`THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO US'  
 INVINCIBLE MIND-SET CAN LEAD ATHLETES INTO TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You're younger, stronger and tougher than the average
person.
</P>
<P>
   You're a star athlete and you're allowed to cut corners.
Parents, coaches and counselors bend the rules for you.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think the rules don't apply to you. After all,
you're invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Then you break an ankle or tear a ligament and don't
rehabilitate properly, leading to further damage. You get caught
with drugs or drinking and driving. You don't wear a seat belt and
are injured in a crash. You're suspended from the team for academic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   It happens often, and it may never change as long as young
athletes continue to grow up in that cocoon of security that can
lead to recklessness and danger.
</P>
<P>
   But is that the whole story? Or are young athletes no different
from typical teenagers who can't fathom that their world could come
crashing down in an instant of bad judgment?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starting strong safety Tommy Bennett, 26, who made the
team as an undrafted rookie three seasons ago out of UCLA, has seen
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that in society in general, just young people in general
thinking they're invincible. From junior high to high school to
college, and even in my professional career, I've seen many, many
young people just live their lives kind of recklessly,'' said
Bennett, who had three teammates, including two who weren't wearing
seat belts, injured last week in a nasty car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying the guys in question that were in the accident
Monday necessarily had that attitude, but I've seen it a lot (in
society) _ driving without seat belts, maybe speeding when they
don't have to, just doing really, really silly things when they
don't have to, and it's just because they think they're
invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Dye, Lester Holmes and Carl Simpson were hurt in the
crash south of Flagstaff. Dye and Simpson weren't wearing seat
belts, and the Department of Public Safety said Holmes would be
ticketed for driving at a speed not reasonable and prudent in the
rainstorm, although he was not above the 75 mph speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   At the high school level, coaches and kids see the invincibility
factor as more of a teenage thing than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through it with my own kids,'' said Washington High
football Coach Steve Chisman. ``One of my big concerns is the
lunchtime situation (when open-campus policies allow students to
leave during lunch, often leading to car accidents).
</P>
<P>
   ``My teenage daughter makes the same comment, `That's somebody
else.' She's an athlete, but everybody thinks they are
invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says high-level athletes may be more prone to
recklessness because they've come to believe they're immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously professional athletes are some of the most
conditioned people on the planet. They think they're never going to
get hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU cornerback Courtney Jackson says athletes have to make a
distinction between invincibility on the field and in their
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an invincibility that most athletes have _ and need _
on the football field,'' he said. ``But what they have to
understand is what happens between these lines isn't necessarily
how things are in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bullet ``can'' hurt you _ I don't care how good a football
player you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Beale, a sports psychology consultant at the Sierra
Center for Peak Performance in Reno, Nev., says elite athletes can
be prone to getting in trouble because of their background.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have in general not been people who have had to live by
the rules while growing up,'' he said. ``They're treated with
favoritism, and nothing is their fault. If you grow up not being
required to live by the rules . . . it can lead to a general
subculture that `the rules don't apply to us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says experience is the best teacher, and he's outgrown
whatever streak of recklessness he may have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear my seat belt. I put on my helmet even when I ride my
bike. I tie my shoes. I've experienced that, honestly, in high
school and college. I got a few speeding tickets, things of that
nature, because I didn't think I was going to get caught,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just from having that young mental attitude. A lot of
young people, we see it every year, somebody gets in trouble for
speeding, maybe DUI, something like that. They all do it because
they think they're not going to get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad decisions often get more attention than the good, said
Joe Corte, Scottsdale Coronado athletic director and football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age, athletes and non-athletes are liable to make some
poor judgments. It's just 17-year-olds making 50 good decisions and
one bad decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Westwood senior volleyball player Brittney Bingham knows
well the impact one bad decision can make, in her case not wearing
a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she was in an accident near Winslow, thrown
through the window of a car and pinned under the wheels for an hour
while waiting for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you experience something, you never think it's going to
happen to you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham sat out a whole season and isn't yet fully recovered
from leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking `Is this really happening?' '' she said.
``You never actually think anything like that is going to happen to
you until it does. Now I wear my seat belt. It was a horrible
experience, and I never want to go through that again. Kids don't
think about what might happen afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Baston, directory of physical therapy at St. Joseph's
Hospital Center for Sports Medicine, says he deals regularly with
the ``invincibility factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You find them maybe taking for granted their injury, thinking
it's not serious,'' he said of some athletes. ``Many think it's not
that important to follow their rehabilitation. It's part of the
immaturity level, thinking `It's not going to happen to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And when it happens, it can be difficult to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-profile athletes have a hard time with these injuries,''
Baston said. ``The guys that know what to expect are more mature
about it, but for the first-timer it can be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Baston has clients as young as 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what parents are doing to their kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what kids do to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of people doing dangerous stuff, stupid stuff just
to say I'm cool or I'm tough or whatever,'' said Westwood
volleyball player Wa'Nami Allen, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're jumping off cliffs, drinking while they're driving,
stupid stuff just for the thrill so they can say, `Look what we did
this weekend.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Devlin, veteran backup center on the Cardinals, says age
plays a bigger role than invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go through college without an injury, maybe that's the
attitude, but how many guys can say that? If the injury occurs,
it's kind of a humbling thing. Then you know that you're not
invincible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what I think. I think it has more to do with being
young than being an athlete. When you're young, you can go all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin, in his seventh training camp, said rookie Yusuf Scott, a
University of Arizona product, had asked him about the age issue
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, you know, I used to feel like I could go 50
years. Then as you get a little bit older, you find it takes longer
to recuperate. Wear and tear.' He was saying, `Well, I feel pretty
good,' and I said, `Well, so did I back then.' All young men think
they're something, I guess,'' Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Clement of the Cardinals knows what it's like to see
your invincibility come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   After starting 33 games in college and never being hurt, he
suffered a season-ending injury his first month in Cardinals camp
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst thing you can imagine,'' he said. ``I'd never
experienced it before. I didn't know how to deal with it. I never
spent any time in the training room in college. Never missed a
play. You start to think it can never happen to you, and then it
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I never thought about and something, really,
that I wasn't prepared to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Rodriguez, a senior starting right tackle at Tempe Marcos
de Niza high school, has faced the same struggle, though not as
severe.
</P>
<P>
   He was injured three weeks ago in a chain-reaction accident and
is undergoing back therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't consider myself invincible,'' he said.
``When you hear that (Dye) almost lost his arm, that's pretty
severe. My accident could've been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to go through, right before my senior year that
I'm supposed to start. It can happen to anybody, not just the
average person.''
</P>
<P>
   Beale, the sports psychology consultant, says coaches at all
levels have to pay more attention to the psychological and
sociological welfare of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches really control that,'' he said. ``They can either be
advocates for or barriers to involvement in psychology. It's an ego
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the ASU cornerback, perhaps best summed up the impact
of the Cardinals players' crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about what happened to those players is that
people got hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is that you're going to see a lot more people
put their seat belts on because of that. It's sad how things
work.'' &QL;

A NOT-SO COLORFUL RAPE
 HOAX 
</HEADLINE>
 COL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Sometime after she'd bashed herself on the head, dug ugly scratches
into her neck and upper thighs, and used a pair of scissors to
slice apart her shirt and bra, Kari Rae Bodenski had to invent a
rapist.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has a storyteller's gift, it turns out, and made her
attacker believ able, frightful and, in ways she hadn't planned,
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of condemning the poor woman, we should praise her
creativ ity and her insight.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled on the floor of the girls restroom at Mendoza Middle
School in Mesa, waiting to be discovered by one of the 500 or so
people on the grounds for ``Meet Your Teacher'' day, the troubled
Bodenski pictured a man with dirty fingernails who smelled of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   He would have carried something sharp and held it to her neck,
she decided. She visualized herself fight ing back, but of course
he was too strong. He'd knock her unconscious, take advantage of
her and leave her there, bruised, scratched, dishevelled.
</P>
<P>
   That was the rough sketch, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She had time to fine-tune the look of her make-believe felon
after the paramedics lifted her onto a stretcher and wheeled her to
an ambulance. The description she later gave the police appeared in
all the local papers and on TV. &QL; 
`TAKING NO CHANCES'
</P>
<P>
   The rapist was said to be about 6 feet tall and 160 pounds. He
had messy brown collar-length hair and was wearing blue jeans and a
black T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yeah, he was White.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments throughout the area were alerted. A manhunt
was launched. School districts, not only in Mesa but all over the
Valley, hurriedly re-evaluated their security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Worried parents telephoned local talk radio programs. Special
meet ings were called at schools. Anxious education officials said
things like, ``We're not taking chances anymore. The world is such
a crazy place that there doesn't seem to be any places left where
students are not in dan ger.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, however, before police detectives began
unraveling Bodenski's twisted fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the incident, Mesa officials called a press
conference to announce that no rape had taken place and that
Bodenski, a 31-year-old mother of two, may only have been trying to
get her husband's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even more public meetings were called during which even more par
ents vented even more anger and frustration, all of it aimed at a
scissor-toting mom with a pitiably overactive imagination. &QL; 
UNDISTURBED GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the one group who seemed completely
undisturbed by the hoax was the only group with a claim to having
been wronged _ White guys.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski said she'd been sexually assaulted by a White man and
everyone _ the police, the public, the media _ was eager to believe
her.
</P>
<P>
   They reacted with anger and outrage, but not surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Not because we have some special prejudice against White men,
but because we hate rapists no matter what the pigmentation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been other cases of false crime
reporting in which an invented assailant was described as Black or
Hispanic or some other minority.
</P>
<P>
   Always, afterward, leaders from these communities hold press
confer ences to say the public's frantic reaction to the ruse only
proves that deep-seated prejudice still exists.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it does _ but not about rape.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Rae Bodenski proved it.
</P>
<P>
   When her story broke, it wasn't the image of a White man or a
Black man people saw in their heads, only an evil man.
</P>
<P>
   It caused a lot of trouble for us and will cause even more for
Bodenski and her family. But in the end, it isn't anger we should
feel toward her, only gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski shuffled the deck of imagi nary assaulters and tossed
out the race card.
</P>
<P>
   She did us a favor. She proved that, sometimes, color really
doesn't mat ter. It's all there in black and (now) white. &QL;

PLUMMER'S LUCK HOLDS IN INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The morning after, he placed his thumbs together.
He compared their size.
</P>
<P>
   One was swollen, stiff, sore.
</P>
<P>
   When the pain pills wore off during the night, his right thumb,
the one a Tennessee defender grabbed and yanked backward _ ``I
heard him go ``Grrrrrrrrr,'''' Jake said, sounding like a masked
wrestling villain applying a torturous hold _ stirred him from
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness his aching thumb spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake,'' it said, telling him nothing he doesn't know, ``you're
one lucky'' ``guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer was born under a lucky star. He is remarkably
resilient. Although he is not sure how, he manages to sidestep the
most precarious and dangerous situations, dodging trouble, escaping
happy and unharmed. Jake Plummer is as irrepressible as Brer
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals $25 million quarterback can't remember sitting out
of a football game because he was hurt. Not in the briar patch of
the NFL. Not at ASU. Not in high school.
</P>
<P>
   `'I can't remember missing a ``practice,'' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake can't grip a football. His thumb is sprained. But he
flashed a smile Saturday morning on the way to the training room.
The same easy smile he gave teammates who won their first preseason
game with their quarterback on the sideline, blowing pink bubbles
with his gum.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same smile he gave Larry Wilson in the upbeat locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know about these things,'' Jake said of his bandaged hand.
It was Jake's way of acknowledging the tough-as-nails former
Cardinals defensive back who sustained and played with worse
injuries than a sprained thumb during his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is _ knock on wood _ the opposite of injury prone. After
games, like the seven-sack pounding he took last year in Seattle,
No. 16 peels off his jersey. Usually his elbows are scabbed, or
oozing fresh blood. Otherwise, he is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer took a fierce blind-side hit in last year's opener
against Dallas. Detroit sacked him on three consecutive third-down
plays, one time after 370-pound guard Jerome Daniels stepped on his
foot. In Jake's rookie season, the Steelers sacked him 10 times. He
must have a guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer brings to mind a sleepwalker in a cartoon, arms
outstretched as he crosses a busy intersection unscratched. Up an
elevator he goes, to the top of a construction site where he steps
sightlessly from one narrow girder to the next, oblivious to the
dizzying height and the danger.
</P>
<P>
   NFL defenders would love to break him in half. In two seasons,
they've sacked him 101 times. So far, thankfully, he has kept on
ticking, durable as a Timex.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer doesn't need to be reminded of the risks of his
occupation. At ASU he moved into the starting job after Grady
Benton was injured. A freshman, playing on a sore ankle, Plummer
threw for 253 yards in the second half against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cardinals rookie, Jake saw Kent Graham go down under a heap
of Giants jerseys. Some fans at Sun Devil Stadium cheered Graham's
injury that day. Graham's misfortune meant that Plummer, hometown
hero, had moved up from third-team to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries happen. The 1999 Cardinals are Exhibit A. In the first
quarter Friday night, Plummer left the field holding his thumb. He
walked toward the tunnel behind a cart carrying defensive tackle
Mike Moten, who had sprained a knee. The cart disappeared beneath a
sign that read ``Godspeed, Ernest Dye.'' Dye is scheduled to
undergo more surgery today on his right arm, which was almost
severed in a recent car accident.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Cardinals' luck is running, a sprained thumb is
almost good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's luck involved,'' Plummer said, referring to his
health. ``It's also a matter of playing hard, not thinking about
getting hurt. Just playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me _ at my size,'' he said, inviting inspection. He
stood there, a slender frame in a T-shirt and shorts and sandals, a
cap pulled down low on his head. He held up his hand. ``I've been
lucky. All I've got is this thumb.'' &QL;

SHORN, BUT NOT REBORN, TILLMAN AS TOUGH AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The body has been remolded from that of an
undersized collegiate linebacker turned bulked-up rookie NFL free
safety, to that of a sleeker, quicker strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Samsonesque hairdo that once flowed to the shoulders, making
him look like a 1960s flower child, has given way to a traditional
cut. A white-sidewalled look.
</P>
<P>
   Ask most anybody and they'll tell you it's a product of Pat
Tillman's maturation, especially as a football player.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell it to Pat Tillman, the Pac-10 Conference's
defensive player of the year two years ago as an Arizona State
senior, who's seeking to someday regain a starting role with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no different than I was a year ago,'' said Tillman, who
often would climb the light towers at Sun Devil Stadium to study
and meditate while at ASU. ``I`m a year older and, I guess, a year
wiser. I don't think I'm a much different person than I have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I did back then I can see myself doing today.''
</P>
<P>
   College teammate Jake Plummer, the Cardinals quarterback,
concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still Pat to me,'' he said. ``He still throws my tight
end down in practice too often. It's just tougher to identify him
nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. What about that new ``do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got sick of it, there's really no reason,'' said Tillman,
who dropped 15 pounds to 192 in the off-season, while reshaping his
frame and improving his footwork through arduous workout sessions,
including martial arts, to better suit his role as backup strong
safety to Tommy Bennett. ``It got old.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinals head Coach Vince Tobin, defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis and secondary coach Larry Marmie each agree that there is
a difference between Tillman today and the rookie who won the
starting free safety job only to lose it at midseason last year to
Kwamie Lassiter. Lassiter ended the season tied for the NFL lead in
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of maturation in him,'' Tobin said. `'I still
see things you'd rather he not do, but he has matured quite a lot.
He's learning the defensive back position and he seems more
comfortable in what he's doing. He changed his body style to the
effect that he looks more like a defensive back now, rather than a
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a lot of things, both mentally and physically, to
improve his game. He's going to be a big part of our defense this
year, whether he starts or not. If he continues to play like he has
been, we've got to design some things to get him into the ball game
where he can make plays. Because that's what he is. He's a play
maker.''
</P>
<P>
   The book on Tillman, who was graduated from ASU ``summa cum
laude'' (3.84 grade average) in 3{ years with a degree in
marketing, has been that of a hitter. Point him toward a brick wall
and he'll run through it and then take on the bus sitting behind
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, too often last year he exercised that trait in practice
drills conducted without pads, pleasing few but Tillman. And, least
of all, Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he's not hitting guys without pads on as much,'' Tobin
said, shaking his head. ``Once in a while you can see the wheels
turning in there that he wants to do it. But he's practicing more
within himself. He still leaves his feet a little bit more in
practice than I'd like to see, where you have a chance to leg-whip
somebody. But he's getting better at that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea that adding a year, losing 15 pounds and a
pound of hair has turned a gladiator into Caspar Milquetoast.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the first preseason game in Denver, when his memory was
knocked from Mile High Stadium into the upper regions of Montana
after he was blindsided covering a punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the sidelines and I asked him if he was OK,''
McGinnis said. ``He said, `My (stuff) is kinda scrambled, coach.' I
asked him if he could go back in and he said, `Don't know, my
(stuff) is kinda scrambled.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the halftime locker room, Tillman was asked if he knew his
current location, or the game score. He failed both tests. But he
also refused to shower and walk the second half sidelines in
civvies, staying in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? Cardinals equipment manager Jim Shearer wisely hid
Tillman's helmet in the locker room to ensure he wouldn't sneak
back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any of it. I have no idea,'' Tillman said.
``If coach said it, I guess I did. I'd like to think I'd have
gotten my butt in there. I must have been scrambled.''
</P>
<P>
   After digesting the story during lunch, Tillman hunted down his
interviewer and said, ``Like I said, I don't remember it. But if I
did it, then I'm a (expletive). I don't take myself out of football
games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really (upset),'' McGinnis said, laughing. ``He came to
talk to me about it, asking if it was true. Pat Tillman is a
helluva football. He's the kind of nut you want to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maturity really wasn't a problem with him. He was mature as a
rookie. The thing he has done is to focus in on what he's doing.
Instead of trying to do everything, he does his job full out and
then gets in the flow of what's going on. When he first came he
tried to do everything at once and couldn't do anything, and every
once in awhile would make the lucky hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Which partly explains why he's making the conversion to strong
safety and finds himself in a backup role behind Bennett, for whom
he harbors deep respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like strong safety a lot,'' Tillman said. `'I feel like I'm
more a part of the defense. I'm closer to the line of scrimmage and
I'm moving around a little more, as opposed to just getting back
into the deep third or something. I still have a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm progressing as well as I can. We've got two real good
safeties right now in Tommy and Kwamie. I just have to keep working
and maybe I'll get in there to play. Maybe I won't, but I have to
keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   While he will see considerable playing time _ even if schemes
must be developed to get him on the field as Tobin and McGinnis
suggest _ holding an NFL starting job remains Tillman's special
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's my goal,'' he said. ``It should be for anybody
who is out here. If it happens or not, who knows? I'm going to work
for it, but, like I said, Tommy has been playing very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy when you lose your job. I knew I had things I
had to improve. I tried to come back out and tried to do the best I
could on special teams, and Kwamie played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, for one, thinks the disappointment of losing his
starting job has aided his development as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``His starting early helped because he was thrust right into it
and had to learn quickly,'' Plummer said. ``Getting benched in
turn, he had to sit there and watch even more. Watching really
helps a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have given anything to not watch and be out there
playing, but he looks a lot better now. He's quicker and faster and
he's reading plays better.'' &QL;

A NOT-SO COLORFUL RAPE
 HOAX 
</HEADLINE>
 COL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Sometime after she'd bashed herself on the head, dug ugly scratches
into her neck and upper thighs, and used a pair of scissors to
slice apart her shirt and bra, Kari Rae Bodenski had to invent a
rapist.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has a storyteller's gift, it turns out, and made her
attacker believ able, frightful and, in ways she hadn't planned,
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of condemning the poor woman, we should praise her
creativ ity and her insight.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled on the floor of the girls restroom at Mendoza Middle
School in Mesa, waiting to be discovered by one of the 500 or so
people on the grounds for ``Meet Your Teacher'' day, the troubled
Bodenski pictured a man with dirty fingernails who smelled of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   He would have carried something sharp and held it to her neck,
she decided. She visualized herself fight ing back, but of course
he was too strong. He'd knock her unconscious, take advantage of
her and leave her there, bruised, scratched, dishevelled.
</P>
<P>
   That was the rough sketch, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She had time to fine-tune the look of her make-believe felon
after the paramedics lifted her onto a stretcher and wheeled her to
an ambulance. The description she later gave the police appeared in
all the local papers and on TV. &QL; 
`TAKING NO CHANCES'
</P>
<P>
   The rapist was said to be about 6 feet tall and 160 pounds. He
had messy brown collar-length hair and was wearing blue jeans and a
black T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yeah, he was White.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments throughout the area were alerted. A manhunt
was launched. School districts, not only in Mesa but all over the
Valley, hurriedly re-evaluated their security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Worried parents telephoned local talk radio programs. Special
meet ings were called at schools. Anxious education officials said
things like, ``We're not taking chances anymore. The world is such
a crazy place that there doesn't seem to be any places left where
students are not in dan ger.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, however, before police detectives began
unraveling Bodenski's twisted fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the incident, Mesa officials called a press
conference to announce that no rape had taken place and that
Bodenski, a 31-year-old mother of two, may only have been trying to
get her husband's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even more public meetings were called during which even more par
ents vented even more anger and frustration, all of it aimed at a
scissor-toting mom with a pitiably overactive imagination. &QL; 
UNDISTURBED GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the one group who seemed completely
undisturbed by the hoax was the only group with a claim to having
been wronged _ White guys.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski said she'd been sexually assaulted by a White man and
everyone _ the police, the public, the media _ was eager to believe
her.
</P>
<P>
   They reacted with anger and outrage, but not surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Not because we have some special prejudice against White men,
but because we hate rapists no matter what the pigmentation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been other cases of false crime
reporting in which an invented assailant was described as Black or
Hispanic or some other minority.
</P>
<P>
   Always, afterward, leaders from these communities hold press
confer ences to say the public's frantic reaction to the ruse only
proves that deep-seated prejudice still exists.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it does _ but not about rape.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Rae Bodenski proved it.
</P>
<P>
   When her story broke, it wasn't the image of a White man or a
Black man people saw in their heads, only an evil man.
</P>
<P>
   It caused a lot of trouble for us and will cause even more for
Bodenski and her family. But in the end, it isn't anger we should
feel toward her, only gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenski shuffled the deck of imagi nary assaulters and tossed
out the race card.
</P>
<P>
   She did us a favor. She proved that, sometimes, color really
doesn't mat ter. It's all there in black and (now) white. &QL;

POLLY ROSENBAUM: `THE FIRST 100 IS THE HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK HENLE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX-Polly Rosenbaum pores over some old photographs in the
Senate chamber of the Old Capitol Building. She served nearly 46
years in the Legislature. &QL; 
choolteacher Edwynne Prendergast, 30, was brimming with her usual
optimism when she arrived in Ari zona in search of adventure and a
good paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly the typical young woman to step off a train in
Tucson that September day in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she was college-educated _ political science and
history at the University of Colo rado. For another, she was
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many before her and after, Edwynne Prendergast, who was
born in Ollie, Iowa, came to this remote, sparsely settled state to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, Prendergast _ soon nicknamed Polly for that
incurable optimist, Pollyanna _ stayed to help write Arizona
history.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, known to Arizona as Polly Rosenbaum, will celebrate
her 100th birthday on Sept. 4. The former legislator never had
children. But for 70 years, she has worried over the state as
though it were her family.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Legislature and out, Rosenbaum has influenced Arizo
na's laws and educational system and fought to preserve its
history.
</P>
<P>
   And long before Arizona won national attention for its ``fab
five'' women in top political positions, Rosenbaum blazed the
lonely trail that they and others have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for women back then if you let it get to you, but
I didn't,'' Rosenbaum says today in her crisp, staccato tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tolerated you. It was especially tough for a woman all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have dreamed of the progress that was made this
century _ in every area.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cooper, director of the Arizona Historical Foundation,
says Rosenbaum epitomizes the brand of tough, tireless optimism
that Ameri cans associate with its Western pioneers _ and thus with
Old Arizona. Plus, Cooper said, she's a walking history of Arizona
that is yet to be written down.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Tucson, the young teacher lodged at the Con
gress Hotel. She had to wait overnight for the Model T Ford that
would take her to the mining town of Hayden, where she had been
recruited to teach typing, shorthand, history and civics.
</P>
<P>
   As was her custom, she immedi ately began soaking up local poli
tics. As a child, Rosenbaum said, she would pull the political
section from the morning newspapers, leav ing the social pages to
her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time to be an optimist: The news in Arizona
newspapers was mostly positive. Though the Great Depression loomed
just weeks ahead, Arizona industry, especially mining, was enjoying
its best year in history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could buy Whippets, Buicks, Fords and Cadillacs, each
with great loads of copper tubes and tanks and wires. Members of
the burgeoning middle class could buy a first-class luxury car for
about $1,000, new. A 3-year-old Buick Roadster could be found in
The Arizona Republican for $485.
</P>
<P>
   High-boy Atwater Kent radios were selling for $188 _ a fortune
for the times. Cars, radios and airplane ads filled newspaper
pages. The state's agriculture, cattle and tourism industries were
also booming as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum took the open-air ride to hot and dusty Hayden; it was
over 110 degrees when she finally stepped out of the coach, her
wool suit soaked in muddy perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But the town charmed her. Hay den, a copper-boom company town of
2,200 near the confluence of the Gila and San Pedro rivers, then
featured a pretty downtown and had access to a riverfront golf
course. It was more livable than today, Rosen baum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dances every Satur day and played golf every
Sunday,'' Rosenbaum recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bridge clubs and meet ings of Eastern Star and the
Rebekahs, and, my, you could take a walk at 2 a.m. if you wanted to
and feel perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Depression hit, the little town kept dancing for
two more years. Rosenbaum taught school and lived in a women's
dormitory-style hotel owned by the mines.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's hard times finally caught up with Hayden.
Scrambling to find a steady paycheck, Rosen baum became a secretary
at Inspi ration Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   From 1929 to 1939, as the Depression deepened and as the towns
of the copper crescent fell on harder and harder times, Rosen baum
was a blur of happy activity in the towns of Hayden and Globe. She
would always be the one to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude means every thing,'' she still says today. ``If
you think you can do something, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, her company lent her as a temporary secretary in
Phoenix for the short session of the Arizona Legislature. She was
paid $5 a day. Legislators were paid $8.
</P>
<P>
   There, she met and married William G. ``Rosie'' Rosenbaum,
majority leader of the Arizona House. When he died in the 10th year
of their marriage, his wife was invited to serve out his term _ so
the state didn't have to pay for an election.
</P>
<P>
   It was not exactly an early victory for feminism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to come down to the Legislature,'' one lawmaker
as sured her. Another told her he didn't want ``any woman'' on his
commit tee.
</P>
<P>
   She would serve in the Legisla ture for almost 46 years, until
she was defeated in 1994 at age 95.
</P>
<P>
   And she became an almost leg endary figure, even to her critics.
The late Republic columnist John Kolbe wrote this about Rosenbaum
after her 1994 defeat: ``Although time had long passed her by, and
she ceased to be much of a power from her back-bench seat in the
minority, on the narrow issues where her interest lay _ such as the
state library _ her wish is still law, so universal is the esteem
and affection in which she is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, she she hasn't always been a profile in courage.
Her lightning-quick scurry out the back door when a controversial
bill comes up for a vote is legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum readily admits that, in part because she was a Demo
crat, she was no flamboyant leader, rarely giving floor speeches or
sponsoring major legislation. In stead, she was a tireless be
hind-the-scenes worker.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career, Rosen baum became friends with a wide
range of Arizonans, from alleged trunk murderess Winnie Ruth Judd
to former Gov. Rose Mofford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Rosie (her husband) and I, we knew all the governors
since Arizona became a state in 1912,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, local historian Marshall Trimble recalls sitting
on a selection committee for the Ari zona Women's Hall of Fame,
which Rosenbaum helped establish. While he and others spoke of what
they read about the illustrious characters from Arizona's past,
Rosenbaum spoke of them as people she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore that if we had brought up the name Martha Washington,
Polly would have reeled off an anecdote about something they did
during the Revolution,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, she was an especially strong advocate for edu
cation and libraries. Because Hay den didn't have a library when
she arrived, she worked to ensure that Arizona's little towns had
their share of libraries. She also spear headed the development of
Arizona's community college system.
</P>
<P>
   All along, she punched holes in the glass ceiling: In 1968, she
and others went through the Arizona Constitution word by word,
elimi nating ``male'' as a requisite for becoming an elected state
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears me out,'' says Mof ford, who calls her a personal
role model and the most remarkable woman she has ever known. Rosen
baum's famous for outwalking most people in both speed and
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many places to go,'' Rosen baum says.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as she gets ready for her second century, Rosenbaum
says she doesn't feel much different than when she was a teenager
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 100 is the hardest,'' she says. ``The second hundred
should be easier because I have crossed all the bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still considers Gila County her home base, for the
past five years her full-time residence has been a two-bedroom
condomin ium in central Phoenix. She con fesses that she doesn't
invite visitors because her home is a bit of a mess. She has been
sorting through 30 large boxes of papers from her legislative days.
She still has 10 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she drives to the state Capitol to give a tour of the
historic House and Senate chambers. She's also a regular at the
state's gem and mineral museum at 15th Avenue and Washington
Street, which she helped establish and which bears her name. Her
love of minerals goes back to her copper town days.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around town is becoming more difficult, she says,
because many of the older buildings that are her landmarks are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with Phoe nix is its lack of memory,'' she
says. ``Newcomers come, and what do they care about what happened
50 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   She cares. In her later years as a legislator, Rosenbaum fought
to preserve a number of historic sites, including the Evans House
on West Washington, across from the old Carnegie Library, which she
also helped preserve. The Evans House was a shambles, though it was
one of only three great Victorian speci mens left in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She, better than anyone, under stands that historic buildings
tie our society to a sense of well-being and give us community
spirit,'' says Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gor don, who worked
with her on the Evans House.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Rosenbaum's political days quite over. Along with former
state Attorney General Grant Woods, she has been asked to be
co-chairwoman of an effort to end gerrymandering of political
districts by creating an independent redis tricting commission. The
proposal is headed for the ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `You bet your life. I'll be glad to give you some
pointers,' '' she says. ``I'll never quit politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is getting used to people asking her about her almost
being 100 _ when they get over their disbelief that she's that old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't there a lot more impor tant things to talk about?'' she
asks. ``Making 100 is just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she feels fortunate to have never had a serious illness or
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had time to be sick,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a long life? ``Being interested in other people
and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her birthday wish for Arizona is that state officials get back
into the habit of thinking carefully about the important issues.
She also worries that children aren't taught to think; all their
time is filled with activity and entertainment, she fears.
</P>
<P>
   And she wishes a wish for mutual respect in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband taught me that you must respect the other person's
viewpoint, even if it is different than yours,'' Rosenbaum says.
``That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not much for partisanship. She became a Democrat because
there wasn't a Republican in sight when she first came to the
state. She stayed a Democrat but never con sidered herself a slave
to any party.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, she would con sider being an Independent, which
is really what she considers herself to have been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 100 years, Rosenbaum isn't interested in leaving this
life any sooner than she has to: She doesn't have time to die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of her fondest memories is a beautiful funeral in the
1940s in rural Gila County.
</P>
<P>
   An old World War I veteran had died, and his family wanted a
military funeral for him. They found a good flag to put on his
coffin. They found a 12-year-old boy who could play a trumpet. The
next day, everybody climbed a hill out in the middle of nowhere and
put the old man in the ground, adding rocks atop his grave to keep
the wild animals away. The boy's taps, beau tifully played, echoed
through the hushed landscape.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers like it was yester day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should remember some of these things,'' Rosenbaum says.
``They will never come again. It was a whole different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she shakes off the melan choly and smiles a bright,
century-old smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about something else,'' she says. &QL;

POLLY ROSENBAUM: `THE FIRST 100 IS THE HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK HENLE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX-Polly Rosenbaum pores over some old photographs in the
Senate chamber of the Old Capitol Building. She served nearly 46
years in the Legislature. &QL; 
choolteacher Edwynne Prendergast, 30, was brimming with her usual
optimism when she arrived in Ari zona in search of adventure and a
good paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly the typical young woman to step off a train in
Tucson that September day in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she was college-educated _ political science and
history at the University of Colo rado. For another, she was
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many before her and after, Edwynne Prendergast, who was
born in Ollie, Iowa, came to this remote, sparsely settled state to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, Prendergast _ soon nicknamed Polly for that
incurable optimist, Pollyanna _ stayed to help write Arizona
history.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, known to Arizona as Polly Rosenbaum, will celebrate
her 100th birthday on Sept. 4. The former legislator never had
children. But for 70 years, she has worried over the state as
though it were her family.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Legislature and out, Rosenbaum has influenced Arizo
na's laws and educational system and fought to preserve its
history.
</P>
<P>
   And long before Arizona won national attention for its ``fab
five'' women in top political positions, Rosenbaum blazed the
lonely trail that they and others have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for women back then if you let it get to you, but
I didn't,'' Rosenbaum says today in her crisp, staccato tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tolerated you. It was especially tough for a woman all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have dreamed of the progress that was made this
century _ in every area.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cooper, director of the Arizona Historical Foundation,
says Rosenbaum epitomizes the brand of tough, tireless optimism
that Ameri cans associate with its Western pioneers _ and thus with
Old Arizona. Plus, Cooper said, she's a walking history of Arizona
that is yet to be written down.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Tucson, the young teacher lodged at the Con
gress Hotel. She had to wait overnight for the Model T Ford that
would take her to the mining town of Hayden, where she had been
recruited to teach typing, shorthand, history and civics.
</P>
<P>
   As was her custom, she immedi ately began soaking up local poli
tics. As a child, Rosenbaum said, she would pull the political
section from the morning newspapers, leav ing the social pages to
her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time to be an optimist: The news in Arizona
newspapers was mostly positive. Though the Great Depression loomed
just weeks ahead, Arizona industry, especially mining, was enjoying
its best year in history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could buy Whippets, Buicks, Fords and Cadillacs, each
with great loads of copper tubes and tanks and wires. Members of
the burgeoning middle class could buy a first-class luxury car for
about $1,000, new. A 3-year-old Buick Roadster could be found in
The Arizona Republican for $485.
</P>
<P>
   High-boy Atwater Kent radios were selling for $188 _ a fortune
for the times. Cars, radios and airplane ads filled newspaper
pages. The state's agriculture, cattle and tourism industries were
also booming as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum took the open-air ride to hot and dusty Hayden; it was
over 110 degrees when she finally stepped out of the coach, her
wool suit soaked in muddy perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But the town charmed her. Hay den, a copper-boom company town of
2,200 near the confluence of the Gila and San Pedro rivers, then
featured a pretty downtown and had access to a riverfront golf
course. It was more livable than today, Rosen baum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dances every Satur day and played golf every
Sunday,'' Rosenbaum recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bridge clubs and meet ings of Eastern Star and the
Rebekahs, and, my, you could take a walk at 2 a.m. if you wanted to
and feel perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Depression hit, the little town kept dancing for
two more years. Rosenbaum taught school and lived in a women's
dormitory-style hotel owned by the mines.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's hard times finally caught up with Hayden.
Scrambling to find a steady paycheck, Rosen baum became a secretary
at Inspi ration Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   From 1929 to 1939, as the Depression deepened and as the towns
of the copper crescent fell on harder and harder times, Rosen baum
was a blur of happy activity in the towns of Hayden and Globe. She
would always be the one to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude means every thing,'' she still says today. ``If
you think you can do something, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, her company lent her as a temporary secretary in
Phoenix for the short session of the Arizona Legislature. She was
paid $5 a day. Legislators were paid $8.
</P>
<P>
   There, she met and married William G. ``Rosie'' Rosenbaum,
majority leader of the Arizona House. When he died in the 10th year
of their marriage, his wife was invited to serve out his term _ so
the state didn't have to pay for an election.
</P>
<P>
   It was not exactly an early victory for feminism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to come down to the Legislature,'' one lawmaker
as sured her. Another told her he didn't want ``any woman'' on his
commit tee.
</P>
<P>
   She would serve in the Legisla ture for almost 46 years, until
she was defeated in 1994 at age 95.
</P>
<P>
   And she became an almost leg endary figure, even to her critics.
The late Republic columnist John Kolbe wrote this about Rosenbaum
after her 1994 defeat: ``Although time had long passed her by, and
she ceased to be much of a power from her back-bench seat in the
minority, on the narrow issues where her interest lay _ such as the
state library _ her wish is still law, so universal is the esteem
and affection in which she is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, she she hasn't always been a profile in courage.
Her lightning-quick scurry out the back door when a controversial
bill comes up for a vote is legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum readily admits that, in part because she was a Demo
crat, she was no flamboyant leader, rarely giving floor speeches or
sponsoring major legislation. In stead, she was a tireless be
hind-the-scenes worker.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career, Rosen baum became friends with a wide
range of Arizonans, from alleged trunk murderess Winnie Ruth Judd
to former Gov. Rose Mofford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Rosie (her husband) and I, we knew all the governors
since Arizona became a state in 1912,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, local historian Marshall Trimble recalls sitting
on a selection committee for the Ari zona Women's Hall of Fame,
which Rosenbaum helped establish. While he and others spoke of what
they read about the illustrious characters from Arizona's past,
Rosenbaum spoke of them as people she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore that if we had brought up the name Martha Washington,
Polly would have reeled off an anecdote about something they did
during the Revolution,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, she was an especially strong advocate for edu
cation and libraries. Because Hay den didn't have a library when
she arrived, she worked to ensure that Arizona's little towns had
their share of libraries. She also spear headed the development of
Arizona's community college system.
</P>
<P>
   All along, she punched holes in the glass ceiling: In 1968, she
and others went through the Arizona Constitution word by word,
elimi nating ``male'' as a requisite for becoming an elected state
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears me out,'' says Mof ford, who calls her a personal
role model and the most remarkable woman she has ever known. Rosen
baum's famous for outwalking most people in both speed and
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many places to go,'' Rosen baum says.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as she gets ready for her second century, Rosenbaum
says she doesn't feel much different than when she was a teenager
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 100 is the hardest,'' she says. ``The second hundred
should be easier because I have crossed all the bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still considers Gila County her home base, for the
past five years her full-time residence has been a two-bedroom
condomin ium in central Phoenix. She con fesses that she doesn't
invite visitors because her home is a bit of a mess. She has been
sorting through 30 large boxes of papers from her legislative days.
She still has 10 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she drives to the state Capitol to give a tour of the
historic House and Senate chambers. She's also a regular at the
state's gem and mineral museum at 15th Avenue and Washington
Street, which she helped establish and which bears her name. Her
love of minerals goes back to her copper town days.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around town is becoming more difficult, she says,
because many of the older buildings that are her landmarks are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with Phoe nix is its lack of memory,'' she
says. ``Newcomers come, and what do they care about what happened
50 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   She cares. In her later years as a legislator, Rosenbaum fought
to preserve a number of historic sites, including the Evans House
on West Washington, across from the old Carnegie Library, which she
also helped preserve. The Evans House was a shambles, though it was
one of only three great Victorian speci mens left in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She, better than anyone, under stands that historic buildings
tie our society to a sense of well-being and give us community
spirit,'' says Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gor don, who worked
with her on the Evans House.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Rosenbaum's political days quite over. Along with former
state Attorney General Grant Woods, she has been asked to be
co-chairwoman of an effort to end gerrymandering of political
districts by creating an independent redis tricting commission. The
proposal is headed for the ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `You bet your life. I'll be glad to give you some
pointers,' '' she says. ``I'll never quit politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is getting used to people asking her about her almost
being 100 _ when they get over their disbelief that she's that old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't there a lot more impor tant things to talk about?'' she
asks. ``Making 100 is just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she feels fortunate to have never had a serious illness or
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had time to be sick,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a long life? ``Being interested in other people
and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her birthday wish for Arizona is that state officials get back
into the habit of thinking carefully about the important issues.
She also worries that children aren't taught to think; all their
time is filled with activity and entertainment, she fears.
</P>
<P>
   And she wishes a wish for mutual respect in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband taught me that you must respect the other person's
viewpoint, even if it is different than yours,'' Rosenbaum says.
``That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not much for partisanship. She became a Democrat because
there wasn't a Republican in sight when she first came to the
state. She stayed a Democrat but never con sidered herself a slave
to any party.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, she would con sider being an Independent, which
is really what she considers herself to have been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 100 years, Rosenbaum isn't interested in leaving this
life any sooner than she has to: She doesn't have time to die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of her fondest memories is a beautiful funeral in the
1940s in rural Gila County.
</P>
<P>
   An old World War I veteran had died, and his family wanted a
military funeral for him. They found a good flag to put on his

ANDERSON SETTLING IN TO BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Now that right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre is on his
way to re-establishing himself as a member of the starting
rotation, it's time for left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson to settle into
his bullpen role.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson began the season in the bullpen, then rejoined the
rotation after Stottlemyre went down. Anderson has pitched in 23
games, starting 15, and has one save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically and mentally, I'm more prepared this go-round
than the first time,'' said Anderson, who was 5-1 and allowed only
seven earned runs over his past five starts with a 2.15 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was down there and didn't get in a lot of games and
there was a long period in between when I pitched, I started to
doubt myself. But I don't doubt myself now. I have confidence. I'm
ready whenever I'm needed.'' &QL; 
Rookie debut &QL; 
Rookie outfielder  &UR; Rob Ryan got a souvenir from his major league
debut on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Pittsburgh Pirates batting helmet,supposedly sent over
to the Arizona clubhouse on Saturday and signed by Pirates catcher
 &UR; Joe Oliver, congratulating him on his first major league ``hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, pinch-hitting in the seventh inning, hit Oliver in the
head with his back swing when he fouled off the first pitch, giving
Oliver a concussion. The helmet sent to Ryan had a dent in the side
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was a bit skeptical as to its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of it seems awful small,'' he said. ``It was a nice
gesture, though. A nice thought.''
</P>
<P>
   After being up with the big club for about a week, Ryan was glad
to get his first at-bat (he grounded out to second base) out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``''Now, hopefully I can settle in and concentrate better on
what I'm supposed to be doing.'' &QL; 
Old friend &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Diamondbacks move on to Florida Tuesday night to begin
their next series against the Marlins, their first pitching
opponent will be right-hander  &UR; Vladimir Nunez, who was part of the
July 9 trade with Arizona that also sent right-hander  &UR; Brad Penny
to the Marlins in exchange for right-handed closer  &UR; Matt  &UR; Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip by the Marlins to the West Coast, Nunez
stopped in Phoenix to tend to some personal matters, including the
sale of his house. Nunez also stopped by to visit Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter after Wednesday night's final game of a homestand.
</P>
<P>
   `Sac' attack &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed middle reliever  &UR; Dan Plesac had an ice pack to cut
the swelling in his right eye after receiving a shiner during
batting practice. He went to field a low line drive that bounced
off the artificial turf and off his glove and struck him above the
eye. The injury is not expected to affect his pitching status. &QL;

GIANTS INSIST RACE NOT OVER IN NL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants believe they are capable of pulling off
a miracle and overtaking the Diamondbacks for the National League
West crown. Most of that belief comes from their leader, Manager
 &UR; Dusty
 &UR; Baker, the optimist's optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe in miracles,'' Baker said. ``I still dream,
like when I was a kid. I hope I remain that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have a 7{-game lead over the Giants, the
Diamondbacks remained respectful of their closest competitor in the
NL West. Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter fully believes the Giants have at
least two runs to make at his club.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, after all, have a recent history of overcoming
nearly impossible odds. Last year, they trailed the Chicago Cubs by
five games with 10 remaining and managed to force a one-game
playoff for the wild card by winning eight of their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, the Giants suffered a four-game losing streak
that left them trailing Los Angeles by two games with 11 to play.
They won eight of their next 10, including a key two-game series
against the Dodgers, and wound up NL West champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the Giants are out of it or soon out of it, we believe
it's unfair and unjust because this team has capabilities to do
something,'' All-Star second baseman  &UR; Jeff Kent said. ``I'm not
saying we're going to do it, but this is a team that's been there
and done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a non-panic situation. Right now, our confidence is
low. We've been beaten up. We've played better games and we know we
can play better. It helps when you have experience in that regard.
You still have hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker added: ``The more recent the miracle is, the more you
think it could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants still have 40 games remaining, starting with today's
game in Milwaukee, which will be followed a four-game visit to
Chicago. With six weeks of the season remaining, the Giants
collectively believe they have the club to pull out yet another
miraculous finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what we need is a miracle,'' Pitcher  &UR; Russ Ortiz
said. ``What happened to us last year, maybe that was a miracle _ I
mean, in baseball terms. But we're nowhere near that point yet. We
won't need something like that. Then again, you never know. God
works in mysterious ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk for anyone else, but I think it's a real good
possibility. If we get hot and Arizona gets cold, great things can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the NL West standings and the wild card standings
shows the Giants' best chance of reaching the postseason is by
winning the division. After all, they would only have to catch one
club, the Diamondbacks. For the wild card, San Francisco would have
to leapfrog four clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how at this stage we can qualify for the
wild-card,'' said  &UR; Peter Magowan, managing general partner. ``We've
got to figure out how to beat Arizona. We play them (Sept. 24-26 at
3Com Park), and we've got to get to a position where those games
mean something.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Dale Sveum recently became the second Pittsburgh Pirates player in
the 112-year history of that franchise to hit home runs from both
sides of the plate in the same game, joining  &UR; Bobby Bonilla. Who
holds the major league records for accomplishing the feat most in a
season and career? &QL; 
If you had wings &QL; 
 &UR; Carlos Baerga was so eager to get back to Cleveland that he left
San Diego before he was told his trade back to the Indians was
completed. Baerga was informed late Sunday night that a trade was
possible. There was a 6:30 a.m. flight out of San Diego on Sunday
and he was on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called to tell Carlos that the deal was finalized (just
before noon), and he was already en route,'' Padres General Manager
 &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga was so excited to return to the club where he enjoyed his
greatest success that he easily agreed to waive the clause in his
contract that called for his 1999 salary to be hiked from $500,000
to $1.5 million in the event of a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carlos would have run across the country to get
here,'' Cleveland General Manager  &UR; John Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga said: ``This is my house. I'm in the place where I always
wanted to be all my life. This changes everything. I'm happy
again.'' &QL; 
More on Mondesi &QL; 
Dodgers right fielder  &UR; Raul Mondesi, who inexplicably and without
provocation railed into club officials last week, had a meeting
with GM  &UR; Kevin Malone and several other Dodgers officials last
week. Mondesi's agent,  &UR; Jeff Moorad, also sat in as the sides all
try to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi declined to comment on the meeting, while Moorad said it
was a ``productive session.'' Malone, who is getting blasted on
local radio in Los Angeles, insists the club will keep this matter,
and any disciplinary measures, within the club.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, however, are speaking loudly, enthusiastically booing
Mondesi every time he steps up to the plate. &QL; 
D-Backs alumni report &QL; 
It's not going so well for former Diamondbacks right fielder
 &UR; Karim &UR; Garcia in Detroit. Garcia was on first base during a game
against Tampa Bay on Monday with no outs and another runner on
third in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit trailed, 8-0, at the time and shortstop  &UR; Deivi Cruz
slapped a single to right-center. Garcia decided to make it to
third base and was thrown out, breaking one of the game's cardinal
rules of not making the first or last out of an inning at third
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get thrown out in a situation like that?'' Tigers
Manager  &UR; Larry Parrish asked. ``There's a time to be aggressive,
but that's not it _ not when you're down, 8-0. You've got to learn
how to think when you're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news, former catcher  &UR; Jorge Fabregas is batting .086 (3
for 35) when batting after the sixth inning in games either tied or
within one run. It's the worst such mark in the majors. &QL; 
The Toy Dept. &QL; 
Chicago Cubs reliever  &UR; Rod Beck, one of our favorites at
``Baseball'' ``Insider,'' had a unique way of looking at the Cubs'
collapse:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed at where we are at. It's sad to see we folded
at a time we had everything going for us. It's no one's fault but
the guys in here. I think everybody, including myself, played a
part. . . . We're stuck in the middle of trying to save some
respect for ourselves, but we now live in the land of misfit
toys.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Baltimore hitting coach  &UR; Eddie Murray holds the record for a
career, having hit home runs from both the right and left side of
the plate 11 times. Houston third baseman  &UR; Ken Caminiti holds the
single-season record with four, a feat he accomplished during his
MVP season in 1996. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Let's make it official and just get the guys red capes: After
it's all said and done, maybe  &UR; Mark McGwire and  &UR; Sammy Sosa truly
are the closest thing to  &UR; Superman in this game. Amazingly, they
are both on a better home run pace than last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The push to raid the border begins in earnest: Something
calling itself the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority recently
mailed out flashy books to expound the virtues of the
Washington/northern Virginia metro area. These folks are serious
about wanting to take away the Expos from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Lee Lacy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What, like it could have
 &UR; possibly been Charlie Hayes?: The San Francisco Giants announced
their all-1990s team last week and, no surprise here,  &UR; Matt
Williams was elected at third base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wonder how much a Johnny Damon jock strap could have
 &UR; fetched?: The Kansas City Royals charities recently auctioned off
the futuristic jerseys worn by Royals players. Rookie  &UR; Carlos
Febles' went for $975 while  &UR; Chad Kreuter's (yes, Chad Kreuter)
brought in $325. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas outfielder  &UR; Juan Gonzalez's lingering hamstring problems
have placed  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro in a tough spot. Because of the
hamstring injury, Gonzalez has required more time as the designated
hitter. In the meantime, Palmeiro, who twice had surgery on his
right knee during spring training, has been forced to move to first
base.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis pitcher  &UR; Kent Bottenfield, enjoying the finest season
of his life, entered the weekend series with a 16-5 record.
Amazingly, he entered the season with an 18-27 career record.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati relievers  &UR; Scott Sullivan (85 innings before the
weekend series),  &UR; Danny Graves (84) and  &UR; Scott Williamson (77) all
have a legitimate shot at pitching at least 100 innings. The last
time three relievers from the same club did that was the 1992
Astros, who had  &UR; Doug Jones,  &UR; Joe Boever and  &UR; Xavier Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the last year the pitcher's mound was 15 inches high,
only one player ( &UR; Frank Howard, 44) hit 40 home runs and only three
(Howard,  &UR; Ken Harrelson and  &UR; Willie McCovey) had 100 RBIs. Last
year, the 30th since the mound was lowered to 10 inches, 11 players
hit 40 home runs and 41 had 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's  &UR; Steve Karsay, who has overcome tremendous arm
injuries, won his 10th consecutive game Thursday night, becoming
the first Indians pitcher to do so since
 &UR; Fritz Peterson, he of wife-swapping fame, did so in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It became official last week that the New York Mets and Chicago
Cubs will open the 2000 season with a pair of games in Japan on
March 29 and 30. They will play a pair of exhibition games the two
days prior. For their troubles, players and coaches each will
receive $25,000 and $8,000 in expense money.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of Colorado GM  &UR; Bob Gebhard's departure before
he resigned Friday. Owner  &UR; Jerry McMorris' statement after the
``Denver Post'' reported Gebhard's ouster is imminent last week:
``It's all pure speculation and it's premature.'' Premature,
according to ``Webster's Dictionar''y: ``Before happening. Before
the proper or usual time.'' &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect Milwaukee to hire one or two minorities for their vacant
general manager and manager openings. With dad  &UR; Bud Selig in the
commissioner's chair and a strong desire to move minorities into
decisionmaking positions, daughter and Brewers CEO  &UR; Wendy
Selig-Preib must follow dad's mandates. Otherwise, Bud could lose
all credibility.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Billy Taylor now pitching for the Mets, Oakland relied on
 &UR; Doug Jones to take over as closer after the July 31 trading
deadline. But Jones has faltered and there is growing talk that
onetime Mets phenom  &UR; Jason Isringhausen could take over the role,
if not now, then certainly in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta traded for shortstop  &UR; Jose Hernandez, GM
 &UR; John Schuerholz said the former Cub would provide insurance against
 &UR; Walt Weiss' leg injuries. In his first 16 games with the Braves,
Hernandez has started 13 times. Weiss has lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was initially counting on injured left fielder  &UR; Moises
Alou to make a dramatic return to the lineup right around Sept. 1.
That's looking impossible now. Alou has no other target date to
return but insists he will be ready for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati acquired pitcher  &UR; Juan Guzman from Baltimore strictly
for the stretch run. After his first three starts, Guzman, who was
2-1 with a 2.05 ERA before Saturday's start, says he wants to
remain with the Reds. GM  &UR; Jim Bowden may try to work out something.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful world of Walt Disney hasn't been so kind to its
stockholders recently. In fact, there is growing talk that
 &UR; Mickey Mouse and his pals may sell off part or all of their stake
in the Angels and/or the NHL's Mighty Ducks. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. NY YankeesSuddenly, looking over their shoulders for Big Apple
supremacy.  &QL; 
2. NY MetsIt's time to face the truth: These Mets can hang with
anyone.  &QL;

surely are now.  &QL;

entering the weekend.  &QL; 
5. ClevelandGetting mauled by Texas' potent offense can only lead
to insecurities.  &QL; 
6. CincinnatiThat jumping around Reds do is called the Bounce, the
rage in Cincy.  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Seattle Mariners: Fresh off a three-game sweep in Toronto,
their record reached the .500 mark. More important, Mariners
players are starting to talk (and act) as if they still have a
chance to jump into the wild card race. ``I see the confidence
coming in everyone, and I think the new stadium (Safeco Field) has
had a lot to do with that,''  &UR; Jay Buhner said. The Mariners are no
longer concentrating on home runs and doing little things to
produce runs. In turn, they have become a better balanced club,
especially in the bullpen, where relievers finally are gaining
confidence. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: One week earlier, the praises of the Blue
Jays were being heralded from coast to coast. Entering their
weekend series in Oakland, Toronto had lost seven in a row and was
beginning to fade in the AL wild card race. The starting pitching
has not been able to keep its share of the burden. Losing all six
games of last week's homestand tied the worst in franchise history
as they were outscored, 51-24. Manager  &UR; Jim Fregosi, not wanting to
wait until it's too late, yanked the struggling  &UR; Kelvim Escobar
from the rotation. The recent loss of ace  &UR; David Wells due to a
back injury has only compounded the weakness. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took a terrible hit when the versatile  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Phillips suffered a broken leg during a game last weekend, an
injury that will keep him out for the remainder of the season. From
his hospital bed in Toronto, Phillips had this to say about the
surprising and surging Athletics: ``They're young, but they can
play. When I came here, they were eating baby food. Now, they've
moved on to meat and potatoes.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now, most have heard of Boston first baseman  &UR; Brian
 &UR; Daubach, signed by the Red Sox over the winter as a six-year minor
league free agent out of the Florida Marlins system. Daubach has
taken New England by storm, becoming a phenom overnight. He has
filled in to the point where hardly any Red Sox fan even mentions
 &UR; Mo Vaughn's name anymore. Daubach had a five-game stretch in which
he drove in a head-shaking 15 runs. His legend grows by the day. &QL;

POLLY ROSENBAUM: `THE FIRST 100 IS THE HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX-Polly Rosenbaum pores over some old photographs in the
Senate chamber of the Old Capitol Building. She served nearly 46
years in the Legislature. &QL; 
choolteacher Edwynne Prendergast, 30, was brimming with her usual
optimism when she arrived in Ari zona in search of adventure and a
good paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly the typical young woman to step off a train in
Tucson that September day in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she was college-educated _ political science and
history at the University of Colo rado. For another, she was
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many before her and after, Edwynne Prendergast, who was
born in Ollie, Iowa, came to this remote, sparsely settled state to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, Prendergast _ soon nicknamed Polly for that
incurable optimist, Pollyanna _ stayed to help write Arizona
history.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, known to Arizona as Polly Rosenbaum, will celebrate
her 100th birthday on Sept. 4. The former legislator never had
children. But for 70 years, she has worried over the state as
though it were her family.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Legislature and out, Rosenbaum has influenced Arizo
na's laws and educational system and fought to preserve its
history.
</P>
<P>
   And long before Arizona won national attention for its ``fab
five'' women in top political positions, Rosenbaum blazed the
lonely trail that they and others have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for women back then if you let it get to you, but
I didn't,'' Rosenbaum says today in her crisp, staccato tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tolerated you. It was especially tough for a woman all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have dreamed of the progress that was made this
century _ in every area.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cooper, director of the Arizona Historical Foundation,
says Rosenbaum epitomizes the brand of tough, tireless optimism
that Ameri cans associate with its Western pioneers _ and thus with
Old Arizona. Plus, Cooper said, she's a walking history of Arizona
that is yet to be written down.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Tucson, the young teacher lodged at the Con
gress Hotel. She had to wait overnight for the Model T Ford that
would take her to the mining town of Hayden, where she had been
recruited to teach typing, shorthand, history and civics.
</P>
<P>
   As was her custom, she immedi ately began soaking up local poli
tics. As a child, Rosenbaum said, she would pull the political
section from the morning newspapers, leav ing the social pages to
her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time to be an optimist: The news in Arizona
newspapers was mostly positive. Though the Great Depression loomed
just weeks ahead, Arizona industry, especially mining, was enjoying
its best year in history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could buy Whippets, Buicks, Fords and Cadillacs, each
with great loads of copper tubes and tanks and wires. Members of
the burgeoning middle class could buy a first-class luxury car for
about $1,000, new. A 3-year-old Buick Roadster could be found in
The Arizona Republican for $485.
</P>
<P>
   High-boy Atwater Kent radios were selling for $188 _ a fortune
for the times. Cars, radios and airplane ads filled newspaper
pages. The state's agriculture, cattle and tourism industries were
also booming as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum took the open-air ride to hot and dusty Hayden; it was
over 110 degrees when she finally stepped out of the coach, her
wool suit soaked in muddy perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But the town charmed her. Hay den, a copper-boom company town of
2,200 near the confluence of the Gila and San Pedro rivers, then
featured a pretty downtown and had access to a riverfront golf
course. It was more livable than today, Rosen baum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dances every Satur day and played golf every
Sunday,'' Rosenbaum recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bridge clubs and meet ings of Eastern Star and the
Rebekahs, and, my, you could take a walk at 2 a.m. if you wanted to
and feel perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Depression hit, the little town kept dancing for
two more years. Rosenbaum taught school and lived in a women's
dormitory-style hotel owned by the mines.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's hard times finally caught up with Hayden.
Scrambling to find a steady paycheck, Rosen baum became a secretary
at Inspi ration Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   From 1929 to 1939, as the Depression deepened and as the towns
of the copper crescent fell on harder and harder times, Rosen baum
was a blur of happy activity in the towns of Hayden and Globe. She
would always be the one to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude means every thing,'' she still says today. ``If
you think you can do something, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, her company lent her as a temporary secretary in
Phoenix for the short session of the Arizona Legislature. She was
paid $5 a day. Legislators were paid $8.
</P>
<P>
   There, she met and married William G. ``Rosie'' Rosenbaum,
majority leader of the Arizona House. When he died in the 10th year
of their marriage, his wife was invited to serve out his term _ so
the state didn't have to pay for an election.
</P>
<P>
   It was not exactly an early victory for feminism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to come down to the Legislature,'' one lawmaker
as sured her. Another told her he didn't want ``any woman'' on his
commit tee.
</P>
<P>
   She would serve in the Legisla ture for almost 46 years, until
she was defeated in 1994 at age 95.
</P>
<P>
   And she became an almost leg endary figure, even to her critics.
The late Republic columnist John Kolbe wrote this about Rosenbaum
after her 1994 defeat: ``Although time had long passed her by, and
she ceased to be much of a power from her back-bench seat in the
minority, on the narrow issues where her interest lay _ such as the
state library _ her wish is still law, so universal is the esteem
and affection in which she is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, she she hasn't always been a profile in courage.
Her lightning-quick scurry out the back door when a controversial
bill comes up for a vote is legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum readily admits that, in part because she was a Demo
crat, she was no flamboyant leader, rarely giving floor speeches or
sponsoring major legislation. In stead, she was a tireless be
hind-the-scenes worker.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career, Rosen baum became friends with a wide
range of Arizonans, from alleged trunk murderess Winnie Ruth Judd
to former Gov. Rose Mofford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Rosie (her husband) and I, we knew all the governors
since Arizona became a state in 1912,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, local historian Marshall Trimble recalls sitting
on a selection committee for the Ari zona Women's Hall of Fame,
which Rosenbaum helped establish. While he and others spoke of what
they read about the illustrious characters from Arizona's past,
Rosenbaum spoke of them as people she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore that if we had brought up the name Martha Washington,
Polly would have reeled off an anecdote about something they did
during the Revolution,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, she was an especially strong advocate for edu
cation and libraries. Because Hay den didn't have a library when
she arrived, she worked to ensure that Arizona's little towns had
their share of libraries. She also spear headed the development of
Arizona's community college system.
</P>
<P>
   All along, she punched holes in the glass ceiling: In 1968, she
and others went through the Arizona Constitution word by word,
elimi nating ``male'' as a requisite for becoming an elected state
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears me out,'' says Mof ford, who calls her a personal
role model and the most remarkable woman she has ever known. Rosen
baum's famous for outwalking most people in both speed and
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many places to go,'' Rosen baum says.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as she gets ready for her second century, Rosenbaum
says she doesn't feel much different than when she was a teenager
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 100 is the hardest,'' she says. ``The second hundred
should be easier because I have crossed all the bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still considers Gila County her home base, for the
past five years her full-time residence has been a two-bedroom
condomin ium in central Phoenix. She con fesses that she doesn't
invite visitors because her home is a bit of a mess. She has been
sorting through 30 large boxes of papers from her legislative days.
She still has 10 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she drives to the state Capitol to give a tour of the
historic House and Senate chambers. She's also a regular at the
state's gem and mineral museum at 15th Avenue and Washington
Street, which she helped establish and which bears her name. Her
love of minerals goes back to her copper town days.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around town is becoming more difficult, she says,
because many of the older buildings that are her landmarks are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with Phoe nix is its lack of memory,'' she
says. ``Newcomers come, and what do they care about what happened
50 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   She cares. In her later years as a legislator, Rosenbaum fought
to preserve a number of historic sites, including the Evans House
on West Washington, across from the old Carnegie Library, which she
also helped preserve. The Evans House was a shambles, though it was
one of only three great Victorian speci mens left in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She, better than anyone, under stands that historic buildings
tie our society to a sense of well-being and give us community
spirit,'' says Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gor don, who worked
with her on the Evans House.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Rosenbaum's political days quite over. Along with former
state Attorney General Grant Woods, she has been asked to be
co-chairwoman of an effort to end gerrymandering of political
districts by creating an independent redis tricting commission. The
proposal is headed for the ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `You bet your life. I'll be glad to give you some
pointers,' '' she says. ``I'll never quit politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is getting used to people asking her about her almost
being 100 _ when they get over their disbelief that she's that old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't there a lot more impor tant things to talk about?'' she
asks. ``Making 100 is just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she feels fortunate to have never had a serious illness or
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had time to be sick,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a long life? ``Being interested in other people
and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her birthday wish for Arizona is that state officials get back
into the habit of thinking carefully about the important issues.
She also worries that children aren't taught to think; all their
time is filled with activity and entertainment, she fears.
</P>
<P>
   And she wishes a wish for mutual respect in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband taught me that you must respect the other person's
viewpoint, even if it is different than yours,'' Rosenbaum says.
``That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not much for partisanship. She became a Democrat because
there wasn't a Republican in sight when she first came to the
state. She stayed a Democrat but never con sidered herself a slave
to any party.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, she would con sider being an Independent, which
is really what she considers herself to have been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 100 years, Rosenbaum isn't interested in leaving this
life any sooner than she has to: She doesn't have time to die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of her fondest memories is a beautiful funeral in the
1940s in rural Gila County.
</P>
<P>
   An old World War I veteran had died, and his family wanted a
military funeral for him. They found a good flag to put on his
coffin. They found a 12-year-old boy who could play a trumpet. The
next day, everybody climbed a hill out in the middle of nowhere and
put the old man in the ground, adding rocks atop his grave to keep
the wild animals away. The boy's taps, beau tifully played, echoed
through the hushed landscape.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers like it was yester day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should remember some of these things,'' Rosenbaum says.
``They will never come again. It was a whole different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she shakes off the melan choly and smiles a bright,
century-old smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about something else,'' she says. &QL;

MERCURY LEADERS FIGHT 2 FOES  
 COMPETITION, AGE ARE WORTHY ADVERSARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Once in Italy, Michele Timms played for a team that
lost all 18 of its games. Only that season was a bigger
disappointment to her than this one with the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   But going 0-for-Firenze at age 28 is different than 15-17 at age
34 in the vastly superior Western Conference of what undeniably is
the best women's professional basketball league ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to rationalize because of the competition. Yet
tougher to accept because of the physiological clock.
</P>
<P>
   The ticking was loud enough for Timms and Jennifer Gillom, 35,
after the Mercury's 1998 WNBA Finals shortfall that both committed
to major off-season conditioning. It was work that in the short
term proved futile, but still might pay off before the
rest-of-their-life phase begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dedication they made to staying in such good shape, almost
reinventing themselves, has added at least one to two years of
high-level play'' for both, said Seth Sulka, Mercury vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jen Gillom could play for three to five years, not at
this level, but I think she can play at this level next year. She's
just so smooth, and I don't see a point her game is going to suffer
from age.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Timms at point guard and Gillom at power
forward have a place in Phoenix for 2000 and are virtually certain
to be among whatever number of players are allowed to be shielded
from the third expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   That draft is part of the reason Sulka believes the Mercury
needs tweaking, not an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking four new teams (Seattle, Portland, Indianapolis, Miami)
instead of two during an Olympic year will be disruptive enough for
the 12 existing teams, none more than three years old.
</P>
<P>
   Will teams be allowed to protect four, five or, as in the past,
six of its 11 players? And after losing a player, can a team pull
back one or two others from the unprotected list if it is at risk
of losing more than one for the first time?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different ways the league can go,'' Sulka
said. ``They really need to consider the fact the existing teams
need to try to maintain some continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as big a factor and as important as making the four new
teams competitive. It needs to be looked at just as much.
Competitiveness is what's going to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom is convinced that because of how the Mercury finished,
going 12-7 after a 3-10 start, less is more when it comes to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't need a lot of changes. We found that
out,'' she said. ``We need to try to keep this team together as
much as possible because we've gone through enough this year to
realize a lot of the mistakes we've made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson, that with the new faces coming in,
they didn't experience the excitement of the playoffs, so they
didn't know what it was like. But now they've gone through it and
seen how we've suffered from it. By keeping this team together,
we'll have a much better start.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the expansion and regular draft rules _ will existing
teams with sub-.500 records still pick ahead of the new teams? _
the Mercury's best-case scenario is to return seven of its top nine
players, including soon-to-be mother Michelle Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   If the 2000 season tips off with three of the four main posts
(Gillom, Griffiths, Maria Stepanova, Marlies Askamp) and four of
five from the perimeter (Timms, Lisa Harrison, Kristi Harrower,
Edna Campbell, Bridget Pettis) still here, consider the off-season
a rousing success.
</P>
<P>
   But Sulka's best guess is that one of his four Olympic-bound
players will not return. The prime candidates are Australians
Griffiths and Harrower, although both say their preference is to be
back.
</P>
<P>
   Timms, the Australian national team captain, must make the most,
financially, of the end of her career and will play in the WNBA
before the Sydney Olympics, which begin Sept. 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a very individual thing with the players and the
coach (Carrie Graf, a Mercury and Australian national team
assistant) whether they come back or not,'' Timms said. ``There are
a lot of tough decisions to be made, and everyone's situation is
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sit at home and not get paid, but these other kids
who have got 10 years left to play in this league, they should
possibly stay at home. They've got to look out for themselves
financially, too, so it'll be an interesting decision for everyone
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova, the 6-foot-8 center who fell nine rebounds shy of
finishing the season with nine consecutive double-doubles, likely
has earned a promotion off the Russian national team bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old seems determined not only to return for a
third Mercury season but for the majority of training camp,
something Sulka said he desperately wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her preference to come back and play here,'' Stepanova
said through her interpreter. ``They can't order me to go
somewhere. If everything works out fine, I feel I will play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova said she and her agent have discussed the need to be
in training camp, which she missed in 1998 because of the World
Championships and this year due to the European Championships, to
``get in shape really fast and get ready to play the season
straightaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Germany did not qualify for the Olympics, Askamp does
not have a conflict, although she must re-sign with the league.
</P>
<P>
   Harrower and former American Basketball League players Harrison
and Campbell, who signed for only one year to be eligible for the
veteran pay scale in 2000, also must be re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Mercury reached agreement with Coach Cheryl
Miller on a three-year contract extension. The 35-year-old has a
53-44 pro coaching record in three years, including playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not receive a technical foul in the final 17 games of
the season after being assessed nine, with three ejections, in the
first 15.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight original WNBA coaches, only Houston's Van
Chancellor, the two-time Coach of the Year, and Miller remain.
Cleveland's Linda Hill-MacDonald was fired on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury's early-season chemistry problems and inability to
win on the road (3-13), where it played 10 of its first 14 games,
are well documented.
</P>
<P>
   The team shooting was 39.9 percent, second-worst in the league,
falling to 37.7 percent excluding Stepanova and Askamp, 11th and
12th in league field goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrison shot better than her ABL career average (47.6
percent to 44.3) and Campbell, in what she admits was a subpar
season, finished ninth in 3-point shooting (37.6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wishes they could pull out a better player at some
position,'' Sulka said. ``But the way we played down the stretch, I
think we were solid. We could get another shooter, but I certainly
don't say we have any voids to fill that are unfillable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although attendance dropped 11.2 percent, the average of 12,219
still was third-best in the league. &QL;

HOT WEATHER HALTS CATFISH STOCKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Catfish stockings in Phoenix's urban lakes ceased on
July 15. It will begin again on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swanson, head of the Arizona Game and Fish Department's
urban program, said the department has learned that the low
survival rate of stocked fish during the hottest monsoon months is
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water conditions are pressing the threshold for stocking,'' he
said. ``It just isn't feasible to keep stocking catfish during
those times.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's urban program, allowing adults and children to fish
near home in city lakes, keeps growing and it considered a
universal success. The latest survey on anglers at the lake is
1996, when 168,100 anglers days were spent at the five Valley urban
lakes during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Poor periods are expected a certain times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the problem of the pH factor. This measures the
contrast between the alkaline and acid contents of the water. In
this state, the alkaline reading is of the most concern. A perfect
pH reading is 5. But as the pH factor rises (alkaline), fish become
more stressed. At 10, they die. Swanson said the pH levels
sometimes rise to 9 to 9.5 in urban lakes. Then, stocking is a
useless proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Water temperature is another consideration. These are small,
shallow lakes. There's no cool, deep water to seek in summer
months. Fish become sluggish and quit feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The warm water and intense sunlight lead to an explosion of
growth by water plants. The water is robbed of oxygen. That's the
cause of many fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   The third most highly used urban lake in the Valley is Cortez
Park Lake north of 35th Avenue and Dunlap Road, with 23,900 angler
days a year. Alvord Lake in south Phoenix is the most used, with
23,900 angler days.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvord dwarfs Cortez in size. There are many more acres to
fish. Considering the acreages of the two lakes, Cortez dwarfs
Alford in the number of angler hours per acre _ 21,500 to 9,800.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cortez is a sick lake now and is getting help
from Game and Fish and the city of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``These artificial lakes are like a giant fish bowls,'' Swanson
said. ``Every so often, they need cleaning like a fish bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   That also means adding more water since the lakes tend to get
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   Water weeds and siltation cause problems and must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez has a unique problem. The canal that feeds it water has a
Phoenix water treatment plant located upstream.
</P>
<P>
   Alum, a chemical, is used at the water plant to cause minerals
and other particles to settle out of the water. It is flushed into
the canal. The chemical no longer is active, but it produces silt
that enters Cortez and settles to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Salt River Project is trying to stop that process, Swanson said.
It would require enlarging the area around the water plant so that
settling basins could be built. The sediment would be dredged
occasionally so the almu wouldn't be discharged into the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Cortez would be easier if it could be purged and cleaned
with incoming water. But there's a problem with that, too.
</P>
<P>
   SRP used to be able to fill Cortez with water and then take it
back without losing its water allowance. The state's Ground Water
and Management Act fixed that, according to Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three phases to the law,'' Swanson said. ``In one,
water allocations to lakes and parks were reduced.'' And SRP now
longer receives credit for water it takes back from the lake.
</P>
<P>
   For now. the remedy for Cortez is to remove water weeds from
Cortez and dredge for silt.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix will have to allocate money for most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really encouraging that the city has been enthusiastic
about rejuvenating its urban lakes,'' Swanson said. ``Some cities
don't want to spend much on their lakes.'' &QL;

STANDARD HIGH FOR UA DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - The attention has swirled around Trung Canidate,
Heisman candidates and a double-barreled attack at quarterback.
There's even a $2.9 million, state-of-the-art scoreboard under
construction at the north end of Arizona Stadium. The dim bulbs are
gone. Soon, they'll be replaced by the bright lights of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Ding-ding-ding, the Wildcats are prepared to make some points.
But make no mistake about one of them:
</P>
<P>
   The potential for another dynamic season on offense is not the
radical new face of Arizona football. If the fourth-ranked Wildcats
can stage an encore of last year's offensive strike force, they
won't be changing so much as evolving.
</P>
<P>
   In Coach Dick Tomey's 12-year regime, Arizona was built with an
emphasis on defense. Since 1994, the Wildcats have been identified
by ``Desert Swarm.'' It's a catchy nickname, but it stuck because
defense is an Arizona tradition. It remains to be seen whether the
new-look offense is a passing fashion or something substantial
enough to merit its own nickname. Stayed tuned on that one.
</P>
<P>
   But there doesn't appear to be much doubt that much of the
Arizona tradition endures. There was evidence throughout the
Wildcats camp at Cochise College near Douglas that plenty of sting
is left in the old swarm. However, one potentially fatal, question
lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Is there life after Chris McAlister?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got life without Chris, and what life without Chris is
like, we'll see,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister, the Baltimore Ravens' first-round pick in April's NFL
draft, was such a dominant presence at cornerback last year that
the Wildcats were able to hide whatever other weaknesses they might
have had in the secondary. McAlister virtually shut down his side
of the field.
</P>
<P>
   His departure has created inevitable doubts about the Wildcats
secondary. Arizona's defensive backs are short. McAlister's
designated successor, 5-foot-9 Leland Gayles, is returning after
missing most of last season after a devastating collision at
Washington that left him with a cervical sprain. The doubts have
been heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their opinions,'' said 5-9 Kelvin Hunter, who is
projected to start at the corner opposite Gayles. ``But we know in
our hearts that we can cover anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If the secondary has a weakness, it might not become evident
immediately, anyway. The Wildcats open Saturday at Penn State,
which has never been known for a strong passing attack.
Nonetheless, the Nittany Lions might be tempted by well-circulated
suspicions of a weak Arizona secondary. However, that also could be
a point at which they fall into a trap.
</P>
<P>
   While All-Everything linebacker Marcus Bell triggers the Arizona
defense, the Wildcats also possess an imposing, deep defensive
line. Don't be surprised if the defensive front emerges as
Arizona's strength this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an extension of the shared duties at quarterback by Keith
Smith and Ortege Jenkins, defensive coordinator Rich Ellerson plans
to employ a rotation. Ellerson has the players to do it.
</P>
<P>
   At Cochise, nine effective defensive linemen were evident. Want
to stop the run? Send in sophomore Keoni Fraser. Need to put some
pressure on the quarterback? Call on sophomore Alex Luna.
</P>
<P>
   Some other names are senior J.J. Joppru, junior Idris Haroon,
junior college transfer Austin Uku, senior James Lewis and freshman
Young Thompson. Remember Thompson's name. He's a cousin of Jack
``The Throwin' Samoan'' Thompson, the former Washington State and
Cincinnati Bengals quarterback. This Thompson is 6-2 and nearly 300
pounds. His legs are island-sized, and he moves along the line of
scrimmage like a riptide.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the rotation is at the bookends with junior starters
Mike Robertson and Joe Tafoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line is one position that takes the most
beating,'' said Tafoya, who has become the group's designated
spokesman and leader. ``We're usually the ones who go down first.
If you get a good rotation going, your legs feel fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to alternate with wave after wave of fresh troops.
</P>
<P>
   A hint at the level of confidence in the defensive line was
evident in the spring when versatile Eli Wnek, a freshman starter
last season from Glendale Ironwood High School, was moved to the
offensive backfield as a lead blocker and occasional receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the defensive front is the opening line in an Arizona
defense that figures to be characteristically creative. Over the
years, Ellerson's schemes have included a variety of labels. From
1992 through 1995, it was called ``the double-eagle flex.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the rest of the nation had another name for
it. It was unyielding, as the Wildcats were the nation's top team
in run defense in '93, No. 2 in '94.
</P>
<P>
   In '94, a Tedy Bruschi-led front was credited with 41 of the
team's 47 sacks, a Pac-10 high. During the past couple of years,
Arizona has introduced the ``whip or flex'' linebacker in senior
DaShon Polk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ended up with a reasonably good defense last year,
but not a great defense,'' Tomey said. ``We retain nine of those
guys that started plus a couple of other guys who played a lot. I
think we have a chance to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   If an enduring tradition means anything at all, Arizona's
defense always has that chance. &QL;

SUN DEVILS' PROGRESS EVIDENT  
 SNYDER THRILLED BY `GREAT CAMP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA, Ariz. _ Breathe easy, Arizona State fans.
Saturday's camp-ending scrimmage did not reflect what the Sun
Devils achieved during their 10 days in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond sat out. Ryan Kealy played sparingly. Many of the
defensive alignments _ particularly nickel and dime packages _ were
put to rest for the day. What the competition did provide was a
chance for the coaches to evaluate positions up for grabs, as well
as key reserves.
</P>
<P>
   First, what was accomplished:
</P>
<P>
   Despite their inexperience, the Sun Devils will be deeper and
better in the secondary. ASU will have a rotation of four players
they are comfortable with at safety.
</P>
<P>
   These Sun Devils seem to be closer and have better leadership.
Players are holding themselves accountable. Redmond and Kealy are
more vocal and have the attention of their teammates. Defensive end
Erik Flowers is among those demanding more from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great camp,'' Coach Bruce Snyder said.
``The players were terrific to coach, they were agreeable and they
played tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy gave every indication that he will have a big year. He
looked confident, poised and extremely comfortable with the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   What's still up for grabs:
</P>
<P>
   Snyder wouldn't say it's a done deal, but it appears Scott
Peters will play center and Levi Jones, a 6-foot-6 former walk-on
from Eloy, will take over at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils gave junior college transfer Kenneth Williamson
an opportunity to start at center _ which would have put Peters at
guard _ but they don't appear sold on that option.
</P>
<P>
   The backup quarterback job is getting interesting. One of the
top contenders is 6-1 Griffin Goodman, a walk-on who helped Eastern
Arizona to an ACCAC championship in 1997. He is battling with
junior college transfer John Leonard for the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder did not discount redshirt freshman Matt Cooper, who could
be the Sun Devils quarterback of the future, but the contest seems
to be between Goodman and Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver is a big-time concern. Junior Tariq McDonald is
the only sure thing. Junior college transfers Richard Williams, who
was limited by a sore hamstring in camp, Ryan Dennard and Royce
Coachman showed promise, but it's still unknown how they will
perform in games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Forth (hamstring) won't return until late September, and
Kyran Jones and Shaun McDonald are promising but need experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's our biggest concern,'' Snyder said. ``I'm sure
they might be offended by that statement, but let them use that as
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are grateful for a generous allotment of talented
tight ends and running backs who can catch.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates for place-kicker _ Stephen Baker and Mike Barth
_ struggled during the early part of the scrimmage, then came on
strong when the competition heated up. Baker finished 3 for 5 with
a long field goal of 47 yards. Barth was 2 for 5 with a long of 43.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Murphy, a transfer from Scottsdale Community College, is
giving Baker a run at punter. Snyder has said he would like Baker
to concentrate on just one position, but would they replace him at
the spot where he was a freshman All-American last season? &QL;

DISASTROUS SEASON MAY BE WHAT ASU NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA - The pedestal is gone. The program has been
humbled. And so has the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Arizona State football took a major hit in both
quality and perception during last year's season of contempt,
you're right. And all that's left is an enormous burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells you that you learn more from your failures than
you do from success,'' quarterback Ryan Kealy said. ``And that's
what we're trying to do _ bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the inherent advantages, there is no logical reason why
ASU football should be where it is: a team on the periphery of the
Top 25, on the mend, hoping to surprise a few people. But the Sun
Devils are here for a reason, and in some regards, a thoroughly
deflating 5-6 season may serve as a turning point in the direction
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The changes start at the top. The head coach, Bruce Snyder, is
59 years old. With a contract that runs through 2004, his job is
safe. But it's easy to see how his perspective has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Entering last season, it appeared the Sun Devils finally had
joined the elite fraternity in college football. They had won 20 of
their previous 24 games. They had cracked the top five in some
national polls, had been given an outside chance at a national
championship. Then it all fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a divided team at times,'' Kealy said. ``There was
a lot of finger-pointing when the ship started to sink.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been easy for Snyder to believe his program was on
cruise control, but there is no question he slipped in 1998. He
overestimated his talent, lost the pulse of his team. But if true
character only emerges from the abyss, then give Snyder credit for
re-energizing himself and his program.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the off-season visiting with other respected coaches.
He talked with LSU boss Gerry DiNardo about practice habits. He
chatted with Army Coach Bob Sutton about leadership. He discussed
strategy with Clemson's Tommy Bowden. He lit a fire under his own
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also is focusing hard on the concept of chemistry. He was
quick to release or suspend five players from the program. He is on
top of everything, and the lessons of last season run deep. For the
coach and his players.
</P>
<P>
   During the boot camp of Tontozona, Snyder allows his players to
sleep in on Sunday morning. In the past, that has led to some
raucous Saturday nights. But this year, Snyder advised his team to
use the break for slumber purposes only. And they've listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think they're more willing to say (the coach) might
know what the hell he's talking about,'' Snyder said. ``As opposed
to, `He's old and he doesn't know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that is much different rhetoric from the coach who once
claimed he did a terrific job in 1998. The coach who told me in our
first meeting that very few people in the state of Arizona know
more about football than he does.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sun Devils won't be playing for a national
championship in January, humility is a fine place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conditioning this summer has been great, our strength is
greater, and our practice habits are much better,'' Snyder said.
``And it all stems from guys saying that last year was
unacceptable. They've been practicing like crazy because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, this season will be a test of Snyder's instincts. He
has imported a number of junior college players, normally a red
flag signaling a program compensating for poor recruiting. But
Snyder really likes this team, and there are signs of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   If he stays healthy, tailback J.R. Redmond can be a phenomenal
talent. If he stays on an even Kealy, the quarterback has the
talent to produce. The defense is more experienced. And while
suspect in quality, the secondary is much deeper than last year, a
necessity in the pass-happy Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry right now is terrific,'' Snyder said. ``And
(defensive end) Erik Flowers has something going with J.R. Redmond.
They will not let this team lose. They talk about it all the time.
And we never had much of that last year. Nobody would step forward
to do that. They were all more interested in what bowl game they
were going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Sun Devils have been knocked down. But they're fighting
like mad to get on their feet. And that says something.
</P>
<P>
   Something good. &QL;

BACKUP QBS HAVE HANDLE ON SITUATION

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - No coach wants a backup quarterback to stick out
like a sore thumb _ which is exactly what Cardinals starting
quarterback Jake Plummer has on his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cardinals staff was gratified when backup Dave Brown and
third-stringer Chris Greisen, thrown into action Friday after
Plummer's injury on the first possession, rallied the team to a
27-17 preseason win over Tennessee. Their performances reaffirmed
that if something happened to Plummer in a game that mattered, the
franchise would not unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, an eight-year veteran and former starter for the New York
Giants, is not the most mobile man on the field. He has taken three
sacks in two games, including one that took the Cardinals out of
field goal range on a third down Friday. But he also threw a
touchdown pass to tight end Johnny McWilliams. In two games, Brown
has a completion percentage of .667 (18 for 27).
</P>
<P>
   Greisen, a rookie who guided the team to its only touchdown in
the preseason opener at Denver, was slowed early last week by an
abscess. He took the Cardinals to a go-ahead touchdown in the
closing two minutes, including a drive-saving 10-yard scramble on
third and 9 to the Tennessee 4.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin wanted to get a good look at Brown on Friday,
but not the way he got it. Brown was scheduled to play the entire
second half after Plummer played the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave got us the touchdown to get us back in the ballgame
(after a 10-0 deficit),'' Tobin said. ``Dave made the good throw to
Johnny for the touchdown. He did what you'd hope a seasoned,
experienced veteran would do. We're confident that if something
were to happen to Jake that Dave could step in, move the offense,
and give us chance to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Greisen has shown maturity beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both games he's showed an awful lot of poise for a young
guy,'' Tobin said. ``He's playing with the second- and third-level
wide receivers, and they don't always run the right routes. Chris
has made check-offs that a lot of more experienced quarterbacks
wouldn't have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made that big first down on the scramble, which was a key
play in that ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays of Plummer's hand during the game were negative. He had a
precautionary magnetic resonance imaging test Saturday morning.
Results are expected today. The thumb was swollen, bruised and very
sore. He is not expected to practice most of this week and is
questionable for Saturday's preseason visit to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake would have to be pretty healthy to play,'' Tobin said.
``We don't want to set him back. He needs the experience of these
preseason games in order to get ready for the regular season, but
we are not going to do anything to jeopardize his health.''
</P>
<P>
   If Plummer can't play, Tobin said he might give the first unit
less work this week and then more in the final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Often-injured cornerback Tom Knight made it through training
camp healthy and has elevated his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with more confidence than he has had,'' Tobin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Andy McCullough, the leading receiver in NFL
Europe, is beginning to learn the system and step forward as the
projected fourth receiver. Free agent Tony Hamler had been making a
move for the No. 5 spot, but he dropped three passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was in a completely different system two months ago,''
Tobin said. ``Everything is new to him since he missed minicamp _
responsibilities, alignments, routes. He's fighting to learn.
Hamler dropped a couple. That disappointed me, but he still is a
rookie. I hope he develops consistency because he does have
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Carpenter also remains in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   On the injury front, tight end Terry Hardy (hamstring) is to
return to practice Monday and center Allen DeGraffenreid (shoulder)
isn't far behind. But defensive linemen Mike Moten (knee) and
Thomas Burke (hamstring) are expected to miss four to six days.
Offensive lineman Jerome Daniels (dislocated elbow) could be out
several weeks, Tobin said, leaving the Cardinals with an acute
shortage of offensive linemen. With the cut to 65 coming next week,
the team does not expect to sign another offensive lineman. &QL;

HOW LOW CAN THIS AGENT GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trailing badly in the public opinion battle, the agent for
unsigned Cardinals first-round pick  &UR; L.J. Shelton sunk to new
depths last week. He managed to turn  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr., Cardinals
vice president, into a sympathetic figure.
</P>
<P>
   First, during a dog and pony show that was disguised as a news
conference in his Denver office,  &UR; Lamont Smith threatened to expose
Bidwill Jr. The agent disclosed he had a tape that would prove
Bidwill Jr. had said the Cardinals could ``live with'' a contract
for Shelton that included all of the ``bells and whistles'' the
team vowed it never would give.
</P>
<P>
   Smith claimed he wasn't trying to blackmail the team. In fact,
he said he hadn't deliberately taped their draft day conversation.
It was inadvertent or accidental, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And if you believe that, you must think  &UR; Richard Nixon
inadvertently taped the conversations in the Oval Office during the
Watergate scandal, an accident that brought down the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three days after Smith threatened to release the
tapes, he didn't show up for a meeting in Tempe with Cardinals
officials. The two sides had met the previous day, and the
Cardinals had scheduled another session to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials maintain they were stood up without even a
phone call. Smith said he hadn't shown up because team officials
had allowed only a short block of time for the meeting. He also was
annoyed that Bidwill Jr. wasn't going to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't interested in serious negotiations. He just wanted
Bidwill Jr. there so they could hash over their draft day
conversation and Smith could let him know what he planned to do
with the alleged tape of their phone call.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason Cardinals officials had a limited amount of
time for the meeting. They were trying to get to Flagstaff to meet
with the families of offensive linemen  &UR; Ernest Dye and  &UR; Lester
Holmes, &UR; both of whom had been hospitalized in a rollover car
accident on Interstate 17 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving town, Smith went on the radio and threatened to
have Shelton, the offensive tackle from Eastern Michigan, sit out
the entire season. He even maintained that Shelton could make more
money next year than the five-year, $5.1 million deal the Cardinals
could pay him as the 21st selection overall.
</P>
<P>
   Smith didn't suddenly become media-friendly. He hasn't returned
one phone call since February from ``The Arizona Republic,'' the
state's largest newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, ever canny, went on the offensive because he thought he
could prey on the unpopularity of Bidwill Jr., whom fans blame for
almost everything that goes wrong with the Cardinals, even when he
isn't involved.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the agent for first-round pick  &UR; Andre
Wadsworth, &UR; Eugene
 &UR; Parker, &UR; blamed Bidwill Jr. for nixing a deal. Callers on talk radio
went nuts. Volunteer workers for the Rio Salado Crossing stadium
project threatened to quit because of all the flak the team was
getting for the Wadsworth holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, Wadsworth signed, on the eve of the
regular season opener.
</P>
<P>
   But if Smith is expecting public opinion to force the Cardinals
to sign his client, he is kidding himself. There is no pending
stadium vote. Wadsworth, the third pick overall, was penciled in as
a starter on draft day. Thus, he had all the leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who was expected to battle for a starting job, has
little leverage. He has missed three weeks of camp and would be a
backup even if he signed today.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Smith has misplayed his hand, showing a terrible
sense of timing.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the franchise is reeling from a tragedy that could cost
Dye his right arm, and Smith, piqued that he doesn't get a chance
to confront Bidwill Jr. about the silly tape, storms out of town. &QL; 
Amazing grace &QL; 
When Cardinals players finally got to visit Dye at Flagstaff
Medical Center last week, they weren't sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Few had ever seen Dye, whose right arm was nearly amputated in
the car accident, without a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Dye made sure the players felt at ease. He told one teammate,
``Tell the guy in the next room, he owes me a Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy in the next hospital room was offensive guard  &UR; Lester
 &UR; Holmes, &UR; who had been driving Dye's Mercedes 500S when it
hydroplaned on I-17, spun around three times and rolled over twice.
</P>
<P>
   Dye had been in surgery for more than eight hours, and yet he
could still joke around with his teammates. &QL; 
Looking good &QL; 
Ravens Coach  &UR; Brian Billick made a popular move with some in the
team's front office when he signed former Cardinals quarterback
 &UR; Stoney &UR; Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the guy,'' Billick said. ``He belongs on the cover of
``GQ.'' I'm a hero with the secretaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Case play? He made only four appearances in four seasons
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts signed him to a two-year, $2 million deal in the
off-season but cut him after one preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out of the blue, totally unexpected,'' Case said.
``Next to  &UR; Peyton Manning, &UR; I thought I was the last person that
anybody thought (was in trouble). I was out there working hard,
doing good things. I had a good game against Chicago. Three days
later, they call me and say they're going to go with  &UR; Steve Walsh
as No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you serious?' It was a two-minute conversation.
They didn't give me a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Case is reunited with former Cardinals quarterback coach  &UR; Matt
 &UR; Cavanaugh, &UR; offensive coordinator for the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of ability,'' Cavanaugh said. ``He's just very
raw right now.'' &QL; 
Class act &QL; 
There wasn't one Giants player who questioned Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel for
leaving the team in training camp to be with his ill mother in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel missed the Giants' preseason opener to be with his
mother,  &UR; Dorothy, &UR; 76, as she began kidney dialysis treatments last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him going to Arizona to see his mother was was the best
coaching decision he ever made,'' Giants defensive end  &UR; Michael
Strahan said. ``I told him he would have regretted it if he hadn't
gone. And I told him he made us realize how much family matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did after he left was call my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel appeared weary when he returned to Albany, N.Y., from
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's stable,'' Fassel said of his mother. ``She's fighting.
She's a tough lady.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
The Chiefs continue to bash holdout first-round draft pick  &UR; John
Tait, &UR; the offensive tackle from Brigham Young who attended Tempe
McClintock High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely remember his name,'' Kansas City Coach  &UR; Gunther
 &UR; Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Hall of Famers  &UR; Chuck Noll or  &UR; Tom Landry doing this?
Billick, the former Vikings offensive coordinator who is in his
first year with the Ravens, gave himself the game ball after they
beat the Eagles in the preseason opener. What will he do when the
Ravens win a game that counts? &QL;

VALDES IS BAIT, BUT DODGERS NEED BIG FISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The suitors continuously asked about Ismael
Valdes before the trading deadline and the Los Angeles Dodgers
wouldn't budge. Teams will target the Dodgers right-hander again in
the offseason, but don't expect the Dodgers to move unless they are
blown away by an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching is too scarce and Valdes has been too good. He just
doesn't have the record to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff and his command is good enough to be a No.1
(starter),'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's what?
Twenty-six. He's still pretty young. ... I went on record with
(Dodgers president and CEO Bob) Graziano and the general manager
(Kevin Malone) and said we can't trade any pitching. We have to add
some.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes celebrated his 26th birthday by allowing two runs in six
innings in Saturday's 6-5, 11-inning loss against Philadelphia, but
he didn't figure in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   That's typical of his season. Valdes entered Saturday's game
with the ninth-best ERA (3.48) in the NL but had just eight wins to
show for it. He hasn't won since July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have 16, 17 wins if we could do some things
offensively behind him,'' Johnson said. ``If all the guys in the
rotation pitched like him, we'd be in high cotton.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers are knee-deep in mud and a storm is
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, on a staff of underachievers, can fall on either side of
the fence. The Dodgers' 3.72 runs-per-game average is tied for
worst in the NL, which speaks of tough luck and no offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes also has trouble closing out innings. In his 11
losses and seven no-decisions he's allowed 56 runs, 32 coming with
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has given up hits that turn ties into one-run deficits on
more than a few occasions. But that can happen when every game you
pitch is low-scoring.
</P>
<P>
   At one time Valdes was 5-2 and heading for his best season since
he went 15-7 in 1997. He is second on the Dodgers with 17 quality
starts (six innings, three or fewer earned runs), but has just
three wins in his past 16 starts. The Dodgers are 4-12 and have
scored more than five runs just once in those 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give up pitching unless you get pitching back,''
Johnson said. ``If you're going to give up one that can do it, you
better get back two that can maybe do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort to start Monday: Coming off the second shutout of his
career, right-hander Darren Dreifort will remain on his normal rest
and will pitch Monday's opener in Milwaukee. Right-hander Mike Judd
will get his third major-league start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson waited to make a decision on Dreifort until the two
could talk, and Johnson was certain Dreifort was ready to pitch on
four days rest.
</P>
<P>
   Finally: Valdes turned 26 and Craig Counsell celebrated his 29th
birthday Saturday.... Johnson said injured right-hander Robinson
Checo, who threw Thursday in a rehab stint at Single-A San
Bernardino, experienced soreness in his groin and wasn't able to do
his side work.... Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu, who's second in the
NL with a .344 average, had two hits and walked twice to extend his
string of reaching base safely to 26 games.

POLLY ROSENBAUM: `THE FIRST 100 IS THE HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Resending to correct first graf) 
 
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schoolteacher Edwynne Prendergast, 30, was brimming with her
usual optimism when she arrived in Arizona in search of adventure
and a good paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly the typical young woman to step off a train in
Tucson that September day in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she was college-educated _ political science and
history at the University of Colorado. For another, she was
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many before her and after, Edwynne Prendergast, who was
born in Ollie, Iowa, came to this remote, sparsely settled state to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, Prendergast _ soon nicknamed Polly for that
incurable optimist, Pollyanna _ stayed to help write Arizona
history.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, known to Arizona as Polly Rosenbaum, will celebrate
her 100th birthday on Sept. 4. The former legislator never had
children. But for 70 years, she has worried over the state as
though it were her family.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Legislature and out, Rosenbaum has influenced
Arizona's laws and educational system and fought to preserve its
history.
</P>
<P>
   And long before Arizona won national attention for its ``fab
five'' women in top political positions, Rosenbaum blazed the
lonely trail that they and others have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for women back then if you let it get to you, but
I didn't,'' Rosenbaum says today in her crisp, staccato tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tolerated you. It was especially tough for a woman all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have dreamed of the progress that was made this
century _ in every area.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cooper, director of the Arizona Historical Foundation,
says Rosenbaum epitomizes the brand of tough, tireless optimism
that Americans associate with its Western pioneers _ and thus with
Old Arizona. Plus, Cooper said, she's a walking history of Arizona
that is yet to be written down.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Tucson, the young teacher lodged at the
Congress Hotel. She had to wait overnight for the Model T Ford that
would take her to the mining town of Hayden, where she had been
recruited to teach typing, shorthand, history and civics.
</P>
<P>
   As was her custom, she immediately began soaking up local
politics. As a child, Rosenbaum said, she would pull the political
section from the morning newspapers, leaving the social pages to
her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time to be an optimist: The news in Arizona
newspapers was mostly positive. Though the Great Depression loomed
just weeks ahead, Arizona industry, especially mining, was enjoying
its best year in history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could buy Whippets, Buicks, Fords and Cadillacs, each
with great loads of copper tubes and tanks and wires. Members of
the burgeoning middle class could buy a first-class luxury car for
about $1,000, new. A 3-year-old Buick Roadster could be found in
The Arizona Republican for $485.
</P>
<P>
   High-boy Atwater Kent radios were selling for $188 _ a fortune
for the times. Cars, radios and airplane ads filled newspaper
pages. The state's agriculture, cattle and tourism industries were
also booming as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum took the open-air ride to hot and dusty Hayden; it was
over 110 degrees when she finally stepped out of the coach, her
wool suit soaked in muddy perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But the town charmed her. Hay den, a copper-boom company town of
2,200 near the confluence of the Gila and San Pedro rivers, then
featured a pretty downtown and had access to a riverfront golf
course. It was more livable than today, Rosen baum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dances every Satur day and played golf every
Sunday,'' Rosenbaum recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bridge clubs and meet ings of Eastern Star and the
Rebekahs, and, my, you could take a walk at 2 a.m. if you wanted to
and feel perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Depression hit, the little town kept dancing for
two more years. Rosenbaum taught school and lived in a women's
dormitory-style hotel owned by the mines.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's hard times finally caught up with Hayden.
Scrambling to find a steady paycheck, Rosen baum became a secretary
at Inspi ration Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   From 1929 to 1939, as the Depression deepened and as the towns
of the copper crescent fell on harder and harder times, Rosen baum
was a blur of happy activity in the towns of Hayden and Globe. She
would always be the one to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude means every thing,'' she still says today. ``If
you think you can do something, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, her company lent her as a temporary secretary in
Phoenix for the short session of the Arizona Legislature. She was
paid $5 a day. Legislators were paid $8.
</P>
<P>
   There, she met and married William G. ``Rosie'' Rosenbaum,
majority leader of the Arizona House. When he died in the 10th year
of their marriage, his wife was invited to serve out his term _ so
the state didn't have to pay for an election.
</P>
<P>
   It was not exactly an early victory for feminism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to come down to the Legislature,'' one lawmaker
as sured her. Another told her he didn't want ``any woman'' on his
commit tee.
</P>
<P>
   She would serve in the Legisla ture for almost 46 years, until
she was defeated in 1994 at age 95.
</P>
<P>
   And she became an almost leg endary figure, even to her critics.
The late Republic columnist John Kolbe wrote this about Rosenbaum
after her 1994 defeat: ``Although time had long passed her by, and
she ceased to be much of a power from her back-bench seat in the
minority, on the narrow issues where her interest lay _ such as the
state library _ her wish is still law, so universal is the esteem
and affection in which she is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, she she hasn't always been a profile in courage.
Her lightning-quick scurry out the back door when a controversial
bill comes up for a vote is legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum readily admits that, in part because she was a Demo
crat, she was no flamboyant leader, rarely giving floor speeches or
sponsoring major legislation. In stead, she was a tireless be
hind-the-scenes worker.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career, Rosen baum became friends with a wide
range of Arizonans, from alleged trunk murderess Winnie Ruth Judd
to former Gov. Rose Mofford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Rosie (her husband) and I, we knew all the governors
since Arizona became a state in 1912,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, local historian Marshall Trimble recalls sitting
on a selection committee for the Ari zona Women's Hall of Fame,
which Rosenbaum helped establish. While he and others spoke of what
they read about the illustrious characters from Arizona's past,
Rosenbaum spoke of them as people she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore that if we had brought up the name Martha Washington,
Polly would have reeled off an anecdote about something they did
during the Revolution,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, she was an especially strong advocate for edu
cation and libraries. Because Hay den didn't have a library when
she arrived, she worked to ensure that Arizona's little towns had
their share of libraries. She also spear headed the development of
Arizona's community college system.
</P>
<P>
   All along, she punched holes in the glass ceiling: In 1968, she
and others went through the Arizona Constitution word by word,
elimi nating ``male'' as a requisite for becoming an elected state
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears me out,'' says Mof ford, who calls her a personal
role model and the most remarkable woman she has ever known. Rosen
baum's famous for outwalking most people in both speed and
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many places to go,'' Rosen baum says.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as she gets ready for her second century, Rosenbaum
says she doesn't feel much different than when she was a teenager
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 100 is the hardest,'' she says. ``The second hundred
should be easier because I have crossed all the bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still considers Gila County her home base, for the
past five years her full-time residence has been a two-bedroom
condomin ium in central Phoenix. She con fesses that she doesn't
invite visitors because her home is a bit of a mess. She has been
sorting through 30 large boxes of papers from her legislative days.
She still has 10 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she drives to the state Capitol to give a tour of the
historic House and Senate chambers. She's also a regular at the
state's gem and mineral museum at 15th Avenue and Washington
Street, which she helped establish and which bears her name. Her
love of minerals goes back to her copper town days.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around town is becoming more difficult, she says,
because many of the older buildings that are her landmarks are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with Phoe nix is its lack of memory,'' she
says. ``Newcomers come, and what do they care about what happened
50 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   She cares. In her later years as a legislator, Rosenbaum fought
to preserve a number of historic sites, including the Evans House
on West Washington, across from the old Carnegie Library, which she
also helped preserve. The Evans House was a shambles, though it was
one of only three great Victorian speci mens left in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She, better than anyone, under stands that historic buildings
tie our society to a sense of well-being and give us community
spirit,'' says Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gor don, who worked
with her on the Evans House.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Rosenbaum's political days quite over. Along with former
state Attorney General Grant Woods, she has been asked to be
co-chairwoman of an effort to end gerrymandering of political
districts by creating an independent redis tricting commission. The
proposal is headed for the ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `You bet your life. I'll be glad to give you some
pointers,' '' she says. ``I'll never quit politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is getting used to people asking her about her almost
being 100 _ when they get over their disbelief that she's that old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't there a lot more impor tant things to talk about?'' she
asks. ``Making 100 is just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she feels fortunate to have never had a serious illness or
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had time to be sick,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a long life? ``Being interested in other people
and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her birthday wish for Arizona is that state officials get back
into the habit of thinking carefully about the important issues.
She also worries that children aren't taught to think; all their
time is filled with activity and entertainment, she fears.
</P>
<P>
   And she wishes a wish for mutual respect in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband taught me that you must respect the other person's
viewpoint, even if it is different than yours,'' Rosenbaum says.
``That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not much for partisanship. She became a Democrat because
there wasn't a Republican in sight when she first came to the
state. She stayed a Democrat but never con sidered herself a slave
to any party.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, she would con sider being an Independent, which
is really what she considers herself to have been all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 100 years, Rosenbaum isn't interested in leaving this
life any sooner than she has to: She doesn't have time to die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of her fondest memories is a beautiful funeral in the
1940s in rural Gila County.
</P>
<P>
   An old World War I veteran had died, and his family wanted a
military funeral for him. They found a good flag to put on his
coffin. They found a 12-year-old boy who could play a trumpet. The
next day, everybody climbed a hill out in the middle of nowhere and
put the old man in the ground, adding rocks atop his grave to keep
the wild animals away. The boy's taps, beau tifully played, echoed
through the hushed landscape.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers like it was yester day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should remember some of these things,'' Rosenbaum says.
``They will never come again. It was a whole different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she shakes off the melan choly and smiles a bright,
century-old smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about something else,'' she says. &QL;

RANGERS TOP RED SOX BEHIND ZIMMERMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman stepped on the
mound ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   The bell rang, and Zimmerman scored a first-pitch knockout
during last night's most significant at-bat of the Rangers' 9-2
victory against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who produced three hits
during his previous three plate appearances, stepped into the
batter's box for his seventh-inning at-bat with runners at the
corners and the Red Sox prepared to whittle into the Rangers' 4-2
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had Zimmerman on the mound,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said of the matchup that pitted All-Star vs. All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman expected that Garciaparra _ who entered the contest
hitting an American League-best .359 _ would be anticipating a
first-pitch slider. So, Zimmerman jammed him with a first-pitch
fastball, and that produced a mere-mortal popup that second baseman
Mark McLemore corralled for the inning's second out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers escaped the inning with their 4-1 lead intact after
Zimmerman induced an inning-ending fly ball from left fielder Troy
O'Leary, and the booming bats of designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
and left fielder Rusty Greer turned the affair into a blowout with
their seventh- and eighth-inning home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved 24 games above .500 for the first time since
1997 when Rangers finished 26 games above .500 with a 94-68 record.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling (10-7) pitched six effective innings
for the Rangers, but Oates went to the league's most reliable
bullpen at the first sign of trouble. Red Sox right fielder Trot
Nixon drew a leadoff walk to open the seventh inning, and Oates
wasted no time summoning for right-hander Tim Crabtree to preserve
the Rangers' 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox second baseman Jose Offerman and center fielder Darren
Lewis greeted Crabtree with consecutive singles, and Oates again
went to the well that seemingly never runs dry.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Venafro entered with the left-handed-hitting
Brian Daubach scheduled to bat, but Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
countered with right-handed-hitting Mike Stanley. Nixon scored on
Stanley's medium-deep fly ball to left field, and Offerman advanced
to third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venafro got a big out on Stanley,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates then called upon Zimmerman to complete the job, and the
Rangers bombarded the Red Sox with their late-inning home runs.
Palmeiro, who drove in the Rangers' third run with a third-inning,
solo home run, gave the Rangers' a 7-2 lead with his three-run home
run during the bottom half of the seventh inning off left-hander
Rheal Cormier.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro became the major leagues' 54th player to hit 350 or
more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' said Palmeiro, who has 11 home runs during
August and six during the past six games. ``I knew I was getting
close, but with the excitement of the game, I kind of lost track.
It's always nice to do something like that at home, though. I
thought it came in a pretty key situation, and that made it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who also produced a two-home run game, applied the
finishing touches with his two-run, eighth-inning home run off
right-hander Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a well-pitched game to begin with, and I think Raffy
had the big hit in the game with his three-run homer,'' Greer said.
``He's been doing it for us all year long. You can't say enough
about what Rafael has done for club.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was the bullpen that allowed the Rangers' bats to make
a difference. The Rangers improved to 53-5 this season when leading
after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they go out there, the results are great,'' Helling
said. ``It's kind of a double-edged sword for me because I want to
go out there and stay in the entire game. Yet, Johnny wants them
out there with the way they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him?

ERSTAD READY TO COME OFF DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels expect Darin Erstad to be
ready when the first baseman/outfielder is eligible to be activated
from the disabled list Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was placed on the 15-day DL after twisting his right knee
while swinging during the Angels' game against Cleveland on Aug.11.
He was diagnosed with a strained medial collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feeling fine,'' Erstad said. ``I don't know all the
technical terms for all the treatments I've done, but I know it
feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the two-week layoff will help to recharge Erstad's
psyche as well. He still has no explanation for his dismal season,
in which he has batted .246 with 10 homers and 37 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been abused (by opposing pitchers) and I haven't made the
right adjustments,'' Erstad said. ``It's not for a lack of effort
or work. It's just been a season-long learning experience about the
mental side of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was the one player the Angels didn't expect to have an
off-year. He was the first overall selection in 1995, he hadn't
batted lower than .284 in his previous three seasons, and his power
and RBI numbers had increased each year. Greatness was forecast for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when hamstring pulls dogged him, Erstad had
been injury-free until twisting his knee against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never got going,'' Erstad said. ``I never got a good
rhythm and never got comfortable at the plate. I've never been
through something like this before. It's a humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do now is finish the season strong and try to leave
a good taste in my mouth for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers don't lie: How sorry has the Angels' offense been this
season?
</P>
<P>
   It ranked last in the majors with 505 runs entering Saturday's
game. Even Montreal and Florida, bad teams that don't have the
benefit of the designated hitter, had scored more runs than the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are on pace to finish the season with 676 runs, which
would be the fewest by the franchise since the 1992 team scored
579.
</P>
<P>
   That '92 team, by the way, featured Hubie Brooks and Von Hayes
as its 3-4 hitters, and posted a 72-90 record.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetic change: Very soon, Edison Field will be a completely
natural-grass stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels ripped out the lime-green AstroTurf adjacent to the
rock fountain in center field and painted the area to match the
stadium's dark-green seats and walls. A smaller AstroTurf area on
the other side of the fountain will be similarly renovated in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The turf was getting damaged by sun, water from the fountain and
falling residue from fireworks, said Kevin Uhlich, vice president
of ballpark operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to wait until the season was over, but it really had
to be done,'' Ulich said.
</P>
<P>
   The change also improves the batter's eye _ and makes the
outfield area look less like an oversize putt-putt course.

COWBOYS FAIL TO STOP BIG PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Big plays given up by the Cowboys' defense in a
34-14 loss to the New England Patriots last night at Foxboro
Stadium even overshadowed the fact that Dallas has not won a
preseason game with Chan Gailey as the team's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there is less emphasis on winning than on
evaluation, Gailey's 0-8 preseason record as Cowboys coach becomes
a minor irritant.
</P>
<P>
   The same isn't true about a Cowboys defense that gave up several
big plays, including 24- and 36-yard touchdown passes and a 21-yard
pass that set up New England's first TD. Dallas is now 0-3; New
England, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman played one quarter, completing a
preseason-low four of 12 passes for 33 yards. He had his first
touchdown pass, but he also threw behind rookie wide receiver Wane
McGarity on an interception.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Aikman has completed 62.2 percent of his passes
(23 of 37) for 222 yards, one TD and two interceptions. He has yet
to be sacked this preseason, although rookie linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer leveled him once just as he released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer being forced to leave the
Cardinals' 27-17 victory against Tennessee Friday night with a
hyperextended thumb on his throwing hand, there is something to be
said for just getting through one of these preseason games ``sans''
injury to your starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas on offense for the Cowboys that screamed for
improvement coming into this game were red-zone scoring and
third-down efficiency (8-for-26).
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed better in the red zone,'' said Gailey, ``but we
had some difficulties in some third-down situations.''
</P>
<P>
   After going through the first two preseason games against
Cleveland and Oakland without getting as much as even a glimpse of
the end zone, the Cowboys' first-team offense moved downfield
rather methodically to score a touchdown on its second possession.
</P>
<P>
   After a short-field TD drive by New England, the Cowboys went 57
yards in nine plays with Aikman hitting a wide-open David LaFleur
for a 6-yard touchdown. LaFleur, coming off the injury list (ankle)
and playing in his first game since January's playoff loss to
Arizona, beat strong safety Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive, Emmitt Smith popped loose for a 21-yard gain
behind Erik Williams, plus a downfield screen thrown by Michael
Irvin. It was the Cowboys' longest run from scrimmage of the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Before that carry, the NFL's leading active rusher had carried
the ball six times for 10 yards this preseason. Last night, he had
eight rushes for 43 yards, including a nifty 10-yard pickup on a
direct snap, as Gailey opened the Cowboys playbook a little wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we put some new things in for this game,'' Gailey
said. ``Some of those things worked well, others did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe and the Patriots' first-team offense
were able to give their water-soaked local fans something to cheer
about early, compliments of two first-quarter touchdowns after Toby
Gowin punts that were knocked down by the wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gowin's 27-yard punt was returned 27 yards by Troy Brown,
then Gowin's 37-yard punt was returned 22 yards by Brown, who was
flipped in the air on a open-field tackle by the Cowboys punter.
This wasn't a good night for the Cowboys' punt-coverage team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our punt-coverage put us in a few tough spots ... and we gave
up a few big plays on defense,'' said Gailey. ``Those are things
that can be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gowin's punt for a net zero yards led to a five-play, 45-yard TD
drive by the Patriots; the 15-yard net punt led to a two-play,
37-yard TD drive. Both touchdowns came against the Cowboys'
first-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   The most-abused Cowboys player along the way: left cornerback
Kevin Mathis, twice beaten deep by Patriots wide receiver Terry
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their starting corners out,'' said Bledsoe, referring to
the injured Deion Sanders \Rtoe\S and Kevin Smith \Rbulging disk\S,
``we felt that we could exploit that, and throw a few deep balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that Mathis is an incumbent starter after beating out
Smith for a starting job last season.
</P>
<P>
   First, Glenn fought off Mathis' bump-and-run at the line of
scrimmage and gathered in a 21-yard toss from Bledsoe, leading to a
2-yard TD run by Kevin Faulk, a 5-foot-8, 197-pound rookie who
scored by slipping away from Dexter Coakley and carrying Randall
Godfrey into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Less than nine minutes later, Glenn beat Mathis deep on a
straight-go in the first quarter. This time there was no
bump-and-run by Mathis. This time it went for a 24-yard TD pass.
With 2:49 still left in the first quarter, the Pats led, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and New England extended their led to 21-7 when tight
end Ben Coates beat Cowboys safety Omar Stoutmire badly with 3:59
left in the first half for a 6-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   After playing poorly the week before at Oakland, Cowboys
quarterback Mike Quinn, in his quest to win the No. 3 job,
immediately hooked up with a wide-open Jason Tucker of TCU for a
55-yard touchdown pass play. It came on Quinn's first attempt of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn read the corner blitz, which left Tucker uncovered, as
safety help was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, New England put together 12- and nine-play
field goal drives in the second half before rookie quarterback
Michael Bishop _ a seventh-round pick despite being the 1998
Heisman Trophy runner-up _ launched a desperation TD pass to rookie
Sean Morey that covered 36 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Singor Mobley was beaten on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Washington, Bishop threw two TD passes and
nearly had a third one as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun to watch,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll said.
``Granted, he's doing this in the fourth quarter against backup
players ... but they're not getting even close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Evaluation vs. winning. For whatever it's worth, the Cowboys'
last preseason victory came against Tennessee in August 1997.

LaFLEUR COULD HOLD THE KEY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Much has been made of the Cowboys' off-season
addition of wide receiver Raghib Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no discounting what his speed will bring to the
Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to any member of the Cowboys' coaching staff or front
office and they'll say that the return tight end David LaFleur is
just as important if not more so to any Cowboys offensive success
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys scouting director Larry Lacewell says the 6-foot-7,
280-pounder is crucial to the Cowboys' running game and inside
passing game and cites the loss of an injured LaFleur for the final
three games of 1998 as a big reason for the late-season decline of
the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doubly important to what we do,'' Lacewell said. ``He's a
standout blocker and he gives Aikman such a big target, especially
on inside of the field and in the red zone. You double the guys on
the outside, but its tough to single cover him on the inside
because of his size.''
</P>
<P>
   But what had been clear up until last night's 34-14 loss to the
Patriots is that, like Ismail, LaFleur had yet to contribute
anything in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Both sat out the Cowboys' first two exhibition games _ Ismail
with a sprained shoulder and LaFleur because of off-season ankle
and back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While Ismail remained on the sideline, LaFleur trotted out on
the field with the first-team offense against the Patriots, making
his presence felt immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The former LSU star caught two passes for 10 yards, including a
6-yard touchdown pass. It was also no coincidence that running back
Emmitt Smith had his best outing of the preseason, rushing eight
times for 43 yards, including a 21-yard burst.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur's day was not without mistakes, as rustiness from the
layoff showed on a dropped pass and a false start.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year veteran, who returned to the practice field for
the first time in training camp last week, said he was just happy
to be out there. LaFleur played between 12-15 snaps in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to be out there,'' LaFleur said. ``I wanted to
get in and get a few snaps and get back into the flow of the game.
I was a little rusty, but I liked being in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't waste any time helping him do that, as
quarterback Troy Aikman called his number on the second play of the
game, resulting in a 4-yard reception.
</P>
<P>
   The next series started off badly, as LaFleur dropped a pass
while being covered tightly by Patriots linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   However, it ended when Aikman found him in the end zone after
beating Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy on a out route.
</P>
<P>
   While LaFleur said he didn't make all the plays, he said he was
pleased that the Cowboys seemed to be trying to get him involved _
a trend he hopes continues throughout the season after catching
just 20 passes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy definitely seemed to be looking my way,'' LaFleur said.
``It felt good on my first game back to be worked in the offense
and be called on in that situation. I might get a few more looks
this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who said he was excited to see
LaFleur back in uniform, can't wait to get him more time on the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times, it looked liked the ball got on top of him
in a hurry,'' Gailey said. ``So there's some rustiness still coming
through. He wasn't expecting the ball. That's why it was important
to get him back into the fray. Hopefully he'll progress even more
the next two weeks.'']

   We were dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us _ including yours truly, I must wincingly confess _
were even convinced that that chilly November afternoon in 1993,
when Will Clark became a Ranger and replaced Palmeiro at first
base, was a red-letter day for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Wince.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't come here today, friends and Romans, to bury Will
Clark. In a way, he did that himself yesterday, shutting down his
1999 season to have surgery on his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Clark finishes this season for the Baltimore Orioles with a .303
batting average in 251 at-bats. He had 10 home runs and 29 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Wince.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, on the other hand, in the month of August alone, has
11 home runs and 27 runs batted in. His second home run last night
was the 350th of his career and pushed him to 36 for the season
with 115 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   They are linked steadfastly, rightly or wrongly, Clark and
Palmeiro. Their baseball careers yoked in the '80s, when they were
fair-cheeked teammates at Mississippi State. On the 1993 day that
Clark signed here as a free agent _ while Palmeiro's agent was
still playing money games, the club said _ Raffy felt betrayed and
angered.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait, he said that day, to every TV minicam that came to
his Colleyville home's door. You'll see.
</P>
<P>
   Simply comparing numbers, the rout was on. Though he is only six
months older than Palmeiro, Clark's body began a fickle decline. In
the five years that he was away, Palmeiro played in 127 more games
than Clark _ nearly a full season. He batted 623 more times.
</P>
<P>
   In numbers that rang the loudest, and never failed to produce a
snarl from Clark when they were mentioned, Palmeiro outhomered him
182 to 77 and had 156 more RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves. Yet, in fairness, Clark
came to the Rangers because he was deemed a winner who would bring
a fiery temperament to what had become a languid clubhouse. And in
that regard, Clark delivered.
</P>
<P>
   With him at first base, the Rangers won their first division
title and finished atop the division three of the five years. He
brought a _ how shall I put this? _ shrill intensity to the
franchise. The injury that apparently still shackles him, bone
chips from a broken elbow, came about on a play when Clark was
playing like, well, Will Clark _ charging after a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   A free-agent signing that failed? No. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean we weren't wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We were wrong about the other half of the 1993 shuffle.
Palmeiro's textbook swing didn't unravel as he grew older and
slower, as some predicted. It prospered, as Palmeiro adapted in
Camden Yards to become a feared home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He now stands, at age 34, on the threshhold of a notable rush at
some hitting milestones. If Palmeiro has four more seasons anything
like his past seven seasons, he will eclipse 500 home runs, have
nearly 1,700 RBI and be within 200 hits of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those are Hall of Fame numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right there,'' said Rangers coach Bucky Dent. ``He
performs, day in and day out. He has the hits. The power. Doubles.
Home runs. The RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays healthy and plays for the right number of years,
it's very possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing, of course, that could stamp Palmeiro's ticket for
Cooperstown would be a World Series. And who's to say now, with
Palmeiro anchoring the Rangers lineup, that that isn't possible?
</P>
<P>
   Some guys are vocal team leaders. Palmeiro leads by quiet
example. He has commanded respect, especially among the team's
young players.
</P>
<P>
   His ``voice'' comes on the scoreboard. Before last night, with
runners on base this season, Palmeiro was hitting .383. With two
outs and men in scoring position, his average is .327. He has a
team-high 17 game-winning RBI, tying the club record.
</P>
<P>
   Dent points to his old Yankees teams, who had players such as
Chris Chambliss and Willie Randolph, as examples of winning teams
that also didn't need a booming clubhouse voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rah-rah guy?'' Dent said. ``No. You don't always need that.
With Rafael, there's a quiet intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I like to do,'' Palmeiro said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years ago, when he left for Baltimore, we called him
a whiner. We said he was just after the money. On his first trip
back into town, some Rangers fans even booed Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong, of course. We all were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   How symbolic, we thought yesterday, that on the same day when
the previous first baseman announced his injury-riddled season was
over, Rafael Palmeiro showed why he is this season's most valuable
Ranger of all.
</P>
<P>
   How grand of him to return home. On his way to Cooperstown.

DRIVE TO SURVIVE: ATHLETES STRICKEN WITH CANCER OFFER LESSONS IN
COURAGE
</HEADLINE>

By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In December 1993, professional golfer Paul
Azinger learned he had lymphoma _ cancer _ in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger returned to the PGA Tour the next season. An estimated
11,500 men died from the disease in the United States that year.
</P>
<P>
   Professional cyclist Lance Armstrong found out he had testicular
cancer in October 1996. Armstrong crowned his comeback to cycling
with a victory in the 1999 Tour de France _ the second by an
American and first by a cancer survivor. But about 370 men in the
United States with testicular cancer died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In February, doctors told guard Kim Perrot of the WNBA's Houston
Comets that she had lung cancer. She was one of an estimated
171,600 Americans who will receive a diagnosis of lung cancer this
year.
</P>
<P>
   She died Thursday. She was 32.
</P>
<P>
   In the arenas of sport, they are lauded for being athletes, but
in the cancer wards of hospitals, they are treated for being human.
</P>
<P>
   They are, in fact, statistics _ just a fraction of the estimated
12 million cases of cancer discovered in the United States] since
1990. No research indicates that they are any more or less likely
to be stricken with cancer than the rest of us, but by virtue of
their public lives, their private struggles become national news.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants running back LeShon Johnson. Florida Marlins
third baseman Mike Lowell. Canadian rower Emma Robinson. Former
Pittsburgh Penguins center Mario Lemieux. St. Louis Cardinals
outfielder Eric Davis. Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, whose
cancerous mole on his left shoulder was removed in the earliest
stage of malignancy in May 1998. Azinger. Armstrong. Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer does not discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   Being an athlete doesn't change that, but in some ways, it does
change how athletes react to their conditions and how they handle
cancer's aftermath. Many attack the disease as though they would an
athletic competition and, as victor or vanquished, offer lessons in
courage. Some, as Armstrong, become public spokesmen, pouring
thousands of dollars into research and awareness efforts, while
others, like Azinger, offer encouragement from a private phone call
or card. Still others, like Robinson, shun the role-model label
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories are important because the public can't believe
that someone so fit and so dedicated to a sport can be stricken
just like anyone else in the population,'' explained Dr. Jeff
Murray, a pediatric oncologist at Cook Children's Medical Center
who has raced with Armstrong. Athletes ``are not gods. They're not
infallible. Bad things can happen to them just like they can happen
to me. I think that somehow personalizes it more for the population
and reminds them how fragile life is for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Their stories are as different as the renegade cells that attack
from within, but the greatest unifying impact of their stories is
hope. TOP PROSPECT New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry.
St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Eric Davis. Los Angeles Dodgers
outfielder Brett Butler. Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres
Galarraga. Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, a 25-year-old rookie third baseman, entered spring
training this season with the Florida Marlins in hopes of joining
those major-league luminaries but found himself inextricably linked
with them after a preseason physical uncovered testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for behavioral risks, such as chewing tobacco or
extended exposure to the sun, no studies indicate that baseball
players are at a greater risk for cancer than the general
population. But Strawberry, Davis, Butler, Galarraga, Kruk and,
most recently, Lowell have brought colon cancer, cancer of the
mouth, lymphoma and testicular cancer onto the field of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I think it's found more often in athletes
because we're tested more often. We have to take physicals every
year,'' said Lowell. ``I think it just proves we're as human as
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lowell has that everyone else might not have is the
discipline, determination and drive that come from years of
athletic training _ something he believes helped him through
recovery and brought him back to the ballpark before the All-Star
Game last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this inner motivation and self-discipline,'' Lowell
explained. ``I thought my major-league career was on hold, if not
stopped, but then I just viewed it as another thing I had to
overcome. A lot of people never said I'd make it to the big
leagues. This is another thing that I have to prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, after Friday's game, was batting .252 with 29 runs
batted in and seven home runs with the Marlins _ not quite where he
would like to be, but good considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell went directly from surgery and radiation treatments into
the baseball season. Lowell looks forward to the off-season, when
he will have time to return to peak physical condition
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pro athlete has a little advantage over others
because of the lifestyle habits they have in place before they get
cancer,'' Murray explained. ``Dedication, perseverance, the will to
win whatever the race is _ the physical, psychological and
emotional habits are as good as they can be going into cancer, and
I think those habits do make a difference to some degree.''
RELUCTANT ROLE MODEL After doctors diagnosed his testicular cancer
in 1996, Armstrong formed a foundation to promote education and
research, and embraced the role as a cancer spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't so effective when I was in the hospital because I was
in bad shape,'' Armstrong recalled. ``But when I would return for
my checkups, I always asked the doctors, `Do you have any testes
patients here? Anybody I need to go see?' That was new for them.
They'd never had anybody say that. You never know what you're
walking into. It's an illness that's uncomfortable at times, but as
a patient and a survivor, it's easier for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though athletes like Armstrong take a public role in educating
people about their disease, others prefer to maintain their privacy
as though they were private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian rower Emma Robinson chose to announce publicly in
February that she had thyroid cancer and would have surgery to
remove it. She hoped that being open about cancer would put her
teammates and competitors at ease and would help her control how
that information was received. What she could not control was the
media blitz that followed when Robinson and her partner Theresa
Luke won the gold medal in the coxless pairs last month at the Pan
American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers trumpeted her ``amazing comeback'' which was
``paved with gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-year medical student had approached her disease with
the same focus that she had developed from lonely days rowing on
open water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to thinking about how to control my emotions and feel
calm and not be distracted by outside things,'' Robinson said. ``I
think that helped me with the diagnosis because I was able to stay
focused on training despite all the distractions and the attention
from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the ``amazing comeback'' headlines, Robinson is
preparing to defend her world championship this month in Ontario.
She would prefer to mount her defense as the 1998 world champion,
not as a gold medal-winning cancer patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be positive if someone gets checked out because of
this, but I don't see myself as a role model or champion,''
Robinson said. ``Right now, people know me because of cancer. The
next time my name comes up, I want it to be because of my rowing
achievements.'' CANCER CHAMPIONS Given a diagnosis of cancer in
1993, just months after winning his first major championship, Paul
Azinger recently passed the five-year mark of being cancer free
since the completion of chemotherapy in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 PGA Championship was his third victory of that season
and his most recent Tour victory. Unlike Robinson or Davis, Azinger
wants people to know about his success against the disease, but his
platform has shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a source of hope and inspiration for people that
are fighting the disease,'' Azinger said. ``I would like to play
better to be more in the spotlight. It's been so long since I've
done well that I'm sure there are people battling cancer who watch
golf that don't know what I've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger became a cycling fan this summer, when Armstrong
accomplished his historic feat, and Azinger knows intimately what
Armstrong's achievement meant to lesser-known persons who are
battling cancer today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an inspiration to me and everyone else out there who
can't see the light at the end of the tunnel,'' Azinger said.
``When you're in the middle of six months of chemotherapy, or a
year of chemotherapy, it seems like a lifetime. To be two
treatments or three treatments into it, it's so bad, you don't see
any end in sight. Then, to see a guy like that doing what he's
doing and beating all odds, that's a total inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   His story has made history: Lance Armstrong, the American cancer
patient who was dumped by an elite French cycling team in the wake
of his diagnosis, joined the American U.S. Postal Service Cycling
Team and rode to victory in the most prestigious event in his
sport.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong is not naive about the crush of popularity he has
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story,'' Armstrong said. ``Here's the kid that was good
before, and he got sick, and everybody dropped him and said he
couldn't come back. Sports fans love comebacks. I think this
brought in a lot of people that watched football or basketball or
baseball because of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory parade that greeted Armstrong in Austin two weeks
ago, the appearances on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' and
``Good Morning America'', the Nike commercial, the official White
House visit _ it is a great story, but one that is rarely told.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 million Americans have died from cancer since 1990.
For every Lance Armstrong, there is a Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was given a 50 percent chance of survival when his
cancer was discovered to have spread to his lungs and brain. His
doctors predict only a 2 percent chance of recurrence for
Armstrong, and even by their accounts his recovery has been
miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible illness,'' said Armstrong, who befriended a
young Austin cancer patient who died from the disease last year.
``My story is one of success, and hopefully continued success, but
they're not all like that, and we have to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 7,400 new cases of testicular cancer will be
diagnosed this year, and an estimated 300 men will die from the
disease in the United States this year. Though he has given hope to
people like Kelli Davidson, a young cancer patient at Cook
Children's Medical Center, has Armstrong set the bar too high?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, have Lowell's strong return and Robinson's
gold-medal comeback reinforced the idea that athletes with cancer
are somehow more-than-human?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the potential downsides to all the
goodness that's come out of Lance's comeback,'' said Murray, who
treated Davidson to daily videotapes of Armstrong's journey through
France. ``It can give the general public a false sense and give the
cancer community too much optimism. What everyone has to remember
is that cancer is very different from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think what Lance has done is going to make people cured is
false thinking. Will it make the lives of people with cancer
better? Absolutely, because it gives them hope, maybe not of living
longer, but for having a special victory in their life and giving
them the perseverance to go on.''

ARMSTRONG IS WORLD-CLASS IN CYCLING AND THE CANCER COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jeffrey C. Murray 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey C. Murray, M.D., is the associate medical director of
Hematology &AMP; Oncology Center at Cook Children's Medical Center in
Fort Worth and a competitive cyclist. He gives his views on what
Lance Armstrong has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic and medical triumph of professional cyclist and
testicular-cancer survivor Lance Armstrong in winning the grueling,
23-day Tour de France is an achievement unparalleled in
professional sport and medical oncology.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, at 25, the near-peak performance age of a
professional cyclist, Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer,
which spread to his brain, lungs and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 world professional road race champion was suddenly
confronted with a race whose prize was life, rather than a colorful
cycling jersey. After several surgeries, intense chemotherapy and
intense perseverance, he was rendered free of cancer in 1997. His
turbulent, but ultimately successful, return to professional racing
represents an intensely emotional triumph of modern oncology,
competitive endurance athletics and the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As a pediatric oncologist at Cook Children's Medical Center and
a competitive Texas cyclist for 10 years, I have a unique insight
into some of the factors that may have led to this incredible
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be competitive, cyclists must adopt a complete lifestyle
of sacrifice and intelligent and intense training.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has mastered these traits. He didn't win the Tour de
France because of luck, happenstance or some ill-defined genetic
talent, but because of his ability to intensify his athletic
lifestyle traits. In fact, Armstrong's victory over cancer and his
rise to the pinnacle of cycling are inseparably, and marvelously,
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Cycling helped him win his battle with cancer, and cancer helped
him win the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had more than modern medical care on his side in his
fight with cancer; he had the personal traits he has used for all
of his athletic life. The human spirit and the will to live are
poorly understood but thought to play at least some positive role
in the care of the cancer victim.
</P>
<P>
   As an oncologist who cares for young people, I see many of the
same traits in adolescents and young adults fighting cancer that
professional cyclists and other star athletes have: persistence,
willingness to sacrifice certain life pleasures and the ability to
endure discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   And his comeback from testicular cancer to win the Tour de
France will leave more of an enduring legacy for the cacer
community than it will for cycling and sport in general. Perhaps
this will be Lance's biggest victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong created a foundation in 1997 to help others who must
walk (or cycle) down the same cancer path as he has. The Lance
Armstrong Foundation has become a premier organization in the quest
to promote public and medical profession cancer awareness and
education, testicular-cancer research and the mission of ``cancer
survivorship.''
</P>
<P>
   A special focus for Armstrong and the foundation is improving
life after cancer treatment. Persons fortunate enough to survive
the cancer experience are often faced with very important medical
and psychological issues. My colleagues and I at the Hematology &AMP;
Oncology Center at Cook Children's Medical Center are working in
partnership with the foundation to create a unique cancer
survivorship clinic focused on after-therapy care.
</P>
<P>
   That clinic will be one more victory for Armstrong, a
world-class champion of cycling and the cancer world. / nn

DODGERS FALL TO PHILLIES IN 11 INNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ So you're a Los Angeles Dodgers fan who just got
back from a four-month jetaway in Malaysia, or Fiji, or maybe you
were hangin' out on a private island. There was no SportsCenter, no
way to follow baseball and you were wondering about the Boys in
Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than perusing old newspapers to understand why the team
that was going to the playoffs in six weeks is instead going home
soon, look no further than the Dodgers' 6-5, 11-inning loss to
Philadelphia on Saturday for all the signs of a disastrous season
rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' 68th loss in 123 games had so many elements present
in so many other games they've frittered away that it does fine as
a poster child.
</P>
<P>
   For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _A solid start by Ismael Valdes (6 innings pitched, two runs)
was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   _The Dodgers were 3 for 14 with runners in scoring position, and
all three hits came in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   _They counted on one inning, a five-run eighth in which Todd
Hundley drove in three with a double, and did nothing else
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   _Given a lead late, the bullpen lost for the 18th time. The
Dodgers' 12-18 mark in the bullpen is the worst winning percentage
(.400) in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   _They lost in extra innings, something they've done 11 times in
15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   _They followed up an emotional, come-from-behind win with seven
innings of malaise and wasted opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _And they had the opportunity to move up in the standings,
albeit to third instead of somewhere substantial, and blew it.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in a few off-field distractions and you have the 1999
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's frustrating, to have a three-run lead and can't hold
it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Pete (Pedro Borbon)
walks a guy, gives up a homer and gets the tough guy out. That's
the way it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what losing baseball _ Dodgers baseball _ is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Though Borbon and Alan Mills, two of the more-reliable relievers
this season, played a big part in this, the loss is more than the
duo combining for two outs, three walks and three runs while
failing to hold a 5-2 lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Mills had allowed one run and two hits in his last 72/3 innings.
Borbon's the one having problems. With Rico Brogna's (five RBI)
two-run homer, Borbon has given up nine runs in 11 innings and has
a 7.60 ERA in his last 18 outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself, right now, an average reliever,'' Borbon
said. ``I have to come out of it and do better. I'm just hurting
the team. My stuff is as good or better than it was at the
beginning of the season. I'm not hitting my corners and I'm making
dumb pitches. That comes from the little doubt in your mind, which
you have when you don't have your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's more than closer Jeff Shaw coming in to get the final
four outs, only to give up a double to pinch-hitter Rob Ducey on a
two-strike pitch in the eighth, though he played a role in the
Dodgers' 45th loss in 74 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an 0-2 pitch, and 0-2 pitches are not supposed to be
hit,'' Shaw said. ``It's a mistake. It's something that shouldn't
happen. It's 0-2. I have to make a pitch out of the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the loss and blame for the season falls all throughout
the clubhouse. And though the Dodgers' bullpen was battered for
four runs in five innings, there were also squandered chances by
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable was in the 10th when the first two Dodgers walked.
They then stood there for a pair of strikeouts before Mark
Grudzielanek grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 2-0, and I told Rick Dempsey down in the pen, `We
got them right where we want them,' `' Shaw said. ``I thought we
would come back and we did, and then we didn't capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Dodgers opponents, the Phillies eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   There. Now, you're caught up on the last 4{ months.

HUNTER WINS WORLD TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones normally garners the majority of
the attention in her marriage to shot putter C.J. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, however, it was Hunter's turn to bask in the
spotlight after winning the shot put on the opening day of the
World Championships. Hunter unleashed a personal-best 71 feet, 6
inches on his sixth and final attempt to earn his first world title
before a crowd of 20,104.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the defending World 100-meter champion, also earned a
place in the record books in the women's 100-meter preliminaries.
In a second-round heat, the nine-time state champion from Thousand
Oaks High clocked a championship- record 10.76 seconds en route to
a world-season best.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, also posted an automatic qualifying jump in the long
jump preliminaries of 22-4\ for the third-best mark to advance to
Monday's final. Jones, who is seeking an unprecedented four gold
medals, will also run in the 200 meters and either the 400- and
1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragilia captured the first gold medal for the United
States in the nine-day competition, equaling her record of 15-1 in
the inaugural World Championship women's pole vault competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's shot put, Hunter, 30, who was third in the 1997
World Championships, yelled, thrust both arms into the air and
pounded his fists on his chest after his winning toss. The effort
moved him from second to first and past runner-up Oliver Sven-Buder
of Germany (70-3{).
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is the third consecutive American to win the event. John
Godina, the 1999 world-leader at 72-3, won the shot put in 1995 and
1997 but finished eighth at 66-9\ after fouling on five of his six
attempts. The bid ended the UCLA alum and former NCAA champion's
bid to become the first man to win world titles in the shot put and
discus in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Bagach of the Ukraine, who was stripped of his gold
medal in 1997 after testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine,
was third at 69-9. Andy Bloom of the U.S. was fourth at 68-8}.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get in the ring and do everything I possibly
could to win,'' Hunter said. ``I didn't want to (do it
halfheartedly). You have to come here with everything you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones certainly did not hold anything back in her quarterfinal
triumph. Running into a 0.3-meter-per-second headwind in the
women's 100 meters, Jones dipped under her leading mark of 10.80,
which she ran at Lausanne and London this summer. Jones, who won
her first-round heat in 11.22 on Saturday morning, was among four
athletes to dip under 11 seconds in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller, a member of the U.S. 1996 Olympic gold-medalist,
400-meter relay, won her heat in a personal-best 10.86 seconds.
Gail Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic 100-meter champion, also
advanced to today's semifinals despite finishing fourth in 11.10
for the 12th-best time.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won her quarterfinal by three-tenths of a second despite
running in lane 5 with two lanes vacant from scratched competitors.
Despite a false start and facing elimination with a second, Jones
was the first out of the blocks on the second start. She said she
was pushed to a fast performance watching Miller and the other
quick quarterfinalists' times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat back and watched the other girls,'' Jones said. ``... I
decided I was going to join the club. I could not have asked for a
better atmosphere. The weather was great and the track was fast.
Watch for some world records here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was keeping an eye on her husband in the shot put
competition after completing her events Saturday. The two made eye
contact throughout the competition. Hunter said Jones' support
helped him rebound after fouls on two of his four attempts to move
into second at 69-2{ on his fifth-round put.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was her coach and mine, and they were all rooting for
me,'' Hunter said. ``We'll celebrate when we go back to the hotel
and then it's back to work. We'll celebrate again (at the
Olympics).''
</P>
<P>
   Shelia Burrell of Reseda, a Cal State Northridge assistant
coach, is 13th after the first day of the heptathlon with 3,643
points. Burrell turned in the top mark in the 200 at 23.52 and had
the second-best mark in the 100-meter hurdles of 13.28 to start the
competition but was well short of her best in the high jump,
managing a clearance of 5-5\. Eunice Barber of France leads Denise
Lewis by a point, 3,994 to 3,993, heading into the second and final
day.

WEAVER LIFTS TIGERS OVER ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Detroit Tigers are 27 games out of first
place. They have the worst record in the American League. But Jeff
Weaver was feeling pennant-race sized prickles on his arms Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 friends and family members in attendance, the
Simi Valley High graduate tossed seven shutout innings and won for
the first time since May 27 as the Tigers beat the Anaheim Angels
5-0 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Tigers and Angels are 49 games out of first place.
At this point they aren't even playing for pride so as much as
trying to salvage what little they have remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver didn't have to search far for his incentive. With his
parents in attendance for the first time since his major-league
debut April 14, the 1998 No. 1 draft choice allowed three hits and
struck out a career-high seven to snap a 13-start winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver (7-9) began the season by winning six of his first nine
starts, but then he hit the skids. He lost six consecutive
decisions during his drought and watched his ERA over that span
bloom to 7.39.
</P>
<P>
   But against the worst offense in the majors, Weaver looked
unhittable. He allowed just three singles, walked two and hit a
batter. Only one Angel, Orlando Palmeiro, got as far as second
base.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were shut out for the 10th time this season. Only the
Tigers (11) have been blanked more times.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn failed to match Weaver,
surrendering a run in the third inning and losing his composure in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler (Taft High/Moorpark College) led off with a single,
was sacrificed to second, moved to third on a deep fly ball and
scored when a high Washburn pitcher went off the tip of catcher
Matt Walbeck's glove for a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's second start of the season turned into a meltdown in
the fourth. He gave up two singles and a double, then issued
four-pitch walks to Damion Easley and Bill Haselman _ all before
recording an out.
</P>
<P>
   The second of those walks forced home the Tigers' third run and
drove Washburn (0-2) from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Al Levine turned in a heroic effort to get out of the
jam, inducing a pop-up from Kapler, striking out Kimera Bartee and
getting Gregg Jefferies to fly out to end the inning and strand all
three inherited runners.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels like the fact that Washburn is young, left-handed and
can throw three pitches _ fastball, curve, changeup. But he hasn't
escaped the fourth inning in either of his two starts this year,
and his ERA has risen to 8.56.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a nightmare for normally sure-handed Angels
shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who committed a career-high three errors.
He bounced a throw in the first inning and committed a pair of
gaffes in the eighth: throwing wide to the bag on a Juan
Encarnacion grounder and taking a potential double-play ball off
his chest, loading the bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had committed nine errors in his first 51 games this
season and made 14 errors all of last year. The three errors were
the most by an Angel since shortstop Spike Owen committed three
against Texas on Aug. 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson pinch-hit for DiSarcina leading off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds provided a few highlight splices in the field.
Proving again that his defensive instincts are as sharp as ever, he
sprinted to make an over-the-shoulder catch of a deep Jefferies fly
ball in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds struck again in the fifth when Dean Palmer hit what
looked to be a sure double off the center-field wall. Edmonds
played the carom perfectly, caught it bare-handed and made a strong
throw to DiSarcina covering second base. Palmer, expecting to coast
into second base, was startled when DiSarcina received the throw
and tagged him out.

NO LETDOWN FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Letdowns are a part of any sport and it would
have been easy for the Los Angeles Galaxy to suffer one Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With the hapless New York/New Jersey Metrostars in town and the
end of a grueling stretch of games in sight, the tendency to relax
seemed to be one of prime concern.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Galaxy of old _ the one from the first games of the
season _ might have let it happen, but this group wouldn't have any
part of such notions, dominating the MetroStars 4-1 in front of
12,045 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they've been having a down streak, so sometimes it's
hard to get motivated for a team like that,'' said Zak Ibsen, who
scored his second and third goals of the season. ``But we came out
with the intensity in the first 10 minutes trying to get a couple
of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 10th in 12 MLS games for the Galaxy, which
has moved within a regulation win (three points) of catching
Western Conference-leading Colorado. The conference leaders play
one another twice over the final nine regular-season games, the
first coming Sept. 18 in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars, meanwhile, tied a league record for futility
with their ninth consecutive loss. They join New England, which has
set the mark twice.
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts of L.A. overlooking N.Y./N.J. ended when the Galaxy
struck in the eighth minute. Greg Vanney curled a left-footed
corner kick into the middle of the box that forward Carlos
Hermosillo headed down and into the left corner for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, who missed the Galaxy's previous four MLS games
because of a lower-back strain, scored his second of the game in
the 59th minute. He now has six goals in seven matches.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes later, L.A. pushed the lead to 2-0 when Cobi Jones
chipped across the defense to an onrushing Ibsen on the right side.
Ibsen snuck behind defender Billy Walsh and met Jones' loft at the
perfect moment, sending a right-footed volley into the middle of
the net that gave Metrostars' goalkeeper Mike Ammann had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen's second goal came in the 88th minute, and it was
extremely similar to his first. He took a cross from Vanney _ the
defender's third assist of the night _ and after a bounce fired
another blast past Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   Jones assisted on the second Hermosillo goal with some quality
work on the right flank before chipping to the middle, setting the
table for the Mexican striker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly scoring two goals early made the game easier, but we
also talked about this game putting us within three points of first
place,'' Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``Plus, I told the guys
they get two days off if they won. I think maybe they wanted the
two days off more than the three points.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a lot worse for the MetroStars had the Galaxy
converted several other quality chances, including a header by Paul
Caligiuri that was tipped off the crossbar by Ammann and two shots
by Jones from in deep.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars did have good chances on semi-breakaways by Henry
Zambrano _ two in the first half and one in the second, which
displeased Schmid _ but the Colombian pushed two of them wide with
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman making a point-blank save on the other.
</P>
<P>
   N.Y./N.J. scored in the 72nd minute on a penalty kick by Mark
Chung after he was fouled in the box by Steve Jolley.

AFTER PRISON, A NEW VIEW FOR McCOWAN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Howard McCowan sits in his Public Policy and
Management 225 class, he listens to other USC students talk about
changing the world. From his experience, he knows life isn't how it
is portrayed in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell them, `It's not like that. This is bull,' ''
the 27-year-old McCowan said.
</P>
<P>
   He's past the point of dreams. He's not like his younger, more
idealistic classmates. Almost seven years of prison changes a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that I'm separate. That has something to do with my
experiences,'' McCowan said. ``I don't know if it will ever leave
me. That's just the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-year absence, McCowan is a USC student again. He
savors every minute in a classroom. It's almost as precious as his
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of all the kids who come out of incarceration
and never approach the idea of going to college, let alone USC,
it's incredible,'' USC athletic director Mike Garrett said. ``He's
one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 McCowan was a part-time starter at free safety for the
Trojans and made 30 tackles as a redshirt freshman. He figured the
NFL would be a natural progression in his athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   But he never played pro football, or even finished playing at
USC.
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, 1991, McCowan went out with teammate Marcel Brown
and Brown's friend, Garlyn Coleman, to pick up a videotape at the
home of USC wide receiver Johnnie Morton in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   They never made it to Morton's, instead driving to Westwood
where they went on a one-night robbery spree that led to McCowan
spending 6{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   McCowan, who said he never personally robbed any of the victims,
said it wasn't about the money. It just happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, you have a lot of energy. The night it took
place, it wasn't planned. It wasn't choreographed,'' McCowan said.
``My motivation wasn't to rob anybody or hurt anybody. It was
something physical and something extremely exciting. It was
criminal but it was physically exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, several victims were beaten up; one
had his nose broken when he was pushed facedown into the sidewalk,
and was briefly unconscious. Victims were robbed of their automatic
teller cards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead investigators was former LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman,
who later became famous in the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My anger came from a lot of different areas,'' McCowan said.
``There were things in my personal life I wasn't too happy about. I
would get into fights. I was destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did he do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything looked hunky-dory to someone on the outside. I was
19. I was at a major university,'' McCowan said. ``Frustration and
anger were my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   With his football career over and a lengthy prison sentence
ahead, it would have been easy for McCowan to become just another
failure in the world of college sports, a lawbreaker who would
never amount to much.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   McCowan is back at USC, earning a 3.5 grade-point average last
fall and a 3.25 in the spring semester. By next May, he hopes to
receive his diploma. His transcript will show he attended USC from
1989-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm accomplishing any great feat,'' McCowan
said. ``I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I think I'm
blessed. I had a few people who cared about my well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   McCowan credits his mother, Thelma, and former USC athletic
director Mike McGee as being instrumental in his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   While he was serving his sentence at Wasco State Prison, about
130 miles north of Los Angeles, McCowan received a visit from McGee
_ the only visitor from USC that McCowan ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was harsh,'' McGee said of his visit to Wasco. ``You go in
there and go through all of the steps to go inside the fence. Here
was Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee made a promise to McCowan: If he could demonstrate he was
interested in academics and stay out of trouble, USC would honor
his athletic scholarship when he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had failed Howard and that we needed to provide
him an opportunity,'' McGee said. ``Howard came to USC as a good
student and we did not keep an eye on things as close as we
should've.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for McCowan. While still in prison he began
taking correspondence courses from UC Berkeley, although he had
never read a book in its entirety before being incarcerated. During
his first stint at USC, his grades were C's and D's.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother wanted him to stay clean and go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved (USC) for allowing my boy a second chance,''
Thelma McCowan said. ``I was willing to spend whatever I had on
him. I felt he made a mistake but he had never been in trouble
before.''
</P>
<P>
   McCowan also began writing some short plays in prison, which he
likes to call ``mini-novels.''
</P>
<P>
   And he stayed out of trouble. Most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into a lot of fights,'' McCowan said. ``I don't know if
it got me into trouble or got me out of trouble. I went to prison
when I was 19. I was still angry. I needed something to identify
with. Guys I knew from the neighborhood or guys who knew guys I
knew. We started to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   McCowan hung out with gang members, many of whom he grew up with
in Carson. But he also completed his courses and remembered McGee's
promise.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, 1997, McCowan was released from prison. Gaining his
freedom was not the end of his troubles, however, as McCowan
discovered a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 30 days, I had a big fear they would come get me and
take me back,'' McCowan said. ``I know for a fact I couldn't do it
again. Seven years is seven years no matter how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me six months to get my personality back, to laugh and
joke. I used to be an upbeat personality. For some reason, that's
been dulled.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee had since moved on to become the athletic director at
South Carolina, although Garrett, now the AD, upheld McGee's offer.
</P>
<P>
   McCowan attended El Camino College in the spring and summer of
1998 before re-enrolling at USC. His progress was monitored by Fred
Stroock, who is Garrett's special assistant for academic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he got out, he had to prove himself at a JC, which he
did,'' Stroock said. ``I had to believe this is a student worth
taking a chance on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the fall semester beginning next month, McCowan is unsure
of what he will do after graduation. He's interested in criminal
justice and he's considering a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   McGee will be there when McCowan gets his diploma and beyond _
McGee said he will help McCowan in obtaining his master's, possibly
at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I put it all in the past and everything is
fine,'' McCowan said. ``I've got a lot of mental struggles, and for
the most part, I've overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure when it's all said and done, I will have experienced
life at its highest and its lowest.''

TAKING SECOND LOOK AT FIRST-ROUNDERS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It used to be the precious stone of trade talks, the
diamond that elevated any discussion to serious status. You
mentioned a first-rounder in a deal and it was big news. Not now.
What we are seeing instead is the plummeting of a formerly sacred
bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' said Garry St. Jean, general manager of
the Golden State Warriors. ``This year, I've seen as many
first-rounders moved as I can remember. What I'm wondering is if
there is another part to some of these deals that don't make the
newspaper or the talk show. You know, some of these first-rounders
are probably protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``protected'' first-rounder is also a 1990s fad. Too many
teams have watched their traded first-rounders turn into All-Stars,
so they specify that the pick has top three, top five, or lottery
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This month alone, Atlanta traded two first-rounders to the
Clippers for Lorenzen Wright and not many people flinched. The Suns
traded two first-rounders, Danny Manning, and Pat Garrity to the
Magic for Penny Hardaway; many people in the NBA still don't
believe the Magic got enough. The Hawks had four first-rounders
going into the draft and didn't want them. The Celtics gave up
their 1999 first-rounder for Vitaly Potapenko, who never has
started for a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Does this confirm that players aren't as good as they once were?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' said Ernie Grunfeld, the former Knicks GM
now with Milwaukee. ``You have a lot of teams with different draft
philosophies now. Some teams feel they can trade a pick because
their rosters are locked. But some teams still like young
players.''
</P>
<P>
   They may like them, but not many teams cling to draft picks with
the idea that they may have the rights to the next Larry Bird or
Michael Jordan. The Magic have an arsenal of first-rounders in
central Florida _ 10 over the next five years. That means
something, but not nearly as much as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can point out the great players in the draft we just
had,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said, ``then you're a better man
than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said that after he traded one of his 1997 first-rounders
(Ron Mercer) to Denver for a package that included cash, players,
and, naturally, a first-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He should be covered in the business pages rather than the
sports pages. He is talked about as if he were a trendy stock
option on the Internet. Going up or down? Staying or going? Those
are always the central issues when the subject is Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Walker Stock Market was cool last spring, but it became more
active at the beginning of this summer. That's when there was a
lively discussion between Walker and a Celtics assistant coach in
Chicago. Walker apparently was more upset with the assistant's
boss, Pitino, than with the assistant himself. The dispute centered
around Walker's and Pitino's dramatically different interpretations
of what ``offseason'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's talk that Walker will be traded after the season.
What are we to make of this stock?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this talk about Antoine being traded is pure
speculation,'' said Mike Higgins, Walker's agent. ``I'll be shocked
if he is traded. People have all kinds of things to say, but no one
has talked to Antoine. He hasn't said anything. He's just getting
ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been playing in an informal Chicago summer league,
which features several Bulls and pros from the area (Tim Hardaway,
Juwan Howard, Michael Finley). During one game a few weeks ago,
Walker went for 47 points. He won't be asked to score that much for
the Celtics, but with Mercer's offense gone Walker will need to be
a consistent scorer. If he stays.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of job that has you celebrating 20 percent success
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about how often you can make a trade work,'' St. Jean
said. ``I don't know if fans realize it, but out of every 10 trades
we talk about, eight of them don't work. You go home with a sense
of despair or you go home feeling euphoric.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean experienced that last week when he thought he had a
chance of acquiring Mitch Richmond. Instead, the former Warrior
re-signed with the Wizards. ``I'm not going to hide that we were
trying to do some things,'' said St. Jean, who used to coach
Richmond in Sacramento. ``We were going to need creativity to pull
it off, but I thought we had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the kind of job that plays mental tricks on you. You
feel like you should be wearing a uniform, but you look in the
mirror and you're wearing a button-down with a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel a different kind of competition,'' Grunfeld said.
``It's the kind of competition that goes on behind a desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans believe that they could be NBA GMs. Especially after
examining some of the trades/signings of the past couple weeks. A
few examples of questionable GM behavior:
</P>
<P>
   --Clippers sign Tyrone Nesby and Eric Piatkowski to contracts.
</P>
<P>
   What's So Bad About It: Most people would take Nesby and
Piatkowski on their teams, but the Clippers overpaid for them. They
could have had both of them for a total of $4 million; they wound
up paying nearly twice as much as they had to.
</P>
<P>
   But Here's What Scares Other GMs: A frontcourt of Lamar Odom,
Michael Olowokandi, and Maurice Taylor. That's one of the most
promising threesomes in the league. But the Clippers' problem never
has been accumulating talent. They've had trouble keeping it.
</P>
<P>
   --Hawks sign Chris Crawford to a seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   What's So Bad About It: Seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But Here's What Scares Other GMs: The Hawks got younger,
quicker, and bigger without giving up Dikembe Mutombo. They added
point guard Jason Terry, guards Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, and
power forward/center Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   --Raptors sign Michael Stewart to $24 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   What's So Bad About It: It had absolutely nothing to do with
basketball. In exchange for Stewart signing a one-year contract
last season, the Raptors agreed to give him a six-year deal later.
So a man who last year scored less than a hoop a game and grabbed
just over two rebounds now makes $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Here's What Scares Other GMs: Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady
being surrounded by yet another veteran, Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   --Nuggets acquire Mercer (who may not sign with them), Popeye
Jones, and Dwayne Schintzius and give up a first-rounder and cash
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   What's So Bad About It: They look silly if they don't trade
Mercer and he leaves at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Here's What Scares Other GMs: Mercer, Antonio McDyess, and
Raef LaFrentz on the same team. LaFrentz, who played in only 12
games last season, is playing again. Before suffering a torn
anterior cruciate ligament, he averaged 14 points and 7.6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Magic made yet another trade last week, this time sending
Manning and Dale Ellis to the Bucks for Armen Gilliam and Chris
Gatling. Gatling has two years left on his contract and Gilliam,
the man who recently traded the ``o'' in his first name for the
``e'' now there, has one year remaining. Because it will have so
much cap space in 2000, Orlando is being viewed as a major player
in the Tim Duncan Chase. The Bulls are in that category, too. But
it is doubtful that Duncan will leave San Antonio, especially since
there will be a new arena to replace the Alamodome. Still, it
wouldn't be a bad idea for the Spurs to sign Duncan to the
six-year, $73 million contract extension he is eligible for now
rather than allowing him to become a free agent . . . Now that
Hardaway is out of Magic Land, a few behind-the-scenes nuggets are
beginning to emerge from his final days with the Magic. One is that
there definitely was an apology to Hardaway from Magic chairman
Rich DeVos. After the Magic lost to the 76ers in the playoffs,
Hardaway complained about the team and DeVos responded with some
complaints of his own about Hardaway. The private apology came when
new coach Doc Rivers made it clear that he wanted the team to keep
Hardaway. But all the words were too late. The team desperately
tried to keep Hardaway before reluctantly agreeing to trade him to
the Suns . . . It is also known that Shaquille O'Neal asked
Hardaway to join the Lakers. The two have had their differences,
but they appear to be settled now . . . The easiest summary of
Scottie Pippen's desire to be a Laker: Phil Jackson would love to
have him; the West Coast Jerrys _ West and Buss _ aren't so sure .
. . Grunfeld was asked what he thought of the East. Which team does
he think is the early favorite? ``I think you have to go with the
defending Eastern Conference champs,'' he said. He was referring to
the Knicks, the team he built. Last week, Grunfeld managed to
praise the city and its ``extremely knowledgeable fans'' without
once mentioning Jeff Van Gundy and Dave Checketts . . . Grunfeld
traded for Latrell Sprewell and is now a GM in Sprewell's hometown.
The 6-foot-5-inch guard is a free agent after next season, but
don't expect the Bucks to get involved with him. They already have
Ray Allen at shooting guard and Glenn Robinson at small forward.
Ironically, St. Jean probably wouldn't mind having him back at
Golden State (the problem there was with P.J. Carlesimo; St. Jean
and Sprewell got along fine). But that won't happen, either . . .
We are still more than a month away from training camp, but three
rookies _ Atlanta's Terry, Charlotte's Baron Davis, and Phoenix's
Shawn Marion _ already are being discussed with excitement. The
Hornets say they like former Celtic David Wesley at point guard,
but he could be moved before the start of the season . . . Rest in
peace, Kim Perrot.

BENNETT LEARNING LEADERSHIP ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If he had been more vocal, Drew Bennett might have
been able to defuse the bomb that was dropped on the UCLA program
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Long before 16 of his teammates were busted for unlawful
possession of handicapped parking placards, Bennett knew what was
going on. He was outraged, but seethed in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want something to come between me and my teammates,''
Bennett said. ``It was not worth making enemies of people you have
to spend so much time with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has a chance to affect the season from here on. He is
front and (behind) center after spending two seasons as the
understudy for UCLA football's glamour role. He may not look or act
the part as it is usually cast, but we think he's perfect as the
Bruins' next starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He's tough and not just because he ran the L.A. Marathon one
year on a whim. Running 26.2 miles in basketball shoes was easy
compared to playing Bubby Brister to Cade McNown's John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett never complained. He just showed up every day and amazed
his teammates with his athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins were hit last year by a spate of injuries at
receiver, Bennett filled in nicely at that spot. He'll be playing
downs on both sides of the ball for at least the first two games
next month, until his suspended teammates return.
</P>
<P>
   The junior would sooner be struck by lightning than brag on
himself. So not many people beyond the cozy confines of Spaulding
Field know he is arguably the best athlete to grace UCLA since
Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who turns 21 on Thursday, can jump so high and run so
fast it doesn't seem possible he and Dan Marino were born to play
the same position.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, his friends and his coaches all say he's a rare
athletic specimen. Ask Bennett for confirmation and you get a
cackle.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind being the best athlete on the field. Bennett says
he's not even the best athlete in his family. He boasts about his
younger brother Richie and soon he's watering a patch of natural
grass with his tears.
</P>
<P>
   Richie, a sophomore at Cal, has cerebral palsy. He is confined
to a wheelchair but hardly confined by it. He is the Michael
Johnson of the wheelchair set, counting many 400-meter national
titles among his litany of achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all these plaques on his wall,'' Bennett said. ``He's
really amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett learned from his father Rick, who was Cal's leading
rusher as a sophomore in 1966, and he spent two years at McNown's
side. Yet all he knows about football he learned from Richie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned more from him than anybody,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The tears well up before he can continue. He squats down, takes
a couple of deep breaths, then completes his thought in a near
whisper, ``Just his joy in doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment it's so obvious how blessed Bennett is. Never
mind his physical gifts, he sees what so many others altogether
miss. Namely, that happiness is a state of mind and not something
gained from starring or even starting.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Bennett is back on the field for a scrimmage that
will help determine whether he or redshirt freshman Cory Paus will
succeed McNown when the Bruins open their season Sept.4 against
Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   No one is questioning Bennett's grasp of the offense. His
mechanics are the issue. If he were consistently throwing the same
tight spirals he did as a freshman, the same tight spirals he
unleashes in this scrimmage, UCLA head coach Bob Toledo would have
one less headache in this migraine of a summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett completes 4 of 5 passes for 50 yards and sounds
inordinately relieved for someone set to inherit the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I played well,'' he said. ``It's been a long
week.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of pressure, to be sure. To the victor go the
spoils: campus-wide acclaim, national attention, all the prettiest
girls.
</P>
<P>
   None of which matters to Bennett, who already has a lovely
girlfriend, Margie, dear friends and no discernible ego in need of
stroking.
</P>
<P>
   What lights his fire is this: For two years he has put in his
time, paid his dues. He'd like to think he has earned this
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm maturing every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who started only one season at Miramonte High and then
walked on at UCLA, is pleading the case of dreamers and late
bloomers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be real upset if I'm not (named the starter) because I've
put a lot of time into this,'' he said, then added quickly: ``But
if anybody has to play above me, I'd pick Cory.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for wondering if Bennett will leave if he doesn't get
the starting job. Incoming freshman J.P. Losman surveyed the
competition at quarterback this past spring and took off for Tulane
without bothering to give UCLA campus life a try.
</P>
<P>
   It obviously takes more heat than that to drive Bennett from the
pocket. It's not as though he arrived in Westwood from his hometown
of Orinda and instantly felt welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers feeling plenty uncomfortable at first. He was a
non-scholarship player surrounded by highly recruited classmates,
all of whom seemed to know one another from high school all-star
games and recruiting visits.
</P>
<P>
   There were four quarterbacks ahead of Bennett in the beginning.
The three directly behind McNown may have had more promise but none
had Bennett's patience.
</P>
<P>
   He persevered and before he knew it he was being groomed to take
McNown's place some day.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his time is now.

A NEW TRADE FOR CARPENTER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bob Carpenter, who grew up here as ``The Can't Miss
Kid,'' stared retirement in the face for a second, saw all those
leisurely, laidback hours flash before his eyes, and, in so many
words, said, ``Can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, then, he is Coach Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not going into this with the aspirations that I
want to be a head coach,'' said the former St. John's Prep star,
reached last week, shortly after his decision to become an
assistant coach in Albany, the New Jersey Devils' AHL affiliate.
``I just knew I couldn't sit and do nothing _ I think that can be
dangerous for anyone _ and this is something to try, see how I feel
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, 36, broke into the league as an 18-year-old offensive
phenom after the Capitals made him the No. 3 choice in the '81
draft _ the highest an American had ever been drafted.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four seasons, he averaged 36 goals, collecting a
career-high 95 points in his fourth season in Landover. In the
early '90s, after stops in New York (Rangers), Los Angeles, and
Boston and a brief return to Washington, he reinvented himself as a
dogged checker in New Jersey and was a key to the Devils' winning
the Stanley Cup in '95.
</P>
<P>
   It was then-Devils coach Jacques Lemaire who taught Carpenter
the importance of being earnest without the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me realize what a great challenge the checking job can
be,'' said Carpenter. ``He basically said, `Look, you don't have to
score, you don't have to be out there on the power play _ just do
this job and you'll be fine.' I took it as a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still be an important part of the team. OK, maybe I
wouldn't be the guy who got the goal, but I could be the guy who
kept Mario Lemieux to no points, and that gave us the same chance
to win, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught me a lot about the game. And it taught me a lot of
respect for the guys who did that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's first real taste of checking came in '90, when he
was in Boston and the Bruins made it to the finals against the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Milbury threw me out there against Mark Messier and said,
`OK, check him,' '' said Carpenter. ``That was something different.
I loved my time in Boston. Those years, along with winning the Cup
in New Jersey . . . nothing beat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen NHL seasons behind him now, Carpenter moves on to his
new career. He'll work under a former Bruins assistant coach, John
Cunniff, and find out whether full-time work without a stick can be
as rewarding as lugging one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I'd never gone to New Jersey and retired after,
say, 12 years, I would have been a little bitter about the whole
experience,'' reflected Carpenter. ``I wouldn't have been on a Cup
winner. And people forget, the money didn't really improve until
the start of the '90s. Before then, people thought if you signed,
say, a four-year deal worth $1 million, you were set for life.
That's nuts. Not if you want to put your kids through school, buy a
car when you need one. It doesn't go that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky. The tail end of my career just made it to when
the money was good'' _ he made just under $1 million in each of his
last two seasons _ ``and that helped a lot. It made it so I could
try something new like this without worrying too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, he's still living the ``Can't Miss'' life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cam Neely will be shuttling between Boston and Atlanta this
hockey season. The ex-Bruins power forward recently signed on with
the Atlanta-based PMT Corp., a credit card and check-verification
company, and he will assist the company's marketing and promotional
efforts _ with obligatory luxury box appearances at the new Philips
Arena, home of the Thrashers . . . Is Atlanta a hockey town?
Consider: The Thrashers will open in October with a season-ticket
base of 13,000. The NBA Hawks are believed to be down to about
5,000. There is an undeniable novelty factor built into the
Thrasher figure _ how many will hold on after a year or two? _ but,
remember, the Flames were doing very well at the gate before they
bolted for a sweetheart deal in Calgary . . . It doesn't look like
ex-BC Eagle Bill Guerin will be with the Oilers at the start of
training camp. Guerin made $1.5 million last season and is now a
Group 2 free agent, believed to be looking for $3.5 million or
better . . . Tony Twist will be rehabbing for the rest of this
calendar year after fracturing his pelvis and ankle when he smashed
up his motorcycle earlier this month. Twist's agent, Don Meehan:
``He's lucky to be alive.'' . . . Alexander Mogilny has to rate as
one of the league's most disappointing talents his last three years
with the Canucks. Long gone are his prolific days in Buffalo, where
in '92-93 he potted 76 goals with Pat LaFontaine dishing him the
biscuit. ``He's really a good kid,'' explained Canucks GM Brian
Burke. ``He doesn't like it when he's not playing well.'' In hopes
of igniting Mogilny's scoring touch, the Canucks this summer
obtained free agent Andrew Cassels, once one of Burke's Forever
.500s in Hartford. If it's the right pairing, perhaps the Canucks
finally will get some value from the trade that saw them send
Michael Peca, among others, to the Sabres in July '95 . . . Mario
Lemieux still hasn't closed his deal to buy the Penguins, and the
cash-strapped flightless birds needed creditors to infuse even more
money last week to say afloat. Lemieux's coterie of
lawyers/financial advisers continues to contend he'll get it done
(will they place a widow's walk atop the Igloo?). Eventually,
federal bankruptcy court will have to push the issue to resolution.
It's yet another example of how the legal and financial systems of
America operate with a different set of rules (read: bend
shamelessly) when dealing with pro sports franchises . . . How
about Derek Plante, once deemed so valuable in Buffalo that the
Sabres could loan him to Team USA for the '94 Olympics, taking a
pay cut ($1 million down to $750,000) with Dallas? He barely
figured in the Stars' plans en route to winning the Cup. But he's
still gainfully employed, at a price that not long ago was
considered exceptional money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons Dominik Hasek decided to announce his
retirement (effective next spring) in the middle of this summer: He
had a book, written in Czech, about to be released, and the last
chapter revealed his plan to call it quits after '99-00. His agent,
Rich Winter, talked him out of quitting prior to this season.
Hasek, still summering in Pardubice, underwent a 40-minute hernia
repair in Germany last week, too . . . The Lightning must have
pushed the patience of the Players' Association when management
paid for ice time all last week and invited anyone on the roster to
enter the voluntary workouts, with GM Rick Dudley and head coach
Steve Ludzik watching rinkside. Anyone truly fighting for a job _
which is about 98.7 percent of the Bolts' roster _ had to feel the
pressure to lace up the blades . . . Surprising end for Anders
Hedberg in Toronto. When Mike Smith's deal wasn't extended with the
Leafs, it appeared that Hedberg would be the GM, but team president
Ken Dryden handed GM duties to head coach Pat Quinn. Following all
this? Then Dryden hired Nick Beverley, an old Quinn pal from the LA
days, to oversee scouting and run the draft. Hedberg essentially
got the heave-ho and resigned, but he was handed his final year's
pay (about $275,000) as a parting gift. Hedberg exited saying he'll
hold on to the dream of one day running an NHL club. The league
would do well to add him to the Gary Bettman regime. He would be a
perfect ambassador between Manhattan and Europe, dealing with
international/Olympic issues . . . LA's top two lines, headed into
training camp, will be stocked with no fewer than three ex-Bruins.
Jozef Stumpel will be the pivot for Luc Robitaille and Ziggy
Palffy, while Bryan Smolinski and Glen Murray will work with Donald
Audette. The Bruins now have only Byron Dafoe on their roster to
show for the deals in which they lost Stumpel, Smolinski, and
Murray. Stumpel exited in the Dafoe-Dmitri Khristich swap.
Smolinski and Murray left in the Kevin Stevens-Shawn McEachern
exchange . . . The Islanders will enter battle this year with a
payroll of some $15 million _ about 25 cents on the dollar compared
with the Rangers. The disparity, on paper, is an embarrassment, and
there will be greater cause to blush brighter than the red line
when the acres of empty seats in Uniondale get flashed incessantly
on ``SportsCenter.'' Meanwhile, a potential buyer has surfaced.
Reportedly, Charles Koppelman, former owner of EMI Group North
America, has offered $185 million _ only $10 million less than what
the Islanders sold for last year. Bang the gavel and scream,
``Sold!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once-promising Bruins forward Jarmo Kekalainen was named the
Senators' director of player personnel, filling the spot vacated by
Marshall Johnston, now the GM. Kekalainen spent recent years as
Ottawa's European scout and also was GM of IFK Helsinki the last
four seasons . . . Where will the Bruins find those 29 goals that
left town when they issued Khristich ``walkaway'' free agency? Dave
Andreychuk is part of the answer. Two more candidates to keep in
mind: Joe Hulbig, the former Oiler signed as a free agent this
summer, and Jeff Zehr, a former Islander prospect who also signed
as a free agent in the offseason. Hulbig was the 13th pick in the
'92 draft, and the Islanders took Zehr 31st overall in '97. None of
those three alone could be expected to equal Khristich's
production, but two of the three should make up for much of the
loss . . . Top Calgary prospect Robyn Regehr just began working out
last week after having both his legs broken in an automobile crash
earlier this summer. The 6-foot-2-inch defenseman lost 25 pounds
soon after the accident but already has gained half of that back.
Regehr was the 19th pick in the '98 draft, the spot Boston handed
to Colorado for the Landon Wilson-Anders Myrvold acquisitions. The
Avalanche then handed Regehr to the Flames for their short-term
rental of Theo Fleury (now another multimillionaire Manhattanite) .
. . Dave King won't be behind the Canadiens bench, aiding head
coach Alain Vigneault this season. King, who failed to land a head
coaching job elsewhere, now will head up the Habs' scouting efforts
in Europe, setting up shop in Germany or the Czech Republic. His
mission: find older, non-draft-eligible players who could help
immediately . . . Think Peter Blute could land a job with the NHL,
maybe as the guy designated to fill the Cup with champagne each
spring? Sounds like a Moet moment to me. In the offseason, he could
book player cruises.

REID'S EYE AGAIN THE FOCAL POINT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The prevailing strategy when fighting World Boxing
Association super welterweight champion David Reid is to attack his
left eye because of an odd ailment that causes the lid to drop down
like a window shade as a fight progresses.
</P>
<P>
   According to his promoters, this condition is a reaction to the
bright television lights at ringside, although many of Reid's
opponents claim it's a result of being hit too often under those
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Reid eventually begins to look like Moshe
Dayan in boxing trunks, which cannot make his job any easier
despite his protests to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has had this malady since the 1996 Olympics, when his
bashful eye seemed to be permanently winking at opponents. A
knockout victory in the gold medal match, a world title after only
11 professional fights, and several operations have done nothing to
change this vexing problem for the undefeated Reid (13-0), and it
is a constant topic of conversation whenever a fight approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday, he will be in with former World Boxing Council
154-pound champion Keith Mullings, a tough man not averse to
punching an opponent in his weak spot, wherever it may be. Yet
Mullings insists he will take a different approach to Reid when
they meet at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to exploit any weaknesses,'' Mullings said from his
training camp. ``If his eye is a problem, I'm going to hit him in
it. But what I'd really like to do is shut the other eye first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the best thing, I would think. If one eye isn't
working, you shut the good eye and let the bad one take care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullings raises a good point, but Reid offers a reasonable
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been this way since I turned pro,'' said Reid. ``It
doesn't bother my vision, and I'm glad it don't. If it did, I
wouldn't have won the title.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily so, but it makes for a good argument.
Reid has not knocked anyone down in over a year, for example, yet
he has visited the canvas several times himself. Some will say the
latter is a result of not being able to see right hands coming at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Reid's performances have suffered of late,
and boxing people who had been hyping a big-money match with former
Olympic teammate Fernando Vargas, holder of the International
Boxing Federation version of the title, now wonder whether Reid
will survive long enough to get to him. Not surprisingly, Mullings
(16-5-1, 11 KOs) is first among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reid has all the potential to be one of the best boxers in the
world, but today's not the day,'' Mullings said. ``With the number
of fights he's had, he hasn't grown with the skills he has yet, so
a lot of guys pose a problem to him. Hopefully, I'll be able to
exploit and take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Mullings will try to take advantage of that lazy
eyelid, but the former champion believes the new champion's true
weakness actually lies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm going to be testing is his chin,'' Mullings promised.
``His chin is more suspect than his eye. Sure, I'll hit him in his
eye. But I'll hit him in his nose and his ear and his throat,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   To this, Reid replied, ``I could tell from his demeanor he's
very high on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the type of measured response people have grown
accustomed to hearing from Reid, who has become famous for his
controlled approach to life. Yet he knows what hangs in the balance
next weekend and cannot ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the big-money payday with Vargas that HBO is
already plotting, and then, possibly, a bigger one with Oscar De La
Hoya if the present welterweight champion gets by Felix Trinidad
and successfully pursues the WBC version of the junior middleweight
title in December, as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all that's at stake, Reid would have good reason to
be worrying about his eyelid's cooperation, Mullings's opposition,
and the widely held proposition that he needs a spectacular victory
to get back on the same pedestal on which Vargas is now perched
after a one-sided manhandling of another ex-champion, Raul Marquez,
last month.
</P>
<P>
   To this, Reid responds the way his eye does to TV lights. He
nods off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'd love a knockout, but the name of the game is
winning, not how you win,'' Reid said. ``You gotta get the win the
best way you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's with an eye wide shut.
</P>

   Here's how hot De La Hoya-Trinidad has become in Puerto Rico:
They're trying to show it in prison. Hector Figueroa, a longtime
closed-circuit operator in Puerto Rico, got the government to pay
$30,000 to have the fight shown live in four prisons in exchange
for Trinidad saying a few words before the broadcast to encourage
the prisoners. It was all set up until Trinidad's father got wind
of it and balked, although the deal still could go through . . .
With 55 percent of the people in Puerto Rico living below the
poverty line, local politicians are cutting deals with Figueroa to
buy the broadcast and have it piped into homes, a case of boxing
striking a blow for politics. Figueroa is hoping combined
pay-per-view and closed-circuit sales will reach $2 million, which
would shatter the previous Puerto Rican sales record of $200,000 .
. . Orlin Norris has agreed to fight Mike Tyson for $800,000 and
has been told it's 95 percent set he'll be Tyson's opponent on Oct.
23. That's also the first night of the World Series, but Showtime
is ready to go through with it. The problem remains Tyson, who has
not signed the contract . . . Strawweight champion Ricardo Lopez
packs on 3 more pounds to venture up to junior flyweight and
challenge IBF champion Will Grigsby Oct. 2 at the MGM Grand. Lopez,
one of the littlest men in boxing, fills in for one of the biggest,
Tyson, who had been penciled in for a fight but now will not appear
before Oct. 16. On the same card, Julio Cesar Chavez launches
another American comeback vs. veteran Willie Wise. It would be
wiser for him to forget the whole idea. But he won't . . . After a
recent rash of out-of-the-ring problems for high-profile fighters,
HBO is considering adding a morals clause to its long-term
contracts with champions. The recent arrests of Vargas and
heavyweight contender Ike Ibeabuchi convinced some HBO executives
that the cable giant needs more protection from the properties it
does business with . . . By the way, have you seen any of the
apologists and ``friends'' of Ibeabuchi lately, now that he needs
$2 million in bail money to get himself out of jail in Las Vegas?
The guys who were pushing him into boxing rings when he needed to
be pushed into a psychiatrist's office don't seem so helpful or
concerned about him now, which is why he's likely to stay in a
Clark County jail cell until a hearing Wednesday on sexual assault
charges. Ibeabuchi's bail was reduced from $5 million, but there
were no takers because everyone in boxing believes they've seen the
last of him for a while. Hence the end of a beautiful friendship .
. . Boxing lost a good friend, and Main Events lost a straight guy
when chief operating officer Mike Boorman opted recently to leave
the company rather than continue to endure the backbiting and
infighting of the Duva clan over control of the organization. Word
is that Dino Duva, who left for personal reasons months ago, wants
back in and along with his sister, Donna, and father, Lou, is
trying to buy out the company's owner, Kathy Duva, wife of Dino's
late brother, Dan. Turns out that when Dan formed Main Events and
Monitor Promotions, he cut his brother and sister in for 30 percent
each of the profits, leaving him with 40 percent. What they didn't
know was that that is all they were cut in on. Word is, after Dan's
death they learned that the company was left to a trust controlled
by Duva's wife and his longtime attorney, Pat English. Dino and
Donna believed all along they controlled 60 percent of the stock
along with the profits, but it turns out they were left with no
voting power, and the mess degenerated into a family feud that has
made it difficult to do business. Boorman, who is married to Lou
Duva's youngest daughter, chose to leave boxing for a teaching
career, something he had been considering for several years. That's
education's gain and boxing's loss. Unfortunately for the Duvas,
his departure leaves Main Events without the most capable member of
the family to run the business. Where they go from here is anyone's
guess, but either Dino, Donna, and Lou buy out Kathy or a
remarkable 15-year rags-to-riches success story comes to a sad end
sooner rather than later . . . Two-time world champion Kennedy
McKinney goes back into action Saturday at the Grand Casino in
Mississippi vs. Mario Diaz in a 10-round junior featherweight fight
McKinney hopes will get him back into the Naseem Hamed sweepstakes
. . . Ivan Robinson learned what happens when you lose a fight.
He's off HBO and back to ESPN2 Sept. 3 vs. Golden Johnson for the
vacant North American Boxing Federation lightweight title. Robinson
twice defeated Arturo Gatti but didn't fare as well against Angel
Manfredy, so it's back to the provinces. Johnson is 17-3-2 but
dangerous. Two of his losses came against Shane Mosley and Pito
Cardona, two of the best lightweights in the world. Mosley has
since moved to welterweight, and Cardona will fight for the vacant
IBF title later this year . . . WBC bantamweight champion Veerapol
Sahaprom (22-1) of Thailand defends his title next Sunday in Japan
vs. Joichiro Tatsuyoshi (17-5-1).

   Dariusz Michalczewski, the World Boxing Organization light
heavyweight champion, is making big money in Germany, but he's
growing weary of not getting the shot he wants _ a fight with Roy
Jones Jr. Michalczewski has made 15 consecutive defenses of his
title and is now 40-0 with 33 KOs. Although he'll make his 16th
defense against Montell Griffin Saturday in Bremen, Germany, it is
not Griffin who is on his mind. ``The time has come now, and Jones
must finally take me on,'' Michalczewski said recently from
Germany. ``The whole boxing world wants to see a fight between
Jones and me. We should fight as long as we are both on a winning
streak. There are only a few of those possible big fights in
boxing. It's Holyfield-Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya-Trindad and
Michalczewski-Jones.'' . . . Jones, by the way, discounted talk
that he might want to fight Shannon Briggs when he learned that
Briggs was 6 feet 4 inches and 230 pounds. . . In case you missed
it, Italian Stefano Zoff upset WBA lightweight champion Julien
Lorcy, winning a split decision in France. Do you have any idea
what it takes to win a split decision from a Frenchman in France?
Apparently Lorcy made no friends after upsetting fellow Frenchman
Jean-Baptise Mendy to win the title in April . . . Fading former
featherweight champion Kevin Kelley was upset last weekend in a
$5,000 tuneup fight in Louisiana by Benito Rodriguez, a lightweight
with a 27-25 record who probably outweighed Kelley by 20 pounds.
The loss cost Kelley an already planned farewell to boxing against
another faded former champion, Junior Jones, underneath the
Hamed-Cesar Soto featherweight unification fight in Detroit Oct.
22. Ireland's Wayne McCullough is on the same card, in a title shot
against WBC super bantamweight champion Erik Morales . . . Bob Arum
has nearly locked up a January unification fight between Morales
and WBO titleholder Marco Antonio Barrera, a fellow Mexican, for
big money as well . . . Talented WBO super middleweight champion
Joe Calzaghe (27-0, 23 KOs) finally has an opponent for his Sept.
18 title defense on the De La Hoya-Trinidad undercard. He'll take
on little-known Canadian Alain Bonnamie (18-8, 11 KOs) . . . NABF
welterweight champion Vernon Forrest takes on Roberto Duran's
nephew, Santiago Samaniego (27-4-1, 23 KOs), in Augusta, Ga.,
Friday . . . Bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala makes his first
title defense Sept. 25 vs. No. 1 challenger Saohin Sritbai Condo
(17-6, 12 KOs) of Thailand.

   Thirty-three-year-old Mickey Ward (33-9) gets one more chance to
put himself into a world title fight when he takes on
seventh-ranked Reggie Green Oct. 1 in Salem, N.H. The winner could
earn a shot against WBA super lightweight champion Sharmba Mitchell
with a strong (but not too strong) performance. Green (30-3) lost a
12-round decision to Mitchell in April . . . Word is Vinny Pazienza
will earn $350,000 and Dana Rosenblatt $185,000 for a fall rematch
at Foxwoods . . . It was learned last week that Reyes Munoz, who
was knocked out in one round by Arturo Gatti last weekend at
Foxwoods and carried from the ring on a stretcher to the hospital,
suffered from cranial nerve palsy, a form of epilepsy, and will
never fight again. The quick action of ringside neurologist Anthony
Alessi prevented any permanent damage. Munoz was first taken to a
local hospital in Norwich and then transferred to Yale Hospital's
trauma center. Alessi said it would have been nearly impossible for
the problem to have been found in prefight physicals. To his
credit, Gatti went to the hospital after the fight to check on
Munoz . . . WBC lightweight champion Stevie Johnston came away from
his win over Manfredy at Foxwoods last weekend a little light
despite his strong performance. Both Johnston and Manfredy were
docked $2,000 by the WBC for failing to participate in weigh-ins 30
days and seven days before the fight. The WBC has a safety rule
that demands fighters in world title matches be no more than 10
percent above their division's weight limit 30 days before the
fight and no more than 5 percent above it a week before the fight .
. . Johnston forgot his boxing shoes and had to borrow those of
Saugus's Bobby Tomasello, who asked only that Johnston sign the
shoes when he was finished, which the champion gladly did . . .
Hartford heavyweight hopeful Lawrence Clay-Bey comes back from a
16-month layoff (he had a broken hand) to face undefeated Dale
Crowe (15-0, 9 KOs) underneath Reid-Mullings.

EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ The first time the PGA Senior Tour set up shop
in Massachusetts was 18 years ago, in the dog days of June at
Marlborough CC. The flashback is to Billy Casper, outside the
clubhouse, weighing his newly discovered life in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago,'' said Casper, ``I was a veteran. Yesterday I
became a rookie. I think it's neat. It's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a born-again existence for the old guys who once faced
into the woodwork, teaching at club jobs and living with the ghosts
of tournaments past. They'd play into their 40s, with little
competitive light at the end of the tunnel. There was the venerable
PGA Seniors' Championship and the US Senior Open. There was the
infant Legends of Golf. Then came a meeting of legends named Sam
Snead, Bob Goalby, Don January, and the late Julius Boros, Gardner
Dickinson, and Dan Sikes on Jan. 16, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Out of it was born the PGA Senior Tour, which is celebrating its
20th year. The old Marlborough tournament moved to Nashawtuc CC in
1985, and the event now known as the BankBoston Classic has aged
gracefully. It has drawn sizable crowds and is now the oldest
54-hole event on the PGA Senior Tour. Is there an end in sight?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the PGA Senior Tour has become old hat, that the
novelty has worn off, paralysis has set in. It's Hale Irwin versus
Gil Morgan. There is a sameness. But it's funny how quickly things
can change. The tour suddenly has a fresh new lease on life, with
rookies shining in what has shaped up as a transitional year. Bruce
Fleisher is No. 1 on the money list, Allen Doyle of Norwood is No.
3.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the year, Doug Tewell, Tom Watson, Lanny
Wadkins, and Tom Kite will turn 50, so the new millennium should
bring a further revitalization of the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watson will bring great credibility and has great
credentials,'' said Irwin. ``Whether or not his game will be up to
the past as we all think it should be is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people we're overlooking. Doug Tewell's
coming out very soon. Then we have Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins
shortly thereafter. A lot of talk has been featured on Tom Watson,
and I don't hesitate to say he will give the Senior Tour a new
face. He'll be great for us. He'll be followed by other players who
very nearly have the same type of profile. It'll be tremendous. I
think the year 2000 is going to be a very exciting year. I think
we're going to see a real show next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to earn your way onto the PGA Senior Tour, and
it's harder to stay there. The top 31 from the previous year's
money list make it, as well as the top 31 from the all-time money
list not otherwise exempt. Also in are the top eight players out of
the Senior Qualifying School. Winners of Senior events are exempt
for one year, and past champions from PGA Tour events make it on a
space-available basis.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Quigley of Barrington, R.I., was in limbo when he turned 50
on April 14, 1996. He tried to qualify or get sponsor's exemptions.
He finally broke through and won the Northville Long Island Classic
two years ago, and he has since won five more times. Quigley is one
of the most active players on the tour, and as a veteran, he can
recognize the changing face of Senior golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some people about three months,'' said Quigley, ``but
it took me about two years. I never felt I belonged out here, but
when I got my first win, I felt I was headed in the right
direction. We're now getting the best players from every country in
the world: Jose Maria Canizares, Hugh Biochi, John Bland, Christy
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is just going on and on, and when they see the
success these guys are having, there's just going to be more coming
over every year if they find some way they can get out here. Q
School is a tough avenue to go through. I was really lucky. If Jay
Sigel didn't three-putt those greens (at Northville), I might have
not have gotten through the Q School, and all of this might not
have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup apparently has a decidedly different connotation
to the Seniors than it does to malcontents such as Tiger Woods,
David Duval, Mark O'Meara, and Phil Mickelson, who have raised the
dander of traditionalists by questioning why money from the event
isn't distributed to players, who can give it to their area
charities or do with it what they will. You wonder why Woods was
heckled on the last day of the PGA Championship, when the crowd
suddenly adopted Sergio Garcia as its hero?
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup has provided Irwin with some of his most
pressurized and cherished moments in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to pull together as a common cause, rather than
playing as an individual with a single cause,'' said Irwin.
``You're actually going out hoping to contribute to the success of
this team through your own performance. It's not a team sport in
the same sense as baseball or football, but it's as close to that
as we can get in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was at Kiawah Island in 1991, when it came down to a
missed putt by his opponent, Germany's Bernhard Langer, on the
final hole to give the US the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a very explosive environment at Kiawah,'' said
Irwin. ``You don't want to be the person who lets the team down.
This is a different environment, and that's why I think it's so
unique. You have other people who are really and truly pulling for
you. They're not just giving you lip service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see that as our match progressed. More and more
people were falling back to the last match. I told my wife the
night before when the pairings came out, `I have a feeling it's
going to come down to Bernhard and me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of intense time together that week, talking
about how you collectively might play. There's a lot of give and
take of information, and that, by itself, is different. It's nice.
It's a refreshing change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the Ryder Cup was something special. Money
was never an issue with me, nor with the players. It was just never
an issue. I think most of the older players had a different
attitude, but it's the same in all sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played for the fact we were representing the US. Now we're
into this other thing, which in my opinion has put a pall over the
whole idea of the Ryder Cup. There are still enough very good
players on that team. They just have to put that aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing a great golf course. I really like The Country
Club. I don't think you can count the Europeans out. They've got
the Cup. They're playing in a hostile environment, and sometimes
that rallies the troops to get together and stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   Englishman Brian Barnes, who once beat Jack Nicklaus in singles
twice in the same day, pulled no punches regarding the money
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bloody disgrace,'' said Barnes. ``If you're not
proud to play for your country, then you shouldn't even be out
there. To even consider being paid for it brings it down to the
same level as any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is way above any sport that is played, due to the fact
that every time we go out there, we have to be honest and put our
own resolve on the line. There is also the matter that the only two
organizations that seem to derive any benefit from it are the PGA
of America and the PGA of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a lot of the money put into the charities in
the players' names. Let's be honest. Most of these guys are already
millionaires, and they have contracts that reward them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hayes played in the 1979 Ryder Cup at the Greenbrier, when
the competition was conducted in virtual solitude. You could walk
right in and watch; nobody was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that hectic then,'' said Hayes. ``It started to
snowball after that year. I still think golf stands alone in terms
of the integrity of sport. I think this is one way to show we will
stay above the greedy aspects of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stockton, who was the US captain at Kiawah, said, ``It's a
little different between your role as a player and as a captain. I
remember being on the first tee at Kiawah, and I couldn't even see
the fairway. You patted them on the back, wished them good luck,
and said, `Thank God I'm not the one who has to hit your shot.' I
would expect (Ben) Crenshaw to win at Brookline, but there's a lot
of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of all the flak over where the Ryder Cup money goes,
it is worth pondering the identity of the next US captain. The
storm that Crenshaw has been in may heat up even more before the
next matches in 2001. Stockton feels the next captain should be
selected now and be present at The Country Club as an observer. ``I
knew Watson was going to succeed me as captain,'' said Stockton.
``That was an exception. I would have very much liked to have
Watson at Kiawah. I think the next captain should be on site. It
puts us in a little bit of a bind, because by the time you learn
how to do it, as I did at Kiawah, I was ready to go the next year.
I understood part of things that go wrong and right, but all of a
sudden it was Tom Watson's turn. I don't know who's following
Crenshaw, but to my way of thinking, whoever's going to do it
should be invited here.'' . . . Jim Ireland, who retired two years
ago after 18 years in sales and an executive capacity with
MacGregor and 26 years as an executive with Titleist/FootJoy, is
the ninth recipient of the Ernie Sabrayac Award, which recognizes
contributions to the business side of golf. This is the PGA of
America's highest honor. Ireland, who resides on Boston's South
Shore, will be honored Sept. 29 at the PGA merchandise show in Las
Vegas . . . The Europeans will firm up their 12-man Ryder Cup
roster at the conclusion of Sundya's BMW International Open in
Munich. The players from the Ryder Cup teams, in addition to those
from last year's Presidents Cup teams, will converge in Akron,
Ohio, this week to play the second event on the International
Federation of PGA Tours/World Golf Championship at Firestone CC.
The purse is $5 million. Isn't this a spinoff from the Ryder Cup's
success? . . . Ten of the 12 US team members will be at The Country
Club a week from Monday to walk the course with Crenshaw and after
lunch play 18 holes. Woods and O'Meara have prior commitments.

A $50 MILLION QUESTION FOR KRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Is he worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   That's what New England fans will be asking themselves for quite
some time, and it's what Patriots owner Robert Kraft has to be
worrying about today, with the ink barely dry on the seven-year,
$50 million contract extension he handed Pro Bowl cornerback Ty Law
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That deal made Law the second-highest paid corner in football
and the highest-paid Patriot in history, pushing him past $42
million quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and assured that Law's best years
in football will be played in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But is he worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   That will be a persistent question the next few years because
the Patriots have not had much luck betting on the future lately.
They invested $16 million in bonuses and $50 million total in Ted
Johnson and Willie McGinest and haven't gotten a full season _ or a
Pro Bowl performance _ out of either of them since. They invested
$2.5 million a year in Max Lane and Todd Rucci, but by the end of
last year Lane was on the bench and the Patriots were trying to
find a way to get Rucci in the same place, although before it's
over both will start again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Only time, luck, and Law will provide an answer to that question
but Law's emergence as one of the game's best cornerbacks was
obvious a year ago after he intercepted nine passes and reached the
Pro Bowl for the first time. When you add the fact that he's only
25 and is so consumed with becoming the best corner in the game
that he spent most of the offseason working with Olympic track
coach Bob Kersee, you can breathe a little easier than it ever
seemed wise to do with those other signings. They were bets made
far more on future potential than past production, whereas Law
already has had the kind of season you pay big for, so at least you
know he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of his obsession was spending several weeks in
Foxborough with Lawyer Milloy working on conditioning after the
Patriots were eliminated from the playoffs last year. He wanted to
be ready for February's Pro Bowl, and he was rewarded for his
efforts, making an interception that he returned 67 yards for a
touchdown and being named the game's co-MVP.
</P>
<P>
   He then worked much of the offseason with Kersee, first at UCLA
before moving on to St. Louis in the late spring, when Kersee moved
his speed camp there. That work ethic is the best insurance Kraft
can have, although it didn't help him in the case of McGinest or
Johnson, who are weight room warriors themselves. Also, cornerbacks
with speed and cover skills traditionally play at a high level
relatively injury-free for many years.
</P>
<P>
   But the question persists. Is he worth the money?
</P>
<P>
   The great George Young, who ran the Giants' personnel operation
during their Super Bowl years and beyond before moving over to the
NFL office, used to say, ``That's the most redundant question ever
asked.'' His point was that no one is actually worth the money, and
on some level that's true.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what you get paid if you're at the top end of the
cornerback market these days. Perhaps a healthy Deion Sanders
exceeds him because of his speed, but we may never see a healthy
Sanders again. That being the case, who is a better cover corner
than Law at the moment?
</P>
<P>
   Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllll??????
</P>
<P>
   That's what I thought you'd say.
</P>
<P>
   So if Law avoids injury, the only thing that can turn this into
a bad investment is a loss of nerve or a reduction in will now that
at least $14.2 million of the money is in the bank. The former is
unlikely if you know Law, a player for whom the term ``hard-nosed''
could have been coined, and the latter doesn't seem likely for a
guy who has been demanding to cover the opposition's top receivers
since his rookie year under Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Injury is another matter, which is why New England now has $50
million reasons not _ I repeat, not _ to grant Law his request to
return punts. That is not, as in not under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   For a reason, one need only cite the season-ending knee injury
to the Giants' Jason Sehorn a year ago on his first and only punt
return. But that is not the only reason.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders remains the best cover corner in the league in most
people's minds, but he clearly asked too much of his body for too
long and now both he and the Cowboys are paying the price. His
injured toe continues to keep him in street clothes and his body
seems to be turning on him. Baseball had something to do with that,
but so too did being asked to return punts and play wide receiver
and make half the field disappear whenever the Cowboys were on
defense. A body _ no matter how finely tuned _ can take only so
much, and this the Patriots need to remember even as Law continues
to agitate for a wider role on offense, which is sure to continue
if the team struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Law easily could play cornerback for years without
facing a career-threatening injury. That's true if one simply goes
by the NFL's actuarial tables, which have become favorite reading
in some corners of the Patriots' front office.
</P>
<P>
   But put Law back to catch a punt, and the odds against staying
in one piece take a quantum leap. With a $50 million gamble made on
Law _ and a $25 million one on Johnson's body possibly already lost
_ it's time for common sense to enter the equation.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would argue that paying someone who has had
just one Pro Bowl season in four years and has averaged only 4 1/2
interceptions a season already flies in the face of common sense,
and they might be right because no one can know what that
team-record signing bonus might do to a player's will. But the
Patriots are betting that Law was a man of his word when he said
Friday afternoon, ``When I retire, five years later I want to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a lofty goal and will require many more years like last
season. Clearly, Law has the gifts _ the speed, the agility, and
the temperament to cover fast men _ and has reached an elite level
through a combination of offseason work and tireless film study.
</P>
<P>
   If the money doesn't change that and injury doesn't derail him,
Law may have his wish answered when his career ends. If so, Kraft
will have had his prayers answered.
</P>
<P>

   While Akili Smith and the Bengals continue to war over the size
of the rookie quarterback's contract, incumbent Jeff Blake declared
this week that the battle, if there was ever going to be one, is
over. While Smith and agent Leigh Steinberg continue to reject the
Bengals' contention that much of the money should be tied to
playing time and performance incentives, Blake said the rookie's
three-weeks-and-counting holdout has cost him any chance of
becoming a productive player this season. ``It's impossible,'' said
Blake. ``He could get by on athletic ability but that will only
take you so far. That's why they have training camp.'' Owner Mike
Brown agrees, claiming that a rookie quarterback who misses camp is
assured of being on the bench all season . . . Speaking of Blake,
he may not have touchdown twin Carl Pickens to throw to anymore but
he doesn't mind aiming at Darnay Scott, either. With Pickens
threatening a year-long holdout, it has been predicted that Scott
could blossom. He and Blake connected for a 66-yard touchdown
against Indianapolis in the exhibition opener. While Blake has
thrown 43 touchdown passes to Pickens in the last five years, he's
also chucked 15 to Scott, with eight of them being 38 yards or
longer . . . On Aug. 14, Byron and David Boston made NFL history
when they became the first father-and-son team to be an official
and a player in the same NFL game. When the Cardinals' rookie
receiver caught his first career pass right in front of his father,
though, he forgot what he was supposed to do. Not so with the next
catch, an 8-yard reception. He flipped the ball to his Dad, who
signaled a first down as the rest of their family cheered behind
the Cardinals' bench. The scene will not be repeated, however. The
league does not allow a father to officiate his son's games in the
regular season . . . Apparently, talkative Denver tight end Shannon
Sharpe now says he won't speak to the media this season. Sure he
won't . . . There is a quarterback controversy brewing but it's not
in Denver, where locals tried to speculate that Bubby Brister was
in some kind of trouble because of a poor performance in the first
exhibition game in Australia. Brister has taken this in stride, and
coach Mike Shanahan called ``ridiculous'' the idea Brister might be
beaten out by Brian Griese or Chris Miller. But believe it or not,
up in Buffalo there are forces already greasing the skids for Doug
Flutie. Flutie remains the starter, but factions within the
organization still like Rob Johnson better. Johnson is bigger,
younger, faster, and has a stronger arm. What he lacks is magic,
something Flutie had in abundance a year ago. But don't be shocked
to see things happen if the Bills' offense struggles or, worse,
Flutie gets hurt.

   Curtis Martin never has been one to pop off, so perhaps what he
says should be taken seriously. If so, the Jets will be a problem
because Martin has been talking lately about rushing for 2,000
yards this season. ``It's not a selfish `me, me, me' thing,''
Martin says. ``This is a goal I've set with the team in focus and
not myself. If I can rush for 2,000 yards it would put us in the
best possible position to do what we all want to do this year.''
This comes at the same time that coach Bill Parcells and offensive
coordinator Charlie Weis are insisting they want to take some of
the load off him by giving Leon Johnson more carries . . . Not long
after Jacksonville wide receiver Keenan McCardell went down at
practice with what at first appeared to be a fractured leg, coach
Tom Coughlin was informed it was only a bruise. His reaction? He
made the sign of the cross . . . Size is everything in the NFL.
Even if you're not in the NFL. Just ask Willie Clyde Thomas, who
was arrested in Las Vegas after a five-month investigation by NFL
Security. It seems Thomas was getting free hotel rooms and other
comps in Las Vegas, including limo rides, by posing as various NFL
linemen. The 6-foot-7-inch, 305-pound Thomas was arrested at the
Fremont Hotel in a free room he got by claiming he was the Bengals'
Jamain Stephens. He also had gotten rooms in the past claiming to
be 49ers tight end Chad Fann. Don't you think somebody would have
asked the guy why he wasn't in training camp before they forked
over the key? . . . Although he's been nothing but a tease up until
now, the Chiefs' explosive Tamarick Vanover is getting another
chance to turn into a deep threat as well as a return man under new
coach Gunther Cunningham. Only half-jokingly, Cunningham said,
``We're going to get him the ball or I'll get some new coaches that
will. You think I'm joking? He's got to get the ball.'' Vanover
might have been happy to hear that but you'll never know. He's not
talking this summer. Former coach Marty Schottenheimer made Vanover
a starter in 1996 and he had a big day in the season opener with
seven receptions but he was injured the next week and was never the
same receiver. A year ago, they moved him to running back to
utilize his speed but that was a failed experiment so he's back at
wideout with the new head coach on his side, which can't hurt . . .
Speaking of the Chiefs, negotiations with No. 1 pick John Tait have
slogged to a halt and GM Carl Peterson now says it would be false
to even call it negotiating. The sides are fighting over making the
fifth year of his contract voidable, something Peterson is refusing
to do in part because he now says this will be a lost season for
the former BYU All-American tackle. Perhaps the Chiefs should have
seen this problem coming. When they were ready to draft Tait with
the 14th pick, they called and asked him to sign a six-year deal
before they made the pick. His agent refused. They then offered a
five-year deal. He again refused. They drafted him anyway. Tait was
not happy when the Chiefs tried to rush him into a deal while they
were on the drafting clock and those feelings were compounded when
the team refused to pay for an insurance policy to protect him
during minicamp.

   If you're a quarterback in the NFL, you can expect to be
criticized. But by your wife? According to the Bears' nominal
starter, Shane Matthews, after he played poorly in Chicago's first
two exhibition games, his wife Stephanie told him he wasn't the
quarterback she was used to seeing. He didn't disagree, but who
wants to hear it at home after losing a starting job to a rookie
(Cade McNown) a month into training camp and now facing the threat
of losing the backup job to Jim Miller, who hasn't played in an NFL
game since 1996? . . . Although McNown appears to have taken over
as the starter, word is more than a few Bears veterans are upset
with what they feel is his constant finger pointing when errors are
made. After a loss to the Steelers last weekend, Chicago offensive
coordinator Gary Crowton spoke to his players as a group, urging
them not to point fingers, and many veterans believed the comment
was directed at McNown. This is a situation that may bear watching
in Bears land . . . Ryan Leaf can't seem to stay out of trouble in
San Diego. He not only got into a beef with a heckler in the stands
after a practice but told the local media, ``I just don't feel like
anybody wants me here.'' A year ago they gave Leaf a five-year,
$31.25 million contract. How much convincing does a guy need?
Believe it or not, despite throwing 15 interceptions and just two
touchdown passes last season, Leaf met the criteria to have his
contract voided after next season despite the fact that he's out
this year with a shoulder injury. That's because he was in for 35
percent of the Chargers' offensive plays last season and San Diego
won one more game than it had in 1997 (five instead of four).
Obviously there was no requirement that the offense actually move
forward while he was in . . . With all that's on his mind, you'd
think Steelers coach Bill Cowher would have more important things
to worry about than how many tailgaters have been displaced because
of a change in parking lot policy around Three Rivers Stadium.
Construction of the new stadium nearby has taken up enough space
that tailgaters are no longer allowed to buy several parking spaces
in prime lots near the stadium entrance and Cowher believes that
will hurt the team's legendary home-field advantage. Cowher claims
team buses having to drive through masses of Steeler fans jammed in
the lots was unsettling. And all along we thought it was Mean Joe
Greene and Jack Lambert.

   Stat of the Week: Of the 108 playoff teams in the 1990s, only 15
have been led by a new quarterback, and none with a new face under
center have reached the Super Bowl. Only two QBs _ Joe Montana in
1993 and Vinny Testaverde in 1998 _ even took their teams to the
conference championship. Eight lost in the wild-card game on the
first weekend of the playoffs. If that holds true this season, at
least 10 teams already are eliminated from playoff contention . . .
Stat of the Week II: According to the Packers, they have just about
50,000 names on the waiting list for season tickets and only seven
moved off those rolls to become ticket-holders this season. At that
rate, it will take more than 7,000 years for the last person on the
list to get a ticket. That person is obviously an optimist . . .
Defensive end Chris Doleman, who declined an offer to come out of
retirement and return to the 49ers this summer, called his old team
and his old line coach this week about work. Doleman dialed up
Minnesota director of personnel Paul Wiggin to discuss the
possibility of returning to the Vikings but it's a long shot unless
he plays for near the minimum. Doleman is also talking with the
Redskins but has demanded a salary in excess of $3 million.
Although he had 15 sacks a year ago, Doleman is 37 and can play
only on passing downs . . . A veteran special teams player usually
knows the score in the NFL better than most people. That's why it
didn't come as a shock to Jim Schwantz when the Bears released him
even though he anchored the fourth-rated special teams unit in the
NFL a year ago. ``Teams won't keep a guy to cover kicks for what
the veteran minimum is nowadays,'' the former Pro Bowl special
teams player said. Schwantz led the Bears in special teams tackles
last year, a season in which that unit went from 27th in the NFL to
fourth. But despite that, the Bears could not justify paying
Schwantz $400,000 to run under kicks when they could have a younger
body do it for less than half the price . . . Not long after Colts
No. 1 pick Edgerrin James signed his seven-year, $49 million
contract in Indianapolis, he was asked if he was better than Ricky
Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner whom James was picked ahead of.
``Ask Mr. (Bill) Polian,'' James said. Polian is the Colts'
president and the man who decided to take James ahead of the NCAA's
all-time leading rusher . . . Speaking of the Colts, center Jay
Leeuwenburg was shocked to learn he had lost his starting position
to Larry Moore. ``I don't think they have the best five players on
the field now,'' said Leeuwenburg, who had started 37 straight
games. Indianapolis coach Jim Mora has built a new offensive line,
with Tarik Glenn at left tackle, Steve McKinney at left guard,
Moore at center, Waverly Jackson at right guard, and Adam Meadows
at right tackle. Moore and Jackson are new starters . . . Figure
this out. Fourteen members of the Buccaneers are sleeping on
special Select Comfort air beds at training camp while the rest of
the team is jammed into usual dorm room-size bedding. That includes
some guys sharing the same room. That must make for pleasant
conversation . . . Old friend Irving Fryar's three-year, $6 million
contract with the Redskins isn't quite what it appears to be. Fryar
received a $400,000 signing bonus and a $600,000 salary for this
season, but the likelihood of his being paid the remaining $5
million at age 37 is slim. Fryar had been working for a TV station
in Philadelphia at the Eagles' training camp when word came that he
had agreed to a deal with the Redskins. This led cornerback Troy
Vincent to say, ``Irv, we want the bike back.'' That was a
reference to the motorcycle given to Fryar by the Eagles at a
retirement ceremony . . . Speaking of the Redskins, coach Norv
Turner finally had no choice but to acknowledge the obvious: If his
team doesn't reach the playoffs, he won't be back. That's because
on Tuesday the George Steinbrenner of the NFL _ new owner Dennis
the Menace (I mean Daniel Snyder) _ said publicly he would fire
Turner if the team didn't make it to the postseason. This came
during a conversation during which Knute Snyder also criticized the
play of tackle Joe Patton. And people think Kraft is a meddling
owner? . . . Oft-mentioned but seldom seen running back Terry Allen
still isn't in New England, but he was in Detroit last week
visiting the Lions. Despite his injury history in recent years,
Allen would at least give Detroit a veteran presence at running
back. With Barry Sanders gone, the only back in camp who has an NFL
carry is Ron Rivers . . . Lawrence Phillips's debut as a 49er
Thursday night resulted in a dropped pass on the first ball thrown
to him and 6 yards rushing on three carries. Has it occurred to
anyone in the NFL that the guy just isn't that good? What he is, is
what so many other runners at Nebraska have proven to be: a product
of 300-pound linemen in front of them. Wait and see.

ANOTHER LOSS LEAVES DIVISION HANDICAPPED 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ The season-ending injury to Real Quiet, on the heels of
the retirement of Victory Gallop, leaves the handicap ranks in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The two 4-year-olds, who finished 1-2 in last year's Triple
Crown campaign (Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,
Victory Gallop the Belmont), were the heart and soul of the
division for older horses. Now the 5-year-old Behrens is the only
handicap horse with any credibility left in training.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Real Quiet was training for the $1 million Pacific
Classic (at Del Mar Aug. 29) when he suffered a fractured splint
bone in his right front leg while breezing 7 furlongs at Santa
Anita. The minimum recovery time for such an injury is three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably happened in the work; he was fine until then,''
said trainer Bob Baffert. ``There was a little filling, and X-rays
showed a little crack at the top of the splint bone. We'll wait 90
days and see how it looks. He's finished for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The fracture will not require surgery, but it would be
career-ending if it does not heal perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing would be to bring him back at the top of his
game,'' said owner Mike Pegram. ``If that can be done, he will
definitely be back. If not, he's going to go to that good life. We
are all hopeful he will come back. It's Bobby's decision, but we
hope he will be able to run in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 13 announcement of Victory Gallop's retirement blew the
first big hole in the handicap division. He apparently tore a
suspensory ligament in his left front leg while defeating Behrens
by a nose, following a desperate stretch battle, in the Whitney at
Saratoga Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little filling behind the pastern,'' said trainer
Elliot Walden, who discoverd the injury Aug. 12. ``He had an
ultrasound, and it revealed a tear. He's too valuable a horse to
try to rehabilitate, and it would have been a six-month process. We
decided to retire him quickly. After doing the homework, it was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury didn't really show up until he had a couple of days
of galloping. That's what happens with a soft tissue injury. It
might separate and tear during the race, but when they do something
on the track after the race, that's when the hemorrhage comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, a son of Cryptoclearance, retires to stud at
Prestonwood Farm in Versailles, Ky., with a career record of
17-9-5-1 and more than $3.5 million in earnings. This year, he won
three of four starts, with a third in the $5 million Dubai World
Cup, and was a definite Horse of the Year candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet's career is over, he will go to stud at Vinary in
Midway, Ky. The son of Quiet American has a career record of
20-6-5-6 and more than $3.2 million in earnings. His last start, a
convincing victory in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup June 27,
seemed to indicate that Real Quiet was on the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic, the closing event of the 11-race NTRA
Champions series, has been blown apart. Prior to the injuries,
Victory Gallop was headed to Del Mar to face Real Quiet for the
first time since the 1998 Belmont. That would have been drama. Now,
little-known local standout Mazel Trick, who won the San Diego
Handicap at Del Mar Aug. 7, will face talented 3-year-old General
Challenge, also trained by Baffert, and Malek, who always tries
hard but seldom wins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jim Bond, who trains Behrens, said his charge, who
numbers the MassCap at Suffolk Downs May 29 among his victories,
may not race again until the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the handicap ranks lost Silver Charm, the
1997 Derby and Preakness winner, and Free House, the 1998 Pacific
Classic winner and this year's Santa Anita Handicap victor.
</P>
<P>
   A division that once went five-deep has been reduced to a single
star.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag, the top dirt horse based in England, is returning
to the United States for the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup next
Sunday. Running Stag ran second in the MassCap, with Real Quiet
third, then put on a dazzling display to take the Brooklyn at
Belmont June 12. He returned to England and most recently worked a
half-mile in :48 at Lingfield. The 5-year-old son of Cozzene will
arrive in New York Monday to prepare for his Saratoga engagement.
Running Stag opened the year by finishing seventh in the Dubai
World Cup, then ran second in a turf race at Goodwood in Great
Britain before coming over for the MassCap. If he scores at the Spa
and stays in North America to race, could he become a leader in the
handicap division? The way things are going, maybe so . . . Harry
Vega, who won 10 races, was named Jockey of the Week at Rockingham
Park. Vega won three races on Sunday and four on Monday. As it does
each week, Coors Light donated $200 in the winning jockey's name to
the national Jockeys' Guild Disabled Riders Fund. Vega also won the
honor the opening week of the meeting in June . . . Plainridge
Racecourse plans to hold two major events in October. The harness
track will reintroduce the Beckwith Memorial Pace, which had been a
fixture at defunct Foxboro Park, and add the Pasquantonio Memorial
Trot. Details, such as purse and date, are to come.

PATRIOTS BOUNCE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If it's progress you wanted from the second
exhibition game of the season, you got it.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots, 20-14 losers to Washington in their
first exhibition game a week ago, rebounded with a solid 34-14 win
over the Dallas Cowboys on a drizzly, foggy Saturday night at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So bad was the weather, and perhaps the spirits of Patriots'
fans, that 9,476 didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   But the 50,816 that were in attendance saw Drew Bledsoe, playing
all but the last two minutes of the first half, completing 13 of 19
for 147 yards and one touchdown, showing no signs of a mildly
sprained ankle incurred in the Washington game. Of course, as if
scripted, rookie quarterback Michael Bishop threw a late 36-yard
touchdown pass to Marshfield's Sean Morey, while also gaining 26
yards on four scrambles.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first team played much better on both sides of the
ball. Bledsoe connected with Terry Glenn five times for 85 yards
and one touchdown before giving way to backup John Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as simple as wanting to score more points,'' said
Bledsoe of the Patriots' game plan. ``We knew they were missing
their corners and we thought we could get the ball downfield. We
accomplished that with Terry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense was also on target as defensive end Willie
McGinest, who was on the field for 17 plays, was able to make it
through the first half without injury and managed a key
second-quarter sack of Dallas quarterback Jason Garrett on a
third-down pass rush where he anticipated the snap count, got a
strong rush on tackle Oliver Ross, and swiped Garrett with his left
arm and brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, who played most of the game,
also looked much more comfortable in the middle, once blitzing and
altering a Troy Aikman pass. He also covered the backs well and
moved well from sideline to sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like night and day with Katz,'' said Patriots defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Chris Carter, who replaced Willie Clay, picked off an
Aikman pass over the middle in the first quarter and returned it 16
yards to the Dallas 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, playing without defensive tackles Chad Eaton and
Henry Thomas, got good efforts from backups Chris Sullivan, Garrett
Johnson, and Leonta Rheams. Rheams, the Patriots' fourth-round pick
last year from Houston, also forced and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Patriots did well in virtually every area except
running the ball. While they gained 127 yards as a team, rookie
running back Kevin Faulk managed only 17 yards on 11 carries. The
kicking game was both hot and cold as well, with Adam Vinatieri
booting three field goals (two from 42 yards, one from 40), but
missing another and coming up short on several kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Bledsoe's throwing, Troy Brown's punt returns,
and a turnover-conscious defense all played parts in a 14-7
first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   After nickel back Kato Serwanga broke up a third-down pass by
Aikman on the first series, Brown took a 27-yard punt by Toby Gowin
and raced 27 yards to the Dallas 35. Bledsoe hit Glenn with a
21-yard fade down the right sideline to the 14. A 6-yard run by
Lamont Warren helped set up Faulk's second-effort, 2-yard run for
the first Patriots' score with 11:24 remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came right back on the next series, marching 57
yards on nine plays. Emmitt Smith broke off a 21-yard run, and
Lawyer Milloy was beaten on passes to the fullback and tight end,
the latter to David LaFleur on a 6-yard scoring pass from Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown put the Patriots back in good field position with a
22-yard punt return to the Dallas 37. Bledsoe went right to work,
finding Harold Shaw in the right flat for a 13-yard gain. That set
the stage for the most artistic play of the exhibition season, a
24-yard post to Glenn, who made one swift inside move on cornerback
Kevin Mathis and exploded to the end zone where he caught the ball
over his shoulder for the score.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:59 remaining in the second quarter and the first team
still in, the Patriots made it a 21-7 game.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the Dallas 46, Bledsoe again picked apart the
Cowboys. He hit Shaw for a 5-yard gain and then went right back to
Glenn down the right sideline. The receiver made an outstanding
grab and managed to keep both feet in bounds for a 25-yard gain.
Glenn was slow getting up and was forced out of the game, but the
injury did not appear serious. Bledsoe threw successfully to Warren
for 11 yards and Brown for 8 before the quarterback found his
favorite target _ tight end Ben Coates _ for the first time in the
game on a 6-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots added a 42-yard field goal by Vinatieri in the
third quarter after the offense went 47 yards on 12 plays, while
Dallas kicker Richie Cunningham missed from 35 with 3:11 remaining
in the third quarter. But the Cowboys scored with one throw, a
55-yard scoring bomb from third-string quarterback Mike Quinn to
Jason Tucker with two minutes remaining in the third quarter,
reducing the Patriots' lead to 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the third, the crowd perked up when Bishop
entered the game. The rookie quarterback dazzled again, escaping
pressure and what appeared to be a sure sack by scrambling for a
16-yard gain on third down as the quarter ended. It led to a
40-yard field goal by Vinatieri early in the fourth. The kicker
missed a chance to add to the score later in the quarter, hitting
the left upright.

RED SOX' ROSE PLUCKED BY RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Two batters into the bottom of the first
inning, catcher Jason Varitek was at the mound, talking to Sox
rookie Brian Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Four batters into the game, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was out
for a word.
</P>
<P>
   One batter into the fifth inning, manager Jimy Williams was out
for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the slump Rose had vowed to break hadn't lost its grip
in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's 9-2 loss to the Texas Rangers, who received
two more home runs and four more RBIs from Rafael Palmeiro
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go? We have to figure that out,'' Williams said
when asked about Rose, who is 2-4 with a 7.90 ERA in his last 11
starts. ``I'm not going to change anything as we speak. He's still
in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose trailed, 2-1, one out into the game, and 3-1 in the third
after Palmeiro took him deep on a 2-and-2 changeup that broke over
the plate instead of away. It became 4-1 after Rusty Greer led off
the fifth with another home run, hitting a 3-and-1 pitch that Rose
threw outside as he intended, but high enough for Greer, who likes
to go the other way, to get the barrel of his bat on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was the 14th allowed by Rose in the last 49
innings, a pace that not even John Wasdin, the man who relieved him
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, has matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he's lost some confidence,'' said Ken Macha, who
managed Rose in the minors and now coaches with Oakland, after
Rose's early departure in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Rose didn't dispute the point. ``It's not hard to lose
confidence when you only pitch three innings in your last five or
six outings,'' said Rose, who has pitched five innings or fewer in
nine of his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going good, you don't have to think about
much. When they're not going well, you have to try and fix it. It's
just a pain in the butt. I wish things would turn my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who also homered Friday night and drove in three runs,
has six home runs in his last six games. His three-run homer off
reliever Rheal Cormier in the seventh was his 36th _ and 350th of
his career _ not bad for a guy who had two knee surgeries in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubts about what I would be able to do,''
said Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, in case you were wondering, the Sox entertained the
idea of signing Palmeiro as a free agent last winter to replace Mo
Vaughn, but general manager Dan Duquette decided that there was no
point in getting into a bidding war with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got a little serious, it did,'' Palmeiro said of his winter
talks with the Sox. ``But my main focus was to work something out
here or in Baltimore. This has always been home, even when I was
playing for Baltimore (for five years), I still lived here. So it's
nice to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit his second home run of the game and the Rangers'
fourth of the night in the eighth inning off Bryce Florie, as the
AL West leaders collected a dozen hits in beating the Sox for the
second time in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's a crisis blooming in the Sox rotation, with
no easy solution in sight. No Bret Saberhagen. Ramon Martinez, the
one-man cavalry on the horizon, was lit up for six runs, including
three home runs, in five innings  &UR; last night &LR;  in Pawtucket. There
is always Pedro Martinez's stand-in, Florie, of course, but is this
any way to run a wild-card race?
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night's starter, Tim Wakefield, will take the mound
against ex-Sox pitcher Aaron Sele with far more questions than
answers as he returns to the rotation after 14 weeks as the team's
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sox hitters did anything to take the pressure off their
beleaguered pitching staff in losing their third straight game and
fourth game in their last five.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had a run two batters into the game when Jose Offerman
hit his league-leading 10th triple into the right-center-field gap
and scored on Darren Lewis's ground out. They then spent the rest
of the night squandering one scoring chance after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right people up,'' Williams said. ``It just didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   They wasted Trot Nixon's leadoff double in the third. They
wasted Nomar Garciaparra's leadoff double in the fourth. They
wasted singles by Garciaparra and Varitek in the sixth, when pinch
hitter Reggie Jefferson lined deep to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Rangers starter Rick Helling departed after a
leadoff walk to Nixon, and Offerman and Lewis singled off his
successor, Eric Crabtree. Mike Stanley, batting for Brian Daubach,
brought home a run with a sacrifice fly off reliever Mike Venafro,
but the fourth Rangers pitcher of the inning, rookie Jeff
Zimmerman, coaxed Garciaparra to pop out on the first pitch, and
came back from a 3-and-0 deficit to Troy O'Leary to retire the
slumping left fielder (1 for 27) on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get him to chase,'' Zimmerman said of his faceoff
with Garciaparra, whose three hits raised his league-leading
average to .363. ``I know I'm not going to walk him. He's up there
swinging the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go after him with 0-and-2 quality pitches, get him
to chase one out of the zone. I think he was looking away for a
slider. I threw him a fastball inside, which I think surprised him,
and I popped him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've faced him three times, and he's made great adjustments
each time. The first two times, I threw him first-pitch sliders and
he made the adjustments, tried to hit 'em to right. That's why he's
the best hitter in the league. Against him, it's like playing mind
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the bottom of the inning, Stanley dropped Cormier's
throw after the pitcher had slipped fielding Rusty Greer's roller
down the first-base line. Stanley's error was followed by a single
by Juan Gonzalez, who had tripled home a run in the first, and
Palmeiro drained the night of any remaining drama by lining a home
run into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like us, though,'' Williams said. ``I still like the
way we're playing. We just need a good start.''

BLEDSOE'S GROWING MATURITY NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sometimes I wonder if he gets into his car,
blasts Everclear, and laughs hysterically about the silly things
said and written about him. Drew Bledsoe must have done that at
least once in the past six years. I am convinced of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots quarterback has been here since 1993. During that
time you may have heard that Bledsoe is not mobile enough. Not
tough enough. Taps the ball too much before throwing. Throws the
ball off his back foot too much. Won't be the same without Bill
Parcells coaching him. Won't be the same with Pete Carroll coaching
him. Doesn't scream enough.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't hear is that the 27-year-old Bledsoe now throws
the ball better than most of the men who play his position.
Quarterbacks are similar to pitchers _ they seem to get smarter as
they get older. Actually, they don't really get smarter; they just
have a better idea of what they're trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was obvious Saturday night at Foxboro Stadium, when
thousands of people watched Bledsoe and the Patriots practice
against the Cowboys. The NFL calls these matchups exhibition games,
but they are glorified warmups that happen to cost a lot of money
if you want to attend one. Many of the exhibition Patriots realize
they are simply borrowing the uniforms they wear, the same way you
borrow a tuxedo. The real football begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the Patriots' 34-14 practice win, Bledsoe looked
good. He threw 19 passes and completed 13 of them. He threw for 147
yards and two touchdowns in the first half. During the second half,
he stood on the sideline like a coach, wearing a headset. No one
ever questioned his arm strength. Now, if practice is an indication
of anything, there won't be many questions about the decisions he
makes, either. He is entering his seventh season. He has an idea of
what he wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, he had a simple plan before he took the field.
He was going to attack the Cowboys' cornerbacks. Deion Sanders and
Kevin Smith were hurting. And although third-year man Kevin Mathis
is a starter, he doesn't cause quarterbacks or receivers to worry.
Late in the first quarter, Bledsoe and Terry Glenn made Mathis look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry beat him so bad at the line of scrimmage that (Mathis)
had no chance,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Mathis on an outside route earlier in the first
quarter, Glenn took him inside and scored easily on a 24-yard play.
The next quarter, going against Cowboys second-teamers, Bledsoe
decided that he was going to pass to tight end Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod Rutledge tried to come in the game on that play, but Ben
sent him out,'' Bledsoe said with a smile. ``That should have been
the first clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things have changed since Bledsoe's rookie season. But he
has consistently gone to Coates when he needs to make a play. He
saw him in the back of the end zone from 6 yards away and found him
again Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. It would be the Patriots' final score of the
half and give them 21 points in the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the essential Bledsoe story is that an offense which he
directs will not have to suffer for long. I think of the 1994
season when I say that. That's when a young Bledsoe threw for 4,555
yards _ the eighth highest single-season total in NFL history _ and
25 touchdowns. He threw to men named Leroy Thompson, Kevin Turner,
Vincent Brisby, Coates, and Michael Timpson. For much of that
season, the starting running back was Marion Butts. Now, he is
surrounded by upgrades. He still has Coates and Brisby, but has
added Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, and a much more confident Troy Brown.
He has Tony Simmons and Kevin Faulk, too. He also has his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Have you looked and listened to Bledsoe lately? He's not so much
of a kid anymore. When he first arrived in town, he was a single
man with a girlfriend who lived out of town. Now the girlfriend is
his wife, and they have a couple of children together.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be clear that he has helped his coaches just as
much as they have helped him. Parcells, a lover of the ground game,
is the coach who watched Bledsoe throw a league-record 691 times in
'94. Carroll, seemingly questioned about his job since he got to
town, simply handed the offense to Bledsoe (and coordinator Ernie
Zampese) and told him to create. That's smart. Bledsoe knows how to
throw. He knows how to throw well. That is indisputable. It can be
argued that he knows how to throw well, even when he is laughing at
his critics.

JONES BELIEVES RIGHT CARD PLAYED WITH LAW 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He is the father of Salary Cap Poker in the
National Football League and keeps a wary eye on all of the other
card players.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones knows better than anyone when to hold them, when to
fold them, and when to grab someone else's discards.
</P>
<P>
   So he watched the most recent ``big play'' in the NFL, the
Patriots' generous seven-year, $50 million contract, with a $14
million signing bonus, to cornerback Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them a thumbs up on that one,'' said Jones, the Dallas
Cowboys owner who isn't always so generous with his praise when it
comes to the way other teams spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three or four teams in this league that continue to
baffle me,'' said Jones Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, prior to his team's
exhibition game with the Patriots at Foxboro Stadium. ``These teams
continually give out big contracts to players who play positions
that do not warrant being paid what I call home run money.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there are four positions on your club where the big
money should go, and one of those is cornerback, which is why I
applaud the Patriots for what they have done with Law. He is one of
the best in the game. They have locked him up for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the four key positions are quarterback, left tackle,
cornerback, and wide receiver. But still, you don't give those guys
the big contracts unless you consider them Hall of Fame kind of
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our club. We've got Troy Aikman at quarterback. He's
got three Super Bowl victories to his credit already. And we feel
he can still play six or seven years and be productive. So he
deserves the big money we have paid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion Sanders, when he is healthy, is the best cornerback in
football. When we signed him away from San Francisco in free
agency, he won us a Super Bowl. And any time you win a Super Bowl,
making that kind of acquisition, regardless of the price, it is
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only win the championship, but you make your team
special off the field as well as in the eyes of the fans. The
perception of how people think of you as a team is very important
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``At running back and wide receiver we tied up Emmitt Smith and
Michael Irvin with big contracts when their time cam up. I think
Emmitt still has from three to five years of good play left; and
Irvin has several. I can't put a number on him as easily. Larry
Allen, who we signed as a left tackle, is considered by many people
the best offensive lineman in the game. Every one of these players
I mentioned has a chance at the Hall of Fame in my opinion, so this
is where we put our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and son Steve, the Cowboys' director of player personnel,
have enjoyed a close relationship with Patriots owner Bob Kraft and
his sons, Jonathan and Dan. When Kraft bought the Patriots six
years ago, he was smart enough to have his sons visit Dallas and
spend time keeping up with the Joneses on how to operate a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home in Dallas we have a setup in our building where we
chart every team in the league and what they are doing. When anyone
makes a personnel move, whether it is a signing or letting someone
go, we study it and have our own opinion on whether they have made
a good move or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots have been doing the right thing. They've been
giving the money to the people they should be giving it to and
letting guys go who in our opinion should be let go because it
would not have been smart to give them the kind of money they were
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys have spent $180 million in signing
bonuses over the past nine years and feels they have played the
salary cap game well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three Super Bowls and if it wasn't for free agency
coming in when it did, we would have had a few more in our
opinion,'' he said. ``Because we had so many outstanding football
players, young players as well, on those championship teams, we had
to make a lot of critical decisions on who to keep and who to let
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it right, you have to put your own value on every
player. Sometimes the player can get a lot more money from some
other team than you think he is worth. This is when you have to
bite the bullet and let him go. We've had more than our share of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in our opinion we have kept the core of our impact players
_ Aikman, Sanders, Allen, Smith, Irvin. We have 10 players still
left from our first Super Bowl team and 15 more from our last. Yet
we still have one of the youngest teams in the league because most
of the rest of the players on our squad have three years or less
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think we are on the way down as a team. I don't
think that way at all. Now we have made our share of mistakes. We
didn't get the production out of Charles Haley that we thought we
would get from the money we gave him on his last contract with us.
I still can't believe he is back and playing football in San
Francisco. Jay Novacek cost us because he got hurt and couldn't
play again. Same with Tony Tolbert. There is no way you can predict
injury, but you have to be accountable for them and move on. In
this business you can't guess on something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all important that when it is time to make a decision on
a player, like New England had to do this time with Law, you have
the courage to pull the trigger. You can't second-guess yourself.
And you can't fold and be fearful of what might happen. You have to
give the player a contract and move on. When the time comes to
dance, you have to pay the fiddler. We just had to roll the dice
with Deion. He has had a serious foot injury and we had to decide
whether to extend his contract or cut our losses if he can't play
again the way he used to play. We decided to extend. If he doesn't
make it, we move on. Fortunately, we had been able to make some
accommodations in some contracts, that if it doesn't work out the
way we hoped, we get hurt but we don't get buried. If Deion can't
make it, it will hurt but we will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he has no regrets over the way he has played his
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When free agency came in, we (owners) thought we had a hard
cap,'' said Jones, ``and I wished we really didn't. But then San
Francisco started playing with a soft cap and if we wanted to stay
competitive we had to start making some moves of our own. And we
did. But let me say this, after enough years of doing this, we are
back to a hard cap. Most of us have paid out so much money in
up-front bonuses, we can't stretch too much anymore. There are only
so many times you can keep on restructuring contracts before you
run out of room. Each year it seems like you have fewer dollars to
work with so it becomes more important each season that you make
the right calls on how to spend the money.''

ROOKIE'S OUTING IS PASSABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This time he looked comfortable. This time
he seemed to belong on the field. This time Patriots rookie Andy
Katzenmoyer displayed a hint of the linebacker he may become.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Katzenmoyer showed marked improvement from last
week. Improvement in a rookie from week to week is the true
barometer by which to judge his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable out there,'' said Katzenmoyer, who played
nearly three quarters in the Patriots' 34-14 exhibition victory
over the Cowboys Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Foxboro Stadium. ``Except for
my run reads, I felt I had a good handle on what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie was thrust into the starting role when Patriots
mainstay Ted Johnson suffered a torn biceps tendon earlier this
month. In the Patriots first exhibition game nine days ago,
Katzenmoyer at times looked lost on the field _ as did the entire
defense against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all embarrassed by the loss to the Redskins,'' said
Katzenmoyer. ``This time we wanted to come out flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedy Bruschi symbolized the physical attitude of the defensive
unit by knocking Emmitt Smith 2 yards back in the first quarter,
and while Katzenmoyer was not as physical as his teammates, he
seemed to know his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go out there and take my time and do my
job,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``It's been a long week of staying and
working hard on the field for me and all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement of Katzenmoyer's play was most evident in pass
coverage. In the first quarter, for instance, the rookie was a
virtual shadow on Dallas tight end David LaFleur. And when Troy
Aikman threw a bullet over the middle toward LaFleur, Katzenmoyer
leaped and knocked away the pass, forcing the Cowboys to punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``LaFleur's really tall and I had to jump for the ball,'' said
the Patriots' rookie. ``And I was happy to be where I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer also made a key play in the first half when his
number was called on a blitz. He forced Aikman into a hurried throw
on third down. ``I was kind of surprised because nobody picked me
up and I sort of hesitated when I got near Aikman,'' said
Katzenmoyer. ``But I guess he had to rush his throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll said he won't be able to give a full
evaluation until the usual coachly review of the tape, but Carroll
saw enough to say the rookie had improved markedly from his first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer ``came through and he did some nice things out
there,'' said Carroll. ``His getting better is important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being very effective at pass coverage,
Katzenmoyer also made several plays on run defense. The rookie made
a crisp tackle on Tarik Smith in the first half. And was seldom
seen out of position. ``I'm trying,'' said the rookie. ``But we
still have a long way to go. At times I felt comfortable out there
and at times I didn't. But I felt more comfortable than I did last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie said he was proud of his pass coverage and that he
has to do better against the run. ``I like to be versatile,
covering passes and stuffing the run. And I feel the more versatile
I am the better I'll be. Right now, I just want to go out there and
do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the rookie made some plays that stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said Katzenmoyer, ``I have to keep on making those
plays.''

WEAVER LIFTS TIGERS OVER ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Tigers are 27 games out of first place.
They have the worst record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Weaver was feeling pennant-size goosebumps on his arms
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 friends and family members in attendance, the
Simi Valley High graduate tossed seven shutout innings and won for
the first time since May 27 as the Tigers beat the Anaheim Angels
5-0 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a breath of fresh air to start over again,''
said Weaver, winless in 13 consecutive starts. ``It feels like I
have my feet back on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Tigers and Angels are 49 games out. At this point,
they are playing to salvage what little pride they have remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver didn't have to search hard for his incentive. With
his parents in attendance for the first time since his major-league
debut April 14, the 1998 No. 1 draft choice allowed three hits and
struck out a career-high seven batters in breaking his six-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver allowed just three singles, walked two and hit a batter.
Only one Angel, Orlando Palmeiro, got as far as second base against
Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was locking up right-handed hitters like he did at the
beginning of the season,'' Tigers manager Larry Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were shut out for the 10th time this season. Only the
Tigers (11) have been blanked more often.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn failed to match Weaver,
surrendering a run in the third inning and losing his composure in
the fourth when he gave up two singles and a double, then issued
four-pitch walks to Damion Easley and Bill Haselman _ all without
recording an out.
</P>
<P>
   The second of those walks forced home the Tigers' third run and
drove Washburn (0-2) from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I exploded, didn't I?'' Washburn said. ``I can't explain it. I
thought I had pretty good stuff, but in the fourth, I just blew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn allowed three runs on six hits and two walks in
three-plus innings. His line would have been worse had not reliever
Al Levine come in with no outs and stranded all three baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels like the fact that Washburn is young, left-handed and
can throw three pitches _ fastball, curve and changeup. But he
hasn't escaped the fourth inning in either of his two starts this
year, and his ERA has risen to 8.56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't feel any different than last year,'' Washburn
said. ``I'm not intimidated to be in the big leagues. I've been
here before and I've been successful. But my command has been
terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that I'm not pitching very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a nightmare for normally sure-handed Angels
shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who committed a career-high three errors
and admitted after the game that he was suffering from a dead
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina bounced a throw in the first inning and committed two
gaffes in the eighth. He threw wide to the bag on a Juan
Encarnacion grounder, then bounced a potential double-play ball off
his chest, loading the bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina was hit by a pitch on the shoulder last week in
Chicago, and he tweaked the arm again while making a diving play
Friday night. He probably won't be in the lineup today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty helpless feeling when you have a ball in your
hand and don't know how to get it over there,'' DiSarcina said.
``It's a pretty sure sign something's sore.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina wasn't about to ask out of the game, but after the
third miscue, he glanced toward the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when hockey teams pull their goalies?'' he said.
``That did cross my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina committed nine errors in his first 51 games this
season, and made 14 errors all of last season. The three errors
were the most by an Angel since shortstop Spike Owen made three
against Texas on Aug. 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson pinch-hit for DiSarcina leading off the eighth.

AFTER FALL, GLENN SHAKEN, BUT STIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There was silence when there should have
been cheers Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, because you can't cheer while you're
holding your breath.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the second quarter of a meaningless exhibition
game with Dallas that the Patriots were dominating when the air
went out of New England's football fans. Terry Glenn had just made
a leaping catch on the sidelines for a 26-yard gain _ his fifth
catch of the night _ and he tumbled to the ground in apparently
unspectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He fell down, people thought at first. Happens all the time in
this game. So what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Then Glenn didn't get up, and it got awfully quiet in
Foxborough. The fans have seen what happens to the Patriots'
offense when Glenn doesn't get up. When he doesn't get up for a
long time, the offense doesn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn lay motionless on the 16-yard line, flat on his back
just 19 yards from where Pete Carroll stood stunned, stiff, and
staring downfield at a crumpled heap of hope, two doctors sprinted
into action. They squatted down and spoke with Glenn, but the
fragile touchdown maker didn't move. The silence grew more
frightful.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had just spent nearly half a game making obvious to even
the most untutored observer why he remains the most important
Patriot on offense this side of Drew Bledsoe. Glenn had already
turned poor Kevin Mathis inside out like a reversible raincoat
twice, beating the Cowboys' cornerback upfield on a 21-yard fade
route two minutes into the game and then toasting him with one
quick outside step and then an inside fly by that the Blue Angels
couldn't have executed any faster a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   On the latter play, Mathis never caught up to Glenn as he pulled
in a 24-yard touchdown pass from Bledsoe that gave the Patriots
their second score, 38 seconds after they'd gotten the ball back
from the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Glenn had accounted for 85 receiving yards, a 17
yards-per-catch average on a slippery track. He had left his fans
bellowing his name after he had slowly walked over to the ones who
filled the end zone stands to exchange hugs and smiles after his
touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   But now Glenn was on his back _ a position he's been in more
often than he's been in the end zone the last two seasons _ and no
one was smiling anymore. Hyperventilating, perhaps, but not
smiling, because the season was on the ground on a wet August night
and no eyes could look away, although none could bear to watch,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a weapon when he's on the field,'' Bledsoe said
later. ``If this had been a regular-season game, they never would
have blitzed the way they did and left Terry one-on-one with those
corners like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it was Deion (Sanders at corner), they wouldn't have
taken those chances. Now other teams will see what happened, and
they won't take those chances, either.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the power of Glenn when he's healthy, which is why
Carroll surely was thinking of the broken ankle last year that
sidelined Glenn and the repeated pulled hamstrings that hamstrung
New England's offense for too much of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As Carroll waited and watched, he thought what everyone in the
stands and Bob Kraft up in the owner's box were surely thinking,
whether he was ready to admit it later or not. He was thinking the
only thing you could think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' would be the polite way to categorize what was
surely running through his mind, although that's probably not a
literal translation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, slowly, Glenn got up. It is the only thing he does slowly,
but he finally did it, and a sigh echoed throughout the stadium,
briefly blowing away the gathering gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Under his own power, Glenn walked to the sidelines, sat down on
the bench, and was surrounded by medical attendants and concerned
teammates. Among them stood the grizzled veteran Ben Coates, who
has played with more pain in his career than Evel Knievel ever did.
</P>
<P>
   He stood over Glenn for a while, saying little but offering the
kind of support your big brother gives you the first time you learn
for real what a punch in the nose feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You better get up,' '' Coates joked later. ``He
don't always get up, you know, but we need him to. He jumps so damn
high all the time that when he comes down, sometimes he can land
kind of funny. I need him to get up to get that double coverage off
of me. He can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With similar thoughts on the minds of most of his teammates,
Glenn finally leaned back and smiled as the stadium lights
reflected off his diamond earring. When he did, Coates was
satisfied and walked away. Minutes later, The Season was wearing a
Patriots' cap and sitting alone on the bench, safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all right,'' Glenn assured the world soon after, a smile
on his face. ``I just came down awkward and hit my head. Nothing's
wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's wrong, Glenn said, and all New England started
breathing again. The storm had passed. Although he would not play
again Saturday night, Glenn was what the Patriots most needed.
</P>
<P>
   He was in one piece.

MCGINEST RACKS UP A SACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Dallas Cowboys backup quarterback Jason
Garrett dropped back to pass from shotgun formation on third down
Saturday night. Willie McGinest closed in. The Patriots' hulking
defensive lineman got the signal-caller in his grasp, held on while
fighting off a block, then pulled Garrett to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions concerning McGinest's rehabilitation from
offseason groin surgery were answered there.
</P>
<P>
   It was his only contribution to the Patriots' defensive
statistics. But it spoke volumes about the status of the team's
defensive mainstay in his first action of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see Willie make a great play,'' said Patriots
coach Pete Carroll following his team's 34-14 triumph over Dallas.
``We played him like he would have played the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots coach praised his team for rebounding from a dismal
showing last week against Washington, and undoubtedly McGinest's
sack, which stalled a Cowboys second-quarter drive from the Dallas
16-yard line, keyed the defense's charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played for 17 plays,'' said Carroll of McGinest. ``For him,
we had 15-20 plays in mind. I'm really glad to see him make a great
play. I don't know about the rest of his play, but he did well on
third down.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest seemed pleased with his output.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always feels good to get a sack. I knew I had him. I was
just trying not to let go,'' said the former first-round pick from
Southern California. ``It's kind of hard when you've got a
300-pounder on your shoulder. But it's just preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, who is 11th all time in Patriots sacks with 30 1/2,
started the first six games of last season before a nagging groin
injury kept him out of seven of the next nine games.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season with 24 tackles (including seven in the
team's last two games of the season) and ranked fourth on the team
with 3 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, McGinest, who has battled an assortment of injuries
the last two seasons (including hamstring and knee woes in 1997),
had surgery to loosen a groin muscle. He has participated in
practice, but did not play in last week's first exhibition game
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bringing me along the right way,'' said McGinest, who
is looking to start in every game for first time since the 1996
season. He made his only Pro Bowl appearance that year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is waiting to see how the groin will respond to
contact, he fired back, ``I'm not worrying about the groin. I'm not
babying it. I'm out there going hard and I feel healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest keyed a Patriots unit that collected 50 total tackles
and two sacks for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a start for us. We've got a lot more plays,''
McGinest said. ``We're coming together as a defense. We've got a
lot more work.''

ARMSTRONG FEELS IMPACT OF HIS VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DOVER, Vt. _ Lance Armstrong talks a lot about his cycling
_ how could he not, after becoming only the second American to win
the Tour de France? And he talks a lot about his experience
surviving testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But though he's quick to say how much his Tour victory this
summer has meant to the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which he helped
found a year and a half ago, he's less eager to brag about his
personal impact on cancer patients _ how he contacts them, or what
he says.
</P>
<P>
   It comes out, though. One example of his work behind the scenes
showed up last month when he appeared on ``Good Morning America''
to talk about his Tour win. There via satellite was a little girl
in a hospital in Texas, a cancer patient whom Armstrong presented
with a mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship started about a year ago, when Armstrong went
to yet another autograph session in his hometown of Austin, Texas.
He greeted thousands of bike fans and some cancer patients, all of
whom had followed his incredible return to racing.
</P>
<P>
   As he spent a few hours saying hello and signing pictures, one
image kept nagging Armstrong. It was of the little girl who had
been first in line, who told the cyclist that she herself had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After he left the store, Armstrong said he had to get in touch
with her, but had no idea how. So he called every hospital in the
city searching for a Kelly Davidson and finally discovered the
12-year-old had been a patient at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two have become pen pals. Armstrong sent her a
road bicycle last Christmas, and he presented her with another bike
on ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong tries to answer all the e-mails he gets from people
who contact him though his Web site (www.laf.org). But he does that
surreptitiously, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't hear from the patients themselves, but from a
friend or relative,'' he said. ``So when I e-mail them, they're
amazed at how I got their address.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Armstrong wants to limit his letters to patients who
are suffering from the same kind of cancer he had, he's hearing
from people who have faced all kinds of obstacles. Like the man who
was trying in vain to lose weight and couldn't get himself to start
running until he was inspired when he saw Armstrong win the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been home only briefly, as his visit to the States
has included trips to New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, but
he's aware of how many people have been in touch with the
foundation wanting to make donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour has been fantastic for the foundation,'' he said.
``The phones just kept ringing, they didn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made a video appearance earlier this month when he
delivered a greeting to riders in Sturbridge, Mass., about to set
out on the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge to raise money for the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's modest about his work, he's not modest about why his
feat has turned him into a role model. He knows his cycling
comeback serves as an example to people to show they can overcome
hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proven that we can survive, and it's proven that there
are success stories in a sad situation sometimes,'' he said. ``And
that we have to deal with those things now, of surviving, and
returning to life, returning to our family, and returning to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that, aside from the illness itself, one of the
most debilitating consequences of cancer is the feeling of despair
that attacks the patient, even after he or she has recovered. For
him, it meant abandoning a bike race in Europe and returning home
to Texas, where he kept his bike packed up in the garage for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy being a sick person and being treated,'' he
said. ``Because when you come out and realize maybe you're going to
live, then what are you going to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you deserve a vacation, or you deserve to win
the lottery, or something like that, but it doesn't always
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In his case, something big did happen with the Tour win, but
Armstrong insists he hasn't changed from the person he was a year
ago. Even though his whirlwind tour home has included a visit with
President Clinton at the White House and an appearance on the David
Letterman show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's been more hectic, but to be honest, I look at myself
the same way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he said, he hopes the Tour victory won't make him _ or
the fans _ overly confident about a repeat victory next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that next year, when I'm training in the spring and
getting ready for the Tour, that I can approach it like I did last
year,'' he said. ``That person was an outsider, who nobody expected
to win the Tour. I hope I can still approach it with the same
hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   That hunger is what has brought Armstrong to Mount Snow, where
he's trying another kind of bike racing. For the rest of the
season, in fact, Armstrong has put aside his road bike and is
focusing on mountain bike racing. After Vermont, he'll ride the
Tour of the Rockies stage race at the end of the month in Steamboat
Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he might resume off-road races next year,
Armstrong quashed any speculation that he might try to go to the
Olympics in Sydney for both road racing and mountain bike racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't deserve to go,'' said Armstrong, who hopes to
represent the United States in the road race time trial. But not on
the mountain, though Armstrong has more than proven his ability
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys _ the best Americans _ are better than me,'' he
said. ``So I'm really not considering that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Armstrong can revel in being the best American _ make
that the best rider _ in the most prestigious bike race in the
world.

MINOR SETBACK FOR RAMON MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I. _ In his days with the Dodgers, righthander
Ramon Martinez was a legend. Saturday night, he was all too human.
</P>
<P>
   On his latest stop on the comeback trail, Martinez, 31, took
such a pounding from the Triple A Buffalo Bisons that it appears
just wishful thinking that he will resume his major league career
in time to help the Red Sox in their wild-card chase. To most of
the 7,156 who braved the cold and steady drizzle at McCoy Stadium,
the one positive thing he did in the Pawtucket Red Sox' 6-1 loss
was show up on time. No controversy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, however, merely shrugged off his poor performance in
which he gave up six hits, including three home runs, and lasted
just five innings. He clung to the fact that the Bison only got to
him in the second and third innings, saying the rest of the time he
had good command. He threw 77 pitches, walked two, and struck out
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of progress was made,'' said Martinez, who made
the ninth start of his rehabilitation program. ``I gave up a couple
of homers. But the way I feel about the way I threw overall is very
good. I'll be ready for one more start down here in five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three starts I pitched good. But tonight I was
facing a different level. Some major league batters. Even though I
gave up the home runs and walked a couple of guys I didn't worry
about the score. I was worried about how I feel and how I
responded. I said to myself I didn't want to give up the four runs.
It kind of challenged me. That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up home runs to three former Red Sox farmhands _
Bill Selby, Jeff Manto, and Mark Whiten. The first two wouldn't
have left Fenway Park; the one by Whiten was last seen heading
toward Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiten is a guy with a lot of power,'' said Martinez. ``I've
faced him before and the pitch I threw didn't go where I wanted it.
That's usually what happens when you make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that unlike his outings against the other minor
league clubs (Single A and Double A) this one tested him, and he is
anxious to see the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``My delivery hasn't changed,'' he said. ``But sometimes I get
lazy a little bit and lose my location. I wasn't real consistent.
But I feel much better about the last couple of innings. At the
moment, no one expects me to throw at 95 miles an hour. This is
going to take a little time. I won't get my 95 back again, but I
might be able to throw 92. I've been throwing in the high 80s and
that should be good enough to get some people out. I will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez thinks he's right on schedule for a return to the big
leagues. One more start should get him to Boston. That decision
will be up to Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette and vice
president of scouting Wayne Britton, who were both in the stands
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Neither was available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some movement on the ball,'' said Martinez. ``That's not
a problem. I have to make some mental adjustments because I don't
have my full fastball. Once you hit the location, it doesn't matter
how hard you throw. Today I threw the changeup and slider for
strikes. I'm not like my brother (Pedro) who can throw three or
four pitches for strikes. I'll let it go but I can throw harder
than I did today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worry a little. You don't want to start at 90-92 miles an
hour and get hurt. But I can handle it. With the kind of stuff I
have right now, I can pitch. A lot of guys throw 80-82 miles an
hour with good location, good breaking pitches. That's all you
need. I've been around long enough to know how to handle myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had been building up to this start since June 21, when
he began his rehabilitation program. Before that he was limited to
throwing on the sideline. His first assignment was a two-inning
stint for Lowell against the New Jersey Cardinals. And even though
he struck out three batters, the Sox were in no hurry to rush him.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was the Gulf Coast Rookie League, where during a
17-day stint Martinez made four starts, pitching 13 innings with a
1.38 earned run average. In August, he moved to Single A Sarasota
of the Florida State League. There he had a 1-0 record in 12
innings of work. In his last start for Sarasota, Martinez worked
five innings in an 8-3 victory over the Port St. Lucie Mets. In
eight starts in his rehabilitation program, he was 2-0 with a 2.00
ERA. He had 27 strikeouts and 10 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, Martinez seemed to be on his game in the first
inning, facing only four batters _ he issued a walk to Selby. But
the next two innings were a nightmare. The first batter he faced,
Chris Turner, he hit with a pitch. Then he walked third baseman
Russell Branyan. A single to right by Whiten loaded the bases.
Turner and Branyan scored on ground outs.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo made it 6-0 in the third. Martinez's stuff didn't fool
anyone, allowing the home runs to Selby, Manto, and Whiten.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished strong,'' said Pawtucket manager Gary Jones, ``He
seemed to turn it up a little bit the last two innings and threw
the ball pretty good. He located his pitches and kept it down in
the zone. I know it's not the majors but guys at the Triple A level
have a lot of experience. They can do a lot of damage.''

IRWINDALE PIT FIRE LEAVES TWO CREW MEMBERS HURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Austin Cameron became the ninth winner in 10
NASCAR Winston West events Saturday night in a race marred when two
Norris Racing crew members were burned in a spectacular pit
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Butts of Buena Park and Dave Valdez, residence unknown,
were transported to two area hospitals. There conditions were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   First-time NWWS driver Manabu Orido of Yokohama, Japan, spun on
the entrance to the pits, tapping the outside wall. He turned
around, reached his pits just past the starting line and was taking
on fuel when the rear of the car exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, a crew member for Eric Norris' car, ran over from the
next-door pits to help clear other crew members and a rolling tire
that was briefly on fire. He was taken to USC County Hospital via
helicopter. Butts, who was the Orido fuel man, was transported to
Arcadia Methodist Hospital via ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez rolled across the asphalt on pit road, trying to put out
the fire, as a fellow teammate tried patting him down. He suffered
burns to his face, legs and arms. Butts, 37, was propped behind the
pit wall, suffering from burns to his chest and stomach. Neither
crew member was wearing fire-resistant material and both were in
short-sleeve shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the CART and Formula One series, NASCAR does not make
fire-resistant suits mandatory in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   The $105,644 Snap-On 250 for the benefit of the City of Hope
race was stopped at Lap 146 for five minutes as a L.A. County
Sheriff helicopter was brought in to transport Valdez to the
downtown L.A. hospital, 18 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second most serious accident at the track this
season, the first under race conditions. During practice for
opening night, Mark Desmert of Roseburg, Ore. died when he went
airborne and hit the wall in Turn 4 in a midget car during a
yellow-flag situation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race, before a crowd of 5,857 people, was one of
attrition. There were eight yellow flags, for 88 laps. Seven cars
suffered tire blowouts in the early going, including pole-sitter
Sammy Patashnick. After 80 laps in the 250-lap race, seven of the
27 cars had been eliminated. Only 12 cars finished.
</P>
<P>
   The final caution came with 62 laps remaining, just three laps
after the final stop, when Austin, from El Cajon, took the lead
with the best pit stop. Jeff Murray of Alta Loma, who held off a
spin just out of Turn 1, had a tire go flat in Turn 4, causing a
six-car accident, although it only knocked out Brandon Ash, who
contended for the lead the majority of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Richards led the race going into the final pit stops, but
Cameron got out first with Richards not among the Top 3. But
Richards, from Spokane, Wash., moved right back among the leaders
and challenged Cameron for the lead at the finish. But Cameron used
traffic to hold off Richards for his second win at Irwindale, by
0.516 seconds -- first in Winston West. Cameron had won a Super
Late Model race at Irwindale earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said the Hoosier tires were OK, but third-place
finisher Butch Gilliland said they went flat because they were
running too hard at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real important to lay back and let the tires work,
Gilliland said.

 &HT;    Give Justice covert computer tool
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like a technique the ``Mission Impossible''
superspooks might have employed in their TV heyday: sneaking into a
villain's lair to install some miraculous gadget that would give
them access to his memos, diaries, financial records, etc. _ never
mind the codes he might use to conceal his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the Justice Department is now preparing to do
precisely that. In legislation it has drafted for submission to
Congress soon, Justice will ask for authority to undertake covert
operations to plant devices that will override encryption programs
on targeted suspects' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though many members of Congress are rightfully touchy on privacy
issues, this is one intrusive measure that merits their support.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department makes a plausible argument it needs this
additional power. Encryption software is used increasingly to hide
all manner of criminal activities: terrorist conspiracies, money
laundering, narco-trafficking, computer fraud, transmission of
child pornography. Little by little, this form of coding is
hampering its investigations, Justice maintains.
</P>
<P>
   This is a restrained course of action compared with an earlier
unsuccessful effort by FBI Director Louis Freeh to win legislation
requiring software makers to install so-called ``back doors'' that
would, in effect, allow authorized investigators to go around
encryption barriers. That was overreaching and would have equipped
Justice to cast far and wide on fishing expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Authority for this new, covert initiative is strictly limited.
Approval must be given by a federal judge in the same manner he
would issue a wiretap order. By the way, recourse to eavesdropping
orders is infrequent; only 34 warrants were issued last year
allowing officers to enter a home or business to install a wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   This time it appears Justice is right in insisting its proposal
is ``consistent with constitutional principles.'' Just the same, if
and when it gets Congress' OK, the department should make it a
point to use this new investigative tool sparingly _ only when
absolutely essential.
</P>

Constitution).

 &HT;    Once again, networks bungle time slots
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ What can you say about a network that takes one of the
most promising new series of the season and schedules it in such a
suicidal manner that even viewers who fall in love with it won't be
able to find it after the first few weeks?
</P>
<P>
   ABC's bizarre plan for ``Once and Again,'' the romantic
comedy-drama from the creators of ``thirtysomething,'' isn't the
only lame-brain scheduling move, but it's one of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks are hemorrhaging viewers like crazy, and
yet stupid scheduling tricks continue. You'd think they'd try to
make it easier, not harder, for people to find the few good shows
that are on the air. But noooooo. ...
</P>
<P>
   Remember last fall, when Fox shifted the wildly popular ``King
of the Hill'' from Sunday, where it was happily paired with ``The
Simpsons,'' to Tuesdays? The animated sitcom from Austin resident
Mike Judge nose-dived in the ratings, falling from a healthy Top 20
perch to somewhere near the bottom of the ratings in a few weeks.
Instead of establishing a hit on Tuesday nights, the network wound
up with a little-watched gem.
</P>
<P>
   At least Fox recognized its blunder. When the new season begins
in September, Hank and the gang will return to Sundays. But the
momentum that ``King of the Hill'' had established during its first
season may be hard to rekindle. Stupid scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's strategy with ``Once and Again'' is considerably more
puzzling. The show, starring Sela Ward and Billy Campbell as
divorced parents starting over in a new romance, has been the buzz
of critics since the tapes were sent out in June. Well-written,
brilliantly acted and warm-hearted, the show is a real bright spot
in an otherwise dull season.
</P>
<P>
   So what does ABC do with its sterling series? The show will
debut in September in the time slot usually occupied by ``NYPD
Blue'' _ Tuesdays at 9 p.m. _ until ``NYPD Blue'' is ready to
return in late October. That's about six weeks. Then ``Once and
Again'' will go off the air until ``Monday Night Football'' departs
in January, leaving a 9 p.m. opening for the new series on Monday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rather unorthodox way to launch a show,'' conceded ABC
entertainment President Jamie Tarses in Los Angeles recently.
``We're profoundly aware there's great risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Great risk that millions of people will fall in love
with ``Once and Again'' and then lose interest during its
three-month layoff. Why not risk a new show that isn't generating
as much buzz, like ``Wasteland,'' the umpteenth take on
twentysomethings trying to find themselves? Or an existing show
with an established audience that might be more likely to remember
it after a three-month absence?
</P>
<P>
   NBC has pulled a stupid scheduling trick, too. Against the
strenuous objections of the show's producer, the network has put
the ``Law &AMP; Order'' spinoff in an 8 p.m. time slot, where it
definitely should not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' focuses on sex crimes
cases, usually murders with a sexual twist. In the pilot, a man who
committed multiple rapes is murdered by his victims and has his
penis cut off. This is appropriate material for 8 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing NBC for a later slot,'' producer Dick Wolf told
critics in Pasadena, Calif., recently. ``Feel free to help me. This
is not designed to be an 8 o'clock show. It's not appropriate for
that hour. It's a very adult drama.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like NBC doesn't have an easy way out of this quagmire.
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' is scheduled to air Mondays,
followed by an episode of ``Dateline NBC'' at 9 p.m. So, switch the
two shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes a damn bit of difference what time
`Dateline' airs,'' Wolf snarled angrily. ``It's on five times a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast, said he thought ``Law
&AMP; Order'' will be fine in the earlier time period and will ``carry
an appropriate content rating.'' Big help.
</P>
<P>
   Single and childless adults may be available for an extremely
adult drama at 8 p.m., but people with kids will not want to sit
down to watch this show while the youngsters are wafting through
the room. It's hard to imagine that fans of ``Law &AMP; Order'' will
flock to this spinoff at such an early hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bad scheduling can kill a show before it gets started and drive
viewers away after it's on the air. Last year's annoying habit of
throwing series into reruns after four or five new episodes rankled
more than a few people, especially with shows like ``NYPD Blue''
and ``ER'' that have continuing storylines.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody (hey, I'll be the one!) should tell these network
nitwits to take advantage of good programming when they've got it,
not hammer a stake through its heart.

A SHOWCASE FOR DRAMA HAS A MIDDLE-AGE BOUT WITH AN IDENTITY
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was designed with grand goals: to be America's
national theater, on the level of the Old Vic in England or the
Comedie Francaise; to be a repertory theater with an impressive
troupe of actors in productions from the classic to the avante
garde.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Lincoln Center Theater approaches the 35th anniversary
of its main stage, no one would say it has fulfilled that vision.
Instead, it has accumulated an oddly checkered record, creating
unassailable hits and unequivocal flops; attracting respected
leaders and testing their reputations, and going dark for six years
while its management fought over its future.
</P>
<P>
   Given this rocky past, the theater _ which includes the
1,000-seat Vivian Beaumont and the 300-seat Mitzi E. Newhouse _ has
come a long way; last season its productions were nominated for 16
Tony Awards and won 2. Nevertheless the contradictions in its
identity and mission persist.
</P>
<P>
   As he enters his eighth season as artistic director, Andre
Bishop _ who was the crown prince of nonprofit theater after
producing hits like ``Sunday in the Park With George,'' ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' and ``Falsettos'' in his 17 years at Playwrights
Horizons _ is feeling the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard road for me,'' he said, talking at his
Greenwich Village home. ``I was used to being everybody's
darling.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The problem for anyone who has the job that I
have is everyone wants Lincoln Center Theater to do what they want
you to do. At the same time, one cannot be all things to all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Lincoln Center Theater's coming season seems to
typify the poles it is pulled between. In December, ``Marie
Christine'' a new musical by the young composer Michael John
LaChiusa, is to open. Later in the season the theater plans to
produce ``Time of the Cuckoo,'' Arthur Laurents' 1952 drama.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, who has served as executive producer since
1985, with Gregory Mosher before Bishop, said these extremes were
simply emblematic of the theater's range, which Bishop is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up and spent his entire life at one theater, which had
a very discrete mission: the discovery, nurturing and development
of new American plays,'' Gersten said. ``When he came to Lincoln
Center, the mission altered. He was charged with running a theater
that had one 1,000-seat house and one 300-seat house, and making
them work. And he couldn't operate with the same repertoire and the
same playwrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda LeRoy Janklow, chairwoman of the theater's board,
dismissed the idea that it is a national theater, saying it can be
only the expression of an artistic director. ``You go with his
vision,'' she said. ``It has always been thus.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bishop, 50, gives the impression of being under siege,
this in part reflects his self-abnegating personality, and he said
he welcomed the challenge. ``I wanted to throw myself up against
the lions again,'' he said. ``And I was so lucky to go to Lincoln
Center. Even though, boy, you never rest easy up there. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, diminutive and scholarly, said he was proud of his
accomplishments, particularly with the Beaumont, a theater
complicated by acoustic and sightline problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the job I thought the big challenge was the
Beaumont,'' Bishop said. ``No other management has made it work.
What has been achieved there is continuity, enthusiasm, productions
of very high quality and the best directors in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say the theater is in the difficult position of
trying to be a nonprofit operation that makes bold artistic choices
and a Tony-eligible entity that plays in the big leagues. (Lincoln
Center Theater also produces plays in Broadway houses, like David
Hare's ``Via Dolorosa'' last season.) And that, combined with its
central location, powerful board and Lincoln Center cachet leaves
the theater subject to greater scrutiny and tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   With two sizable theaters, there are many seats to fill and
48,000 members to satisfy, each of whom pays $35 a year and $30 a
ticket. And like any nonprofit theater, Lincoln Center's must pay
its bills, which are high, with production costs that rival those
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're under the gun all the time,'' said the Broadway
producer Emanuel Azenberg. ``They have the same costs and the same
difficulties that the commercial theater has except they can't
afford failure.''
</P>
<P>
   And, theater professionals say, it is considerably harder to
develop work quietly with a budget of $20 million to $26 million at
Lincoln Center Theater than it was at the 140-seat Playwrights
Horizons, with a $4 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is also up against the challenge for every nonprofit
theater, particularly those with aging subscribers: balancing
artistic risks with financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He and Gersten seem to have the strong support of the board.
``Like picking money managers, you don't look at what they did in
the last five or six months,'' Ms. Janklow said. ``You look at what
they did over the last 10 years. And there's so much exciting and
interesting work that an occasional disappointment, you just chalk
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the board seems to recognize the need to develop
more new straight plays. ``I think the board is now feeling that
perhaps it's good to open our doors a bit wider,'' said Daryl Roth,
the independent producer and a board member. ``I think we'll see
less of the old chestnuts, hopefully, in favor of new American
writers.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some perceive Lincoln Center Theater as increasingly timid and
unexciting. Several producers, agents, reviewers, publicists, and
playwrights say the theater has abandoned its mandate by playing it
safe. Bishop is producing the work of tried-and-true playwrights
rather than gambling on new voices, they say, presenting straight
plays acquired from elsewhere, and in some cases making
compromising commercial alliances like its co-production of
``Parade'' with Livent, whose bankruptcy _ coupled with the
production's mixed reviews _ helped force the show to close.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bishop made his reputation by developing playwrights
like Wendy Wasserstein, Christopher Durang, Jon Robin Baitz and
William Finn, many say he has failed to nurture a comparable crop
of new voices at Lincoln Center, and that he has stuck with people
he knows, with classics and with middle-brow revivals like ``Ah,
Wilderness!'' and ``The Little Foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at Playwrights, he was able to serve the artist
more,'' said James Freydberg, a Broadway producer. ``He's lost
because it's not what he does. What he was so successful at was his
ability to midwife artists and not have them in a situation of
having to please a large audience.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Juan Darien,'' the allegorical puppet show, was a
revival, some producers have pointed out. The theater's acclaimed
revival of ``Carousel'' was an import from London, as was Tom
Stoppard's ``Arcadia.'' And ``Parade'' originated with Livent.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop ``doesn't seem to be doing the kind of new plays that he
did at Playwrights,'' said Robert Brustein, the artistic director
of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and the
theater critic for The New Republic. ``And it puzzles me because he
does have that Mitzi Newhouse. It's a nice theater for new plays,
and he's got impeccable taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, some directors and playwrights have said,
was agreeing last spring to have the musical ``It Ain't Nothin' but
the Blues'' move into the Vivian Beaumont after ``Parade'' closed,
the first time in its history that the theater has simply offered
itself up as real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone the whole hog,'' said John Heilpern, who worked
as an assistant director to Sir Peter Hall at the National Theater
in London and is now theater critic for The New York Observer. ``It
is now apparently a theater for hire, and that's not what it's on
earth for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gersten replied that nonprofit theaters rent their spaces all
the time, and that it cost $30,000 a week to leave the house empty.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some theater executives said that Lincoln Center Theater's
critical ups and downs _ ``The Heiress'' triumphed in 1995, ``God's
Heart'' bombed in 1997 _ have curtailed its artistic courage, that
the hits have trapped the theater into trying to repeat them and
the misses have made the theater nervous about taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the argument goes, Lincoln Center Theater tends to
stick with what works, like having Gerald Gutierrez direct ``Ring
Round the Moon'' and ``Ivanov'' because he directed two hits in a
row _ ``The Heiress'' and ``A Delicate Balance'' _ or like
producing the reliable monologuist Spalding Gray, which the theater
plans to do again next season.
</P>
<P>
   There is generally accepted to be a scarcity of good new work
and every theater is hungry for it. But look at off-Broadway,
others counter, and there is strong material on which Lincoln
Center has missed out: ``Wit,'' ``Side Man,'' ``This Is Our
Youth,'' ``Killer Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that they are afraid of breaking in new American
playwrights at their theater,'' said one young playwright who
insisted on anonymity. ``They worry that the scale of their
productions and the scrutiny those productions undergo can place
too much pressure on a new playwright. Why they don't try to do
productions on a smaller scale, I can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This debate, however, may be Lincoln Center Theater's
birthright. In 1958 several theater professionals were asked to
weigh in with their ideas for the new theater in The New York Times
Magazine. Tyrone Guthrie, the director, wrote, ``A repertory
theater should not indulge in the highly speculative business of
producing new work,'' adding that a national theater, like a
national picture gallery, ``must keep a selection of great
masterpieces constantly in view.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the actress Cornelia Otis Skinner suggested, ``A
theater presenting only the classics or near-classics would soon
take on the character of a museum, and while there is nothing wrong
with museums, the aims of a good repertory should be toward growth
and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his predecessors _ Elia Kazan and Robert Whitehead and
then Herbert Blau and Jules Irving _ Joseph Papp took over in 1973,
vowing to bring new American playwrights, black authors and rock
musicals to the stage. Subscribers canceled, and Papp left in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under Richmond Crinkley, the theater remained dark for six
of his seven years while the board sparred with Lincoln Center Inc.
over various issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mosher gets credit for reviving the theater in 1985, he
was called too Broadway-conscious because of crowd-pleasing
productions like ``Anything Goes'' and ``Speed-the-Plow,'' starring
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the work of new writers belongs in smaller theaters,
not in big ones like the Vivian Beaumont. ``Developing new writers
is a private process and should be protected and nurtured, not
thrown out into the limelight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said one of his dreams was to have a third,
black-box space ``away from it all'' for developing new writers.
</P>
<P>
   If he is producing plays with mass appeal, Bishop said, it is
because he genuinely likes them. ``I have never considered myself
to be a radical,'' he said. ``I've always been attracted to
individual, idiosyncratic writers, but popular writers.''
</P>
<P>
   His theater gets points for producing new musicals like last
season's ``Parade,'' which won two Tony awards. And it has earned
the respect of some Broadway producers, including Rocco Landesman,
president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who in 1988 publicly accused
Lincoln Center of betraying its raison d'etre by being ruled by the
box office. ``I would like to see fewer British imports and more
American plays,'' he said. ``But Andre has brought a coherent
artistic sensibility to that enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he was committed to doing new work, even if it is
the work of his old friends. He said he planned to produce new
plays by Tina Howe, Ms. Wasserstein and Baitz.
</P>
<P>
   Members of his old guard say Bishop should be commended for this
loyalty. ``I am moved by the fact that this man continues to
believe in me,'' Baitz said. ``When I finish writing a play, there
are three people that I give it to, and Andre is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Richard Greenberg added: ``Do we want playwrights
to have opportunities when they're young and nowhere to go when
they're old and mature? Not every theater should be about what the
28-year-olds are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he felt the heat and has done his share of
hand-wringing. But he also said he must ultimately trust his
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said that being an artistic director is the
intelligent exercise of one's own taste,'' Bishop said. ``And that
is what I believe with all my heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you start second-guessing yourself in advance, I
think you're done for.''

`GROWN-UPS': URKEL &AMP; CO. COULD BE A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The show is called ``Grown-Ups.'' Its star, 22-year-old Jaleel
White, has clearly filled up and out since his days as the geeky
Steve Urkel on ``Family Matters,'' a role he began at 12. But just
in case anybody still doesn't get the message, early in the first
episode White's character, Calvin, says to his lifelong buddy,
Gordon (Dave Ruby), ``We're not kids anymore.'' Duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these protestations to the contrary, however, there
is more than a little of the young Urkel in the not-so-old Calvin.
Sure, White has shed the nasal honk, eyeglasses, suspenders and
ill-fitting clothes. But inside his well-tailored business suit, he
is still the goodhearted misfit, a guy who still can't figure out
why everybody else seems to be having much more fun than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown-Ups,'' which begins its run on UPN Monday night, is a
likably gentle sitcom. Nearly every cog in its clockworks has been
borrowed from another show. Even the character of Calvin, the
very-junior executive who can't quite believe he has landed in the
business world, isn't very far from the role played on ``Working''
by Fred Savage, another performing puppy who is publicly growing
into his paws.
</P>
<P>
   This show's promise lies in its casting and curlicues rather
than its concept. As the schlumpy Gordon, Ruby strikes the right
note of anguish, especially when he takes up his grievances
directly with God like some sort of contemporary Tevye. Gordon's
wife, Shari (Marissa Ribisi), is a combination of sultry and ditzy.
(Imagine Madonna as portrayed by Carol Kane.) Couples like this
live only in the sitcom universe. But these two performers seem
ready to put a new spin on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the busy first episode, Calvin finds a new roommate, Shari's
friend Robin, played by Soleil Moon Frye, who used to be a child,
too, and when she was, played the title role in the series ``Punky
Brewster.'' (Can't you see these roomies inviting Savage over for
an evening of swapping nasty stories about Rick Schroder?)
</P>
<P>
   There's also the subplot about Calvin's simmering crush on a
high school classmate who now dates Gordon's colleague. That opens
the way for another curlicue, Calvin's Walter Mittyesque daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   This show, with its snippet of invention and its teaspoonful of
charm, could become a keeper. It seems to know one truth: You never
totally outgrow your inner Urkel.

 &HT;    Lucky guy goes for a spin
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I exhaled and told myself how lucky I was.
The car had started again with only the slightest flick of the key.
</P>
<P>
   The car was parked in an inch of mud about 5 feet from the edge
of a pine forest, not far from a drainage ditch and about 15 yards
from the road.
</P>
<P>
   The road had turned. I had not. In a sudden, driving rain, the
car was frictionlessly suspended on the road's slick, watery
surface and was not responding either to brakes, the steering wheel
or my adamantly delivered suggestions. It was hydroplaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hydroplaning'' is one of those bland technical terms that
describes the physics of a situation without getting across its
essence. Its essence was that I was moving sideways at about 50
miles an hour before spinning like a tilt-a-whirl. The pine trees
smudged past the windshield while oncoming cars honked their horns
to alert me that driving sideways on a county road is a serious
breach of driver etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   I spun once, then twice, as the car left the road and slid
across the wet grass on the shoulder. It jumped the drainage ditch
with a thump that felt like a punch in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   There was a spray of mud and I found myself parked. Facing the
right way. No major damage except for torn-up tires.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky me. As a reporter, I had spent many bored hours
translating accident reports from police jargon to English. I wrote
about cars pulled out of drainage ditches in one-car accidents. I
transcribed official non-explanations like: ``the driver lost
control of the vehicle.'' I chatted with highway patrolmen in the
rain who helpfully pointed out tire marks and in flat voices
theorized about ``oversteering'' and shook their head at ``driver
error.'' I sometimes passed copies of these briefs to obit writers.
Very bad things can happen to a car doing the
tilt-a-whirl-maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   My case was also one of driver error. First: The driver let his
tires go bald, something that has been the case for most of my
adult life. Second: When the car started sliding, the driver
reacted quickly and decisively; which is to say I did everything
precisely wrong. You're not supposed to brake hard. You're not
supposed to keep turning the wheel when nothing happens. This is
basic high-school driver's ed.
</P>
<P>
   So, I felt lucky. I hadn't died. The car started again. I was
even able to limp to a nearby tire place.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who have a more exacting definition of luck.
They would see sitting in a car parked in the mud and listing at 15
degrees after spinning across a drainage ditch as something
UNlucky.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same way when lightning struck my house. I felt lucky
my house hadn't caught fire. Others have trouble connecting the
concept of luck with the idea of being hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when my wallet was lost or stolen _ I still don't
know which _ I felt lucky that the cards were accounted for, that
it held only three dollars and that a person carrying my driver's
license didn't shoot the president. Lucked out again.
</P>
<P>
   When you happen onto a situation rich in disastrous
possibilities and come out unscathed, I consider that luck. A lot
of people think of luck as avoiding all situations rich in
disastrous possibilities. That seems like a boring kind of luck. A
no-hits, no-runs, no-errors kind of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Others are very demanding and only see luck in situations when
good things fall from the sky. Lottery luck. Such connoisseurs of
luck tend to feel unlucky all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shallow men believe in luck,'' wrote Emerson in one of his
more frosty and New Englandy moments. ``Strong men believe in cause
and effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But that kind of thinking denies you the exhilaration
of the close call. A thrill that's so life-enriching, that we
sometimes talk ourselves into believing that many near-misses came
closer would seem immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been on that plane,'' we tell ourselves and are
grateful to be alive. I could have run into a tree. I was standing
there only an hour before. ...
</P>
<P>
   Lucky ducks, all of us.
</P>

 &HT;    Tundra ready for big horizons
 &HT;    All-new pickup from Toyota a quiet giant
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1991 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyota may be tardy in coming to the big-pickup game, but its
all-new Tundra is definitely a player.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary will tell you that tundra is a treeless arctic
plain, but your eyes and the seat of your pants will tell you that
a second meaning is a monstrous pickup truck with an engine to
match its size.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has done about everything possible to Americanize the
Tundra, including building it at a new $1.2 billion facility in
Princeton, Ind. The Tundra has the features and some styling cues
of the big trucks marketed by Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge. Building
it in the United States enables Toyota to avoid the import tariff,
so its pricing can be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The base V-6 Tundra lists for about $14,995, while the white
test truck with four doors _ Toyota calls it an ``access cab'' _
and shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive listed for $25,585 and
totaled $29,617 after adding options and destination charge.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.7-liter V-8's advantages are obvious. It generates 245
horsepower at a strangely quiet 4,800 engine revolutions per minute
and 315 pounds-feet of torque at an even-quieter 3,400 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has made the Tundra one of the quietest pickups on or off
the road. At highway speed, which the Tundra manages very easily (0
to 60 mph in about eight seconds), only the stiff ride and firm
seats really remind that this is a truck.
</P>
<P>
   With all that power, it can be a workhorse, too. The payload is
2,000 pounds, and the Tundra can pull about 7,000 pounds. The only
puzzler is why opting for the big engine means settling for a
6.5-foot bed, while the V-6 version can be had with an 8-foot bed.
</P>
<P>
   Its four doors mean the Tundra has a lot of flexibility for
moving people and cargo. Comparison shoppers will note that while
other manufacturers put the handles for the extra doors on the
jamb, Toyota puts them on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seat bottom folds up for access to the jack and other
tools and for storage. The rear doors swing back past a right angle
to provide good access.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin, fairly easy to enter because it has running boards,
is roomy enough, although the seating needs to be refined,
particularly in the rear. Optional cloth captain's chairs give a
good driving position and comfort for one passenger, and there's
plenty of storage with a center console and pockets on all four
doors. A minor annoyance is the optional visor mirrors that lack
covers and can be distracting when the visors are in use.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation, in keeping with Toyota's style, is simple,
and the controls are straightforward. Push buttons and rotary
controls are large and easily operated.
</P>
<P>
   Pound for pound _ and the Tundra's curb weight has about 4,400
of them _ it is a big truck with big power and big potential, but
there's nothing crude or rude about it.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Toyota Tundra two- or four-wheel drive,
four-door pickup
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $29,617 (base: $25,585)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.7-liter V-8 engine with 32 valves (245
horsepower), four-speed automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams, optional
power anti-lock brakes with daytime running lights, $630
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with power windows and
locks, sliding rear window, dual extended sun visors, $1,060;
five-spoke alloy wheels with chrome wheel arches, $600; six-speaker
stereo with CD and cassette players, $250; captain's chairs, $75;
fog lamps, $100; bedliner, $298; carpeted mats, $106; towing hitch
and wiring harness, $435
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 14 mpg regular unleaded city, 17 mpg highway

 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was designed with grand goals: to be America's
national theater, on the level of the Old Vic in England or the
Comedie Francaise; to be a repertory theater with an impressive
troupe of actors in productions from the classic to the avante
garde.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Lincoln Center Theater approaches the 35th anniversary
of its main stage, no one would say it has fulfilled that vision.
Instead, it has accumulated an oddly checkered record, creating
unassailable hits and unequivocal flops; attracting respected
leaders and testing their reputations, and going dark for six years
while its management fought over its future.
</P>
<P>
   Given this rocky past, the theater _ which includes the
1,000-seat Vivian Beaumont and the 300-seat Mitzi E. Newhouse _ has
come a long way; last season its productions were nominated for 16
Tony Awards and won 2. Nevertheless the contradictions in its
identity and mission persist.
</P>
<P>
   As he enters his eighth season as artistic director, Andre
Bishop _ who was the crown prince of nonprofit theater after
producing hits like ``Sunday in the Park With George,'' ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' and ``Falsettos'' in his 17 years at Playwrights
Horizons _ is feeling the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard road for me,'' he said, talking at his
Greenwich Village home. ``I was used to being everybody's
darling.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The problem for anyone who has the job that I
have is everyone wants Lincoln Center Theater to do what they want
you to do. At the same time, one cannot be all things to all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Lincoln Center Theater's coming season seems to
typify the poles it is pulled between. In December, ``Marie
Christine'' a new musical by the young composer Michael John
LaChiusa, is to open. Later in the season the theater plans to
produce ``Time of the Cuckoo,'' Arthur Laurents' 1952 drama.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, who has served as executive producer since
1985, with Gregory Mosher before Bishop, said these extremes were
simply emblematic of the theater's range, which Bishop is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up and spent his entire life at one theater, which had
a very discrete mission: the discovery, nurturing and development
of new American plays,'' Gersten said. ``When he came to Lincoln
Center, the mission altered. He was charged with running a theater
that had one 1,000-seat house and one 300-seat house, and making
them work. And he couldn't operate with the same repertoire and the
same playwrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda LeRoy Janklow, chairwoman of the theater's board,
dismissed the idea that it is a national theater, saying it can be
only the expression of an artistic director. ``You go with his
vision,'' she said. ``It has always been thus.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bishop, 50, gives the impression of being under siege,
this in part reflects his self-abnegating personality, and he said
he welcomed the challenge. ``I wanted to throw myself up against
the lions again,'' he said. ``And I was so lucky to go to Lincoln
Center. Even though, boy, you never rest easy up there. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, diminutive and scholarly, said he was proud of his
accomplishments, particularly with the Beaumont, a theater
complicated by acoustic and sightline problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the job I thought the big challenge was the
Beaumont,'' Bishop said. ``No other management has made it work.
What has been achieved there is continuity, enthusiasm, productions
of very high quality and the best directors in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say the theater is in the difficult position of
trying to be a nonprofit operation that makes bold artistic choices
and a Tony-eligible entity that plays in the big leagues. (Lincoln
Center Theater also produces plays in Broadway houses, like David
Hare's ``Via Dolorosa'' last season.) And that, combined with its
central location, powerful board and Lincoln Center cachet leaves
the theater subject to greater scrutiny and tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   With two sizable theaters, there are many seats to fill and
48,000 members to satisfy, each of whom pays $35 a year and $30 a
ticket. And like any nonprofit theater, Lincoln Center's must pay
its bills, which are high, with production costs that rival those
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're under the gun all the time,'' said the Broadway
producer Emanuel Azenberg. ``They have the same costs and the same
difficulties that the commercial theater has except they can't
afford failure.''
</P>
<P>
   And, theater professionals say, it is considerably harder to
develop work quietly with a budget of $20 million to $26 million at
Lincoln Center Theater than it was at the 140-seat Playwrights
Horizons, with a $4 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is also up against the challenge for every nonprofit
theater, particularly those with aging subscribers: balancing
artistic risks with financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He and Gersten seem to have the strong support of the board.
``Like picking money managers, you don't look at what they did in
the last five or six months,'' Ms. Janklow said. ``You look at what
they did over the last 10 years. And there's so much exciting and
interesting work that an occasional disappointment, you just chalk
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the board seems to recognize the need to develop
more new straight plays. ``I think the board is now feeling that
perhaps it's good to open our doors a bit wider,'' said Daryl Roth,
the independent producer and a board member. ``I think we'll see
less of the old chestnuts, hopefully, in favor of new American
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some perceive Lincoln Center Theater as increasingly timid and
unexciting. Several producers, agents, reviewers, publicists, and
playwrights say the theater has abandoned its mandate by playing it
safe. Bishop is producing the work of tried-and-true playwrights
rather than gambling on new voices, they say, presenting straight
plays acquired from elsewhere, and in some cases making
compromising commercial alliances like its co-production of
``Parade'' with Livent, whose bankruptcy _ coupled with the
production's mixed reviews _ helped force the show to close.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bishop made his reputation by developing playwrights
like Wendy Wasserstein, Christopher Durang, Jon Robin Baitz and
William Finn, many say he has failed to nurture a comparable crop
of new voices at Lincoln Center, and that he has stuck with people
he knows, with classics and with middle-brow revivals like ``Ah,
Wilderness!'' and ``The Little Foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at Playwrights, he was able to serve the artist
more,'' said James Freydberg, a Broadway producer. ``He's lost
because it's not what he does. What he was so successful at was his
ability to midwife artists and not have them in a situation of
having to please a large audience.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Juan Darien,'' the allegorical puppet show, was a
revival, some producers have pointed out. The theater's acclaimed
revival of ``Carousel'' was an import from London, as was Tom
Stoppard's ``Arcadia.'' And ``Parade'' originated with Livent.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop ``doesn't seem to be doing the kind of new plays that he
did at Playwrights,'' said Robert Brustein, the artistic director
of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and the
theater critic for The New Republic. ``And it puzzles me because he
does have that Mitzi Newhouse. It's a nice theater for new plays,
and he's got impeccable taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking, some directors and playwrights have said,
was agreeing last spring to have the musical ``It Ain't Nothin' but
the Blues'' move into the Vivian Beaumont after ``Parade'' closed,
the first time in its history that the theater has simply offered
itself up as real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone the whole hog,'' said John Heilpern, who worked
as an assistant director to Sir Peter Hall at the National Theater
in London and is now theater critic for The New York Observer. ``It
is now apparently a theater for hire, and that's not what it's on
earth for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gersten replied that nonprofit theaters rent their spaces all
the time, and that it cost $30,000 a week to leave the house empty.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some theater executives said that Lincoln Center Theater's
critical ups and downs _ ``The Heiress'' triumphed in 1995, ``God's
Heart'' bombed in 1997 _ have curtailed its artistic courage, that
the hits have trapped the theater into trying to repeat them and
the misses have made the theater nervous about taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the argument goes, Lincoln Center Theater tends to
stick with what works, like having Gerald Gutierrez direct ``Ring
Round the Moon'' and ``Ivanov'' because he directed two hits in a
row _ ``The Heiress'' and ``A Delicate Balance'' _ or like
producing the reliable monologuist Spalding Gray, which the theater
plans to do again next season.
</P>
<P>
   There is generally accepted to be a scarcity of good new work
and every theater is hungry for it. But look at off-Broadway,
others counter, and there is strong material on which Lincoln
Center has missed out: ``Wit,'' ``Side Man,'' ``This Is Our
Youth,'' ``Killer Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that they are afraid of breaking in new American
playwrights at their theater,'' said one young playwright who
insisted on anonymity. ``They worry that the scale of their
productions and the scrutiny those productions undergo can place
too much pressure on a new playwright. Why they don't try to do
productions on a smaller scale, I can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This debate, however, may be Lincoln Center Theater's
birthright. In 1958 several theater professionals were asked to
weigh in with their ideas for the new theater in The New York Times
Magazine. Tyrone Guthrie, the director, wrote, ``A repertory
theater should not indulge in the highly speculative business of
producing new work,'' adding that a national theater, like a
national picture gallery, ``must keep a selection of great
masterpieces constantly in view.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the actress Cornelia Otis Skinner suggested, ``A
theater presenting only the classics or near-classics would soon
take on the character of a museum, and while there is nothing wrong
with museums, the aims of a good repertory should be toward growth
and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his predecessors _ Elia Kazan and Robert Whitehead and
then Herbert Blau and Jules Irving _ Joseph Papp took over in 1973,
vowing to bring new American playwrights, black authors and rock
musicals to the stage. Subscribers canceled, and Papp left in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under Richmond Crinkley, the theater remained dark for six
of his seven years while the board sparred with Lincoln Center Inc.
over various issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mosher gets credit for reviving the theater in 1985, he
was called too Broadway-conscious because of crowd-pleasing
productions like ``Anything Goes'' and ``Speed-the-Plow,'' starring
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the work of new writers belongs in smaller theaters,
not in big ones like the Vivian Beaumont. ``Developing new writers
is a private process and should be protected and nurtured, not
thrown out into the limelight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said one of his dreams was to have a third,
black-box space ``away from it all'' for developing new writers.
</P>
<P>
   If he is producing plays with mass appeal, Bishop said, it is
because he genuinely likes them. ``I have never considered myself
to be a radical,'' he said. ``I've always been attracted to
individual, idiosyncratic writers, but popular writers.''
</P>
<P>
   His theater gets points for producing new musicals like last
season's ``Parade,'' which won two Tony awards. And it has earned
the respect of some Broadway producers, including Rocco Landesman,
president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who in 1988 publicly accused
Lincoln Center of betraying its raison d'etre by being ruled by the
box office. ``I would like to see fewer British imports and more
American plays,'' he said. ``But Andre has brought a coherent
artistic sensibility to that enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he was committed to doing new work, even if it is
the work of his old friends. He said he planned to produce new
plays by Tina Howe, Ms. Wasserstein and Baitz.
</P>
<P>
   Members of his old guard say Bishop should be commended for this
loyalty. ``I am moved by the fact that this man continues to
believe in me,'' Baitz said. ``When I finish writing a play, there
are three people that I give it to, and Andre is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Richard Greenberg added: ``Do we want playwrights
to have opportunities when they're young and nowhere to go when
they're old and mature? Not every theater should be about what the
28-year-olds are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he felt the heat and has done his share of
hand-wringing. But he also said he must ultimately trust his
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said that being an artistic director is the
intelligent exercise of one's own taste,'' Bishop said. ``And that
is what I believe with all my heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you start second-guessing yourself in advance, I
think you're done for.''

 &HT;    Four at WestPoint dispose of shares
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four insiders at home furnishings maker WestPoint Stevens last
month sold a total 68,011 Class A shares, raising more than $2.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two insiders at Carmike Cinemas, whose shares are
trading at about half of what they were selling for a year earlier,
boosted their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   At WestPoint Stevens, William F. Crumley, executive vice
president of manufacturing, sold 9,519 shares July 27 at between

</P>
<P>
   Charles W. McCall, director, exercised an option for 20,000
shares July 23-27 at $9.50 each, totaling $190,000. The former

FIREARMS MAGAZINES FLOURISH DESPITE MOVES TO CURB GUN SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with the highly publicized acts of gun violence the last
year _ including episodes in Littleton, Colo., Atlanta and Los
Angeles that received front-page newspaper coverage and 24-hour
news-channel surveillance _ comes a peculiar, and to some
disturbing, flowering of the gun media.
</P>
<P>
   From Guns &AMP; Ammo, which is owned by EMAP Petersen and is one of
the American gun industry's largest magazines, to
smaller-circulation titles like Shooting Times, owned by Primedia,
the gun magazines have enjoyed a minor but notable surge in
popularity the last two years. They are retooling their designs,
printing on better-quality paper and publishing articles about the
threat of rioting at the turn of the millennium. The combined
result is that the magazines are, for the most part, attracting
more readers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the renewed interest in gun magazines follows the
vagaries of the gun manufacturing industry, which operates on the
principle that when gun violence raises the political pressure to
restrict gun sales, people rush out and buy more guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a curious thing, but the whole gun industry, for many
years, has thrived in an adverse legislative climate and withered
in a benign one,'' said Jan Libourel, the editor of Gun World: The
Total Journal of Firearms, which is published by Y-Visionary
Publishing Co. of Orange, Calif. ``It's very simple. Consumers get
scared that their guns won't be available. With that, the gun press
gets more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Libourel said the market for gun magazines was robust, which
might seem odd considering signs that sales have plummeted _ to 1.5
million handguns a year in 1998 from about 4 million in 1994, he
said _ since the passage of federal laws in 1994 that banned an
array of assault weapons. ``I wouldn't say that the market for gun
magazines is booming,'' he said, ``but I would say that it is
definitely surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacture of guns in the United States, including
revolvers, rifles, shotguns, pistols and machine guns, has declined
precipitously since 1993, according to the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. (It does not keep figures on sales.) In 1993,
5.2 million guns were manufactured; in 1997, the number had
decreased to 3.6 million. The number of guns imported in 1993 was 3
million; in 1997, the number decreased to 930,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downturn, gun magazines remain the firearm
industry's favorite, and most uniformly supportive, marketing tool.
Negative reviews are rare, and advertisers provide a constant
stream of advertising revenue. Advertising pages in Guns &AMP; Ammo
were up by only 1 percent for the first half of 1999, compared with
the first half of 1998, but advertising pages in Handguns _ also
published by EMAP Petersen _ were up 19.4 percent for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Among the titles with circulations exceeding 100,000 are Shotgun
Sports, Guns, Handguns, Gun World, Combat Handguns, Petersen's
Rifle Shooter, Rifle &AMP; Shotgun Supershooting and American
Handgunner. EMAP Petersen _ the New York-based publisher of
consumer titles like Teen and Motor Trend _ is the largest
publisher of handgun magazines in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Johnson, the group publisher of the Petersen Outdoor
division, which publishes 10 gun-related magazines, said Petersen
planned to keep the gun-magazine market growing, despite the
shrinking gun market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a little bit better with all of the magazines in
the past year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson argued that the magazines' popularity was unrelated to
gun violence. ``We believe that we can trace their success to
improvements in the actual magazines,'' he said. ``We have focused
on hiring better-quality writers. We've increased the package size
and added more four-color pages. We've started working closer with
the newsstand distributors so that the magazines are placed where
they are most likely to be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns &AMP; Ammo's circulation has climbed steadily since 1995, when
it was 570,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Johnson said circulation was 610,000 in the first half of 1999.
Mediamark Research Inc. reported that figures from spring 1999
showed that Guns &AMP; Ammo's total audience was 5.8 million readers.
Shooting Times, which is published by Primedia _ also the publisher
of New York magazine _ saw its circulation rise to 205,000 in 1998
from 180,000 in 1995, according to the audit bureau, while Rifle &AMP;
Shotgun, published by Natcom Inc., was up to 120,000 in 1998 from
96,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area of writing that is superbly uncritical,'' said
Tom Diaz, the author of ``Making a Killing: The Business of Guns in
America.'' ``It's hypermarketing, and Guns &AMP; Ammo is the 500-pound
canary.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the only titles to suffer in terms of circulation is The
American Rifleman, a publication of the National Rifle Association
that is given free to members; its circulation dropped to 1,276,600
in 1998 from 1,716,700 in 1995, but that dip was caused in part by
the fact that the NRA started producing another magazine, American
Guardian, that is also offered to NRA members. They can choose one
of three magazines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there are more gun magazines to come. In 1998, Petersen
began publishing two new gun titles: Petersen's Shotguns and
Petersen's Rifle Shooter. But 2000 will see a veritable bumper crop
of gun-related titles, many of them one-time publications EMAP
Petersen hopes to grow into full-fledged annuals, including Guns &AMP;
Ammo 2000 Annual Handguns, Guns &AMP; Ammo The Complete Book of
Big-Bore Handguns, Guns &AMP; Ammo Firearms for Law Enforcement, Guns &AMP;
Ammo Military Surplus, Guns &AMP; Ammo Modern Knives and two editions
of Guns &AMP; Ammo Fishing Annual. The company is also introducing a
gun title for women.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the magazines address gun violence, and some do not.
Libourel wrote in the August issue of Gun World that the Columbine
High School shooting spree was attributable not to the fact that
the teen-agers were able to obtain guns, but that they were ``a
couple of maladjusted weirdos with Nazi leanings.'' And in American
Rifleman, the name of Charlton Heston, president of the NRA,
appears on a monthly political column.
</P>
<P>
   But at EMAP Petersen, Johnson said Guns &AMP; Ammo was not concerned
with political opinion-writing, and indeed the magazine rarely
issues editorials defending handguns or assault weapons of any
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Husni, a professor of media studies at the University of
Mississippi who closely tracks magazine trends, said gun journalism
appears to be thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more titles than ever before, and that's because
they are even more specialized,'' he said. ``Now you have specific
magazines for specific machine guns and magazines for assault
rifles and magazines for owners of Colt .45s and magazines for
women and guns.'' He added: ``Is it healthy? I don't know if it's
healthy for readers, but it's healthy for the magazines.''

ADVERTISING: FORD FOCUSES ON ITS SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Trying to establish a common brand image for its
ever-growing family of sport utility vehicles, Ford Motor Co. is
preparing to start next month one of the largest advertising
campaigns ever in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   After relying for nearly two decades on its ``built Ford tough''
theme for pickups, it has created a separate slogan, ``no
boundaries,'' for its sport utility models and will start
advertising them as a group, as well as individually. Because it
will also be putting three new sport utilities on the market in the
next six months, Ford and its dealers are planning to spend huge
sums on television, print and Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively with our dealers, it'll probably be the biggest
thing we've ever done,'' said Jan Klug, marketing and advertising
manager for Ford brand cars and light trucks. ``It'll be
unavoidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford introduced the campaign at a gathering here that attracted
3,500 of the nation's 4,300 Ford-brand dealers. The dealers,
invited mainly to see the offerings for the 2000 model year, seemed
to like the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' said David Kruse, a Detroit
dealer, ``because you can go whenever you want, wherever you want
with these vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The visual footage for the TV ads is usual fare for sport
utility vehicle spots _ men and women rafting rapids, hiking alpine
trails, climbing cliffs and mountains and leaping into pristine
lakes. Each ad shows all the models, with an extra emphasis on the
giant new Ford Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The television ads will run particularly during athletic events
this autumn, and Ford plans to step up its sponsorship of sports
like downhill skiing. Ford and its agency for the campaign, J.
Walter Thompson, a subsidiary of WPP Group, are still working on
the print and Internet campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klug refused to give the campaign's budget, but sport
utility vehicles are already among the most heavily advertised
products in the country. The most advertised automobile last year
was the Jeep Grand Cherokee, with $136.4 million in ads, according
to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York company that tracks
advertising spending. Ford and its dealers spent $63.7 million on
ads last year for the Expedition, $61.8 million for the Explorer
and $13.7 million for ads featuring the two vehicles together.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans a new marketing approach inside its dealerships to
complement the campaign. The sport utility vehicle areas at
dealerships will be dubbed ``Ford outfitters,'' a name that will
also appear in the advertising. Ford will sell tents, backpacks and
other camping equipment at deep discounts to its dealers this
autumn, to be arranged around the vehicles in showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 largest dealerships in terms of sales will also be
offered whitewater kayaks and other, more elaborate gear, said
Joseph Collins Jr., Ford's brand manager for sport utility vehicles
and minivans. Ford will not enter the market for outdoor gear,
however, and customers who want to buy the equipment they see in
dealerships will be steered to companies that specialize in the
business, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising and marketing program is ambitious partly
because of the new models Ford is introducing. The Excursion, the
world's largest sport utility vehicle, officially goes on sale next
month, but production began last month and dealerships are already
selling some of the first vehicles. The Ford Explorer Sport, which
will go on sale later this autumn, is a restyled version of the
two-door model.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Explorer Sport Trac, which will reach dealerships early
next year, is technically a sport utility pickup. It is identical
to an Explorer back to the second rows of seats, but has a short,
open pickup truck bed in the back instead of an enclosed cargo
area. Ford will include the Sport Trac in its sport utility vehicle
advertising, partly to avoid competing directly with the Ford
Ranger Super Cab, a four-door pickup that it closely resembles.
</P>
<P>
   With so many new models joining the Explorer and Expedition,
Ford needed to establish a common brand identity for its sport
utility vehicles to contain advertising costs, Ms. Klug said. ``We
don't want to have to support every name plate with 40 million
bucks apiece,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   James Gregory, chief executive of Corporate Branding LLC, a
brand strategy company in Stamford, Conn., said that creating a
common brand made sense because of the sheer number of sport
utilities. ``It's getting to the point where its oversaturated, so
building an umbrella over the whole group is a brilliant idea,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Advertising the giant Excursion with the Expedition and Explorer
may also help the smaller models. The Excursion, which weighs
almost twice as much as a Jeep Grand Cherokee, has attracted
considerable attention. Ford has already received orders from
dealerships for every one it will produce this year, despite
criticisms of the vehicle by safety and environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also makes the Lincoln Navigator and Mercury Mountaineer
sport utility vehicles. But these will not be included in the Ford
brand advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some sport utility ads, Ford does not show any of its
sport utilities actually using their four-wheel-drive capability.
Instead, the vehicles are shown on paved roads or on dry, smooth
dirt roads that could be easily traversed in a car. Ford is working
with the National Park Service on a separate campaign urging people
in wilderness areas to ``tread lightly'' and inflict as little
damage as possible on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the vehicles' ability to cross rough ground is
suggested in the ads' narration, which is by John Corbett, a star
of the former television series ``Northern Exposure.'' During
mountain climbing scenes at the start of one ad, Corbett says,
``Out here, the stories unfold like a map, stories written across
the sky with the tip of an eagle's wing or read between the lines
of a sheer rock face.''
</P>
<P>
   After further scenes of outdoor adventure, Corbett concludes the
ad by saying, ``You'll need an outfitter for the journey, an
outfitter for your dreams. Introducing Ford outfitters, offering
you the most far-reaching sport utilities on Earth, created to take
you where the stories begin and never end.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry surveys have shown that most sport utilities are
actually used for commuting, running errands and other mundane
tasks. Collins acknowledged this to reporters here, saying, ``SUVs
are about image, they're about taking people where they want to go,
not necessarily where they really go.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the adventurous sports depicted in the ads, Ford
plans to continue advertising during golf tournaments. ``Golf is a
huge interest for people who buy sport utilities,'' Ms. Klug said.

   The most ambitious early adventure of the United States in
creating an American empire, otherwise known as the
Spanish-American War, receives colorful treatment Monday night,
enlivened with period flavor, political contradictions and populist
enthusiasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crucible of Empire,'' a two-hour PBS offering narrated by
Edward James Olmos, begins with the closing of America's Western
frontier, leaving a vigorous young nation in search of ways to
express its energies outside its borders. Spain, that brutal but
faltering colonial power, became the chosen target; the restive
peoples of Cuba and the Philippines became allies of the United
States, or its pretexts. Theodore Roosevelt, before he became
president, spoke for the popular spirit when he said, ``I should
welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to such imperialist tendencies did not have a chance
against jingoists like the publisher William Randolph Hearst and
his star reporter, Richard Harding Davis, whose accounts of Spanish
atrocities stirred American outrage. The February 1898 explosion
aboard the battleship Maine, which killed 266 U.S. sailors in
Havana harbor, brought a new national slogan and new demands for
war. More than 1 million men responded to President William
McKinley's call for volunteers; among them was the young Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   So America embarked on a two-ocean war, presumably in behalf of
Cuban and Filipino rebels, but in reality, as Monday night's
historians agree, in behalf of the nation's own ambitions.
Confusion was rampant, but the romance of warfare, featuring Adm.
George Dewey's defeat of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay and the
Rough Rider charge up San Juan Hill, captured the nation.
</P>
<P>
   We are reminded that this was ``the first filmed war,'' and a
fake at that. Most of the pictures, one historian reports, were
shot on the roof of New York buildings with toy boats in bathtubs
and men blowing cigar smoke to simulate the smoke of battle.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ambiguous victory in which many more Americans died of
disease than in combat. Spain lost its empire, but the Cuban and
Filipino rebels were disappointed in their dreams of
self-government; the United States soon found itself encountering
rebellions against its rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a prescient prediction shortly before his assassination,
McKinley, no great fan of the war, alerted his countrymen to their
new global responsibilities as they began to compete in a world
market. The United States was ready to do business.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1995, Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue
magazine, fixed her sphinx-like gaze upon her boss, S.I. Newhouse
Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast, and exhorted him in front of a
room full of Conde Nast publishing executives to buy Fairchild
Publications. The company had just been bought by Walt Disney Co.
as part of the Capital Cities acquisition, and Disney did not seem
a natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Ms. Wintour has long had Newhouse's ear,
he demurred. He was turned off, said a former Conde Nast executive,
by the prospect of owning dozens of decidedly unglamorous trade
magazines like Supermarket News, Brand Marketing and Footwear News.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the fashion, advertising and magazine publishing
industries hummed with the news that Newhouse, whose company
publishes Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker
and a dozen other sleek and stylish magazines, had offered $650
million for Fairchild, the publisher of Women's Wear Daily, W and
Jane magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that seemed to grip most onlookers was that now Conde
Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, would control most of the
American fashion press, and with that would have the ability to
exert considerable influence over the $180 billion American apparel
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse's head had been turned, say Conde Nast executives, by
the rapid growth the last four years of W magazine _ which has
emerged as an ad-rich, provocative fashion title, combining aspects
of society gossip and lifestyle reporting.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal is complete, Conde Nast will own Vogue and W, two
of the country's leading fashion titles, along with the influential
trade publications Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record, a
chronicle of the men's apparel industry. And only two fashion
titles in the entire country _ Harper's Bazaar, which is owned by
Hearst Magazines, and Elle, published by Hachette-Filipacchi
Magazines, a unit of Lagardere Group _ will be outside the Conde
Nast corral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most powerful instruments in the fashion business are
Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record,'' said Steve Klein,
managing partner at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners, an advertising
agency that handles placement in magazines for major advertisers.
``So people are concerned about the fact that all of a sudden the
editorial influence that drives what is on the shelf and what sells
in the stores is in the hands of one company, that the business
power in the fashion industry is now in the hands of the Newhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significant issue, the chatter,'' he added, ``is going to
be: Does so-and-so designer get preferential treatment in Vogue
because they are getting great reviews in Women's Wear Daily?''
</P>
<P>
   Women's Wear Daily _ a whisper-slim daily tabloid newspaper that
does not shy from bad reviews _ is heavily read and influential.
Michael Gould, the chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's,
said, ``More people in my business read it every day than they read
The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers expressed cautious enthusiasm about the consolidation.
Kenneth Cole, whose footwear and clothing company earned $218
million in revenue in 1998, said the situation resembled a kind of
monopoly on style. ``The more participants, the more points of view
there are, the better,'' Cole said. ``I hope that objectivity does
not get lost here, and certainly there's that concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Bartlett, a menswear designer, said the dual ownership
would not make him uncomfortable. ``There are already a lot of
magazines under the Conde Nast umbrella, and they all have their
own personalities and editors,'' Bartlett said. ``It's more about
the relationships that you have at each magazine. To me it's about
getting on the phone with one person, not with an entire
conglomerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues were bandied about in the brand-new Conde Nast
headquarters in Times Square in Manhattan. At Mademoiselle, staff
members speculated that they might be merged with Jane, the
Fairchild title for young women edited by Jane Pratt. (The editor
in chief of Mademoiselle, Elizabeth Crow, pointed out that Conde
Nast had plenty of magazines, like her magazine and Glamour, that
compete with one another, and said she did not see why merging
competitive titles was necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   And at Vanity Fair, editors applauded the decision, which will
guarantee that celebrated Fairchild photographers like Mario
Testino and Bruce Weber will now be permanent fixtures at Conde
Nast and not lost to Hearst or Hachette-Filipacchi.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes as fashion magazines, scrambling for
advertising and readers, are rethinking their approach as they
consider the end of the standard high-fashion glossy featuring
remote cover models and inaccessible fashions inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion magazines now have retooled themselves, favoring
celebrities over models on their covers and adding more lifestyle
features, in part to mimic In Style, a celebrity fashion magazine
published by Time Warner's Time Inc. that has come to dominate the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Betts, who takes over as editor of Harper's Bazaar
next month, has said she will focus on more of a lifestyle
approach. And Elaina Richardson, the editor in chief of Elle, has
already begun doing so, introducing a spinoff title this fall
called Elle's Ultimate Road Trip, a style and travel magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Uptown at Elle's publishers, Hachette-Filipacchi, Jack Kliger,
the company's chief executive, said he was glad his offers to
Disney had been rebuffed, because the final price tag for
Fairchild, under the stewardship of Patrick McCarthy, was
unreasonably high. According to industry analysts, the ABC division
earns about $25 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we dipped our toes in the water,'' Kliger said. ``But we
found the water to be cold. And expensive.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Bret will cross south Texas and move into Mexico
on Monday, bringing a vast swath of rainfall with it. While Bret
wrought havoc on the coast Sunday, inland locations will be hit
hardest Monday. Weak jet-stream winds above the former hurricane
will cause it to move slowly, allowing the system to drop very
large amounts of rain. Serious flooding will occur in places that
get continuous, heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, a low-pressure system crossing the northern
Plains will trigger showers and thunderstorms from Minnesota
southward along the Mississippi Valley. Some of the storms will be
strong, as a potent jet-stream disturbance at 18,000 feet will aid
in the development of the thundershowers. Gusty winds and hail will
be the primary severe element of the storms.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will also develop across the Southeast, where
a declining front will provide the necessary lift for pockets of
rain to grow. Some of the storms will provide briefly heavy rain,
as weak winds aloft slowly move the showers across the region.
Meanwhile, the Northeast will be partly to mostly sunny and will
turn warmer as high pressure slides off the coast of the Middle
Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West will be quite sunny and warm, as a large area
of high pressure settles into the area. A weak disturbance aloft
will cross Nevada, bringing a few showers to the northern Sierra
and southern Cascades. A few showers are also possible over the
higher terrain of the intermountain West. Along the coast, offshore
flow will allow temperatures to rise to well above seasonal levels
in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tornados and Hurricanes
</P>
<P>
   Tornado watches were issued near the southern Texas coast on
Sunday as Hurricane Bret approached the area. While hurricanes and
tornadoes are very different storms, hurricanes at landfall promote
the conditions necessary for tornado formation. All hurricanes have
tall thunderstorms that are the precursors of tornadoes. As a
hurricane moves over land, the low-level winds weaken more quickly
than the winds several thousand feet above the ground. The shifting
wind in the vertical, called wind shear, helps provide the twisting
motions that can be concentrated into a tornado.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Fifty years after playing femmes fatales and
hard-boiled dames in classic examples of film noir, those shadowy
mysteries often made by emigre directors, the actresses who starred
in them still receive fan mail almost daily. ``These films are very
big all over Europe, and lately Eastern Europe, and I still get
mail asking if I'm married,'' said one alumna of the genre, Audrey
Totter. ``They have no idea that I'm a grandmother now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Totter, who is a spunky 80 and who starred in films like
Robert Montgomery's ``Lady in the Lake'' (1946), Robert Wise's
``Setup'' (1949) and John Berry's ``Tension'' (1950), is one of
four living actresses whose movies are among those being honored by
Turner Classic Movies this summer on cable television. (Probably
the best-known film noir heroines were Barbara Stanwyck, who died
in 1990, and Gloria Grahame, who died in 1981.)
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Ms. Totter was seated in the Formosa Cafe, a
restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard that dates back to Hollywood's
golden age. She was joined by Marie Windsor, Coleen Gray and Jane
Greer, who played the gorgeous (often mysterious, sometimes deadly)
women who clashed with Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan
and Sterling Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it
left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when
everything is so explicit,'' said Ms. Windsor, 76. She played the
seductress in the John Garfield classic ``Force of Evil'' (1948),
directed by Abraham Polonsky, as well as similar roles in Richard
Fleischer's ``Narrow Margin'' (1952) and ``The Killing'' (1956),
directed by Stanley Kubrick. ``Everything was implied but not
shown,'' Ms. Windsor said. ``Film noir engaged the audience, let
them use the gray matter between their ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray, who confessed that even now, at 76, she is still upset
about having often been typecast as a ``good girl'' in those
movies, said that film noir was especially timely because the women
in them were not only tough but sometimes even had careers, seemed
totally disinterested in raising children and being homemakers and
were sexually provocative. (Of course major stars like Bette Davis
and Joan Crawford built their careers playing such women, too.)
``You never spoke of divorce or adultery in movies,'' said Ms.
Gray. ``If you were a married couple, if a man and women were in
bed, one of them had to have a foot on the floor.'' Ms. Windsor
added: ``And you could never show cleavage. And kissing was, well,
a little bit and they'd pan away. Silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, the four spoke bluntly and fondly about the old
days, reminiscing about their favorite actors (Alan Ladd, John
Garfield, George Raft), one they didn't like (George Sanders) and
the studio moguls who had reputations for chasing starlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a meeting with Darryl Zanuck, and I was a little
nervous; he had a reputation for being a womanizer,'' recalled Ms.
Gray, who appeared in Phil Karlson's ``Kansas City Confidential''
(1952) and with Ms. Windsor in ``The Killing.'' ``The first thing I
did was walk in and say: `How do you do, Mr. Zanuck. You know we're
both from Nebraska. I'm from Staplehurst.' He was very nice. I was
almost disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Film noir _ French for black film _ emerged in the United States
around World War II with the influx of German and Austrian
expatriates like Billy Wilder (who made the noir classic ``Double
Indemnity'' ) as well as Fritz Lang, Max Ophuls, Otto Preminger and
William Dieterle. Along with other directors, like Joseph Losey and
Edward Dmytryk, they made movies that were often peopled by cynical
or desperate characters living in a venal and paranoid world, a far
cry from traditionally sunny Hollywood films. The films not only
represented the sensibility of their directors but the mood of the
times: the McCarthy era loomed, and there was a sense that turmoil
simmered beneath the nation's postwar exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The visual style of noir films _ odd camera angles and harsh
shadows _ was influenced by German Expressionism, compounded by the
realities of movie production in the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an industry where postwar economics dictated recycling of
existing sets, exploiting stock film libraries and generally
minimizing shooting times, the flexibility of film noir made it a
fiscally sounder proposition than many other types of motion
picture,'' according to ``Film Noir,'' a book about the genre
published in 1979 by Overlook Press. (For example, the dark
shadows, shot in high-contrast black and white, which marked most
such films, were often a way of hiding bare-bones sets.)
</P>
<P>
   Film historians consider Orson Welles' 1958 ``Touch of Evil''
the last true film noir, although a new generation of directors was
clearly influenced by the genre. These included Roman Polanski
(``Chinatown,'' 1974), Stephen Frears (``The Grifters,'' 1990) and
Curtis Hanson (``L.A. Confidential,'' 1997).
</P>
<P>
   The women who starred in these films, contract players at
studios like MGM, 20th Century Fox and RKO, said they were amazed
that the genre was currently popular in Europe, especially in
Eastern Europe with the fall of Communism. Ms. Greer said she was
recently offered a role by a German director who thought she was a
young woman. ``He'd have a heart attack once I stepped off the
plane,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greer recalled that, recently, ``three tall, handsome blond men
_ all of them Germans'' showed up at her door one morning on a
secluded street in Los Angeles and asked to pose for pictures with
her. They said that they found her address on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ```Out of the Past' is very popular in Europe,'' she said,
recalling her classic 1947 film directed by Jacques Tourneur, in
which she played a woman who helps entangle a private eye, Robert
Mitchum, in a web of murder and double dealings. (The film was
remade in 1984 as ``Against All Odds.'') Ms. Greer said Tourneur's
directorial advice was amazingly simple: ``First half good girl,
last half bad girl.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few laughs the actresses recalled that their major
problem seemed to be that they were taller than many leading men
like Robert Cummings, Ladd, Raft and Garfield, whom they called
Jules, which was his real first name. The women said they would
sometimes play scenes with the actors standing on boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, after all these years, they still spoke vividly about
the parts they missed and how they were sometimes frustrated by
being typecast. ``The bad girls were so much fun to play,'' said
Ms. Totter. ``I wouldn't have wanted to play Coleen's good-girl
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' said Ms. Gray. ``Who would? Like in `The
Killing.' I was the good girl. It was frustrating! And Marie had
the big fat juicy part.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Windsor smiled. ``They were always the best,'' she said.
``You're quite right.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leo Castelli, the New York art dealer who played an
extraordinary role in shaping contemporary American art and
fostering international acceptance of painters like Jasper Johns,
Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella, died on
Saturday night at his Manhattan home. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli emerged as one of the most influential American art
dealers of the century in the late 1950s, when Abstract
Expressionism began to ebb, and for decades helped develop and
promote the Pop, Minimal, Conceptual and Neo-Expressionist
movements. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first
one-man shows and brought attention to Andy Warhol, Ellsworth
Kelly, Cy Twombley, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Joseph Kosuth and
Richard Serra, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli stood out in the history of American art and in the
history of American art dealing for two quite different reasons.
First, in his choice of artists he never looked back. If he was not
there first, he did not bother to begin. In the case of the great
masters of modernism _ Matisse and Picasso, for instance _ he never
thought of dealing in them. Not only were they out of reach; they
were also yesterday, and he wanted today.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he came to New York as a refugee from Europe during World
War II and was on the fringes of the art world, he happened to have
access more than once to paintings by the pioneer Russian
abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky. Sometimes he sold the Kandinsky
paintings privately, but it never occurred to him to show them as a
dealer in a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the end of World War II he was a close friend of
Willem de Kooning, and they spent summers together in the Hamptons.
But it never crossed Castelli's mind to show de Kooning's work.
When he finally became a gallery dealer, he lived entirely for
artists whom he had fostered from their beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for his special place in the trade was that he
convinced Europeans that the new American art of the 1960s was of
the highest international importance. Nothing like that had
happened before. Castelli was entirely and unmistakably European,
and he knew how to overcome European doubts and hesitations in the
context of the new American art. It also helped that he was not a
brash young boy but a man of the world who spoke several European
languages perfectly and was almost 50 before he opened his New York
gallery in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Castelli the cosmopolitan esthete chose the artists
(sometimes with a little help from friends). But it was Leo
Castelli the diplomat who wooed and won curators and collectors,
both in the United States and in Europe. The decisive moment was
probably in 1964, when a painter he had championed, Rauschenberg,
became the first American to win the major award of the Venice
Biennale, the International Grand Prize for Painting.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the balance of prestige between American and
European art was never quite the same. Museums in Britain, France,
Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands began to
collect contemporary American art not because it was ``better'' but
because it was different in a provocative and, in the end, a deeply
rewarding way.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the temporary exhibitions of recent art from all over the
world that flowered in Europe throughout the 1960s and '70s, the
same phenomenon presented itself. There were those who saw it as an
attempt to steal the idea of modern art from Europe. But art has
its own ways of righting the balance, and over the next 20 years
and more Castelli showed Yves Klein from France, Jan Dibbets from
the Netherlands and Bernt and Hille Brecher and Hanne Darboven from
Germany, among other Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To a degree now rarely equaled, Castelli was an individual
trader. Other dealers went in for megadeals, megamergers and
megarelocations. Multinational empires, formal or informal, lasting
or short-lived, came into being. Castelli preferred on the whole to
deal one on one and, whenever possible, with people he already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Where other dealers operated in private behind closed doors,
Castelli, at 420 West Broadway in SoHo, was always on view, though
behind glass. (One person likened the scene to an airline ticket
counter at which even the casual visitor was well received.) If
there was the possibility of an agreeable encounter at his gallery,
Castelli seized it, whether or not any business would result. He
behaved as if business were a subdepartment of sociability.
</P>
<P>
   He never played in what is known as the second market, in which
coveted works of art are bought and resold at very high prices and
without reference to the gallery that sold them in the first place.
If others made millions with paintings on which he had made
thousands, that was the way of the world, and he did not complain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New
York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll
whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons,
desertions were initially rare among his artists.
</P>
<P>
   When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered
him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he
did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate
work in that time. ``I never expected to find anyone willing to
support experimental work,'' Serra said. ``It was like getting a
Rockefeller grant.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Barbara Bertozzi, Castelli is survived
by a daughter from his marriage to Ileana Schapira, Nina Sundell,
and a son, Jean-Christophe, of New York, from his marriage to
Antoinette (Toiny) Fraissex du Bost.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing his artists, Castelli put his natural conviviality
to work. As he once said to Calvin Tomkins of The New Yorker: ``You
have to have a good eye, but also a good ear. There's no other way
if you want to make a good choice. You hear things, feel
vibrations, gauge reactions. You spot movements emerging, and you
try to pick the best practitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Castelli was well able to spot them. Sometimes he was equally
well able to keep them. Johns said some years ago, ``I'm very
grateful that I haven't had to work with any other dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Anniversaries were remembered in the gallery, as shown by
publications devoted to James Rosenquist, after 30 years, and more
recently to Bruce Nauman, after 25 years. In that sense, the
mammoth retrospective of Jasper Johns at the Museum of Modern Art
in 1996 was the apogee of Castelli's professional career. There had
never been a dealer quite like him; and in the changed
circumstances of today, there is unlikely ever to be anyone like
him again.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The organizing drive among the engineers at the Pratt &AMP; Whitney
factory in Palm Beach, Fla., was a home-grown affair. The
leadership of the aspiring union, the Florida Professional
Association, knew it had a difficult job, and in an early appeal
stressed that ``just because we are seeking change doesn't mean
we're radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may not have been radicals, they did employ a novel
tactic: They sent their appeals to all of the factory's 2,000
engineers at their company e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got away with about 10'' of the mass mailings, said Kenneth
Coolidge, the union treasurer, ``before the company found out and
objected.'' Those objections led to the suspension of Coolidge and
the union's president, Brian Waldron, for using the company's
e-mail system for what was deemed personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, more than two years after the suspensions, the union
in Florida agreed to withdraw a complaint accusing Pratt &AMP; Whitney
of using unfair labor practices in return for the company's pledge
to allow the limited use of its system for such e-mail in the
future. And both sides along the labor-management divide are
looking to this settlement for signs of how friendly an environment
cyberspace _ particularly the cyberspace surrounding corporate
offices and factories _ will be for the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   While some union officials have been emboldened by the
settlement, others say they will tread lightly until there is a
greater consensus about the rules for contacting employees via
corporate e-mail addresses. And all the while, companies are
fighting to keep their systems off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail has become common in many workplaces that unions are
eager to organize, including those at software companies and in
other high-technology industries. And unions have found it an
unusually effective organizing tool, one that combines the intimacy
of a conversation, the efficiency of mass-produced leaflets and the
precision of delivery by mail to work forces that are often widely
dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves time, it saves money,'' said Michael Blain of the
Washington Alliance of Technical Workers, or WASHTECH, an affiliate
of the Communication Workers of America that is trying to organize
software workers in the state of Washington. ``We can reach 1,300
people by just hitting `send.'''
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders at Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a unit of United
Technologies Corp., who ultimately failed in their drive to
organize the Palm Beach plant, said they had used e-mail to respond
quickly to management statements. ``If you get the information out
quick, the bureaucracy has to be more accountable,'' Coolidge said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies may find it galling to see unions capitalize on
corporate e-mail systems to organize workers. When nonemployees
send e-mail to organize, some say, that should be considered
trespass, and when employees receive union e-mail at work, it will
invariably be read on company time, a practice that they say labor
law should prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail from unions does interfere with employers' expectation
that work time is for work,'' said Frank Morris, a lawyer who
represents management in labor disputes. ``The unions are trying to
make extraordinary use of a tool that didn't exist until recently
for their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies also contend that any mass e-mailing, even if about
work conditions or union organizing, is an intrusion comparable to
the ``spamming'' done by commercial outfits. Intel recently
persuaded a California Superior Court judge to order a former
employee, Ken Hamidi, to stop sending e-mail messages to its
employees by invoking common law about trespass. (Hamidi has
appealed the ruling.) According to court papers, Hamidi sent more
than 30,000 e-mail messages about the company's employment policies
in six bursts between 1996 and 1998 while avoiding the company's
efforts to thwart him.
</P>
<P>
   The California court's decision has angered free-speech
advocates who say e-mail is useful precisely because it is not
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is potentially a solution to a previously insoluble
dilemma,'' said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties
Union's employment rights office. ``Employees have a right to
organize and employers don't have to allow trespassers. But now
employees have a way of learning about unions without trespassing
on the employers' property.''
</P>
<P>
   Some organizers are eager to test how far they can go. ``We have
e-mailed, and thought about using e-mail in organizing drives,''
said George Kohl, research director for the Communications Workers
of America. ``But the context we work in is that we don't own'' the
company's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the union did not contact anyone at a corporate
e-mail address during its successful campaign this month to
organize 10,000 passenger service employees of US Airways Group
Inc. Instead, it relied on a bulletin board at the union Web site,
Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman, said. ``We don't use corporate
e-mail,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``We just think there are better ways
to do it without the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A more common use of e-mail at the Communications Workers of
America, said Suman Ray, a research economist there, is to build up
a network among people already committed to the cause. That way
there is no concern of antagonizing noncooperative employees who
might inform management about the unsolicited messages.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft Corp., for example, WASHTECH organizers have
collected a list of 1,300 supporters, including nearly 200 people
who gave Microsoft e-mail addresses. (While the other 1,100
presumably work at Microsoft and other software companies in the
area, organizers said, most gave home e-mail addresses.) ``We don't
worry about sending to Microsoft addresses,'' Blain said, although
he added that he thought the company had the ability to block out
any messages coming from WASHTECH.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the National Labor Relations Board, he added,
``That's not the direction the NLRB is heading, and if Microsoft
were to discriminate, that is illegal.'' A Microsoft spokesman
declined to comment on the company's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even at unionized companies, there are no clear guidelines for
union access to corporate e-mail systems; increasingly it is
becoming another bargaining issue.
</P>
<P>
   A shop steward of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, which represents engineers and technical workers at
Boeing Co. of Seattle, was recently given a written warning for
sending a message to 80 or so workers about ``a workplace issue at
that location,'' said Phyllis Rogers, the union's general counsel.
She said the union understood that such communication would be
permitted if directed at fewer than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers said the union, which represents 25,000 professional
workers, mainly in the Puget Sound area, had formed a negotiating
committee to address the issue. The union's current contract
expires on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokeswoman, Amanda Landers, would not discuss the
specific dispute but said that in general, Boeing allowed
nonbusiness e-mail only for ``incidental, personal use.'' Ms.
Rogers, the union lawyer, said, ``We are offended that our
correspondence should be considered the same as any other e-mails,
because we have a legal relationship with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pratt &AMP; Whitney case, the company conceded in an e-mail
dated July 6 that employees can use e-mail to ``initiate a response
or reciprocal discussion, relating to terms and conditions of
employment, and the employee's interest in self-organization'' as
long as the use was ``occasional, incidental and infrequent.'' But
since that agreement was made without a ruling from the NLRB, which
referees union organizing, it is not precedent-setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are bubbling up,'' said Fred Feinstein, the
general counsel for the labor relations board, whose office decides
whether to file complaints against companies for unfair labor
practices. In a recent report summarizing important issues coming
before the board, Feinstein made it clear that he considered the
right to use e-mail to be protected under the National Labor
Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said he believed that in at least some cases, e-mail
is best compared to ``solicitation,'' one-on-one conversation
typically permitted in factories during work breaks anywhere on
company property, instead of ``distribution'' of literature, which
can typically be more closely regulated. (Of course, this presumes
that a union's e-mail message would be read by workers during a
work break.)
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the management lawyer, objected to this reasoning and
said unions ``have had the benefit of a Clinton-appointed NLRB that
has not taken into account the costs.'' He said it was foolish to
apply Industrial Age examples to new technologies and said
congressional legislation might be the best way to devise rules to
protect companies.

<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ From the outside, the old Cameron place looks
the same as always.
</P>
<P>
   The towering cypress tree still guards the end of the driveway
next to the U.S. flag, and Mexican pheasants still prowl the thick
brush of the 24-acre homestead on the north end of town.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, there is a new and unexpected mood in the quiet home
of Leona and Charles Cameron. More than 33 years after their oldest
son was lost in North Vietnam, he is finally home.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the family and friends of U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Virgil King Cameron will lay the young pilot to rest in Arlington
National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   His polished military casket will be carried to the gravesite on
an ammunition caisson; Navy jets will fly overhead, and he will be
honored with a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed interment with full military honors of the U.S.
Naval Academy graduate _ who was 27 when his plane was shot down
during combat over North Vietnam in July 1966 _ is a stirring
reminder of the uncertainty and grief still facing thousands of
American families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we were shocked, really, because we really didn't think
we'd ever receive that call because the circumstances of his crash
were bad and we knew his plane exploded on impact in a fireball,''
said Leona Cameron, the pilot's 84-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's been hard. We have grieved. But we never
agonized like so many people who thought perhaps their loved one
might still be alive and in the hands of their captors and being
tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 2,054 Americans listed as missing in action
from the war in Southeast Asia, including two more from the South
Texas city of McAllen. The remains of about 100 Americans are
currently undergoing forensic review by the U.S. Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The long wait has been difficult for Cameron's parents and four
younger brothers and sisters, not to mention his bride. The young
pilot had been married for only six months to his high school
sweetheart, McAllen native Ellen Watson, when he was shot down. She
did not remarry for 11 years as she waited for confirmation of his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a godsend. It's sort of like a miracle,'' said Bill
Levingston, a college friend and Continental Airlines pilot from
Spring, Texas. ``I'm really happy for his family that they're
finally able to put this to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Levingston plans to attend the service for Cameron, whom he
first met when they attended Schreiner Institute (now College) in
Kerrville, Texas, in 1957. Levingston, also a U.S. Navy pilot,
began his combat tour of Vietnam a few months after King was shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   During the years after Cameron's A-4E Skyhawk was lost over
North Vietnam, the family worked to bring attention to the growing
numbers of U.S. servicemen held prisoner or missing.
</P>
<P>
   They joined a national organization of the families of Prisoners
of War and lobbied Washington for the release of prisoners and the
return of the remains of those who had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   King's mother and father, Charles E.R. Cameron, a former McAllen
science teacher and longtime Immigration and Naturalization Service
inspector, helped organize a petition drive seeking a full account
of missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The family photo album includes a picture of Charles and Leona
Cameron and daughter, Diane, delivering the petition signed by
25,000 Valley residents to then-U.S. Sen. Bob Dole in Washington in
1974. It was the same year the U.S. Navy declared that King was
killed in action, and the family held a memorial service in
McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   To call attention to the harsh treatment of American captives,
Charles Cameron even constructed a full-sized model of the crude
bamboo cages the prisoners were held in and pulled it down main
street during a Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take decades longer _ in May of this year _ for the
Camerons to receive the telephone call they had been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was May 7th, the day before King's birthday, and they said
both blood tests were positive down to the last sequence. There was
no doubt about the match. That was a shock,'' Leona Cameron
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, Defense Department officials had asked Leona
Cameron and her daughter, Diane, to provide blood samples for an
identification process called mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis.
Although this form of DNA testing has been available for 15 years,
it was only approved in 1995 for use by Pentagon labs in
identifying human remains, said Larry Greer, spokesman for the
Defense Department's POW/Missing Personnel Office.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the family was told the Pentagon wanted the blood
tests to see if they would match a set of remains they suspected
were those of Cameron. The Vietnamese government had handed over 20
boxes of human remains on Sept. 13, 1990, Greer said. The Camerons
were told their son's remains were recovered from a roadside grave
where he had apparently been buried by North Vietnamese villagers
after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, a trio of government officials traveled to McAllen
and presented their final report to King's parents and four
siblings, including the findings of DNA testing by the Armed Forces
DNA Identification Laboratory in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we were amazed that something like that could be
done,'' said Drake Cameron, 57, a Houston geophysicist who works
for Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Age 24 when his older brother was shot down, he recalled he was
on a seismic vessel in Tasmania when he called home and got the sad
news. ``We were all pretty devastated,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The family learned Cameron was on a mission to attack a barge or
other traffic on a river near the North Vietnamese city of Vihn,
and the jet fighter was hit by ground fire as Cameron swooped down
on the target.
</P>
<P>
   A wingman watched as the crippled plane crashed, exploding into
a fireball on impact. The wingman recalled seeing the sun shining
off the canopy of King's plane, an indication that he could not
eject, and a rescue helicopter did not pick up a distress signal.
Cameron's fellow pilots aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Constellation noticed the crippled plane never turned toward the
ocean, as pilots were trained to do, a sign that Cameron may have
been injured. And no parachute was spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, the Pentagon spokesman, said the 8 1/2-year delay in
identifying Cameron's remains was likely caused by a lack of
supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're fortunate we get from the Vietnamese (along) with the
remains, something that would indicate who this particular set of
remains may represent,'' Greer said. ``For example, they might tell
us that these remains were recovered at a specific location, and
the villagers might tell us it's from an American airplane that was
shot down on a specific date.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, a military dog tag or identification card is
included with the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Without some clues or circumstantial evidence, the forensic
anthropologists may spend years ``piecing together a very complex
jigsaw puzzle,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that since January 1995, the Pentagon has identified the
remains of 170 servicemen from Southeast Asia who were once listed
as missing in action. Of that total, he said, 35 were from Texas.
Fifteen of those were identified through the same mitochondrial DNA
testing process used to identify Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the family learned of the positive
identification, they have spent time recalling Cameron's life and
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always busy on something, in school, then on hobbies
and so forth,'' said his mother. ``And of course, there was always
a lot of work around here. We had goats and cows, and he'd milk
them before school and deliver eggs to some of our customers in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cameron, 93, said his oldest son was a serious but
fun-loving boy who raised white mice and kept alligators in an
upstairs bathtub. An early fascination with model airplanes led him
to join the Civil Air Patrol, borrowing a cousin's small plane to
log additional training hours. At age 16, he had earned his private
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Schreiner Institute in 1960, Cameron won
an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy and earned the top
aviation award there.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Cameron, who flew to Hawaii last week to accompany his
brother's remains to Washington, said his family is grateful to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that they do these things for those who have
given their lives to their country,'' he said. ``The family just
wants to make this a time when we close this chapter in our family
history, and make it a time when King is honored, and to honor God
and country.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's mother said her faith tells her she will see her son
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all students of the Bible,'' she said of her family,
``and that's where our faith comes from. That's why we feel sure
we'll see King again because we know he was a believer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leo Castelli, the New York art dealer who played an
extraordinary role in shaping contemporary American art and
fostering international acceptance of painters like Jasper Johns,
Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella, died on
Saturday night at his Manhattan home. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli emerged as one of the most influential American art
dealers of the century in the late 1950s, when Abstract
Expressionism began to ebb, and for decades helped develop and
promote the Pop, Minimal, Conceptual and Neo-Expressionist
movements. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first
one-man shows and brought attention to Andy Warhol, Ellsworth
Kelly, Cy Twombley, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Joseph Kosuth and
Richard Serra, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli stood out in the history of American art and in the
history of American art dealing for two quite different reasons.
First, in his choice of artists he never looked back. If he was not
there first, he did not bother to begin. In the case of the great
masters of modernism _ Matisse and Picasso, for instance _ he never
thought of dealing in them. Not only were they out of reach; they
were also yesterday, and he wanted today.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he came to New York as a refugee from Europe during World
War II and was on the fringes of the art world, he happened to have
access more than once to paintings by the pioneer Russian
abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky. Sometimes he sold the Kandinsky
paintings privately, but it never occurred to him to show them as a
dealer in a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the end of World War II he was a close friend of
Willem de Kooning, and they spent summers together in the Hamptons.
But it never crossed Castelli's mind to show de Kooning's work.
When he finally became a gallery dealer, he lived entirely for
artists whom he had fostered from their beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for his special place in the trade was that he
convinced Europeans that the new American art of the 1960s was of
the highest international importance. Nothing like that had
happened before. Castelli was entirely and unmistakably European,
and he knew how to overcome European doubts and hesitations in the
context of the new American art. It also helped that he was not a
brash young boy but a man of the world who spoke several European
languages perfectly and was almost 50 before he opened his New York
gallery in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Castelli the cosmopolitan esthete chose the artists
(sometimes with a little help from friends). But it was Leo
Castelli the diplomat who wooed and won curators and collectors,
both in the United States and in Europe. The decisive moment was
probably in 1964, when a painter he had championed, Rauschenberg,
became the first American to win the major award of the Venice
Biennale, the International Grand Prize for Painting.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the balance of prestige between American and
European art was never quite the same. Museums in Britain, France,
Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands began to
collect contemporary American art not because it was ``better'' but
because it was different in a provocative and, in the end, a deeply
rewarding way.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the temporary exhibitions of recent art from all over the
world that flowered in Europe throughout the 1960s and '70s, the
same phenomenon presented itself. There were those who saw it as an
attempt to steal the idea of modern art from Europe. But art has
its own ways of righting the balance, and over the next 20 years
and more Castelli showed Yves Klein from France, Jan Dibbets from
the Netherlands and Bernt and Hille Brecher and Hanne Darboven from
Germany, among other Europeans.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   To a degree now rarely equaled, Castelli was an individual
trader. Other dealers went in for megadeals, megamergers and
megarelocations. Multinational empires, formal or informal, lasting
or short-lived, came into being. Castelli preferred on the whole to
deal one on one and, whenever possible, with people he already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Where other dealers operated in private behind closed doors,
Castelli, at 420 W. Broadway in SoHo, was always on view, though
behind glass. (One person likened the scene to an airline ticket
counter at which even the casual visitor was well received.) If
there was the possibility of an agreeable encounter at his gallery,
Castelli seized it, whether or not any business would result. He
behaved as if business were a subdepartment of sociability.
</P>
<P>
   He never played in what is known as the second market, in which
coveted works of art are bought and resold at very high prices and
without reference to the gallery that sold them in the first place.
If others made millions with paintings on which he had made
thousands, that was the way of the world, and he did not complain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New
York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll
whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons,
desertions were initially rare among his artists.
</P>
<P>
   When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered
him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he
did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate
work in that time. ``I never expected to find anyone willing to
support experimental work,'' Serra said. ``It was like getting a
Rockefeller grant.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In choosing his artists, Castelli put his natural conviviality
to work. As he once said to Calvin Tomkins of The New Yorker: ``You
have to have a good eye, but also a good ear. There's no other way
if you want to make a good choice. You hear things, feel
vibrations, gauge reactions. You spot movements emerging, and you
try to pick the best practitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Castelli was well able to spot them. Sometimes he was equally
well able to keep them. Johns said some years ago, ``I'm very
grateful that I haven't had to work with any other dealer.''
Anniversaries were remembered in the gallery, as shown by
publications devoted to James Rosenquist, after 30 years, and more
recently to Bruce Nauman, after 25 years. In that sense the mammoth
retrospective of Jasper Johns at the Museum of Modern Art in 1996
was the apogee of Castelli's professional career. There had never
been a dealer quite like him, and in the changed circumstances of
today there is unlikely ever to be anyone like him again.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Castelli, whose name was originally Leo Krauss, was born on
Sept. 4, 1907, in Trieste, which was then a part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian
by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married into
the Castelli family, which had long been established in there. When
the city became Italian in 1919, the entire family took the name
Castelli.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli's father rose to a high post in a local bank, and the
family lived well. After World War I, which they spent in Vienna
(where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to
Trieste. To grow up in affluent circles in Trieste was to become
familiar with the subtleties of four or five European languages.
Leo Castelli never lost a magical fluency that allowed him to move
from one culture to another without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Summers in Trieste were a matter of carefree white-flanneled
days in big gardens behind high walls. Young Leo, though slight,
skied and climbed mountains; he also read new novels in several
languages and flirted.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a law degree at the University of Milan in 1924,
he returned to Trieste, where his father got him a job with an
insurance company. Business bored him. But in 1932, to please his
father, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest.
While there he fell in love with Ileana Schapira, the 17-year-old
daughter of one of the richest men in Romania. After their
marriage, his father-in-law saw to it that he worked _ but not too
hard _ in banking. He also helped the young Castelli to be
transferred in 1935 to the Banca d'Italia in Paris. The couple had
a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Paris, and thanks in part to his wife's exceptional
flair, Castelli became more and more involved with the art world.
An architect and decorator friend, Rene Drouin, suggested that they
open a gallery in the Place Vendome, next door to the Ritz. The
gallery combined modern furniture and decoration handled by Drouin
and artwork by second-generation Surrealists and neo-Romantics
handled by Castelli.
</P>
<P>
   The site was ideal, but the timing was not. The gallery had
hardly opened when World War II broke out. The Castellis made a
leisurely exit in the general direction of New York, where Mihail
Schapira, Ileana's father, was establishing a comfortable
bridgehead. In March 1941 they arrived in New York by way of
Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana with a long-haired
dachshund and their daughter's English nanny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 Castelli joined the U.S. Army and was sent for training
in the field artillery. Transferred to an intelligence unit, he was
trained for service behind enemy lines in France. After the
liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter
for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of
Castelli's military service, he was given U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to New York, the Castellis were introduced to
a totally different art world in which they instantly made
themselves felt. They had money, they had flair, and they were fun
to be around.
</P>
<P>
   Though often pressed to open a gallery, Castelli was not in a
hurry. He did not want to work with the Abstract Expressionists,
then dominant in the galleries, though many of them were his
friends. He did not want to work with the great European artists,
all of whom were spoken for. He wanted to be first with artists
almost nobody knew.
</P>
<P>
   Biding his time, he had a joint exhibition with the Sidney Janis
Gallery in the fall of 1950. His role was to show current Parisian
abstract painting in company with the New York Abstract
Expressionists, many of whom were represented by Sidney Janis. If
he dealt, it was privately, working out of his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he went public on his own, in a round-fronted
brownstone owned by Schapira at 4 East 77th Street in Manhattan,
where he and his family lived. It was essentially a private place,
untransformed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954 he saw Rauschenberg's work for the first time. And it
was while visiting Rauschenberg's studio shortly thereafter that he
was taken to call on Johns, who lived in the same building. After
many years of being badgered by interviewers for a firsthand
account of that famous encounter, he sometimes began to sound, in
the words of a close friend, ``like a wind-up toy.'' He once
likened the visit to walking into the tomb of Tutankhamen and
seeing the treasures there.
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 on Rauschenberg and Johns gave a tremendous charge of
energy to the Leo Castelli Gallery. In 1960 Stella and Twombly
reinforced the case for the gallery as the place in New York most
worth visiting. Johns' flag paintings, Rauschenberg's collages and
Stella's striped canvases not only signaled that Abstract
Expressionism was giving way to a new esthetic but also quickly
made Castelli and his principal assistant, Ivan Karp, art world
stars with a reputation for discovering new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw the work of Johns and Stella, I was bowled
over,'' Castelli told an interviewer in 1984. ``I just felt sheer,
pure enthusiasm. And then you get feedback from a mysterious
consensus out there that you are right. Then, of course, you
intensify your push and drive. Anyone can discover an artist, but
to make him what he is, give him importance, that's really
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Castelli's next group of stars _ Lichtenstein, Warhol, Claes
Oldenburg, and Rosenquist _ attracted unheard of public interest,
particularly when his gallery exhibited Lichtenstein's fanciful
takeoffs on comic strips and Warhol's paintings of consumer icons
like Campbell's soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer's identification with Pop Art also made him a
lightning rod for criticism. When some critics chided him for
promoting these artists and denounced him for heralding a movement
they felt inferior to Abstract Expressionism, he replied in a 1966
interview that painting was ``what artists make of it.'' ``One does
not have to like it, but one cannot discard it,'' he continued.
``One can lament a certain fashion, but one . . . just cannot say:
`This is not art, it will go away.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those unsuccessful Abstract Expressionists who
accuse me of killing them; they blame me for their funerals,'' he
said. ``But they were dead already. I just helped remove the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Castelli Gallery continued to chart the course of
contemporary art with exhibitions by his ever growing number of
artists. They included Ellsworth Kelly, Donald Judd, Robert Morris,
Dan Flavin, Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra and Joseph Kosuth.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's move to 420 West Broadway in 1971 was a crucial
moment in the emergence of SoHo as the headquarters of
groundbreaking art in New York. Another such moment was when
Castelli took a further and very large auxiliary space on Greene
Street and kept it for some years. This proved that virtually
nothing could be too large to show in SoHo. Other dealers soon took
the hint, and when the galleries began to move toward Chelsea,
colossal spaces became an everyday matter.

</P>
<P>
   In his later years Castelli did not appear to sell a great many
pictures. He would give work to other dealers to sell on terms
mutually agreed to, but it was not in his nature to go out and
hustle. Nor did he appear to have gone small or quiet. ``It was by
being passive,'' someone said, ``that he retained an active
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed in 1994 by the cultural critic Suzi Gablik, he
was quite specific about his point of view. ``I just give my
shows,'' he said, ``and try to make everybody aware that they are
there, through publications and so on. But then if people don't
come, well, it's too bad. I can't really be on the phone all the
time to find clients. Sometimes I feel very frustrated about it,
but it's not in my nature to be someone who runs after people.''

<P>
   In 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums,
Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art,
Rauschenberg's 1955 ``Bed,'' to the Museum of Modern Art. Castelli
said he had given the work, then valued at about $10 million, ``in
repayment of a debt of gratitude I owe the museum and its founding
director, Alfred Barr, for having been my great mentors.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Bed'' was made by Rauschenberg when he was dealing with found
objects, often picked up from the street. Living in a $15-a-month
loft on Fulton Street and unable to afford canvas, he was looking
for a surface to paint on. One day he took the quilt from his bed,
stretched it like a piece of canvas, and then to neutralize the
quilt's bold pattern added his white pillow and proceeded to daub
the whole with paint.
</P>
<P>
   Castelli bought the work for $1,200 from the first Rauschenberg
show at his gallery in 1958. ``Very few people were buying
Rauschenbergs at that time, and for me it was logical to buy a
painting that I so admired,'' he said. ``As a matter of fact, it
was important in my decision to give Rauschenberg a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg, who has been known to tongue-lash collectors for
making high profits on his work, said: ``I'm very proud of Leo for
giving it to the museum. I don't like masterpieces having one-night
stands in collectors' homes between auctions.''

<P>
   Castelli and his wife were divorced a few years after the
opening of their gallery. She then married Michel Sonnabend and in
1962 started her own gallery, the Sonnabend, with branches in Paris
and SoHo. She and her ex-husband were friends and partners in other
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s Castelli married Antoinette ``Toiny''
Fraissex du Bost. In 1969 she opened Castelli Graphics, a separate
gallery for the exhibition of prints and graphics. She died in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life Castelli married a young Italian art critic,
Barbara Bertozzi. With her active participation, he opened a new
gallery on East 79th Street in Manhattan. The inaugural show was of
monotypes by Johns.

THE LOVE-HATE THEME IN ALBEE'S LIFE AND WORK 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It should not surprise us to learn that the author of the
searing ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' has had a turbulent
life, the vicissitudes of the personal side eerily paralleling
those of the professional one.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee was adopted by Frances and Reed Albee, who
cherished the infant but had no use for the boy, ultimately driving
him from their home when he was 20. Similarly, theater audiences
and critics were at first dazzled by the new playwriting star when
he exploded onto the New York theater scene in the early 1960s with
``The Zoo Story'' and ``Virginia Woolf,'' only to find that they
didn't care for the maturing, developing dramatist. The feeling
seems to have been that with his increasingly opaque plays Albee
was seeking one kind of obscurity but deserved another.
</P>
<P>
   Albee's personal war was with his mother, with whom he
reconciled, to a degree, three years after the success of
``Virginia Woolf.'' His war with the critics ended happily with the
triumph of his 1994 play, paradoxically about his mother, ``Three
Tall Women,'' which reinstated him as one of the country's top
playwrights. Devotion and rejection, kisses and slaps, raves and
slams: his life has pulsated with the love-hate rhythms that roiled
``Virginia Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   All this Sturm und Drang has been well captured in Mel Gussow's
readable new biography of Albee, which lends the Albee spectacle
more drama and narrative shape than some Albee plays. Gussow, a
cultural writer for The New York Times, also provides an insider's
chilling view of the near-rejection and critical pummelings of
Albee plays that most critics now see as major works. Over the
years Gussow had many interviews with Albee and for this biography
was given access to his letters, files and scrapbooks. Albee
apparently asked nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   In portraying the man himself, Gussow doesn't shirk from Albee's
alcoholic years of ``Virginia Woolf''-like verbal knifings of
friends and associates. Still, the man the biography portrays is,
in the end, likable _ touching, funny, compassionate, unafraid to
confront his demons, ironic about himself _ and never less than a
fully dedicated artist aiming for the highest theatrical levels.
</P>
<P>
   Gussow makes frequent allusions to the real-life models for
various characters in the plays. While this can be seen as the
biographer's duty, it can have a trivializing effect. When Albee
speaks about the use of his own life in his plays, he quite
admirably says his hope is that the truth he strives for
``transcends the personal and the private, and has something to do
with the anguish of us all.'' Too much tracking of real-life
inspiration by the biographer tends to drag the plays, and their
bids for universality, back down to the personal and the private,
spinning artistic gold into the straw of gossip.
</P>
<P>
   More serious is the absence in the book of a thorough critical
analysis of Albee's work and an effort to establish his place as an
artist. Throughout the narrative, Gussow dutifully quotes the major
critical reactions to the plays, both pro and con. In the process
he presents dismissive comments from important writers on the
theater like Walter Kerr, who wrote that ``Virginia Woolf'' was ``a
play with a sizable hole in its head'' and Robert Brustein, who
called Albee's plays empty. As these denigrations pile up, even
though outweighed by the many kudos (and three Pulitzer Prizes),
clouds of meretriciousness gather over the Albee oeuvre that Gussow
never dispels.
</P>
<P>
   Even the positive quotations refer less to a play's meaning or
significance and more to strengths like the verbal brilliance,
``the lightning flashes,'' ``the thunderclaps'': attributes that
suggest an MTV approach to serious drama. The criticism quoted
rarely addresses a play's underlying intent or Albee's success in
achieving a specific artistic goal.
</P>
<P>
   Such nagging concerns about the artistic coherence of Albee's
plays are not helped by a number of comments from Albee himself to
the effect that when creating a play he thinks about the characters
for long periods of time, then lets them write it. In his eventual
renunciation of one of his most cryptic plays, ``Tiny Alice,''
Albee admits he wrote it ``totally on instinct.'' Such
self-deprecations reinforce a sense that Albee plays simply happen,
sometimes brilliantly to be sure, but are not meticulously
constructed by a clear-eyed intellect as are the plays of Shaw,
Ibsen and Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   As the critical dust rises in the course of this biography, I
assumed that before the end Gussow would step forward to settle
matters, or at least give his own critical appraisal and seek to
place Albee in the artistic firmament. I would expect this of any
biographer, but certainly one with Gussow's standing in his years
as a critic. Except for a few sentences on the last page, however,
such summary assessment never occurs. Instead, the book bogs down
in overlong discussions of casting decisions and directorial
flourishes in various incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Although I do not feel these are minor lacks, they by no means
negate the value of this biography. We learn much about how
professional theater works in America, how reputations are made and
destroyed, the agonies of mounting a new play, the fatuous hidden
agendas ascribed to a serious author who happens to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   We are served up generous helpings of theater lore seasoned with
much wit from Albee and some from Gussow. We live through the
40-year struggle of a major dramatist to produce work that is fresh
and important. We are shown how an artist's lifelong obsession with
a formidable mother can embellish many of his dramas and culminate
in a first-rate play about her alone, ``Three Tall Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Gussow succeeds, as do the best novelists and
playwrights, in portraying a many-faceted and engaging central
character who leads us through a series of gripping adventures. It
is almost a bonus that the story takes place against the
name-steeped glamour of Broadway and that its hero is one of the
important artists of this epoch who Gussow says, and many believe,
helped change the face of the American theater.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ For years, Timothy Koogle built
high-performance cars and raced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love speed,'' he says. ``And I love well-built, highly
engineered machines.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Koogle is the chief executive of Yahoo, and his
board won't let him take the risk. But the same impulses that
inspire his passion for fast cars have helped build Yahoo into the
well-tuned machine that paces the Internet pack.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 million people visit Yahoo worldwide each month _
traffic that will help it sell about $500 million in advertising
this year, up from $208 million in 1998. And even after a 40
percent drop in its stock price since April, Yahoo has a market
value of $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for Yahoo's success. In the early days of
the Web, in 1994, its founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo, came up
with a good idea while avoiding writing their computer science
dissertations at Stanford University _ a handmade directory of Web
sites. And they picked a great name.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Koogle, 48, whose predilection for speed belies an
understated and analytical demeanor, who figured out how to make
Yahoo a business. Like the top executives of most companies that
operate on Internet time, he insists on running flat out. Unlike
most, he has also steered a straight course, never allowing Yahoo
to drift from its ambitious but simple business model, even as
other Web start-ups bounced from fad to fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside, Yahoo is a fun and irreverent place,'' Yang
said, ``but on the inside we are extremely competitive people who
are very disciplined and serious about growing.'' Referring to
Koogle by his nickname, he added, ``T.K. has ingrained in all of us
that whatever we do, it should speed us up, not slow us down.''
</P>
<P>
   An engineer with no background in media companies, Koogle
concluded soon after he was hired in 1995 that Yahoo's biggest
opportunity lay in offering a free advertising-supported service.
That model is almost universal today, but at the time, creators of
other search sites thought they could charge money for software or
even for searches.
</P>
<P>
   And he was the first to map a strategy for expanding a search
engine from a simple way to find things on the Internet to the kind
of broader service that has come to be known as a portal, mixing
products like free e-mail with specialized information areas like
the popular Yahoo finance site. What is more, he planned not only
to do this in dozens of countries but to do it while earning a
profit _ a distinct rarity among Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental difference, however, is that Koogle
insisted that Yahoo stay obsessively independent, essentially the
Switzerland of the Internet. In its early, cash-starved days, that
meant turning down eager suitors willing to pay for the right to be
the exclusive provider of one thing or another. Recently, it has
also rebuffed overtures from huge conglomerates interested in
marrying Yahoo to their broadcasting or publishing properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of the long term and a big fan of discipline,''
Koogle said recently. ``If you are short term in your thinking,
people will wave checks at you and you will take them. We've seen
our competition do that. Our users value us because we are a
trusted, independent, comprehensive source.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some wonder whether Koogle's stubborn independence can
survive the cutthroat market battles that lie ahead, especially
redoubled competition from Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and America
Online, both of which offer Internet access and browser software as
well as a broad range of online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo's problem is that it needs to be bought,'' insists Barry
Schuler, who runs most of the online services for America Online.
``Yahoo's management is great, but the portal model has failed.
It's just a feature of something bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the other search engines have rushed to align with
larger partners. Excite was bought by At Home Corp., which is
largely owned in turn by AT&AMP;T and other cable companies. Infoseek
is being acquired by Walt Disney Co. Snap is controlled by General
Electric Co.'s NBC subsidiary. And in the spring, Lycos agreed to a
complex marriage with USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, these deals have created nothing but drag.
Lycos was forced to cancel its merger after investors complained.
Disney has had to revamp its deal with Infoseek after a slow start
for the partners' new Go Network service. And Excite, long Yahoo's
most vigorous competitor, is now caught in a family feud between
AT&AMP;T and the other owners of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle has preferred to play the role of acquirer. He courted
Excite earlier this year until At Home snatched it away from him,
and then immediately bought Geocities, the big community-based Web
service, and Broadcast.com, an Internet audio and video service.
Those deals have expanded Yahoo's offerings, audience and market
value while preserving its cherished neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could own them and have them still be as
successful,'' said James Murdoch, the president of News America
Digital, the arm of News Corp. that runs Internet services for Fox
News and Fox Sports and has a number of nonexclusive promotional
deals with Yahoo. ``People don't want to go to a portal and only
see Fox properties or NBC properties. The reason Yahoo has done so
well is that they are independent _ and they have been religious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koogle says his ideas about management were inspired by the
self-reliant work ethic of his father, a fireman and machinist for
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said nobody owes you anything, so go out and earn what you
want,'' Koogle said, ``so I've been making money since I was 7
years old.'' In high school, he worked fixing machines at
McDonald's and repairing cars with his father.
</P>
<P>
   As an engineering student at Stanford, he rebuilt the engines of
other students' cars _ ``rich kids with plenty of money to pay to
have them fixed correctly,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His other passion is music. During less hectic periods in his
life, he played in several rock bands. And now, divorced with no
children, Koogle will pick up one of the several guitars strewn
around his office or his bedroom to relieve the stress of a
round-the-clock work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle's love of machines spurred him to start a business while
he was a graduate student in 1978 making controllers for
electronics manufacturing. He eventually sold the business to
Motorola. He next moved to Intermec _ then an ailing subsidiary of
Raytheon _ which makes bar-code scanners, as chief engineer and,
later, president.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning Intermec to take the helm of Yahoo was a significant
gamble. In 1995, the Internet was largely a curiosity, a blank
slate with no successful business models. He set out to create a
corporate culture that tempered big-company ambitions with an
entrepreneur's focus on financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have conversations with people asking, `Why do you
bother with profits?''' Koogle said. ``But I've had enough
experience to know at a gut level that if you don't build a company
from the start to be profitable, you're never going to be able to
get profitable later.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo achieved its first profitable quarter in September 1997,
and reported an operating profit of $28 million in the most recent
quarter, excluding the charges associated with its acquisitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success, the company still prides itself on
penny-pinching. Executives will cut out of meetings early to catch
the last flight home and save the cost of a hotel room. Salaries,
from top to bottom, are low by Silicon Valley standards. The
payback, of course, is stock options; Koogle's are worth nearly
half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For a workaholic, guitar-playing, race-car-driving,
demi-billionaire, Koogle comes off as surprisingly serene. He
speaks slowly, methodically, with quiet, self-effacing humor. On a
bright morning a few months ago, smoking a cigarette outside
Yahoo's headquarters, sporting black jeans, a denim shirt and a
mane of gray hair, he looked more like an aging rock 'n' roller,
which of course, he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not one of those ego-CEOs who try to micromanage
everything,'' said Karen Edwards, Yahoo's marketing head. ``He is
easy to talk to, but it always seems like he's pondering life's
true meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, operating details are delegated to the staff of young
producers, while strategy is still forged in spirited late-night
debates among Koogle, Yang and Jeff Mallett, the company's chief
operating officer. Despite their different styles, the three men
have, by all accounts, developed an easy working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As intense as Koogle is laid back, Mallett, 34, oversees the
company's operations. Yang is often Yahoo's face to the outside
world and its designated worrywart, pondering the next wave on the
Web. His very private cofounder, Filo, helps manage the company's
vast computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's management has anticipated _ or invented _ most of the
major shifts in the short but chaotic history of the Internet. Last
year the company's big push was to develop services like e-mail,
customized news pages and chat rooms, all of which force users to
register their names and other valuable demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is developing a suite of services for businesses,
including advertising, e-mail and online store software, built on
its vast store of data about users.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's penny-pinching ways caused it to fumble the
attempted acquisition of its archrival, Excite, according to
executives involved in the negotiations. At a pivotal bargaining
session, Yahoo appeared to back off from some of its earlier terms.
This prompted Excite to open parallel talks with At Home, which
quickly raised the bid, with one condition: Excite could not give
Yahoo a chance to counter.
</P>
<P>
   Learning its lesson perhaps too well, Yahoo swung the other way
in its next deal, offering a big premium over Geocities' existing
share price on the condition that the company agree within a day.
Only six weeks later, it made a similar pre-emptive bid for
Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have not been universally popular among investors.
So far, advertisers have shown little interest in Geocities pages,
which are all created by amateurs. And most of Broadcast.com's
revenue has come from running Internet conference calls for
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle argues that Yahoo can tap its large sales force and
database marketing prowess to increase the advertising revenue from
both services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question, though, is whether the company is
positioned to thrive in a world of high-speed Internet access
provided by cable, telephone and satellite companies, which are
forming alliances with programming providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Yahoo to keep its brand front and center,''
said Shaun Andrikopoulos, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex.
Brown. ``That will be difficult to do, because they don't control
the front screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Koogle asserts that even high-speed customers will bypass the
front door provided by their cable or phone company and seek out
Yahoo because of its broader offerings and, more important, because
fast connections play to the strengths of multimedia programming
from Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are multiple technologies, multiple providers,'' he
said, ``and we think that there is a great benefit for us to remain
independent.''

   BOSTON -- Each summer, thousands of Americans pack up the family
car and take off for Mount Rushmore, driving through amber waves of
grain and ample miles of strip malls to gaze upon the likenesses of
four presidential legends who helped shape our nation's political
destiny. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll nation is no different in that sense. Each summer,
thousands of armchair rockers, casual fans, and committed
followers, graying baby boomers, and nose-pierced Generation X'ers
turn out to catch a handful of touring legends who have
reconfigured the pop music landscape. This year has brought Bob
Dylan and Paul Simon (together) to the Boston area, and before them
the Rolling Stones.

kicked off in raucous style Saturday night, it's Bruce
Springsteen's turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss is back, reunited with his E Street Band mates. To rock
mavens, it feels a little like a visit from the pope, or a playoff
series against the Yankees. Horowitz, backed by the New York
Philharmonic. Olivier, with the Royal Shakespeare Company, on tour
as Lear.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen did not disappoint the faithful. He opened the show
with ``The Ties that Bind,'' as good a description as any of his
potent rapport with live audiences. Half an hour later, most of the
arena was still on its feet. He blasted through songs like ``Prove
It All Night'' and ``Darlington County,'' slapping palms with
front-row patrons and hugging bandmates. Sideman Clarence Clemons
blew his own wall of sound on the sax. It was as if they had never
left, although they did nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the new Boss, same as the old Boss. Tickets are scarce,
anticipation is high, new Web sites are springing up. If history is
not in the making here this week, it is certainly on the mind of
local Boss buffs who have faithfully followed their guy since the
glory days of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bradley, 40, a corporate secretary, says she fell hard for
Bruce back in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in love with my girlfriend's brother, and I wanted to
like the guy he liked,'' recalled Bradley, dressed in a black
leather jacket. Though she never dated the friend's brother,
Bradley added, Springsteen's songs spoke to her own hungry heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling people that you can go out and do things,
giving you hope,'' she said, moments before a kindly stranger
upgraded her backrow seats to the first row. ``As a teenager, you
can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a quarter-century ago for most of his fans, when
Springsteen, a wiry, working-class kid from New Jersey, was
anointed the ``future of rock'' _ and proved them (mostly) all
right for saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Springsteen has married, divorced, remarried, and
started a family. He has become a multimillionaire, an
Oscar-winning songwriter, and a member of the Rock Hall of Fame,
his election to which last year was as much a lock as Joe
DiMaggio's trip to Cooperstown. He's about to turn 50, the
traditional age for midlife crises. And like many Boss fans, he is
celebrating his passage into middle-middle age by both looking back
and plunging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   What elevates Springsteen above the typical Jurassic Rock arena
act is the covenant he holds with his fans. There is simply no pop
idol around quite like him these days. Elvis was more mythic, Dylan
more enigmatic, and Sinatra far more of a multimedia force. The
tabloids have never lusted for Bruce the way they pant for Michael
Jackson or Madonna. It's doubtful that you'll ever see him do a
Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet success has not seemed to spoil the Boss, either, nor driven
him into some neurotic shell of his former self. His working-class
anthems still ring true because their sentiments seem honestly
purchased. He may have a home in Los Angeles, but there's still a
lot of New Jersey in Springsteen. And he still touches the New
Jersey in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is music for the guy who loves Bud,'' said Scott Greene,
28, a marketing manager. Greene helped organize an Internet chat
group dubbed LuckyTown that met at the Harp Lounge prior to the
concert. The group has been extra busy this week, swapping
Springsteen tickets on line, one more indicator of how Bruce fans
have adapted with the times.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Weiss, 47, a property manager from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
flew into Boston on Friday holding tickets to two of this week's
shows. Weiss was also on hand for Springsteen's May 5, 1974,
Harvard Square concert, when Bruce opened for Bonnie Raitt, and
inspired critic Jon Landau (later Springsteen's manager-producer)
to pen his famous prophesy about having glimpsed the future of rock
'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who wore a replica ``Born in the USA'' album cover belt,
said that to appreciate Springsteen you really have to see him and
his bandmates in concert. Few rock fans would quibble with that
assessment, especially those lucky enough to be holding tickets to
this week's shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``He writes about people's hopes and dreams,'' Weiss observed.
``And he does it with such dynamic passion. He gets it across to
everyone in the room, even if they're in the top balcony.'' Welcome
back, Boss.

COLLEAGUE OF MAN HELD IN CHINA RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ While translator Daja Meston of Newton remained
hospitalized with injuries suffered under detention by Chinese
authorities, an Australian colleague was freed Saturday and flown
out of the country, officials and Meston's wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Lafitte, 50, a researcher at the University of
Melbourne, was escorted by Chinese authorities on a flight from
Xining, the capital of Qinghai province in northwest China, to the
Beijing airport. Within an hour, he was allowed to talk to
Australian consular officials and call home, before being placed on
the next flight to Sydney, his wife, Helen Verran, said from
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Verran said that in the moments she was able to speak to her
husband, his biggest concern was for a Tibetan man who had been
detained with him and Meston. After the men were detained last
Sunday, Verran said, the two foreigners did not see the Tibetan
man, a Chinese citizen, again.
</P>
<P>
   There were also unconfirmed reports Saturday that other
foreigners traveling in Qinghai, the site of a controversial,
proposed World Bank poverty-relief project, were also in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte ``obviously feels terrible that bad judgments or
mistakes he may have made may have put this Chinese national in
danger,'' his wife said, referring to the Tibetan who was detained
with them. She added that Lafitte had heard his American friend was
hurt, but ``didn't want to fill him in on the details. He's got
enough to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meston, a Tibetan-speaking researcher who was traveling with
Lafitte, remained hospitalized in Xining Saturday, suffering from
severe injuries that Chinese officials say resulted from his
jumping from a third-story window while in custody on Wednesday.
Meston suffered a broken back, internal bleeding, and organ damage,
US officials told his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department has been lobbying for Meston's immediate
release but it appeared unlikely he could be moved in his current
condition.
</P>
<P>
   An American doctor who accompanied US consular officials to
Xining on Friday was allowed to examine Meston again Saturday, and
was consulting by telephone with a team of US doctors in Beijing. A
decision on whether to move Meston, based on discussions with
specialists, would be made within days, according to a source close
to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The source added, ``It looks like the Chinese have provided good
medical treatment. . . . If some Chinese official had not acted
extremely quickly in getting medical treatment, this person would
be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The source cautioned that it is still unclear how Meston
sustained his injuries, whether from a failed attempt to leap to
freedom, as Chinese authorities have said, or from abuse at the
hands of police.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that if Meston were abused, it was
probably at the hands of local security officers, without the
knowledge of Beijing authorities, who would have been fearful of
generating bad press.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Meston and Lafitte were not accused of advocating
Tibetan independence or of spying, but of ``illegal covering and
photographing in a restricted area.''

   BOSTON -- Each summer, thousands of Americans pack up the family
car and take off for Mount Rushmore, driving through amber waves of
grain and ample miles of strip malls to gaze upon the likenesses of
four presidential legends who helped shape our nation's political
destiny. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll nation is no different in that sense. Each summer,
thousands of armchair rockers, casual fans, and committed
followers, graying baby boomers, and nose-pierced Generation X'ers
turn out to catch a handful of touring legends who have
reconfigured the pop music landscape. This year has brought Bob
Dylan and Paul Simon (together) to the Boston area, and before them
the Rolling Stones.

THE SUPPLY WARS OF UKRAINIAN ALUMINUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ While Alcoa and Western rivals warily circle
each other in their efforts to retain supremacy in the aluminum
business, a relatively obscure but powerful competitor that
operates extensively in the former Soviet Union has been increasing
its control in a region responsible for much of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World Group, a privately owned company based in London, is
already the largest seller of aluminum ingots, the bulk form of
processed aluminum. Recently, it has been concentrating its effort
in Ukraine, where it has formed an alliance with the government
that could hurt the company's few remaining regional competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine is an important source of raw material for the huge
smelters that underpinned the Russian aluminum industry. Those
smelters have been responsible for much of the aluminum that has
flooded world markets in recent years and depressed the price.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Trans-World's activities could change the balance of
supply and demand in the global aluminum industry remains unclear.
But they could potentially exert more effect on prices than the
merger intrigue between Alcoa and Reynolds Metals of the United
States, and among Alcan Aluminum of Canada, Pechiney of France and
the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, Trans-World has been trying to expand its
control over aluminum production in all parts of the former Soviet
Union but has been blocked in part by the Mykolayiv Alumina plant,
the region's largest source of alumina, a powdery material made
from bauxite that is used by smelters to produce aluminum ingots.
The state-run company is based in the city of Mykolayiv, 250 miles
south of Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   Mykolayiv's general director, Vitaly Meshyn, had joined with two
Trans-World competitors and resisted pressure to lower his prices
for alumina. But late in June, the Ukrainian government dismissed
Meshyn, accusing him of corruption, and replaced him with Mykola
Naboka, who had formerly run an ore-enrichment plant in Kazakhstan
for Trans-World. Naboka then cut supplies to a Siberian smelter run
by Trans-World's main competitor, Siberian Aluminum, and sent them
instead to one controlled by Trans-World.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Ukrainian government forced Tajikistan's
state-run smelting operation, the other member of the old alliance
with Siberian Aluminum and Mykolayiv Alumina, to accept new terms
for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Meshyn, a popular manager who had provided numerous benefits to
his workers, including health care and recreation that includes an
Olympic-size swimming pool, has sued to get his old job back. Many
of Mykolayiv's workers say they believe that Trans-World played a
role in the decision to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World, Ukrainian officials and Naboka deny that. They say
Meshyn was ousted for skimming profits from the plant into offshore
accounts and for allowing customers to amass large debts.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World is a holding company formed in the late 1980s by two
British brothers, David and Simon Reuben, and two brothers from
Uzbekistan who are now Israeli citizens, Lev and Mikhail Cherny.
</P>
<P>
   It currently sells about 2 million tons a year of aluminum
ingots, about two-thirds of the former Soviet Union's annual
production and 10 percent of global annual production, industry
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World itself would give no estimate of its annual aluminum
sales, but said total annual revenue is about $7 billion. By
comparison, Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum company, is
currently producing about 1.5 million tons a year of ingots and 1.8
million tons of aluminum can sheet and other rolled products.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World presents itself as a successful Western investor in
Russia, where many others have struggled since the Soviet Union's
collapse at the end of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the company can overcome resentment at the Mykolayiv
plant remains unclear. Meshyn has been revered among Mykolayiv
workers, who consider him a defender of their job security and
welfare. At a recent festival for plant workers that Meshyn
sponsored annually, featuring lip-synching starlets, children's
games, shish kebab and beer, workers lamented that it would
probably be the last such celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Vasily Radchenko, a compressor-station worker, noted that the
factory had paid for his 8-year-old son's lymphatic cancer
operation, which he could never have afforded on his $120 monthly
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the factory,'' he said, ``I wouldn't have a son.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Aging gracefully.'' That modest little phrase doesn't begin to
capture the shock and struggle involved. And probably it shouldn't,
for what's the point of grace if the end doesn't transcend the
means?
</P>
<P>
   Performers radically dramatize the questions and strategies we
all have to maneuver through. What's the balance between that which
you want to conceal and that which you must reveal? How does sexual
desire play out against marks of decline and decay? What do you do
with the kinds of power that can only be gained once you admit to
certain losses?
</P>
<P>
   All of these questions flared up then resolved themselves
blissfully as I watched Mikhail Baryshnikov perform last week with
his company, the White Oak Dance Project. Baryshnikov is now being
referred to in passing as ``50-something.'' That ``something'' is a
throwaway when you're in your 20s and an alert for your 30s; it is
embarrassingly coy at 40 and close to an indignity by 50.
</P>
<P>
   He is 51 and in what Henry James nicely albeit mournfully called
the middle years. And he is a great performer, as great as he ever
was but on different terms. It isn't only that he has moved from
ballet to modern dance, and that within modern dance he is
scrupulous about what kinds of movement his body can and cannot _
well, what's the right word? Accommodate, endure, master, submit
to, express.
</P>
<P>
   He always had what seemed like boundless virtuosity, charm and
passion. Now he can exist in the center of silence and stillness,
catching you with the smallest move of the hand or head, the way
the great silent screen actors did. There is an unobtrusive
melancholy here too (as if to say, aren't we always alone, even
when partnering and being partnered?).
</P>
<P>
   He was a beauty, in his quicksilver way. And he is still
wonderful to look at, but he is fully mortal now. The body seems
smaller; the hair has thinned, and the ears are a little big. The
intangibles are there in the face: pains, pleasures,
responsibilities, things done and not done. Everything leaves its
trace.
</P>
<P>
   As weight shifts in the body and skin changes its texture, the
accumulation of memory and experience and feeling alters us. Rudolf
Nureyev fought against all this, and what had been grand and bold
in him turned feverish and hysterical. Annabel Gamson, who restaged
and performed Isadora Duncan's work for many years, took the stage
with her long, beautiful white hair and used her artistry to make
age a haven for innocence and an emblem of experience.
</P>
<P>
   White hair is a litmus test, not only for how we choose to
present ourselves, but for what the consequences will be. And here,
the movies are a pretty good mirror of the lives we lead. For an
aging male star, white hair is striking, infinitely preferable to
hair that's disappearing or has been man-made, however efficiently.
(Bald heads work if the head is well-shaped or if, like that of
Telly Savelas, it dares you to pass judgment.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are a female star you had better be committed to
character roles or you'd better be Elizabeth Taylor. Ms. Taylor has
spent her middle years going through stages (marriages, weight
gains, weight losses, stays at the Betty Ford center) as flagrantly
as Drew Barrymore did in her childhood and adolescence. And there
is Ms. Taylor, with her white bob and her still-dark eyebrows, full
of no-nonsense shamelessness. Whether it's about how she ages or
what she wears, she has, bless her heart, made the principles of
good and bad taste equally meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bacall has chosen a safer, cannier route. She's putting
the grande dame and the tough dame together in one package; she
knows that the loftiness of one needs the earthiness of the other.
Spontaneous? Not for a moment, but terrifically efficient. It's the
mode followed by the men of her famous first husband's generation.
You gave the audience the mask of experience if you were Bogart or
Cooper or Grant. You shifted it a little with each role, just
enough so that experience seemed to be your choice, the manly
choice, and the one that pushed deterioration out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation plays it a little differently. Al Pacino, Jack
Nicholson and Harvey Keitel go for strategic deterioration. Mel
Gibson is on a nerve-racking cusp. There is a little too much hair,
and the smile, that boyish, naughty smile, is a little too much
insisted on nowadays. (Tom Cruise is going to face the same _ let's
call them issues _ as he grows older.)
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta is trading vanity for character, while Michael
Douglas tries to make vanity pass for character. And Robin Williams
has diversified with serious roles that take our attention away
from the verbal and physical mania of his youthful comic self. But,
as ``Patch Adams'' showed, when he blends low clowning with high
earnestness, he falls into the ``watch me, I'm still an adorable
extraterrestrial kid'' pit.
</P>
<P>
   What's true of actors like these is true for the human throng.
Old tricks and habits (ways of talking, dressing, reacting) can be
like outmoded pieces of equipment. They're usable, but they take
too much effort to be worth using much of the time. Or as a friend
of mine once observed about a piece of clothing we were looking at:
``You can get away with it. But do you want to?''
</P>
<P>
   Strategic decay is not a viable option for most women. Susan
Sarandon is going through a Baryshnikov-like process, making sure
that she gets better and better at what she does and that she looks
her best without trying to look like her younger self. Meryl Streep
has always played women of so many kinds and ages that her own
appearance is a kind of temporary shelter, the dressing room she
inhabits before going onstage. And like Robin Williams, Whoopi
Goldberg is trying to balance her dramatic gifts against her comic
ones. And to choose better projects too, it appears; bad movies do
not become middle-aged comics.
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that the test of a first-rate
intelligence was the ability to hold two opposing ideas in your
head at the same time and maintain the ability to keep functioning.
Clearly, being a pop star and growing older are just such ideas,
and it's almost impossible to find a performer who's willing even
to try holding on to them. They'd much rather grab onto the
signifiers of their glory days and hope that their fans will keep
on believing.
</P>
<P>
   For Diana Ross it's the vast head of curly hair, the archly warm
smile. For Keith Richards it's the jet-black hair and the ultra-hip
costumes. For James Brown it's the waved and processed hair and the
dance steps that now require considerable huffing and puffing. And
for Mick Jagger it's the hair, the clothes, the attitude, the
preening, onstage and off, which, in their own more refined English
way, are as desperate as the black leather, white pleats and gold
jewelry of Elvis Presley's later years.
</P>

   Enough. Back to Baryshnikov, onstage with five lovely dancers,
all young women. He gives off nary a hint of professional arrogance
(I'm the master here) or of sexual grandstanding. He is using time
and himself in ways that seem transcendent and yet, if the rest of
us are willing to take risks on our own scale, possible.

`GROWN UPS' ROLE FITS JALEEL WHITE PERFECTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaleel White has grown up. Turns out he's a fine actor who
doesn't have to exaggerate his appearance or change his voice to
get a laugh. With a high forehead that furrows like an Illinois
cornfield and big sleepy eyelids that are like mood-altering window
shades, White is a young Bill Cosby, able to use his face to
maximum comedic effect.
</P>
<P>
   White's ability lifts an otherwise drab comedy a couple of
notches above average, but ``Grown Ups,'' premiering Monday night
on UPN, isn't likely to be the show that makes people accept White
as someone other than Steve Urkel, the geekchild he played on
``Family Matters'' for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown Ups'' is a logical title and a logical segue for White.
His character, J. Calvin Frazier, is out of college and struggling
with the idea that ``the job I used to have is now my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. In Monday night's episode, Calvin has been
promoted to vice president of regional distribution for a
corrugated-box company. But change is afoot. The producers say
Calvin will be leaving cardboard for something more high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   His living arrangements will be changing, too. Soleil Moon Frye,
the grown-up Punky Brewster, plays Calvin's new roomie in the
pilot, but she won't be back, even though the original credits
listed her as a regular.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the show remains intact: Calvin is new to this
postgraduate grown-up thing, and he's making his way as best he can
with the help of best friend, Gordon, and Gordon's wife, Shari.
Sometimes he needs advice, such as this from Shari on proper
etiquette with a female roommate: ``Be considerate, leave the seat
down and don't walk around in your underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Calvin replies: ``That's no problem. I don't even wear
underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   White's timing, his expressions and his physical comedy tend to
be funnier than the lines, which break no new comedic ground. His
support from Dave Ruby and Marissa Ribisi is adequate, but ``Grown
Ups'' will have to succeed on White's everyman appeal. This is
easier at UPN, which doesn't need huge ratings to keep a show on
the air. But even if ``Grown Ups'' lasts a while, its legacy may
not be as the new paradigm of TV comedy but as a notable example of
integrated casting.
</P>
<P>
   Though White is African American and Ruby and Ribisi are not,
the difference in their races is not the crux of this buddy comedy.
No doubt it will come up at some point, as it inevitably does when
blacks and whites hang around together, but by accepting an
integrated living situation without poking fun at it, ``Grown Ups''
is as groundbreaking in its way as ``Room 222'' and ``The White
Shadow'' were a generation ago, especially in a TV season as
diversity-challenged as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Grown Ups. Half-hour comedy about three childhood friends
struggling with the new and unfamiliar responsibilities of
adulthood. Starring Jaleel White, Dave Ruby and Marissa Ribisi.
Season premiere Monday night on UPN. Episode repeats Tuesday at 8
p.m.; series moves to Mondays at 9 p.m. Aug. 30. Parental guideline
rating: TV-PG.

   Grade: B-

MULTIPLE POCKETS ARE BECOMING MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of pockets as a new accessory, something to compete with
jewelry, handbags or other holdalls.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple pockets _ once found only in frumpy travel clothes and
pocket-covered vests favored by photographers or fly-fishing fans _
are becoming mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But not all these new pockets are so obvious. A pair of plain
khaki pants has midthigh pockets accessed by a zipper hidden in the
inseam. A windbreaker has an extra pocket on a sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets are also sewn onto belts sold with sleek pants. It keeps
the pants line bulge-free and gives the occupant a place to stow
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Even a strapless evening gown from Yves Saint Laurent, shown in
a recent Nordstrom show, has pockets hidden in some delicate
shirring around hips and waist. A woman who pays $1,630 for this
dress won't have to buy an evening bag to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people are simply tired of lugging around bags or being
weighted down with fanny or back packs. Perhaps it's a backlash
against minimalist fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But once they discovered the multipocketed convenience and
comfort of cargo pants, there was no chance for pocketless garments
and those with plain old pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Julian, New York-based trend-watcher, says this pocket surge
is ``all about utilitarian fashion ... mobile dressing ... clothes
that adapt to us.'' He says it's taking cargo pants to the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   Sean wood, assistant manager at Seattle's Zebra Club, says
multipocket fashions are part of the high-tech and military
influences driving segments of the fashion business.
</P>
<P>
   At Zebra Club, there's a women's camisole ($40) complete with
two zippered pockets plus a cell-phone pocket all on one skimpy
little top. A hooded sweat shirt ($88) has a zippered patch pocket
set at an angle across the front.
</P>
<P>
   Even a plain, ribbed turtleneck women's sweater ($88) has a big
patch pocket just below the collar.
</P>
<P>
   The Powder Room has a classic pink buttoned-down shirt ($34.95).
But turn it around and there's a huge pocket across the back. Even
a short black cocktail dress ($36.95) has an oversize patch pocket
on one hip.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy stores are another source of high-pocket clothes.
Here's where to find six-pocket carpenter pants ($30), utility
vests with five pockets ($34), or sweatshirt-like sweaters with
hoods, front zippers and two big front pockets ($29.50).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to a combination of foresight, luck and good timing,
Richard Forman has won the right to boast. His company,
Register.com, is the first and most aggressive player in the game
of breaking up the monopoly on Internet address registrations that
a Virginia company, Network Solutions Inc., has enjoyed for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting gate is still closed to the more than 250
companies expected eventually to compete in what is stacking up to
be a risky venture even by Internet standards.
</P>
<P>
   One big unknown is how far registration fees will drop from the
$70 Network Solutions charges for an initial two-year registration
as more competitors enter the arena. An even bigger gamble is that
key rules for the game remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those rules will be decided this week when the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the nonprofit
corporation charged with introducing competition into the business
of registering names ending in the popular domains of .com, .net
and .org, holds its fourth board meeting in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The group is expected to approve a uniform dispute resolution
policy that the companies will have to follow in cases of
cybersquatting _ the practice of registering domain names just to
hold them in hopes of making a profit _ and other tangles over
trademark issues. The policy will be play a large role in
determining what legal liabilities the new competitors will
ultimately face.
</P>
<P>
   Other important issues also remain the subject of protracted
negotiations between Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., and
the Department of Commerce, which chose Icann last year to run the
Internet's addressing system and to establish the framework for
introducing competition to Network Solutions' cash-cow monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include contract terms for allowing competing
companies to register addresses in the master data base of domains
that Network Solutions will continue to administer _ including how
much they will pay Network Solutions as a service fee for each name
they register.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delays and uncertainties have a number of potential
competitors in a holding pattern, they have provided an unexpected
bonus for Register.com, which was one of five companies chosen in
April to participate in a pilot round of competition with Network
Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, the first of the five to go live, won't say how
many names it has already registered. But Forman, insists that the
numbers are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the second largest registrar in the world,'' he says
with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com has competed aggressively with Network Solutions in
what are expected to be important areas of the business _ like
providing customer service and computer operations for running Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com has entered into partnerships with nearly 20
companies, including Staples and Mastercard, giving it a link on
their Web sites and offering services related to building a Web
site. It also has partnerships with 30 Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But like the registration of domain names themselves, those are
all areas where Network Solutions has had a head start.
</P>
<P>
   With the exclusive right since 1993 to register addresses that
end in .com, .net and .org at $70 each, Network Solutions has
reported snowballing profits for the last 11 quarters. Anticipating
competition, it has spent much of the last two years building
international partnerships and new services aimed at small
businesses that want to build a Web presence. Network Solutions now
has more than 500 employees and averages 400,000 new domain name
registrations a month.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, by contrast, has about 100 employees and a lot
less cash. But Forman is confident that when the dust has settled,
he'll be on top. ``I spent a lot of money building these systems; I
know how much they cost,'' he said. ``You're going to see a lot of
companies that just can't do the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Merenbloom, an Internet analyst with Prudential Securities,
agrees in part with that assessment. ``The potential here is for a
very large industry,'' he said, ``but it is likely to be controlled
by _ or rather comprised of _ a few rather successful companies,
some largely successful, a few moderately successful companies and
a large number of nominally successful companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think Rich has positioned himself in the first
heat, and, given the inevitable issues and delays, he and others in
the first group have a natural time advantage. That's not to say
that over time the playing field won't level. I think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   But while those delays offer some advantages to the first five
companies, they are also making it difficult for them and for other
potential competitors to develop solid business plans and raise
capital, Merenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear what the requirements are to be successful _
other than quality service at a reasonable price,'' he said. ``The
real issue right now is that nobody wants to do the wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture are Internet giants like America
Online, which is also participating in the pilot round of
competition. Like the other bigger companies in that group _ France
Telecom and Melbourne IT _ it has done little yet to kick off the
business and has said even less about what its plans are or whether
it will try to go head-to-head with Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Stubbs, chairman of the only nonprofit group participating
in the test round of competition, the Internet Council of
Registrars, said a lot of people were ``waiting to see what comes
out of these negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how much money you are going to make next
week, it's hard to sign a lease on a new apartment,'' Stubbs said.

TALENT SHOW LETS EVERYONE BE A CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching a talent show is a lot like spending time at the
airport. As the contestants pass in review, one's thoughts are
oddly similar to those that arise at a crowded carousel in baggage
claim: ``What the heck is he wearing?'' ``Is that a man or a
woman?'' ``Nice eyes.'' ``Long legs.'' ``Sheesh, what an annoying
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are thoughts that are more or less unique to
talent shows: ``Who told her she could sing?'' ``Who told him he
was funny?'' ``What the heck was that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in judgment of others may not be polite, but we all do
it.
</P>
<P>
   And talent shows like ``Destination Stardom,'' which is the
first new fall show to debut this season, pretty much demand it.
Premiering Monday night at 8 on the fledgling Pax TV network,
``Destination Stardom'' has 100 members of the audience pick the
winners. Viewers at home also can vote for their favorites and
parlay their judgmental sides into a free Hawaii vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Canning of ``Entertainment Tonight'' is the host, taking
over capably where Ed McMahon left off when ``Star Search,'' also
created by longtime producer Al Masini, went bye-bye five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Masini has tweaked the format to offer more prize money, but the
concept is essentially the same: Competitors in several categories
go head to head, with each winner receiving a cash prize and the
right to compete the next week against a new challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The categories are singers under 16, singers over 16, comedy,
variety, family variety (in which the members of an act must be
related) and female models.
</P>
<P>
   The models parade around in swimwear, perhaps a tad racy for a
family-values network like Pax TV. But what family doesn't like
cheesecake? (On Monday night, the choices are Norwegian cheesecake,
German cheesecake and Hawaiian cheesecake.)
</P>
<P>
   We won't divulge the identity of Monday night' winners, not even
in the variety category, which pits Jaret Hughes and six members of
the Seattle SuperSonics dance team against a juggling unicyclist
from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe one winner. That would be Hawaii, where
``Destination Stardom'' is produced. With opening and closing
scenes that play like a travelogue, the show is the sort of
shameless promotional spot that every Chamber of Commerce executive
dreams about.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Destination Stardom'' is about dreams, and what better
place than a vacation paradise to help make them come true?
</P>
<P>
   With slick production and hokey intentions, ``Destination
Stardom'' offers the kind of ``interactive'' connection TV has been
making ever since Ted Mack succeeded Major Bowes and asked each of
us to render judgment on complete strangers who dreamed of making
it big and got a chance to realize the dream.
</P>
<P>
   Destination Stardom. One-hour variety show featuring competitors
in six talent categories. Hosted by Lisa Canning. Season premiere

MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSIONS DRIVE NET TOWARD GRIDLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a nation's highway system, the Internet has traffic rules
that prevent chaos and gridlock. But an increasingly popular type
of multimedia traffic is turning out to be a cyber road hog that
flouts the rules and creates traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   This scofflaw traffic, known as streaming media, is widely
hailed as the future of home entertainment, capable of eventually
delivering high-quality audio and video programming over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, network experts warn, it may drive everyone else
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media is analogous to broadcast media in that the
audio or video material is produced as soon as a computer receives
the data over the Internet. The problem is that the streaming data
does not respond to network congestion in the way other Internet
traffic does.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer sending conventional data encounters congestion,
it significantly slows its own transmission rate, but a computer
sending streaming data will reduce the flow only slightly. So if
streaming traffic competes with conventional traffic for the same
congested strip of roadway, the streaming traffic, like some VIP
motorcade, assumes the right of way and lets all other data traffic
pile up.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, said Van Jacobson, chief scientist for Cisco
Systems Inc., a leading maker of Internet traffic routers, is that
conventional traffic ``is polite; this stuff is impolite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People writing software for that traffic _ they don't care,''
Jacobson said of streaming media. ``In the long term, it's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, streaming media has to flow continuously to
the user's computer, so it cannot follow the same traffic rules as
conventional data. But even so, it is possible for packets of
streaming data to interact civilly with other traffic on the
Internet. The reason they do not, Jacobson said, is that streaming
media providers have no incentive to comply with traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, ``if Real Networks is polite and Microsoft
isn't, then Real looks crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even elbowing all other data aside, today's streaming media
produces a very low quality of entertainment most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that lack of quality today is a result of slow modems at
the user's end. In three to five years, when cable modems and
souped-up digital telephone lines are expected to be common, most
Internet users may be listening to live Webcasts or playing
high-quality radio on their computers. In 10 years, movies and
commercial television might very well be carried over Internet
channels.
</P>
<P>
   This increasing demand will add vast amounts of streaming
traffic to the Internet and could lead to what Jacobson calls
``congestion collapse'' _ the Internet equivalent of gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers are also concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blake, vice president for marketing and business
development for AT&AMP;T Labs Research, calls the trend disturbing,
adding, ``What people are saying is, `If my stuff gets through,
that's all I care about.''' He said AT&AMP;T and other Internet service
providers were pressuring the producers of streaming media to head
off the problem before it grows out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media traffic is also of growing concern to the
Internet Engineering Task Force, an industry group that is the
closest thing the Internet has to a governing technical body.
Jacobson, an active task force participant, said the group has not
yet formally addressed the issue, because ``it's not big enough to
kill the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet anyway. But a number of Internet service providers are
getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said he would like to see streaming media use
congestion controls that are compatible with those used for
conventional data-packet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, according to measurements by the National Laboratory for
Applied Network Research at the University of California at San
Diego, none of the existing streaming media providers are using
such controls.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks, the largest streaming media provider, declined to
respond to the growing criticism, although a spokesman, Jay
Wampold, said the company was trying to address congestion
problems. Over the last year, he said, Real Networks had installed
a network of computers for delivering the company's broadcasts that
bypasses the Internet's main traffic routes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Unangst, lead product manager for Windows Media, the
streaming media division at Microsoft Corp., said the company was
working with network companies to route its streaming data around
the Internet's main arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know bandwidth and optimizing bandwidth is a huge, huge
issue,'' Unangst said, using an industry term for transmission
capacity, ``and we're covering all the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson said that while actions like those taken by Real
Networks and Microsoft might help, they would not resolve the
problem. The bottlenecks are not on the main thoroughfares, he
said, but on the side streets and access roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get out to the edge of network, closer to users, that's
where the bandwidth gets limited,'' he said.

<P>
   While cable modems and digital subscriber lines will increase
bandwidth to the home, a truly significant increase in Internet
bandwidth would require ripping out 300 million copper wires and
replacing them with fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen fast,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy, experts say, lies in providing incentives for
streaming media providers to comply with traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper incentive structure in place, streaming material
from both Microsoft and Real Networks would look slightly worse
than it does now, Jacobson said, but at least the competition for
bandwidth would be fairer.
</P>
<P>
   As a standards-setting organization, the Internet Engineering
Task Force does not have legal authority to force software
developers to adopt congestion-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But standards, which enable all the computers linked to the
Internet to talk to one another, can sometimes be used to
discourage disruptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tragedy of the commons,'' said Sally Floyd, a
researcher at the AT&AMP;T Center for Internet Research at the
International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif. ``Only
with the right incentive structure do the right things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tragedy of the commons'' is an example from economic game
theory. If a group of farmers must graze their cattle in the same
small patch of grass, or commons, it is in the farmers' collective
interest not to overgraze, lest all the grass die out and all the
cows starve. The problem is that it is in each individual farmer's
interest to act counter to the common good.

</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Internet traffic _ e-mail and data transmissions to and
from Web sites, for example _ follows a basic set of traffic laws
known as the transmission control protocol, or TCP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, when rising Net traffic led to severe
congestion problems, TCP has included a congestion-control
mechanism that instructs a transmitting computer to slow the data
flow by half as soon as the data it is sending encounters
congestion. Only when the congestion clears does the data speed up
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is that congestion itself is effectively
the error signal that gives the sender the feedback to speed up or
slow down,'' said Robert J. Berger, president of Internet Bandwidth
Development, a consulting firm in Saratoga, Calif. ``It means that
there will almost always be at least a bit of congestion, but
that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not OK when traffic that conforms to TCP runs into
traffic that does not follow those same rules. When the point of
congestion is reached, TCP traffic cuts its sending rate in half.
But streaming traffic just barrels through the stoplights. This in
turn creates more congestion, which further slows the law-abiding
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media traffic ``needs to back off,'' said Scott
Shenker, head of the AT&AMP;T Center for Internet Research in Berkeley.
``I think most researchers feel it's a flaw in the Internet
architecture that there's no way to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shenker and Jacobson believe the solution to the streaming
media problem is to build incentives into the architecture to
encourage good behavior. But they have very different ideas of what
form those incentives should take.
</P>
<P>
   Shenker prefers to plant a mechanism within Internet routers
that he calls ``fair queuing,'' which would force packets sent from
different sources to wait their turn to be sent.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's proposal, developed with Ms. Floyd in 1989 and only
now being tested in Cisco routers, uses a kind of virtual penalty
box. When the router experiences congestion, it takes a random
sample of its traffic. If a certain host computer is
overrepresented in that sample, its packets are placed at the end
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   This creates the right incentive structure, he said, because the
Internet service providers do not have to persuade Real Networks or
any other company to obey the rules. Rather, he says, ``The
customers do instead, because the quality'' of their audio and
video ``gets really crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair queuing and penalty boxes rely on software fixes to change
the incentives. Another approach, favored by many service
providers, is to create economic incentives for fair sharing of the
roadways. The basic idea is that heavy users should be paying for
the extra bandwidth that they consume.
</P>
<P>
   This model, known as differential service, is already being
deployed on the Internet. But there are many questions about how it
should be adapted to streaming media _ especially about who should
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real puzzle about streaming media is who is going to make
the money _ if we knew this, then we could answer a lot of the
technical questions,'' said David Clark, a senior research
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory
for Computer Science.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever solution is eventually adopted, the streaming media
problem is certain to be resolved, these experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Internet that's growing and can handle streaming media is
in everyone's interests,'' said Blake of AT&AMP;T Labs. ``We poke each
other with sharp sticks all the time, but slowly we move forward.''

SEAFOOD STEW A BEACHCOMBER'S REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a lean year for Dungeness crab. Razor clams, once
easy pickings along public Northwest beaches, are fewer and often
far between.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for glass balls from Japan? They're not as abundant as
they used to be. Beachcombers are also bemoaning the fact they
seldom find red beavers, blue turtles, green frogs, yellow plastic
ducks or white Nike sneakers among the driftwood on the shores of
Pacific beaches any more.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike crab and razor clams, it takes a whole lot of plastic
ducks to make a meal. Boil a sneaker for a month and you'd still
need a chain saw to carve it into serving pieces.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason the Sneaker Society has disbanded. The
other reason is that it has been almost a decade since five,
box-car-size ``shoe boxes'' were lost off a container ship. A
couple of years later some of the 40,000 Nike sneakers began to
wash up on Oregon beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of that area collected 40 or more wet but
serviceable shoes. Since Cannon Beach was named for an ancient
weapon salvaged off its shores, it was natural that Oregon
community would serve as unofficial headquarters for the Sneaker
Society, formed so that a resident who found 13 left shoes might
match then up with right shoes in appropriate sizes.
</P>
<P>
   At about the time the tide of sneakers began to ebb, toy ducks,
blue turtles, green frogs and red beavers began to wash up on
Alaska beaches. They were manufactured in Hong Kong and headed for
Tacoma, Wash., when containers were lost during the great storm of
'92. It took two years for the toy creatures to reach communities
like Sitka.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents of Cannon Beach are holding their communal breaths
for a flood of Lego pieces. Some five million tiny building blocks
were lost off England in 1997. Oceanographers predict the currents
may carry them to Oregon beaches in about 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping officials say some 1,000 containers are lost overboard
each year and the cargo is often swept along thousands of miles by
ocean currents.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Dungeness crabs and razor clams begin reappearing in much
larger numbers, oceanfront residents are hoping the next Northwest
tide might bring in some spilled cans of clams and tomato sauce
plus a few errant bottles of wine to form a foundation for this
seafood feast.
</P>
<P>
   Flotsam Stew
</P>
<P>
   32 ounces chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   18-ounce can tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 green peppers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   Handful of chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Italian herbs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon (or more) red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound small shrimp
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds halibut, snapper or cod
</P>
<P>
   16-and-a-half ounce can undrained chopped clams
</P>
<P>
   In a pot combine the first 13 ingredients. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes, or until potatoes
are fork tender.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the fish fillets into bite-sized pieces and add to the pot
along with the shrimp and clams. Remove from heat when the fish can
be flaked with a fork. This makes six main-dish servings.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I cooked this stew I used large squid steaks,
cubed, instead of the clams. You could also use small squid,
cleaned and cut into rings.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't recommend sauteed sneaker laces. But they might help
fill out the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if a few acorn squash from Samoa wash up on the local
beaches, this makes a delicious side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Samoa Squash
</P>
<P>
   2 acorn squash
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup water
</P>
<P>
   1-and one-third cups frozen peas, cooked
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dill weed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Cut the squash in half and remove seeds and fibers. Melt the
butter and add the brown sugar. Divide among the four squash
halves. Place squash in a pan cut side up. Pour one-half cup of
water into the pan. Bake 75 minutes at 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the peas with the sour cream, dill and lemon juice.
Divide among the squash, then return them to the oven for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four beachcombers.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider an assortment of plastic toys for table
decorations.

SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN TAKE TO THE INTERNET FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Uniprime Capital Acceptance Inc., a small
automobile dealer with an even smaller stock price, announced early
last month that it had acquired a new dealership, its share price
hardly budged.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Uniprime made a more startling
announcement: It had a cure for AIDS. And with that news,
transmitted at lightning speed over the Internet, Uniprime's shares
more than doubled. Online message boards favored by individual
investors were abuzz with happy chatter about the company's
prospects, making Uniprime one of the Internet's most talked about
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS cure turned out to be a stock fraud cooked up by a
self-described doctor named Alfred Flores, according to a civil
complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week
against Uniprime and Flores in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Last Thursday, federal law enforcement officials raided Uniprime's
headquarters in Las Vegas and arrested Flores in connection with
his role in the scam, which regulators describe as unusually
brazen. Flores' medical credentials now appear to be dubious, and
his resume, posted online, omitted an important detail: a criminal
conviction years ago for his role in a murder, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Like snake-oil salesmen who rode into frontier towns peddling
cure-alls more than a century ago, modern hucksters have taken to
the Internet with gusto. And as the Uniprime debacle shows, amid
the worthwhile companies promoting themselves on the Internet are
shadowy scam artists who pose a real threat to unwary or
unsophisticated investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Internet has done is make it possible for people to
have a wide geographic reach promoting cures and products very
cheaply,'' said Stephen Barrett, a doctor in Allentown, Pa., who
specializes in unearthing health scams. ``So there are probably
more people involved with scams than ever before even though
there's no way of finding data to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Uniprime came to regulators' attention last month when Cameron
Funkhouser, head of market regulation for the National Association
of Securities Dealers, was feeding his 4-month-old son early one
morning as he perused Internet stock boards. A message, bearing
Uniprime's stock symbol, flashed across his computer screen: ``Buy
UPCA!''
</P>
<P>
   A little digging on the Internet about Uniprime convinced
Funkhouser that something was amiss. A few hours later, the NASD,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service began an investigation of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wonders how these investigations get triggered,''
Funkhouser said. ``Well, that's how it happened. The wrong guy read
the message they spammed across the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and other securities regulators have been mounting an
increasingly public offensive against Internet fraud over the last
year. While regulators have brought dozens of fraud cases against
Internet companies since 1995, a large portion of the suits were
filed this year and last.
</P>
<P>
   But even with heightened enforcement activity, resource-poor
regulators, who often have a difficult time keeping up with fraud
in the off-line world, face even greater challenges trying to
monitor cyberscams.
</P>
<P>
   Uniprime, and its chief executive, Gary Tabb, did not respond to
requests for an interview. Tabb, while named in the SEC suit, is
not a defendant. A lawyer representing the company and Flores did
not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the Uniprime scam was hatched this
spring when Flores, 45, was passing through Las Vegas and ran into
a friend of Tabb's at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   An introduction was arranged and Flores told Tabb that he had
invented Plasma Plus, a miracle cure that had effectively conquered
the virus that causes AIDS. Almost immediately, the two men decided
to go into business together, according to the SEC's suit.
</P>
<P>
   From at least September 1998 until the Flores-Tabb meeting,
Uniprime had issued a stream of news releases about its intention
to acquire car dealerships and become one of the largest dealer
chains in the country. Uniprime currently claims to own only a
handful of dealerships in New York and South Carolina. In May,
Flores and Tabb formed a company, New Technologies, to promote
Plasma Plus. Uniprime got a large stake in the company and Flores,
who signed over Plasma Plus' patent rights to New Technologies,
became New Technologies' president. Then the games began.
</P>
<P>
   Uniprime never released any meaningful financial reports, and,
because it trades in the loosely regulated online world of
small-stock bulletin boards, was not required to file extensive
disclosure reports with the SEC. Its glowing news releases about
the promises of Plasma Plus, though, were enough to stir up a
frenzy among investors.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, the day Funkhouser of the NASD saw ``Buy UPCA!''
flash across his computer screen, Uniprime announced a ``major
breakthrough in the field of HIV research.'' The release claimed
that five AIDS patients in Spain had been successfully treated with
Plasma Plus. The next day, Uniprime's shares jumped $3.25 to $5 as
more than 5 million shares of the company were traded. Presto.
Uniprime, with shares that were worth about 25 cents each in
January, now had a market value of about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallah! Hallah! Hallah! Shout it from the rooftops of the
banks. Praise the money. From the church of the immaculate buck.
Praise the money,'' read the July 20 post of an apparent Uniprime
investor, a ``mr. r,'' on Raging Bull, an Internet stock board.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Bull is gossip central in the mania surrounding Uniprime.
To date more than 10,000 messages have been posted about Uniprime
on the site, making it one of the most talked about stocks on
Raging Bull's message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors were skeptical of Uniprime's claims from the
beginning. On July 21 an investor with the screen name ``darking''
took speculators to task in a message posted on Raging Bull.
``Believing this is a cure for HIV is like believing (on my say so)
that I have a cure for aging,'' darking wrote. ``Not bloody
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, enough investors bought the hype to give Uniprime a
valuation far out of proportion to its real financial prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But Uniprime devotees should have been skeptical. According to
the SEC's complaint, Flores had little in his background to suggest
he had stumbled upon an AIDS cure. In 1983, the complaint says,
Flores was convicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder
``based upon his participation in the murder of a friend's parents
in their Colorado house after they refused to hand over valuables
to Flores and their son.'' Flores was sentenced to 25 years in
prison, but was paroled in 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Flores, who claims to be a native of Spain with U.S.
citizenship, went to great lengths to pad his resume. He claimed to
have spent 15 years in a laboratory outside Lisbon, Portugal, doing
immunology research, an impossibility given the prison time Flores
was serving. He also claimed to be an honors graduate of the
University of Colorado, but he never attended it.
</P>
<P>
   Claims of having successfully tested Plasma Plus on five
patients were also dubious, and a supposed agreement to do further
research with an AIDS foundation in the Bahamas was a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Although the SEC suspended trading in Uniprime's shares on July
22, some investors, either because they could not be convinced
otherwise or because they were actively participating in pumping up
the shares, refused to lose faith in Uniprime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation is not by the SEC!'' posted ``irvine'' on
Raging Bull on Aug. 16. ``This is the gov. trying to suppress
information to the public with pressure from THE MAJOR DRUG
COMPANIES.''
</P>
<P>
   Small brokerages are often some of the most active participants
in the trading that envelops the freewheeling world of stock
bulletin boards. The bulk of the trading volume in Uniprime's
shares passed through three small brokerage firms, Knight
Securities Inc., Wien Securities Corp. and Hill Thompson Magid &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Uniprime's shares, which resumed trading on Aug. 5, now trade at
about 25 cents, beaten flat by last week's raids on the company by
law enforcement officials. Perhaps one burned Uniprime investor,
``consolimd,'' in a message posted on Raging Bull on Aug. 14, best
captured the current mood of Uniprime investors:
``Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Postal Inspection Service has filed a criminal
complaint against Flores and the SEC's investigation is continuing.
While not new, the lesson of the Uniprime scandal is still
valuable, regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the perils of investing in companies that do not file
disclosure documents with the SEC. The only disclosure this company
made was press releases,'' said Andrew Geist, the SEC's associate
regional director in New York. ``You wonder whether investors are
looking at these companies with a critical eye.''

2 DIE, 206 HURT AS JET WITH 315 ABOARD CRASHES IN STORM AT HONG
KONG AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A Taiwan jetliner crash-landed and burst into flames
during a tropical storm here Sunday night, killing two people and
injuring 206, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The China Airlines plane from Bangkok with 300 passengers and 15
crew members was landing in fierce wind and rain when its right
wing touched the runway. The plane flipped over and skidded to a
stop, as flames swiftly engulfed the aircraft, several witnesses
told local television and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for China Airlines in Taipei said the plane, a
McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had been buffeted by strong winds as it
landed on the south runway of the new Hong Kong International
Airport at 6:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses reported, though, that the plane had been on
fire before it touched down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the plane, like a fireball coming down,'' Toshi Hoshino,
a passenger who was changing planes in Hong Kong, told the AP.
``The right wing hit the ground first. The left side of the body
then followed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the government could not confirm whether the
plane caught fire before or after it landed.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with local television, several passengers
described a chaotic scene inside the plane, with people hanging
upside down in their seats as flames moved steady from the front to
the back of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters quickly gained access to the plane through a rear
galley and led passengers to safety. Most of the passengers were
Thai, but about 80 were Portuguese tourists, the AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash-landing is the first serious accident at Hong
Kong International Airport, a vast $9-billion complex that opened
last July on an island west of Hong Kong. It replaced Kai Tak, a
cramped airfield on Victoria Harbor that was legendary for its
rooftop-skimming landings.
</P>
<P>
   But the accident is the latest in a series involving China
Airlines. In 1993, a China Airlines 747 skidded off the runway at
Kai Tak, landing in the harbor and injuring 23 people. In 1994, a
China Airlines Airbus A300-600 crashed in Nagoya, Japan, killing
264. And in 1998, 196 people were killed when a China Airlines jet
plunged into a row of houses near Chiang Kai-shek Airport in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan civil aviation officials
said the plane tilted 15 degrees as it touched down. A spokesman
for the airline, Shih Ping-huang, said ``side wind was very strong
when the plane landed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong government said the two
confirmed fatalities were a man and a woman. Their identities were
not disclosed. China Airlines said at least four other people were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Local television showed pictures of the plane on its back with
its landing gear protruding upward. Although emergency vehicles
converged on the plane within moments of the crash, witnesses said
firefighters struggled to put out the blaze in the gale-force winds
and sheets of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong had been lashed by wind and rain throughout the day as
Typhoon Sam moved ashore from the South China Sea just east of the
territory. The storm caused several flight delays, as well as
cancellations of ferry service from the central Hong Kong to
outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the No. 8
cyclone warning signal, which indicates average winds of 39 to 73
miles per hour. The storm, which generated gusts of 81 miles per
hour during the afternoon, uprooted trees, tore down signs and
flooded roads throughout the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here noted that Hong Kong's airport remains open
during typhoons, even with the No. 8 warning signal is hoisted.
They said it was up to individual airlines and pilots to decide
whether to land. Hong Kong closed the airport immediately after the
crash so that the passengers could be evacuated.

   YALOVA, Turkey _ As the sun beat down on this seaside resort,
several dozen people spent the day Sunday watching and waiting as
noisy power shovels tore through a 50-foot-high pile of debris that
was a handsome apartment house less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some had already seen the bodies of relatives pulled from the
ruins. The stench was a grim signal that many more are entombed
here.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, one group of aid workers cried out. A power
shovel had broken into a bedroom, and they could see a corpse
inside. The big machine backed away, and workers began pulling away
slabs of concrete by hand.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the bloated body of a woman who might have been
about 20 was freed. Workers wrapped it in a blanket, zipped it
inside a green plastic body bag and carried it to a waiting
ambulance, which sped away with its siren blaring.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions brought on by the discovery seemed to subside for a
while, but then one man sitting in the crowd turned pale, wept
silently, and suddenly began screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen years old!'' he shouted, his face contorted with pain
and grief. ``Buried under there! Just a baby! Just 13!'' With both
his hands, he began violently ripping up the grass around him.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers wiped the man's brow with wet cloths and sought
to comfort him. They managed to calm him after a few minutes, but
he refused to be led away, preferring to maintain his awful vigil.
</P>
<P>
   As power shovels worked, the flotsam of dozens of lives tumbled
out of the rubble. There were clothes, mattresses, bookshelves,
carpets, a television, a washing machine, a radiator, a toilet and
a set of the works of Balzac, translated into Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew we weren't ready for something like this,''
lamented Mehmet Kocadag, 65, who had traveled to Yalova from his
home in eastern Turkey. The bodies of three of his relatives had
been found on Saturday, and he was waiting for a fourth that he
said was surely decomposing in the sticky heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third earthquake I've lived through, and I can
tell you that no matter what you're hearing now, in a week or a
month or at most a year, everything will be forgotten,'' Kocadag
said. ``We'll go back to building with sand, and when the next
quake comes, you'll see scenes like this all over again. The army
and the state will be too late, and thousands more will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Onur Disbudak, a soldier posted in Yalova, said he had spent
several days listening to complaints like these, along with some
that were far sharper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry and emotional,'' he said. ``How could they
not be? They want someone to blame, and if they want to blame us,
that's fine. But since we've gotten here, things have calmed down a
little. Turkish people aren't afraid of police, but they respect
the army. When we ask them to move, they move.''
</P>
<P>
   The army and government were not the only targets of wrath in
Yalova Sunday. Many people said they would happily help lynch the
contractor who built the collapsed apartment house near where they
were sitting. They said his shoddy workmanship and substandard
materials had caused scores of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that other buildings only a hundred yards away were
damaged only lightly or not at all lent credence to their charges.
But the contractor, like many others whose work is now being
scrutinized, has disappeared.

MARRYING CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY TO POWER LINES  
 FINDING MISSING PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The vast majority of American homes and businesses are wired for
telecommunications. But the phone lines, telephone poles,
fiber-optic cables and switching stations that Americans take for
granted can be scarce in other countries. Installing that equipment
in poorer nations is an expensive undertaking, and so for many in
Asia, Africa or the Middle East, phones remain a luxury. Cellular
networks could eliminate the need to wire houses, lay cable or
erect poles, but suggesting that poor villagers in a nation like
Vietnam use cell phones has something of a ``let them eat cake''
attitude about it.
 &HT;    The governments of many such nations have given the higher
priority to providing electrical power to their citizens, even in
the most rural areas. That may prove to be a telecommunications
solution, too.
 &HT;    Paul Kline, an inventor from Germantown, Md., has devised a
wireless telecommunications system that takes advantage of the
electrical power infrastructure. His invention marries conventional
power lines with cellular technology and standard telephone
equipment to bring phones, fax machines and computer modems into
homes and businesses that have no telecommunications wiring.
 &HT;    Kline calls his invention a ``wireless local loop distribution
system.'' He first installs a transceiver that connects electrical
power lines and standard telephone equipment in homes and offices.
Then he attaches what he calls a ``fixed wireless terminal'' to the
power grid in the region. The phone signal is sent via the power
lines to the wireless terminal, which in turn transmits it to other
wireless terminals or to a base station.
 &HT;    More than one home or business can be linked to a single
wireless terminal because most power distribution systems use
step-down transformers for clusters of homes or businesses. The
transformers reduce the high voltage sent over electrical lines to
the 110 or 220 volts used in homes. Each cluster of buildings
connected to a step-down transformer is effectively isolated from
every other cluster.
 &HT;    Kline envisions that this could mean that clusters of homes or
businesses could also be isolated via his wireless
telecommunications terminals. The terminals would be able to
``multiplex'' the signals from different buildings, according to
his patent filing. Thus, the system could carry more than one user
in each transformer cluster. Kline hopes that one wireless terminal
for several customers would make his invention even cheaper to use.
 &HT;    The wireless terminal is also connected to a power meter, so
that energy use can be transmitted to a power company. Kline
received patent 5,937,342.

   Help in Finding That Lost Document
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating search for a single document in a ream of papers
or a room full of files may be over. Marvin Isaacman and Denis
McGreivy, two California inventors, have patented a system that
uses radio signals to pinpoint a piece of paper on its precise
shelf or drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Office files are usually labeled and stored alphabetically,
numerically, by color or bar code. But those systems don't help
when a folder is misfiled or lost. In their patent, the inventors
say a recent study found that ``an average U.S. executive spends
around $10,000 a year searching for missing files.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to eliminate this waste, the inventors first tag files or
documents with a passive radio frequency code. The tag is made up
of a small coil or antenna that collects energy and an integrated
circuit bearing an identification code. When someone wants to
locate the document, a computer-controlled transceiver transmits
the coded signal via an antenna in first one, and then a second,
radio frequency. The tags pick up energy from the transceiver; when
a match is made, the relevant tag is activated and sends a signal
back to the transceiver.
</P>
<P>
   Since the signal is a radio frequency, it does not require
direct line-of-sight between the transceiver and the tagged files.
So documents can be stored in a box, cabinet or drawer. Antennas
set up on shelves or in drawers can extend the signal. Once the
correct signal is received, the computer then automatically names
the shelf or drawer where the document can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacman, from Los Angeles, and McGreivy, from Laguna Niguel,
Calif., received patent 5,936,527.

FORMER HEAD OF DELL PUBLISHING TO MOVE TO DUTTON BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three months after fleeing an executive-level reorganization,
one of Random House's former top publishers and editors is taking
over an imprint for a rival and raising hopes that some of her
authors will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Baron, who abruptly quit as president and publisher of
Dell Publishing, part of Bertelsmann AG, will become the president
of Penguin Putnam Inc.'s Dutton Books. Her goal will be to raise
the profile of fiction at the imprint, which offers an eclectic mix
of popular titles that range from Sylvie Brown's best-selling
psychic's guide ``The Other Side and Back'' to Diane Johnson's ``Le
Divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock to the system allowed me to do some heavy
thinking,'' Ms. Baron said of her departure from Dell after more
than 18 years spent editing writers like Thomas Harris and Danielle
Steel. ``I had to try to decide what I wanted to do next, and I had
a lot of advisers. I really realized that when I was working on
`Hannibal' and doing the last-minute editorial stuff, just how much
I enjoy what I do. And I wanted to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Ms. Baron's resignation, Harris issued a
statement bemoaning ``the mindless waste of the company's best
resources.'' But it is unlikely that he will follow Ms. Baron to
Dutton, owned by Pearson PLC, because he has a contract to write
another book for Random House and takes years to complete
manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had relationships with writers over the years, many
relationships, and when any of them are free and available I would
love to publish any of them,'' Ms. Baron said. ``But there's
nothing to talk about really.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Janklow, the literary agent for three of Ms. Baron's
former authors at Dell, including Ms. Steel, said contracts would
probably keep the writers in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steel, Janklow said, ``is in the middle of a long contract,
and there have been no conversations whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people have contractual obligations, and they
will probably play them out,'' he added.

AS HOPE OF FINDING NEW SURVIVORS ENDS, RELIEF EFFORT ACCELERATES

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With hope of finding survivors of Turkey's
devastating earthquake now all but gone, the Turkish authorities
are turning their attention to caring for those who have survived.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale relief effort in the area hit by the earthquake is
finally beginning after days of confusion. Turkish and foreign
volunteers have been joined by soldiers and police, and heavy
equipment has been moved to almost every victimized town.
</P>
<P>
   Divers scoured the waters of the Sea of Marmara Sunday for the
first time since the quake and reported that they had found more
than 150 bodies. Most of those victims had apparently lived in
homes facing the sea, which lies at the center of the earthquake
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials said more than 12,000 bodies have been
recovered so far, and a U.N. relief official has estimated that the
final death toll may reach 40,000. More than 33,000 people were
injured in the quake, and at least 200,000 are homeless. Only two
survivors were found beneath the rubble Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's crisis center issued an appeal for body bags,
tents, blankets and dry food, but said help ``is especially welcome
if it comes in the form of cash donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were visible on the streets of many devastated towns on
Sunday, collecting refuse, keeping spectators away from dangerous
sites, spraying disinfectants and spreading lime powder along
gutters. Military trucks and jeeps moved through streets alongside
power shovels, bulldozers and other heavy equipment sent by nearby
cities and private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, the country's top military commander,
toured hospitals and pledged that the military, which has been
criticized for what some say was its slow reaction to the aftermath
of the quake, would do all in its power to aid the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of Housing Koray Aydin estimated that 60,000 buildings
had been either destroyed or seriously damaged in the quake. He
said that within a few days, he would begin moving many of the
homeless out of the fields and tents where they are now living.
Some are to be given prefabricated huts, and others will have rooms
in unused hotels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary housing compounds will be set up, taking into
account the desire of our homeless citizens to remain close to the
areas where they lived,'' Aydin said.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement was a reflection of the accelerated pace with
which the government is now moving to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In another step, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit fired the
appointed governors of Yalova, Kocaeli and Sakarya, three of the
hardest-hit provinces. He said they had proved unable to meet the
challenges posed by last week's disaster, and he replaced them
temporarily with members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the strength to overcome the devastation of this
earthquake very soon,'' Ecevit said in a televised speech. ``We
only need to trust in the strength of our nation and our state.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a few Turks remained angry, not only at Ecevit but at
the entire state apparatus. They accuse the government of failing
to grasp the magnitude of the crisis for days and then responding
too slowly to save many victims who had been buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest newspaper, Hurriyet, devoted nearly a full
page to an account of how two Japanese officials committed suicide
after the Japanese city of Kobe was devastated by an earthquake in
1995. They had been blamed for permitting poor construction and not
responding quickly enough to the needs of victims.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper, Cumhurriyet, published a front-page editorial
headlined, ``A Complete Change of Mentality is Needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for fundamental change in Turkey is obvious,'' the
editorial said. ``If this earthquake does not rouse us from our
torpor, it will be impossible to maintain hope for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey remains in a state of shock, with smiles rare even in
areas far from the earthquake zone. Each day, newspapers carry
reports and photos that seem more awful and more tragic than those
that came before. In cafes, bars and tea houses, people sit glumly,
shaking their heads and murmuring to themselves as they watch
heart-rending scenes unfold on television.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By one count, 42 countries and 38 international organizations
have sent aid to Turkey since Tuesday. More than 3,000 U.S. sailors
and marines aboard three warships laden with medical supplies were
expected to arrive early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank pledged to send $200 million for emergency
housing construction. Deputy Prime Minister Recep Onal said the
government was considering issuing special ``earthquake bonds'' to
raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers found just two living victim of the earthquake Sunday.
One was a 57-year-old woman who was pulled from the debris of her
home in Golcuk. Another woman, 52, was pulled out from the rubble
of her home, southwest of Golcuk, by Israeli, Turkish and Bulgarian
rescue teams, the Israeli army said. Some believe that they may be
the last to be found alive.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that few if any victims remain alive beneath the
rubble, teams of rescue workers from Germany, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Japan and Britain began packing for their return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we came here was to save people,'' said Edward
Pearce, who headed one of the British teams. ``That has ended.''

JETS CUT ZOLAK AND MAKE MIRER BACKUP TO TESTAVERDE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The two most surprised backup quarterbacks in
Jets' camp passed each other Sunday _ Scott Zolak going, Rick Mirer
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells whittled the No. 2 spot down to a more
manageable size by cutting Zolak and, while not announcing it
officially, anointing Mirer the backup behind Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer still was reeling over the Friday night trade with the
Packers that made him a Jet after he thought he had finally found a
home in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And Zolak? He had discovered minutes before he was given his
audition as the Jets' backup on Friday night against the
Philadelphia Eagles that Mirer was his new teammate. The news
didn't help his performance: In six drives, he was unable to lead
the second-stringers to a score.
</P>
<P>
   On releasing Zolak, Parcells said, ``It's a better opportunity
for him to go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer's acquisition, for an undetermined draft pick next year,
echoes last year's arrival of Testaverde, a former Heisman Trophy
winner and the top pick over all in the 1987 draft who had played
for years with bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the very first things Coach Parcells said to me it this
is not unlike what happened to Vinny,'' said Mirer Sunday as he
prepared to suit up for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him don't worry about the running game,'' Parcells
said. ``I told him we'll surround him with players. He should just
concentrate on his receivers and their routes.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, too, that Ray Lucas can now concentrate on his
special teams' skills as well as learning how to play quarterback.
He apparently is no longer a viable contender for the backup job.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer recounted his checkered pro past with almost a sigh, as if
he has never got over his failure to achieve the success he had at
Notre Dame. His play in college led to his being chosen No. 2 in
the 1993 draft, behind Drew Bledsoe, who was taken by Parcells for
the Patriots. Mirer went to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd wind up with Parcells in New England, since Drew
was from Washington,'' Mirer said. ``I guess I've come full
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dealt a pretty bad hand,'' he said of his pro
career. ``If you can survive that, you learn a lot. But last season
at Green Bay I learned to relax and it rejuvenated me.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have one snap behind center last year with the
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   But with Seattle in 1993, he set National Football League rookie
records for attempts, completions and yardage. Seattle was a loser,
though, and after his second season, Coach Tom Flores, a former
quarterback who worked well with Mirer, was fired, replaced by
Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came it didn't do me any good,'' Mirer said. He was
dealt to the Bears in 1997 when the franchise was floundering. It
was a time of turmoil for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town was against the organization from the start of me
being there,'' he said. ``I just got caught up in bad times. The
hard part was being home and feeling like that. It was my
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is from Elkhart, Ind., and broke many of Jeff George's
state scholastic passing records.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is 29, 6 foot 3 inches and 212 pounds. He has a 20-34
record as a pro. He has a completion percentage of 53.3 with 62
interceptions to only 41 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you study his history of who was coaching him in Seattle,
you see that there may be reasons for his past,'' said Pat Kirwan,
who was formerly the Jets' director of player administration and
has seen hours of Mirer film. Kirwan, now CNN's NFL analyst, added
that what happened to Mirer ``is a classic case of a high draft
pick who doesn't produce immediately _ you get labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan said that Mirer would benefit from his last year in Green
Bay under Coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer arrived Saturday and immediately spent time in the late
evening with the Jets' quarterback coach Dan Henning. It will be
part of a weeklong crash course if Mirer is to see action next
Saturday night against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have an extra practice day this week, and there will be
several two-a-day workouts, which will benefit Mirer. He takes over
a backup role that has been unproductive so far in two preseason
games: Ray Lucas and Zolak combined for 15 drives that led to only
two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer said he ``can still play in this league,'' that ``some of
the stuff I've been through it would be easy to call it quits, but
I've taken it head-on.''

ON HORSE RACING: MANDATORY INDUSTRY TAX ON AUCTION SALES IS
CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOE DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ You might never have suspected it, from
the slick way the state of racing was portrayed at the annual Round
Table conference of the Jockey Club last week. But John Jacobs, the
son of the late great trainer Hirsch Jacobs and a leading agent for
Japanese money in the booming horse market, states it bluntly:
``There's a storm brewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way: ``I can't remember any time in recent
years when anything has been so divisive in the racing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs means the recent decision to impose a tax of 1 percent on
the purchase price of horses at auction sales. You bid $3 million
for a yearling, you pay $30,000 to the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, the new ``league office'' established 16 months ago to
unify the racing business.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As Tim Smith, the commissioner of the association said in a
letter to thoroughbred buyers, ``These funds not only will go to
support existing, successful programs, like co-op advertising and
expanded TV coverage, but also will enable the NTRA to launch
extremely important, additional marketing programs such as
increased Internet and consumer promotions, customer service
training for track employees, new fan development, on-site
enhancements, data base marketing and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   While you try to translate ``new fan development'' and ``on-site
enhancements,'' you might keep in mind some other fuzzy ideas that
Smith and the seven vice presidents in his league office have
produced. One involves a ``pennant race'' for older horses,
awarding points for a series of handicap races reaching a peak in
the Pacific Classic on Aug. 29. But in recent weeks, Silver Charm,
Real Quiet and Victory Gallop have all been sidelined or retired
with injuries, reducing the Pacific Classic to a meaningless race
in a meaningless pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   No mention was made of such negative trends at the Round Table
conference, which included a film on the Triple Crown that also
didn't mention that Charismatic broke his leg in the Belmont
Stakes. Nor was any mention made of the dispute over the new tax on
buying horses.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitch was made in a recent letter to the ``Dear
Thoroughbred Buyer'' from Bill Greely, president of the Keeneland
track in Lexington, Ky., where 4,000 horses will be put up for sale
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning with the September yearling sale,'' Greely wrote,
``an NTRA fee _ 1 percent of the purchase price for each horse _
will be added to your buyer's statement from Keeneland. We will
forward that amount to the NTRA. If you intend to purchase at
Keeneland but do not wish to pay the 1 percent fee, please send a
letter by Sept. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter gives no hint of what would happen if the buyer chose
not to pay the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Greely adds that ``the fee is a worthwhile investment in the
future of the thoroughbred industry.'' But some major members of
the industry don't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never attach that fee to your statement to Japanese
buyers,'' John Jacobs said. ``They would never pay it. We're trying
to bring new buyers into the business, so why stick an important
new buyer with a tax on what he buys? Adding $30,000 is like adding
a year's training charges. Some people are bitter. There's a storm
brewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs turned his memory back to the time when Hirsch Jacobs
would send him to Finger Lakes or Green Mountain to sell eight
horses to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' he remembered, ``would tell me, `Don't come back
with eight horses.' I saw many meat-and-potatoes horsemen who had
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also worried that the 1 percent tax this year might be 2
percent next year. And he is a supporter of the NTRA.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar Kimmel, the prominent horseman and the father of John
Kimmel, the smart young trainer, also sees trouble brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NTRA has to make it on its own,'' he said. ``To impose
more expenses on owners is ludicrous; 95 percent of the owners
don't break even, as it is. And why tax the buyer of a horse? Half
of these horses will never get to the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Smith and his marketers gave their self-congratulatory
reports to a room filled with racing leaders. They included the
most powerful new force in the business, Frank Stronach, the
Canadian industrialist who recently bought Santa Anita and
Gulfstream Park. He watched silently. This was a few days after he
told The Daily Racing Form: ``I don't like mandatory deductions. I
don't like mandatory anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach's contracts with the NTRA end on April 1, and he has
said the tracks would withdraw unless the association strictly
defines its role and makes certain changes. It's even money that
Tim Smith will blink first.

STRESS, ANXIETY OF FLYING ARE INCREASING FOR THE BUSINESS
TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Road rage makes headlines. But ground travel isn't the only
place where people's stress levels get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel stress, including air rage, is growing as more people
crowd through airports and as planes fly at maximum loads.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are particularly acute during the peak summer
travel months, making life especially miserable for business
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there's been little psychological research on the
phenomenon of air travel stress.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an area that intrigued Jonathan Bricker, a doctoral
candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker, who helped put himself through college working at a
travel agency, used to hear his clients tell him horror stories
about the toll traveling took on their work and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 270 million people a year fly for business,'' he said,
``And it's been increasing a few percentage points every year.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 times a year, some traveler snaps and assaults a
fellow passenger or crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker and UW psychology Professor Irwin Sarason wanted to
figure out what factors contributed most to air travel stress in
general, not just assaultive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel stress affects employee health as well as
performance, Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an archival study of insurance records from 10,800
World Bank employees, for example, traveling employees were more
likely to file claims for medical and mental disorders than
non-traveling employees.
</P>
<P>
   Claims by male traveling employees, for example, were 80 percent
higher than for non-traveling male employees. Women who traveled
filed 18 percent more claims than women who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some people handle the ups and downs of air travel better than
others, Bricker said. People who anticipate and prepare for how
they will handle delays, for example, are less likely to get
stressed out when they happen.
</P>
<P>
   Risk factors for feeling stressed by air travel include anxiety
and an anger-prone personality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Situational factors also increased stress. People who traveled
to multiple locations were more likely to be stressed than those
who always traveled to the same destination.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker and Sarason studied 329 travelers, who took an average
of 21 business trips a year.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that personal and situational factors interact
to produce air transit stress, Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxiety increases vulnerability to the perception of air
travel stress,'' he said. ``This vulnerability was stronger for
women than for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious women traveling to unfamiliar locations were
particularly prone to stress.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker said: ``When they were going to a new destination, these
women worried more, for example, about their personal safety, and
were concerned by such things as new procedures to get in and out
of an airport, making a connecting flight or wondering whether
their plane will be delayed. Going to a new place almost doubled
the amount of stress for women.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, the factor that seemed to increase stress the most was
the tendency to get angry.
</P>
<P>
   Men who were anger-prone in addition to being anxious, were at
high risk for experiencing travel stress, Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to reduce stress while traveling, however.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, for example, can help by giving travelers information,
he said. If people know why their plane is delayed, or what is
happening to their connecting flights, they deal better with the
anxiety of flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines could also help travelers by providing information on
ways to manage stress, Bricker said. He has drawn some interest
from The Boeing Co. and several airlines about developing in-flight
videos or presentations with stress reduction exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Deep breathing and muscle relaxation exercises done right in the
airline seat can help people cope with stress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People can also learn what their trigger points are, and
practice ways of dealing with them, Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Late takeoffs and landings, missed connecting flights, lost
baggage, waiting in lines, and getting the wrong directions are
just a few common travel experiences that trigger stress.
</P>
<P>
   People can prepare themselves for stressful situations by
bringing along work or relaxing reading material to cope with
delays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's going to be a delay, passengers can reduce their
anxiety by thinking about who they need to notify at the other end,
and by making alternative arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The key is for travelers to recognize when they're getting
stressed, and take a minute to calm down, Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can be in control of your own stress, it's more
pleasant for everyone,'' he said.

   PICCOTTS END, England _ With fields of shin-high wheat, a carpet
of white daisies, wild clover underfoot, lazy oaks overhead, Bob
Fiddaman's farm at the end of a winding lane bordered with
hedgerows provides an unlikely political battleground.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what it has become since Fiddaman offered to devote
some of his land to test planting of seed crops that have been
genetically modified _ GM in the shorthand of the battle-hardened.
</P>
<P>
   He and three other farmers whose willingness to take part in the
government-run trials was made public the week before last have
been targeted by protesters who have already invaded other such
plantings, trampling and ripping up roots in fields of oil-seed
rape and maize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite likely there will be some sort of direct action
against the crops at some point,'' said Andrew Wood of the protest
group Genetic Snowball. ``The public has made it clear they don't
want GM crops, and there is no need for these tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' acts of destruction, while illegal and extreme,
are an expression of the widespread opposition to the introduction
of genetically modified crops in Europe and particularly in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic modification of food has been a relatively unquestioned
phenomenon in the United States and Canada, with altered
ingredients in a range of processed food from soft drinks to beer
to breakfast cereals. It is also common in animal feeds and soya,
corn and cotton seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But its arrival here has set off alarms and united demonstrators
from lapsed causes in a powerful protest movement against what they
call ``Frankenstein food'' and the large multinational companies
promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no government agency in Europe with the regulatory
rigor of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to build consumer
confidence, and government approval can arouse suspicion as much as
it can provide reassurance. This is nowhere more evident than in
Britain, where the public is sensitized by the outbreak of mad cow
disease in 1996 and the government's tardy conclusion that it was
something that could harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain
that don't apply elsewhere,'' Fiddaman said, ``the fact that we are
an island, the fact that agriculture is not spread out across broad
spaces but is close to inhabited areas, and the whole tradition
here of wanting to keep land pure and unspoiled even by
conventional agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   A new MORI poll says 79 percent of the British public think that
farmland genetically modified crop testing of the kind Fiddaman has
agreed to should be stopped. Major food manufacturers, supermarkets
and fast-food chains have already announced the removal of all
genetically modified ingredients from their products sold in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, though on record as
being in favor of genetically modified foods, has been forced by
political pressure to impose a set of largely unenforceable
regulations on food outlets, demanding that they identify on menus
items that may have traces of genetically modified soya or wheat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central tenets of Blair's self-described
``modernizing'' program is the determination to see Britain become
a country in the forefront of technological innovation, and he has
been caught out by the furor over genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   The British press has seen the issue as one for crusading
journalism, and the scare headlines and wide publicity given to
selected scientific studies alleging danger prompted Blair to
accuse newspapers and broadcasters of fomenting ``hysteria'' and
``skewing'' coverage away from the more numerous studies finding no
fault with genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a moment where the Blair government's vaunted
ability to capture the public mood has failed it, in the process
reinforcing some underlying concerns about the otherwise popular
government _ that it is cocky, beholden to big business and
subservient to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of scientifically altered food is the subject of a
growing political dispute between Europe and the United States.
Last month, Washington imposed tariffs on food imported from
members of the European Union after the Europeans banned the
importation of American hormone-treated beef. The World Trade
Organization has declared the European ban unjustified because
there is no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef is
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, the American food company behind much of the
genetically modified food in Britain, has seen a large public
relations program aimed at halting its demonization by the British
public have just the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic modification at issue is a way of adding genes that
confer resistance to insect, fungal and viral pests to plants that
might otherwise die or require heavy doses of pesticides. It can
also, as in the case of Fiddaman's crops, foster
herbicide-resistance, meaning that weeds can be killed with a
single spray that leaves the crops standing.
</P>
<P>
   Objections to genetically modified food rest on the broad claims
that genetic manipulation is an act against nature, that the food
it produces is dangerous and that its cultivation damages the
environment. There is scant scientific evidence to support any of
these conclusions, and farmers like Fiddaman argue that only field
tests, the procedure the protesters seek to halt, can come up with
rational answers to people's worries.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters who have destroyed test sites say letting them
proceed would allow the escape of transplanted genes from crops to
related wild species and contaminate the environment. Recent
laboratory studies at Cornell University showing that monarch
butterflies were stunted and killed by eating pollen from
genetically modified corn received enormous attention here.

</P>
<P>
   The first case to arouse concern was a study conducted by Dr.
Arpad Pusztai, a 69-year-old scientist with the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, who told a BBC television
documentary last August that the British public was being used as
``guinea pigs'' for the testing of genetically modified food. He
said he based his conclusion on tests he had conducted in which
rats that were fed genetically altered potatoes experienced stunted
organ and brain growth and breakdowns in their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was immediately dismissed by Rowett, where he had worked for
36 years, and he was criticized by fellow scientists for going
public with tests that had not gone through the standard procedures
of peer review and publication.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert May, a noted biologist who is the government's chief
scientist, called Pusztai's research ``garbage.'' The Royal
Society, Britain's senior scientific academy, examined the study
and said it was ``flawed in many aspects of design, execution and
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The scare has mobilized a late-arriving consumer movement in
Britain and galvanized people with broad anti-establishment
concerns beyond food safety, ranging from anger at the growing
industrialization and corporate control of British agriculture to
opposition to the construction of new highways in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   They have received the backing of Prince Charles, a passionate
organic farmer, who scheduled a meeting with Pusztai, expressed
sympathy for his findings and decried the reaction of other
scientists to his study.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddaman, 54, has been farming the same land since 1971. He
pointed past a tractor and a tool shed to the field where he is
about to start planting genetically modified winter oil-seed rape.
``The protesters say they believe these crops may be dangerous, but
they refuse to let us go forward with the testing to see if they
are right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am wrong, I'll have to accept that,'' he said, ``but I
wouldn't be offering the fields if I thought it was going to
produce contamination.'' The owners of adjacent fields have backed
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds come from AgrEvo, a German joint venture of Hoechst AG
and Schering AG. They give the plants a tolerance for a herbicide
that kills all the weeds around them, thereby allowing Fiddaman to
reduce the amount of pesticides he will be spraying. Promoters of
genetically modified food argue that in this way their produce
actually benefits the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will be visiting unannounced throughout the yearlong
process, and their findings will go to the government agencies that
are judging the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been caught by surprise in past attacks, which
were often conducted at night by people in full-body
anti-contamination suits and goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty people, including Lord Peter Melchett, 51, the executive
director of Greenpeace U.K., were arrested in Norfolk last month
after they destroyed a field of crops. Melchett described the act
as one of ``decontamination'' and said his organization was
dedicated to ending ``the whole program of commercialization of GM
pollution disguised as science.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the field, William Brigham, 59, said: ``This has
nothing to do with genetically modified organisms. It's whether we
want democratic government in this country, or anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The local police have promised Fiddaman a quick response if he
calls with reports of trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's not much I can do,'' he said, ``The fields are
only protected by hedgerows. I don't mind their opposing the tests,
but I find their vandalism abhorrent. If they want to come and
stand over there with protest flags, I don't mind. But they
shouldn't trash the land.''

FOR THE FIRST LADY, A FUND-RAISING VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton held her second
fund-raising event of her vacation on Sunday, greeting nearly 250
people at a brunch at the Martha's Vineyard home of Frank Biondi, a
former Viacom executive. The price of admission was $1,000 a
ticket, yielding the first lady _ and her expected New York Senate
candidacy _ nearly a quarter of a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, President Clinton, joined her but did not address
the audience and did not participate in the picture-taking as Mrs.
Clinton stood with guests for snapshots. Clinton did, however, play
the saxophone, which he borrowed from the high school jazz band
that was playing at the brunch, and belted out ``My Funny
Valentine'' in honor of a couple celebrating their 35th wedding
anniversary. The event was closed to the press, but Joe Lockhart,
Clinton's spokesman, described the president's rendition as jazzy.
</P>
<P>
   The brunch was just one more event in a swirl of socializing
since the Clintons arrived here Thursday for vacation. This has
left them little time to spend watching television, which is too
bad for the Republican National Committee in Washington. The
committee began saturating the cable airwaves here on Sunday with a
commercial aimed at an audience of one, the president, urging him
to agree to the so-called ``lock box'' to save money for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The weather has been overcast and drizzly, but the Clintons have
been out and about. After Sunday morning's fund-raising brunch,
attended by many of the Clintons' regular Vineyard friends like
Vernon Jordan and Maurice Tempelsman, they headed to a local
restaurant, Balance, for a birthday party for Kelly Craighead, a
longtime aide to both Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, the president encountered a young man named Mark
O'Connor, a Boston bicycle messenger who complained about an
ordinance that imposes a $100 fine for not wearing a bicycle
helmet. The president told him that not wearing a helmet was risky.
O'Connor said he was a slow and careful rider and that his helmet
sometimes blocked his view. Clinton told him, ``You may be slow,
but the streets are fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is to take a break from her fund raising until next
Saturday when her family decamps from Martha's Vineyard and heads
for the Hamptons, on Long Island, N.Y., where they will stay at the
home of Steven Spielberg, the director. She has scheduled four
fund-raising events next weekend, two in connection with the
Democratic National Committee, and two more when the family visits
the Finger Lakes in upstate New York for a few days after that. The
total take for her two-week vacation should be about $800,000, said
Howard Wolfson, her campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clintons flew to Nantucket from Martha's Vineyard on
Friday for the first of Mrs. Clinton's vacation fund-raisers, the
Republicans complained that the first lady was raising money on the
taxpayers' tab.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pfeifle, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said that Mrs. Clinton's political travel cost taxpayers an average
of $20,000 an hour of travel time. Wolfson said that the campaign
would reimburse the Treasury for the cost of a first-class airplane
ticket to Nantucket, adding that such reimbursement was the same
rule that applied to previous occupants of the White House who made
political trips.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifle said the cost of a first-class ticket came nowhere near
the actual cost of travel for Mrs. Clinton and her entourage.
Wolfson said Republicans had not objected when the families of
Republican presidents made political trips and reimbursed the
Treasury for the cost of the air fare.

<P>
   ON THE BADME PLAIN, Eritrea _ He is a carpenter who became a
sniper but who is now very tired of shooting people in this largely
overlooked war, far deadlier than Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' said Feshtsion Tesfaldet, his finger on the
trigger and his body tucked in a sandy trench here, ``I don't want
to see anyone else get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifle fire still rings out and mortar rounds still drop down,
but after 15 months of a particularly senseless conflict, the
killing may in fact stop soon along the disputed border of Eritrea
and its larger neighbor, Ethiopia. Eritrea has accepted all points
of a peace plan. Ethiopia is asking questions about only a few
details.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is certain, but President Clinton said last Monday that
a deal seems near between the two allies of the United States on
the Horn of Africa. He then mentioned the war's most ghastly
aspect: 70,000 soldiers had died, he said, though his estimate was
higher than most so far.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war began in May 1998, few countries held as much
promise as Ethiopia and Eritrea, both poor but industrious and
growing economically. And so the war _ fought in trenches with
sickening numbers of casualties _ has been a depressing rebuke to
so many hopes for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The nations' allies watched in horror as Ethiopia and Eritrea
turned their strengths against each other. They bought millions of
dollars of warplanes and tanks and dug trenches. Ethiopia
apparently spent thousands of young lives in human-wave assaults on
Eritrea's positions, and bodies still lie in plain view, rotting in
the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage has been great, and the distrust remains high
between the two nations, once so close that the war felt like a
domestic spat come to blows. That has made peace hard to find, even
now when the disagreements have dwindled to a relatively few
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never been so close to a peace agreement as now,''
said one Western diplomat in Eritrea. ``Which doesn't mean we will
have peace in the next few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither nation will discuss the details that divide them. But
they agree on much of a plan drafted by the Organization for
African Unity and pushed by the United States and the United
Nations. The plan calls for a cease-fire; for both sides to
withdraw from disputed territory along their 625-mile border; and
for outside observers, possibly U.N. peacekeepers, to monitor the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United Nations will finally do what did not
happen when Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993:
demarcate the border, based on old maps drawn up by Eritrea's
colonizer, Italy. The question is especially tricky here along the
Badme plain, where the war began and which both sides claim as
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after a series of border incidents, Eritrean
soldiers marched into the town of Badme, wresting it from the
Ethiopian administration. Ethiopia declared war. On the surface,
the battles were over Badme, but they were fueled by long tensions
over trade and how to live in the same region as equals.
</P>
<P>
   In the peace plan, diplomats say each side wins something. But
many Eritreans say Ethiopia comes out on top because Eritrea must
withdraw first from the parts of Badme it still holds, a tacit
admission that it was first to use the might of its military to
settle a border question. Ethiopia can also administer areas it
once held while the borders are drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most suitable compromise, especially for Ethiopia,''
said one Eritrean soldier, Girmay Ogbu, 35, here at the front. ``If
they don't sign this, the world will realize that Ethiopia doesn't
want peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Ethiopia has not signed off on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Selome Taddesse, a spokeswoman for Ethiopia, noted that her
nation had accepted the bulk of the plan last year, when Eritrea
had not. She said Ethiopia was ``100 percent committed'' to the
plan but had questions that must be answered by the Organization
for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our questions are very specific,'' she said. ``Our opinion is,
the more we are specific, the more there is a guarantee for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say two major issues concern whether Ethiopian
authorities may carry guns when their administration returns to
Badme while the border is being drawn, and what power the outside
observers will have to act on complaints by Eritreans living, at
least temporarily, under Ethiopian control.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Eritrea, a proud nation of fighters, believe,
though, that Ethiopia's objections mask an intention to reignite
the fighting once the rainy season ends in September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For 30 years, Eritreans battled against Ethiopia to win
independence. They beat the former dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam,
in 1991 alongside a group of Ethiopian rebels who are who now in
power in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea's departure left Ethiopia landlocked, and there is
still is some sentiment in Ethiopia that Eritrea should not have
been allowed its independence. Eritreans believe that Ethiopia may
want to either reclaim Eritrea or replace its current government,
led by President Isaias Afwerki, with one friendlier to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with Ethiopia is they think they can easily
disintegrate Eritrea,'' said Mehretu Ghebretensae, an Eritrean
journalist and former fighter. ``They think that by changing the
government they can recolonize Eritrea. That's impossible. Eritrea
is in the blood of every Eritrean.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia denies that it wants either territory or to topple
Afwerki. The goal, officials there say, is to prove that Eritrea
cannot use force to settle political problems, like who owns Badme.
</P>
<P>
   Along the front here _ where soldiers still skirmish at night
from trenches only 50 or so yards apart _ the Eritreans say they
are skeptical that Ethiopia really wants peace. Some say Ethiopia
will not stop until it captures Asmara, Eritrea's capital.
</P>
<P>
   As gunfire blasted between the trenches, Capt. Gebrehiwet Abebe,
39, said Ethiopia's leaders fear peace because that means they will
have to explain to the people the enormous number of soldiers
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side will release figures, but many analysts here and in
Ethiopia estimate that at least 40,000 people have died in the war
_ and most believe that Ethiopia suffered by far the higher
casualties because it was largely on the offensive. One diplomat
here estimated that Ethiopia had lost three soldiers for every
Eritrean who died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to answer that question,'' Abebe said.
``That's why they don't want peace. But with pressure from the
outside world, it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea's leaders may too have to answer to their people
once the war is over. Its losses on the battlefield may not be as
high, but many Eritreans have died fighting for a piece of land
that may, in fact, end up belonging to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean trouble for Afwerki. And it is a possibility
many soldiers here, who have watched friends die for Badme, do not
like to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's our land,'' Abebe said tightly. ``Don't ask that
question.''

COMPANIES LEARN ONLINE SALES CAN BE MESSY, ESPECIALLY THOSE PESKY
RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life was much easier for E-commerce companies when their primary
focus was on acquiring customers. They could simply take the
company public, spend huge sums on advertising then wait for the
customers to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Things became messy when shoppers actually arrived. Suddenly,
E-commerce executives realized that managing online sales could be
as difficult as managing offline merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise returns, in particular, have been nettlesome for
Internet stores, especially those without previous experience in
catalog or traditional retailing. Analysts and executives say
E-commerce sites have not done enough to give customers the same
confidence in their return policies as offline merchants do and
have been slow to devise effective systems for refunds and
exchanges. In short, they say, if Internet retailers want to
attract more return customers, they are going to have to deal
better with returns by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling returns is a complicated process that can't be
standardized the same way as outbound shipments,'' said James
Vogtle, an E-commerce research director with Boston Consulting
Group. ``And it's a process that's not getting the attention it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For every $100 in goods an E-commerce company ships, $5 worth is
returned, according to a recent study by Boston Consulting in
conjunction with Shop.org, an Internet retailing trade group. That
5 percent rate compares favorably with that of direct marketing
companies, which have return rates of 5 percent to 7 percent, as
well as traditional retailers, whose returns total 6 percent of
sales, according to the National Retail Federation. But the
comparison is also somewhat misleading because a large percentage
of Internet commerce is made up of items like books and CDs, which
have low return rates.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is not the number of returns, but how those
returns are being handled. Analysts and executives say customers
are often subjected to poor customer service when trying to make
returns, resulting in delayed exchanges or mishandled refunds.
Because most sites require customers to pay for shipping items back
to the retailer, the process can be costly, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These problems are reflected in two surveys conducted among more
than 2,000 Internet users by Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm. In one survey in which Internet shoppers ranked
their top 12 sources of dissatisfaction with E-commerce sites the
fifth-greatest concern was returning merchandise. In the other
study, also conducted by Jupiter, 40 percent of those surveyed
indicated they would buy more on line if they could return items
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have retailers been frequently caught off guard by the
volume of orders received, but, says Ken Cassar, a Jupiter analyst,
E-commerce sites often cede control of fulfilling orders _ as well
as handling returns _ to outside companies. ``When things do go
wrong, a vast majority of the time it's because there's a gap in
the seams between various parties,'' Cassar said. ``The fewer times
the baton is passed, the greater the chances are for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly, an online
retailer of clothing and housewares, says the company sees a return
rate for clothing ``in the low 20 percent range'' _ nearly 10
points below the catalog rate for apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly, which uses a third-party to handle orders and returns,
manages the return process in several steps. After a customer calls
and indicates a problem, the item is shipped back at the company's
expense, using a United Parcel Service packing slip included with
each item delivered. The item is inspected when it arrives, and the
customer's account is credited ``within a week of them sending
it,'' Morris said. The fulfillment center repackages and restocks
items that are in perfect condition; imperfect items are either
repaired or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that no orders are mishandled, Bluefly ``is all over
the fulfillment house,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We manage them really closely,'' he said, ``and treat them
like they're virtual employees.'' Of returns in general, he added,
``This is definitely the less-sexy side of the business, but it's
as important _ if not more important _ than any other aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brooks, chief executive of Furniture.com, an
Internet-only retailer, said that because the cost of returned
furniture _ and dissatisfied customers _ was so high, the company
designed its Web site to insure that customers made the right
choice. ``The best way is to make the customer as educated as
possible about what they're getting,'' Brooks said, adding
that &QC; Furniture.com's return rate is materially lower than that of
catalog companies, though he would not disclose a specific rate.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com's Web site enables customers to view photos of an
item from a number of angles, use a room-design option to see how
it would fit with their current furniture and e-mail or speak to
design consultants and have fabric swatches sent to them free. Once
the furniture is shipped, customers can hold the furniture for a
week before returning it _ at no cost. The only catch: customers
get a store credit, not a cash reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing companies like Lands' End and Levi Strauss are also
improving their sites with modeling technology that allows
customers to indicate their physical dimensions and receive
guidance on what size to order.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to accepting returns, perhaps the best option
is one that remains unreachable for companies that operate only on
line _ namely, physical stores. The Gap and Federated's Macy's, for
instance, accept returns of merchandise at their stores even when
items are purchased on line _ a policy that is not shared by many
Internet retailers who have physical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Kapp, vice president for special markets and new media at
Estee Lauder, which includes the Clinique Web site, agreed there
was a benefit in allowing customers to return items to a physical
store. She said Estee Lauder customers could do so as long as the
department store in which the company's products were sold allowed
it.
</P>
<P>
   But that option has limits, Ms. Kapp said. ``What if you live 20
miles away, or you don't feel like going to the mall?'' she asked.
``Isn't that the reason why they got on line in the first place?''

POPP FINDS THAT KEEPING HIS COMPOSURE IS PART OF WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RAY KRUEGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alexander Popp is starting to realize that is takes
more than strokes and footwork to be a tennis star.
</P>
<P>
   Popp, of Germany, kept his composure Sunday to beat Sebastien de
Chaunac of France, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, to capture GHI Bronx
Tennis Classic, a Challenger Tour event in Crotona Park. In the
women's final, Erika de Lone of Lincoln, Mass., was up, 6-1, when
Els Callens of Belgium retired because of strained left quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch Popp, who at age 22 is ranked 169th in the
world, has risen from nowhere on the Futures Tour, the lowest level
of pro tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win a match for six months,'' he said of the
beginning of 1998. ``Then I got lucky, won a few matches, and that
improved my confidence and then I won more matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Popp didn't get discouraged Sunday after dropping the first-set
tie breaker to de Chaunac, who crumbled after losing the second-set
tie breaker. Popp held serve at love in the first game of the third
set, and at 30-all in the second game, he hit a forehand passing
shot that appeared to clip the line.
</P>
<P>
   It was called good, but de Chaunac did not agree and glared at
the chair umpire. De Chaunac then pushed a slice backhand into the
net to lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   Popp held his serve in the next game to go up, 3-0, and de
Chaunac received a warning for firing a ball over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   De Chaunac won only 4 points in the next three games and Popp
was handed a $7,200 winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of lost of his composure after he lost the second
set,'' Popp said of de Chaunac. ``I didn't think I was playing well
in the beginning, but I just tried to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Popp and the 21-year-old de Chaunac, who is ranked 232nd in
the world, will compete in the U.S. Open qualifying rounds this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Both De Lone, 26, who received a $8,800 winner's check and is
ranked 106th, and Callens, 29, who is ranked 91st, are in the
Open's main draw. But Callens is not sure if her injury will
prevent her from playing. ``I will try to rest and see what
happens,'' she said.

CHARACTER WITNESSES EXPECTED TO TESTIFY FOR DOLPHINS' MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Tony Martin, the Miami Dolphins wide
receiver, in a federal trial on money-laundering charges will
present what they described as several prominent character
witnesses Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those character witnesses are presumed to come from the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Martin flew to San Diego to play in a game against the Chargers
on Saturday night, catching three passes in the Dolphins' 13-10
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is charged with attempting to pay $175,000 in lawyer's
fees on behalf of Rickey Brownlee, the twice-convicted Miami drug
dealer, and with leasing three cars for Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Martin, who has started for two Super Bowl teams
in the last five seasons could face three to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge K. Michael Moore decided that Martin,
33, would be tried with Brownlee, whom he has known for about 15
years. Thus, the bulk of the nearly three-week trial has involved
Brownlee's alleged drug-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair at all,'' said Howard Srebnick, one of Martin's
attorneys, about Martin's case being coupled with Brownlee's.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Dolphins signed Martin to a four-year,
$14.2-million contract, expecting him to fill the club's longtime
need for a deep-threat receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson and a number of Martin's new teammates
attended court on the trial's first day in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Martin denied in conversations secretly taped by the government
that he had ever leased cars for Brownlee. On the tapes, Max Lloyd,
owner of Don L. Leasing in Pompano Beach, Fla., and cooperating
with the government, asked him that.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Martin replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later Martin became upset at Lloyd, saying Brownlee was
not a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Paul Robarge, an Internal Revenue Service agent,
may have given Martin an inadvertent boost when he testified that
money allegedly laundered by the football player might have come
from legitimate sources _ a restaurant and convenience store owned
by Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   But then earlier this week, Martin's former business manager,
Rick Norton, who is based in San Diego, asserted that Martin was
nearly broke when the receiver told him early last year that he
intended to put $100,000 in his bank account to cover a check for
Brownlee's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' Norton said during his testimony. ``I was
concerned it was a money-laundering situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even should Martin be convicted, the Dolphins expect him to play
this season, because it is anticipated that he would appeal the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that the Dolphins' contract gives Martin _ who
declared bankruptcy in March _ a chance to solve his financial
problems. He made $9.1 million from 1993 through 1998 yet spent
almost $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was a quarterback at Mesa College in Colorado, was a
fifth-round draft pick of the Jets in 1989 and was promptly
switched to wide receiver. He was cut at the end of training camp,
then played five seasons with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He then played for San Diego, where he began to assert himself
as one of the game's top pass receivers. He averaged 72 catches
over four seasons for the Chargers and led the team to the 1995
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he helped Atlanta gain its first Super Bowl berth. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARKS, Nev. _ At 12:30 Sunday morning, in the hotel that is
playing host to this year's Tailhook convention, the hallways were
stone silent. A handful of pilots drank beer in a suite with the
door open; two women passed by, without incident. As 1 a.m. neared,
one of the men peeled off to bunk down for the night.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Tailhook Convention looks like eight years
after a sexual misconduct scandal that came to symbolize what
critics said was an official tolerance for swaggering libido in the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The days seem long ago indeed when an elite young naval officer
could streak down a hallway or form a gantlet with buddies to grope
women and strip off their clothes. The gathering is now a sleepy
mix of reunions, symposiums, golf, cocktail hours and banquets,
attended by an overwhelmingly older male crowd _ all that remains
after the Navy cut its ties to the event, making it harder for
active-duty officers to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more subdued,'' said Cmdr. Chuck Wright of
Lemoore Naval Air Station near Fresno, Calif., socializing at a
mixer on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1991 convention, 83 women, some in the Navy, reported
being assaulted or harassed. About 50 Navy and Marine Corps pilots
were fined or disciplined in the misconduct. The scandal also led
to the resignation of the secretary of the Navy, Lawrence Garrett
III, and early retirement of the Navy's top admiral, Frank Kelso
II.
</P>
<P>
   Measures taken to tone down the the convention have worked, said
Wright, who also attended in 1991. ``You lose a little bit of the
rowdiness,'' he said, ``but you also lose the opportunity to make a
fool of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailhook leaders are still seeking to put the scandal behind
them and reassert the convention's original purpose: providing an
informal forum for the exchange of tales and techniques between
fledgling aviators and veteran pilots.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since the Navy cut ties with the Tailhook
Association, a booster group with about 10,500 members that
sponsors the convention, a delegation of military leaders attended
this weekend at the behest of Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the convention's organizers court official
recognition, having repudiated the misbehavior of 1991 and taken
steps to discourage it from ever happening again, some members
still take a defiant tone. They say that the incidents of 1991 were
blown out of proportion and that the punishments were politically
motivated. There is still anger at political leaders and the Navy's
withdrawal of support.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the group's general membership meeting on Friday
afternoon, Matt Purdy, a lieutenant stationed at Miramar Air Force
Base in San Diego, portrayed the 1991 episode as an isolated
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely offensive that it's taken this long for them
to get here,'' Purdy said, in reference to the secretary's
delegates. John Rochford, a member since 1965, now retired from the
military, said that if the same standards applied in the Tailhook
inquiry had been used to investigate behavior on V-J Day, ``my
goodness, we would have court-martialed everyone in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has taken several steps to reduce the boozy
atmosphere, particularly by moving the convention from Las Vegas to
a more modest setting at John Ascuaga's Nugget, on the outskirts of
Reno, tucked between a rail yard and Interstate 80.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality suites that served as the epicenter of the
misconduct in 1991 are no longer rented in clusters. And the group
has sought to make the convention more amenable to members' spouses
by adding activities designed for them; on Saturday morning, while
members listened to lectures on improvements in fighter plane
technology, a bus filled mostly with their spouses prepared to
depart for a cooking demonstration at Planet Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The few female aviators who attended the convention did not
express any concern over the environment and said they welcomed the
opportunity for ``hangar flying,'' or exchanging tales and tips
with veteran pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take care of myself,'' said Pamela Salisbury, a civilian
member from Santa Fe, N.M., who runs the Saber Tooth Snapping
Turtles, a group that encourages children to become interested in
flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman, I feel safer here than anywhere else,'' said her
friend, Tammy Green, who is also a pilot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Years of pariah status took a toll on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Active-duty officers could no longer get official orders to
leave base for the convention, and the hundreds who once attended
disappeared (active-duty members now must use vacation time to
attend). Senior Navy officers, who once appeared in informal
seasons where junior officers asked policy questions, were no
longer allowed to attend. Membership dropped by a third, from about
15,000 to 10,000. For the first couple of years after the scandal,
some said, officers were discouraged from attending.
</P>
<P>
   Now, corporate sponsors are returning, as are the coveted
active-duty officers. ``I think Tailhook is beginning to look a
whole lot more like it used to, only better,'' said Lonny McClung,
the association's president.

 &HT;    Columbine victim appeals for help in Atlanta
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lance Kirklin, a survivor of the Columbine High School
shooting, visited an Atlanta church on Sunday as part of a local
fund-raising effort to help Kirklin's family pay his mounting
medical bills, which could total $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin was shot five times during last April's massacre in
Littleton, Colo. The lanky 16-year-old's scarred face has become
one of the most enduring symbols of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing to me all the good people in this world who
don't even know someone, but they want to help them,'' Kirklin told
several hundred worshippers at Gospel Tabernacle Christian Church
in east Atlanta. ``I just want to say thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin has had five operations and may need five more to repair
his face. A thick scar snakes from behind his left ear and over his
jaw toward a diamond-shaped patch of skin that has been grafted
from his leg. With no medical insurance, Kirklin's father has no
way of paying the hospital tab, now at $229,000.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Atlanta retiree Richard Wilson donated $10 to
the Kirklins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is needed to help him go on,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin was brought to Atlanta by Harry Ross, an Atlanta-based
political pollster. Ross has mailed letters to local churches
asking for donations and plans to bring Kirklin back to Atlanta on
Friday to speak at a crime prevention seminar he is coordinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a miracle child, shot five times at point-blank range
and survived,'' Ross said. ``This can happen again if we're not
prepared to wage war against teen-age aggression and teen-age
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin, who began school last week, flew back to Colorado
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The teen says he does not fear death. In fact, making the most
of every day has become his philosophy of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just try to live life to the fullest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in making a donation should make checks
payable to the Lance Kirklin Fund. Accounts have been set up at
local branches of Bank of America and Capitol City Bank &AMP; Trust.

 &HT;    Atlanta church mourns quake vicitims
 &HT;    By Rick Badie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rosy faces of David, Jennifer and Jeffrey Kilic
beam from a hallway bulletin board at Mount Vernon Baptist Church
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promoted To Heaven _ A Miracle,'' says a caption above the
pictures. Missing is a photograph of Katie Kilic, the youngest
Kilic sibling to perish in Tuesday's brutal earthquake in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   David, 2, Jennifer, 5, and Jeffrey, 6, died instantly. Katie, 7
months, died hours later. Their mother, Jan Kilic, suffered head
injuries, but survived the Aug. 17 earthquake. Another daughter,
Natalie, 3, only received a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear when the two survivors will return to the Atlanta
suburb of Marietta. William Kemp III, Jan's father, said Sunday it
could be as early as Tuesday. The bodies of the four children are
expected later this week. Nothing's certain.
</P>
<P>
   Left to make sense of the tragedy are grieving relatives and a
church congregation that on Sunday leaned on faith for
understanding. The Kilic children and their mother were well-liked
members of Mount Vernon, where sorrow permeated the 11 a.m.
service.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Rev. Sam Boyd told about 600 attendees:
``The root of all tragedies, be they natural disasters or
premeditated acts, is sin. And it's omnipresent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see more pain, pestilence and destruction in
this world,'' he said. ``God is trying to get our attention through
these things. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the loss of four children ``irreversible,'' Boyd said
Jan, or anyone faced with extreme adversity, should ``focus on
eternity. I'm sure that God has more planned for Jan and the lives
of those four children than we could ever see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst tragedy in your life could become the greatest
triumph in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd ended the sermon by inviting people to pray at the altar.
Linda Thompson, Jan's best friend and mother of three girls who
played with the Kilic children, stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   Before the service, she called Jan a woman committed to
relationships _ with God, friends and family. Jan's husband, Babur,
a Marietta anesthesiologist, did not make the trip to Turkey with
the family. His family had been vacationing in the resort town of
Yalova when the earthquake struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan had a healthy, confident, stable, loving family,''
Thompson said. ``That's the No. 1 thing I can say about her. The
most important thing to her right now is she knows this is God's
hand in her life and that He is close by her.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Gwen Jenkins, the pre-school minister at Mount
Vernon, said the structure Jan and Babur provided their children
was evident in their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   David, the 2-year-old, ``was always trying to tell me
something,'' Jenkins said. ``I didn't always understand him, but he
always talked with a smile on his face.''

 &HT;    Don't forget, national debt clock is still ticking
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember the national debt?
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk of a budget surplus that has consumed
Washington in recent weeks, the Concord Coalition is worried many
people have forgotten that the nation is some $5.6 trillion in the
red -- and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   So the bipartisan budget watchdog group has taken its National
Debt Clock out of storage and hit the road to remind the public
that the government's finances are not yet in order.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop on the two-week tour was Sunday in downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people forget that we have a national debt which is
growing,'' said Phil Smith of Atlanta, regional director of the
Concord Coalition. ``We're getting closer to a balanced budget, but
we're not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The large sign, carried on a 25-foot trailer, gives an
up-to-the-minute estimate of the size of the country's debt. At
4:30 p.m. Sunday, the debt stood at 5,640,616,090,000 and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The sign was on display Sunday afternoon in Atlanta at the
Candler Building, 127 Peachtree St. The clock will visit cities in
Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and Louisiana, Smith said.
The trip, the first since 1997, was timed to coincide with
Congress' two-week summer break.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's booming economy has helped slow the rate the debt
is growing. But the Concord Coalition, co-chaired by former Senator
Sam Nunn of Georgia, wants to make sure people realize it's still
going up.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some Democrats are arguing that some of the
budget surplus should be spent to shore up social security, while
Republicans are pushing for a big tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have a problem on both sides of the aisle,'' Smith said.
``We're praying for gridlock. If neither side gets their way, then
the debt starts getting paid down automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the sign was mixed in Atlanta. Some walked by and
shook their heads after seeing the clock, while others simply
ignored it, Smith said.

RETELLING OF NABOKOV'S `LOLITA' CREATES ITS OWN CONTROVERSY  
 ARNETT PLANS TO WRITE HISTORY OF CNN 
THE SMELL OF NEWS FROM LOS ANGELES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The copyright tiff has ended, but the tensions are still
simmering between Vladimir Nabokov's son and an Italian author who
has written a retelling of ``Lolita'' from the young girl's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Foxrock Inc., the publisher of ``Lo's Diary,''
announced a ``Solomon-like agreement'' that allowed American
publication of the book with a 5 percent royalty to Nabokov's son,
Dmitri, along with added commentary from him and the author, Pia
Pera. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux had earlier canceled publication
after the Nabokov estate sued, charging copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's preface is not particularly gracious: ``As some
readers may know, one Pia Pera (henceforth `PP,') an Italian
journalist, author of some stories that I have not read and of a
translation of `Eugene Onegin' into Italian which I have, decided
to seek inspiration, fortune and fame from a book called
`Lolita.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov then notes the many similarities in the book to
``Lolita,'' like ``articles of clothing, hair styles, personal
effects, pets, gifts, even the bacon purloined from a breakfast
tray.'' He concludes by describing the compromise and his hope that
his permission to publish set a precedent without spending money on
costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The path has been a rather tortured one,'' he said, ``the
knock on the door belated. But the copyright to `Lolita' has been
honored, and `Lo's Diary' is in your hands. Whether it draws from
`Lolita' well or badly I leave for you to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail note from Italy, Ms. Pera dismissed Nabokov's
preface as ``a disappointingly dull emulation of his father's
mastery of irony and, on occasions, virtuoso contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I have much to say on the questions raised by my book,
I have ultimately decided not to publish an afterword to Lo's
diary: let the work speak for itself,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pera made several attempts to write an afterword addressing
issues raised by the copyright dispute. Her early essays ranged up
to eight pages and were angry in tone, the author's American
publisher, Barney Rosset, said. The last attempt, he said, amounted
to one paragraph: ``Never mind how `Lo's Diary' got to you, whether
it traveled first or second class, comfortably or not; never mind,
here it is. I hope you will enjoy it.'' But soon after, the author
withdrew even that remark, leaving Rosset fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, the women whom I have known and loved would not
act in this foolish and fatuous manner,'' Rosset said. ``Can you
imagine Susan Sontag, as a result of an unfriendly critique of her
work, running away and pouting in a corner?'' --DOREEN CARVAJAL &QC;

   ARNETT PLANS TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF CNN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a difference five months can make. In April, Peter Arnett
was leaving CNN. He and the network had brought each other fame
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war and misfortune over the 1998
Tailwind broadcast, a report about accusations that nerve gas was
used by U.S. forces in Vietnam that was later retracted, and were
parting on not-so-friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Arnett and Ed Turner, the former executive vice
president of CNN, are shopping around a book proposal for an
authorized history of CNN and assessment of the network's effect on
television news. If things move quickly enough, the work's
publication could be pegged to the network's 20th anniversary next
year. And CNN's top executives are happy to cooperate. ``We were
asked to, and Ted and Tom said yes,'' said Sue Binford, a CNN
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ted is Ted Turner, the network's founder and the vice chairman
of its parent company, Time Warner Inc. Tom is Tom Johnson, the
network's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Turner, the co-author of the prospective work (and no
relation to Ted Turner) said last week, ``I want to make the book a
combination of things _ not just 24-hour news but the things that
came out of it.'' But, he added: ``We don't have a publisher. We
just have an eager agent and two guys ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who worked for CNN for 18 years before parting company
with the network, now does interviews of world leaders for a Web
site, ForeignTV.com. &QL;

<P>
   THE SMELL OF NEWS FROM LOS ANGELES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team planning next spring's new look at The Los Angeles
Times had orders to think outside the box. But some executives at
the newspaper might have wondered whether there was such a thing as
thinking too far outside the box when they were asked to give their
newspaper a sniff test.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting about three weeks ago, consultants from Nissan
Design International, one of three outside firms advising the
newspaper on its redesign, gleefully warned executives that they
had taken the outside-the-box business to heart. Then they passed
around little boxes of shredded newspaper, including The Times, a
unit of the Times Mirror Co., and two competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, one participant said, was that The Times smelled
``a little sour.'' Then the consultants passed around test tubes
containing alternative scents like laundry detergent, hand lotion,
citrus, coffee and doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee scent proved to be a crowd-pleaser, as did the
doughnut smell.
</P>
<P>
   A second meeting with another consultant, Landor Associates,
which specializes in brand identity, had a different
shake-things-up suggestion: a page in which the newspaper's name
was printed in a no-frills, all-lowercase typeface and run together
like a Web site address. It was also chartreuse.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, participants at the meetings said, the
suggestions were offered less as real options than ways to loosen
people up.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign, the newspaper's first in more than 10 years,
``stems from a desire to organize the paper as best we can and give
maximum exposure to the content we produce,'' said John Arthur, the
newspaper's managing editor for regional editions, who is heading
the 80-person internal redesign team. It also stems from The Times'
shift to a slightly smaller size.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, the newspaper should have a cleaner and
more uniform look. ``This is not going to be a radical new
presentation that is going to alienate readers,'' he said. ``The
idea is to bring in new readers while keeping all the readers we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the design meetings, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said, ``I don't think anyone's out there
pouring perfume into the ink.'' --FELICITY BARRINGER &QC;

   REVAMPED GUN MAGAZINES ATTRACTING MORE READERS
</P>
<P>
   Along with the highly publicized acts of gun violence during the
last year _ including episodes in Littleton, Colo., Atlanta and Los
Angeles that received front-page newspaper coverage and 24-hour
news-channel surveillance _ comes a peculiar, and to some
disturbing, flowering of the gun media.
</P>
<P>
   The gun magazines have enjoyed a minor but notable surge in
popularity over the last two years. They are retooling their
designs, printing on better-quality paper and publishing articles
about the threat of rioting at the turn of the millennium. The
combined result is that the magazines are, for the most part,
attracting more readers.
</P>
<P>
   TENSIONS OVER `LOLITA' RETELLING
</P>
<P>
   The copyright tiff has ended, but tensions are still simmering
between Vladimir Nabokov's son and Pia Pera, an Italian author who
has written a retelling of ``Lolita'' from the girl's perspective.
In June, Foxrock, the publisher of ``Lo's Diary,'' announced an

<P>
   ANOTHER BIG PLAYER IN ALUMINUM
</P>
<P>
   While Alcoa and Western rivals warily circle each other to
retain supremacy in the aluminum business, Trans-World Group, a
relatively obscure but powerful competitor that operates
extensively in the former Soviet Union, has been increasing its
control in a region responsible for much of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
   THE TROUBLE WITH ONLINE RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives have realized that managing online sales
can be as difficult as managing offline merchandising. Merchandise
returns, in particular, have been nettlesome for Internet stores,
especially those without previous experience in traditional
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   THE RISK OF REGISTERING WEB NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a combination of foresight, luck and good timing,
Richard Forman's company, Register.com, is the first and most
aggressive player in the game of breaking up the monopoly on
Internet address registrations. But more than 250 companies are
expected eventually to compete in what is stacking up to be a risky
venture. One big unknown is how far registration fees will drop. An
even bigger gamble is that key rules for the game remain unknown.

<P>
   FORD TO START BIG AD CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Trying to establish a common brand image for its ever-growing
family of sport utility vehicles, Ford Motor Co. is preparing to
start one of the largest advertising campaigns ever in the auto
industry. After relying for nearly two decades on its ``built Ford
tough'' theme for pickups, it has created a separate slogan, ``no
boundaries,'' for its sport utility models and will start
advertising them as a group, as well as individually.

 &HT;    Braves win on Jordan's hit in 9th
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Jordan is sick of talking about his sore right
hand, and sick of swinging with it too. But he allowed himself to
do a little bit of both for the sake of a 3-2 win over the Padres
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading some of his hurt around, Jordan singled in the winning
run in the bottom of the ninth inning to complete a three-game
sweep of San Diego. The Cincinnati Reds, contenders in the Central
Division and wild-card races, come into town for three games
starting today.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's face was still long when he came out of the training
room after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to pull myself out of the game after my third
at-bat,'' Jordan said. ``But then I figured I might as well stick
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth at-bat, Jordan singled on the infield to start the
eighth inning, just after the left-field scoreboard at Turner Field
showed the Mets had rallied to beat the Cardinals in the first game
of their doubleheader. That meant the Mets, who would go on to lose
the second game, were a half-game up in first place at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones followed with a walk, but when Jose Hernandez
failed to get a good bunt down, the rally was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, however, the Braves came up with a victory in
their final inning for the 23rd time this season. And the Padres,
who did their best to give the Braves their 4-3 win in the opening
game of the series Friday, were back at it. Reliever Dan Miceli
gave them their opening by walking Gerald Williams on four pitches
to lead off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone moved Williams to second with a sacrifice and Miceli
walked Jones intentionally to set up a force situation for a
possible double-play _ and possibly a preferred shot at the
sore-handed Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to block everything out with the game on the line,''
Jordan said. ``I tried to go up there with a clear mind, see the
ball out of his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   With San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman safely on the bullpen
mound, Jordan took an inside fastball for a strike from Miceli and
filed away that he'd probably see it again. He took two pitches out
of the zone to work the count to 2-1, got that fastball in again
and pulled it to left field to score Williams easily.
</P>
<P>
   That made a winner out of John Rocker in another successful
outing by Terry Mulholland, who dueled Sterling Hitchcock to a 2-2
tie with eight innings of quality work.
</P>
<P>
   TONIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 7:40 p.m.; Turner Field.

THE OTHER COUPLE IN SERBIAN POLITICS: THE DRASKOVICS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE Yugoslavia _ Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, and his influential wife, Danica, find themselves
at a political crossroads, suddenly less radical than many of their
supporters, their commitment to the ouster of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Having built a reputation as fierce and combative leaders of the
opposition to Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic,
the Draskovics now have money, power, position and a lot to lose _
making them much like the tightly knit Milosevics themselves, whom
they detest but to whom they are often compared.
</P>
<P>
   The Draskovics control Belgrade, its many business opportunities
and its powerful television station, Studio B _ all at the
sufferance of Milosevic's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   And their efforts to find a peaceful way to oust Milosevic, to
negotiate with him for new elections while trying to subvert him,
have confused some of their followers and helped keep the
opposition divided.
</P>
<P>
   That was glaringly evident at a large anti-Milosevic rally on
Thursday in Belgrade, which drew up to 100,000 people. When
Draskovic realized how many had shown up, he felt compelled to
crash the rally he had refused to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded Draskovic is normally a compelling orator, a kind of
rock star. But his speech, calling for early elections and not
Milosevic's immediate removal, was too moderate for the crowd,
marking a strange new episode in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Draskovics' desire for political power and dominance among
the varied opposition leaders has led them to make various deals
with the authorities while holding to the idea of fundamental
democratic change. As they alternate between opposition and
cooperation _ what critics call opportunism _ more people ask
whether they have any other real aim beyond power.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night on Studio B, Draskovic defended his caution, saying
it would be easy to call for civil war. ``I am Milosevic's
opponent, but I am also opposed to a single head rolling,'' he
said. ``I don't want people to get killed because of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   But many disappointed despisers of Milosevic say the Draskovics
have become afraid of revolutionary disorder, corrupted and
co-opted, more interested in replacing the leader at the top than
in destroying his system of crony capitalism and special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that they are so driven by an intense personal
hatred for their erstwhile coalition partner of only three years
ago, the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic _ an animosity
fully reciprocated _ that the fight for supremacy within the
opposition has overshadowed the fight against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Such charges infuriate Vuk and Danica Draskovic, now 53 and 54
respectively. In a recent, four-hour interview at their comfortable
home, Mrs. Draskovic said bitterly: ``Who led the demonstrations in
1991? And '93? And '96? Who led the fight in the streets? Who went
to jail?''
</P>
<P>
   But each time it has been Mrs. Draskovic, a former judge forced
to resign in 1973 by the Communists for refusing to jail a jobless
man, who has pushed her husband, the orator and mover of crowds, to
act boldly.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, during enormous street protests that ultimately
forced Milosevic to grant the democratic opposition their victories
in local elections, Mrs. Draskovic was captured on television
urging protesters to take clubs and march on Dedinje, the
neighborhood where Milosevic lives, and to seize power from the
thieves who had stolen the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was time now _ after the loss of Kosovo _ to
urge people to take clubs to Dedinje again, Mrs. Draskovic answered
immediately, ``Yes, it's always time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said nearly as quickly: ``No. No one wants a civil
war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is a tension that has defined their relationship, which is
strong and mutually dependent, between the smart, aggressive
daughter of a Chetnik _ a monarchist guerrilla during the Nazi
occupation _ and the son of a proud Partisan, a fighter with the
victorious Communist Tito.
</P>
<P>
   They were law students in 1968, the year of student upheavals
throughout Europe, when they first met and dated, and took part in
protests here against social injustice, inequality and ``the red
bourgeoisie,'' the party bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tito promised reforms, exhilarating Draskovic and the others,
who danced and shouted, ``Tito we love you!''
</P>
<P>
   But Danica Boskovic, Draskovic remembered in a 1990 interview
with On magazine, was utterly contemptuous of the half-Croatian
Tito and of their faith in him, and she exploded when Vuk tried to
pull her into the celebratory kolo, or dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kolo?'' she demanded. ``That bandit, that Ustashe'' _ a
Croatian fascist. ``He's cheated us and fooled us just to get us to
calm down. I thought you were smarter than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuk said: ``Don't speak that way about Comrade Tito. Get into
the kolo.'' And Danica said: ``Choose: him or me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I chose Tito,'' Vuk said, ``and I seem to remember I
pushed her away.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Tito reneged and called the students
counterrevolutionaries. ``I repented,'' Vuk said, ``and for four
years I tried to exchange one word with Danica, in vain. She would
not see me for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a true story, Danica said, laughing. Why did she relent?
``Vuk changed,'' she said. ``He left the party.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But when is confusing. Communist Party membership was a
necessary ticket for employment in journalism, and he worked for
the Tanjug press agency from 1969 until 1978, when he was yanked
from Lusaka, Zambia, for making up a border war.
</P>
<P>
   He said that charge was nonsense, that he had had ideological
troubles, but he then worked for the official trade union newspaper
in Belgrade. He said he had given up on the party, but actually he
was expelled from it in 1982, when he published the fiercely
nationalist novel ``Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel reopened many of the nationalist and religious issues
that Tito had suppressed but which helped break apart the country,
with so much bloodshed, after his death.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL END)
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Draskovic's deep and mythic Serbian nationalism _
``I'm a victim of my metaphors,'' he said as he expressed his love
for the dead multiethnic Yugoslavia _ his wife's anti-Communist
credentials have given their Serbian Renewal Party a considerable
reach into provincial Serbia, where the more citified intellectuals
of the Democratic Party do less well.
</P>
<P>
   Her fury at the expropriations and hypocrisies of Communism have
helped drive her toward action, she says, and without question
helped him toward political prominence.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested by Milosevic's Serbian government for the first
time in March 1991, after a huge opposition demonstration against
the unrelenting propaganda of the state television, which the
protesters called ``TV Bastille.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Policemen and demonstrators clashed, and as the marchers
faltered, Danica, standing with Vuk on the balcony of the National
Theater, yelled at him: ``What are you waiting for? Shout,
`Forward!' ''
</P>
<P>
   He did. One policeman and one student died, and he was arrested
for a few days, but he had earned his reputation as ``king of the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, 1993, there was a street riot in Belgrade after
Milosevic _ then president of Serbia, one of the republics making
up Yugoslavia _ engineered the sudden impeachment of the federal
president, the nationalist writer Dobrica Cosic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic led a march through Belgrade. But it was Mrs.
Draskovic who called on protesters to storm the federal Parliament.
She was filmed on state television saying, ``We should get inside,
beat up the police and bust up the whole building'' and asking
demonstrators, ``Where are your guns and your bombs?''
</P>
<P>
   The couple was arrested about 1:30 a.m., and both were beaten
badly by the police. Mrs. Draskovic was beaten by the chief of the
city's police, Rade Markovic _ now director of state security _ and
she is said to have behaved impressively, cursing the police and
the government with blood pouring from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, in a separate cell, reacted differently. He wrote a
letter, later published in a newspaper, full of pathos to Mrs.
Markovic, Milosevic's powerful wife, begging her to free Danica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danica and I have no children,'' he wrote. ``To me, she is my
wife and my child and my whole family. While she is in jail, my
entire family is in jail. Help her, esteemed Mrs. Markovic, and you
will have helped me, too. I would be endlessly grateful to you, as
long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draskovics were in jail or prison hospitals for some 40 days
before they were freed on July 9, flown to Paris by Danielle
Mitterrand, the wife of the French president at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But there are persistent reports that Draskovic wrote a second
letter from jail, promising Milosevic that if his wife was
released, the street demonstrations would stop and his party would
``disarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple denies that there was any unpublished letter, but
there is no question that Draskovic moved into more conventional
politics and showed an increasing willingness to deal with the
authorities to get a share of power and, it is said, money.
</P>
<P>
   There were already signs of that a year before. In the local
elections of 1992, a democratic coalition including his party won
the upscale Belgrade municipality of Savski Venac, a district
covering Dedinje, a wealthy area with many embassies and official
houses. At the inaugural session of the local Parliament, Draskovic
struck a deal with Milosevic's Socialists and dropped a coalition
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Danica's brother, Veselin Boskovic, took over the department
that managed municipal construction grounds _ in other words, he
controlled building permits and vacant city land. Accusations of
graft and corruption, including cash bribes for building permits,
were so plentiful that he was forced to step down, despite denials,
in part because Milosevic's party kept a dossier on him.
</P>
<P>
   But after the opposition won Belgrade in the 1996 elections,
Boskovic was given responsibility for the same department _ only
for all of Belgrade. Again, there have been numerous accusations of
bribery and graft, of payoffs for permits, which he and Mrs.
Draskovic have denied.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's chief of security, a former bodyguard who was a
member of a short-lived Serb Volunteer Guard that Draskovic sent to
Croatia to fight in 1991, was also appointed manager of the large
Tasmajdan Sports Center in downtown Belgrade. There, as with
parking lots, tickets are paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Roksanda Nincic, a political reporter for the liberal Vreme
magazine, says that one of Draskovic's problems ``is that he's
organized a corrupt government that hasn't put Danica's family in
influential places so much, as in places where cash flows.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Draskovic has another brother and six sisters, and in the
interview, she listed each of them and their professions to refute
persistent allegations that she has granted them or their husbands
leases for lucrative shops in good locations.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic's Socialists _ which keep Draskovic in power in
Belgrade by not voting against him in the city council _ are widely
believed to have the means to harass and prosecute Boskovic and
other party and family favorites, a stick they use, Draskovic
rivals say, to keep Mr. and Mrs. Draskovic in line.
</P>
<P>
   The Draskovics also see control of Studio B, the Belgrade
television station, as vital to any relatively fair election
campaign _ another reason, some suggest, that Draskovic is not
eager to defy Milosevic too fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps explain why Draskovic agreed to participate in the
1997 Serbian elections, which Djindjic and most of the other
opposition parties boycotted (against U.S. advice) as unfair
because of a lack of truly independent media and outside electoral
observers.
</P>
<P>
   The election was only credible because Draskovic took part.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as he moved more fully into conventional politics, Danica
Draskovic was perceived as too visible and influential. Like
Hillary Clinton, she pulled back from the open play of politics _ a
decision her husband announced.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, he is defensive on the topic. ``She has influenced
me more than you think but less than normal,'' he said. ``She
influences me most when her stand is close to mine, but not if we
are opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   She is fiercer than he, it seems, about Djindjic. In the
interview, she remembered being infuriated by reading, her second
day in jail in 1993, a newspaper citing Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said we got what we deserved,'' she said bitterly. When
Draskovic agreed later to go into the Zajedno coalition with
Djindjic in 1996, ``we were very close to divorce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She said, a touch sarcastically, ``He said, `I must save Serbia,
I must save my people.' And what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' Draskovic said. ``Zajedno was a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Draskovic shocked more of his supporters when
he went into Milosevic's federal government as a deputy prime
minister, citing the crisis in Kosovo and the need for national
unity while saying he remained, at heart, in opposition, working to
change the system from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   He became the acceptable face for the regime, its spokesman to
the West and Western media, yet he also criticized Milosevic and
his wife for manipulating Serbian patriotism for narrow political
goals. That finally got him dismissed before the war ended,
allowing him to revive his oppositionist credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is accused of doing another deal with a desperate
Milosevic, favoring early elections in November. Draskovic denies
any deal and says elections are the only way forward. But what he
defines as pragmatic politics, aimed at power, is increasingly seen
here as opportunism. Yet his rivals have no clearer notion of how
to oust Milosevic, other than hoping to do it in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 interview with On magazine, Draskovic mentions that
in a preface to his book, ``Where Are You Going, Serbia?'', he is
compared to a rooster in a famous Ivo Andric short story. The
rooster is killed not because it sings badly, but because it crows
too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it ends up in the pot,'' Draskovic said. ``And
that, I guess, is my destiny.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican pollster Linda DiVall and Republican
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole are, in many ways, an odd
couple.
</P>
<P>
   They differ in style, with Ms. DiVall's blunt, matter-of-fact
demeanor containing none of the sugary flourishes that garnish Mrs.
Dole. They disagree on policy, with Ms. DiVall supporting a woman's
right to a legal abortion and Mrs. Dole expressing a qualified
opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Ms. DiVall was hired to work on Mrs. Dole's bid
for the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year, a few
Republicans contacted the campaign to protest the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't think I was conservative enough,'' Ms. DiVall said
over lunch last week, smiling wryly at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, Ms. DiVall said, ignored her work in the past for
politicians well to the right of Mrs. Dole _ former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich sprang quickly to mind.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the critics were missing a larger point that
spoke to just how hard Ms. DiVall would be willing to fight for
Mrs. Dole, just how much Ms. DiVall cared about this candidate's
success.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. DiVall, the Dole campaign is not just another contract,
another source of income, another line on her resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history,'' Ms. DiVall said, referring to the fact that no
woman before Mrs. Dole had attempted ``a serious, viable female
candidacy'' for the presidency. ``To be part of that was something
that I thought would be terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that in January, on the day after Mrs. Dole announced
that she was going to leave her job as president of the American
Red Cross, Ms. DiVall personally visited the organization's
headquarters to introduce and pitch herself to Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case of one Republican trailblazer hooking arms with
another. In 1985, when Ms. DiVall started her firm, American
Viewpoint Inc., which has offices in Alexandria, Va., she was the
first female pollster in the Republican Party to strike out on her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. DiVall, 47, is easily one of the half dozen best
known pollsters in the party. Because she is the only woman on that
list, she is assumed to be particularly attuned to the way female
voters feel about Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, women have generally shown a stronger
preference for Democrats, and that gender gap has been a subject of
enormous frustration and intense study for Ms. DiVall, whose own
lifelong allegiance to the Republican Party arises from her belief
that the federal government should be leaner and less quick to
assume that it has the prescriptions for all social maladies.
</P>
<P>
   A significant part of the gender gap, Ms. DiVall said, has to do
with women's less certain purchase on economic security and more
ingrained roles as caretakers. Those realities incline women to
expect government to play an actively protective role that is more
in line with both Democratic ideology and oratory.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. DiVall said that another force pushing women away from
Republicans is more easily fixed, and that is what she described as
the ``judgmental, intolerant, scolding and dour'' attitude that too
many Republican politicians project.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the polling she has done for Republicans is aimed at
helping them find the right terms and tenor for articulating their
smaller-government message without seeming callous. Ms. DiVall
similarly coaches candidates who oppose abortion on less preachy
enunciations of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not always going to be a softening,'' Ms. DiVall said,
referring to the candidate's position. ``And I'm not trying to do
that. But I'm trying to say that there are others out there with
different views, and they are not irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   She would rather be golfing. When she left Mt. Prospect, Ill.,
the Chicago suburb where her father, an extremely successful
accountant, and her mother raised her and two younger sisters, she
headed to Arizona State University with the goals of ``getting rid
of my hay fever and becoming a professional golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed on both counts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A political science professor with his own polling company
exposed her to that line of work, which appealed to her
appreciation for measurable truths in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, who could possibly dispute the person who had the
numbers in a campaign?'' Ms. DiVall said. ``Little did I know.''
</P>
<P>
   She first did research and other work for the Republican
National Committee, then for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, and by the time she struck out on her own, she had made
all the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a real pioneer,'' said Christine Matthews, a
35-year-old woman who does political polling for Market Strategies,
a nationwide firm. Additionally, Ms. Matthews said, ``She
challenges the party's status quo, and she challenges assumptions
that the party can't be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DiVall is unmarried, childless and can often be found with a
five-iron at Mt. Vernon Country Club, which allows women to play
golf at any time of the weekend _ not just during prescribed
periods of the day _ unlike some other clubs around Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She loves the game enough that last year, when a political trade
journal asked her to name her favorite books, she listed ``Ben
Hogan's Five Fundamental Lessons of Golf'' alongside the Ayn Rand
novel ``Atlas Shrugged.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows that Mrs. Dole lags far behind Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in the polls, but Ms. DiVall is not discouraged, and said that
Mrs. Dole could yet prove to be magnet for those who do not
typically vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody's who's paying attention to this race is probably
guilty of deviant behavior,'' she said. ``Most voters won't tune in
until a year from now.''

WHEAT FARMERS' PRACTICE OF FIELD BURNING IS UNDER ATTACK

<P>
   RITZVILLE, Wash. _ On long summer days, the amber waves of grain
of ``America the Beautiful'' come to life here in the gentle hills
of eastern Washington, more so in moist years, still true even in a
terribly dry one like this.
</P>
<P>
   But on many farms, the harvest is soon followed by flames, as
growers take a match to their fields to clear the wheat stubble and
prepare for another planting season. On some days the air is thick
with the smoke, and it often drifts from the farms to Spokane, the
largest city in the region, blowing ill will along with the acrid
fumes.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old practice of field burning, used by farmers here
and in many other parts of the country as the cheapest, most
efficient way to clear stubble, weeds and disease-bearing pests, is
under increasing attack in many places, especially where the farms
are not far from cities whose residents lead lives that are not
tied to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are alternatives to burning,'' said Patricia Hoffman,
president of Save Our Summers, an environmental group based in
Spokane that is leading a fight to have the practice eliminated.
``There aren't alternatives to breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for farmers here and in the heavily agricultural Palouse
region along the Washington-Idaho border, south of Spokane, the
issue is not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burning is a tool we want to have in our toolbox,'' said Brett
Blankenship, a third-generation wheat farmer who lives in Ritzville
and is president of the Adams County Association of Wheat Growers.
``It's one of the best ways to clear the fields without chemicals,
without drastic tillage measures that cause a lot of erosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, a federal panel advising Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman on environmental issues conducted a
three-day tour of Spokane and nearby farms. The chairman of the
panel, which is expected to make recommendations to alleviate the
problem, described the inland Northwest as a national hot spot for
the field-burning debate.
</P>
<P>
   And officials with the state's Department of Ecology, who have
declared smoke from the burning to be a ``significant regional
health problem,'' negotiated a deal with farmers this year intended
to reduce the annual amount of stubble burning in the next seven
years to half last year's level of 230,000 acres in eastern
Washington. That was about 7 percent of all the wheat acreage in
the area; farmers generally use fire for especially heavy
concentrations of stubble, and clear and reseed other fields with
different methods, including tilling.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term goal for both farmers, who hope to avoid a ban or
more severe limits on burning, and environmental groups is to
figure out better ways to grow wheat that can head off both the
need for burning and the erosion problems associated with tilling.
The wheat farmers have even helped to pay for studies at local
universities.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these moves has quelled the debate so far, as
environmental groups say the current agreement still allows far too
much burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we don't allow other industries to pose
such a clear public health risk simply because it's cheaper or
easier to do it that way,'' said Tim Connor, a spokesman for the
Northwest Environmental Education Foundation, a group based in
Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Ritzville, about 60 miles southwest of Spokane, farmers
are feeling beleaguered by the issue, and it is not too surprising
to find that few local people seem to consider the late-summer and
early-fall burning objectionable. The town was built on wheat. It
was settled by German pioneers in the 1800s who for a time helped
to make it the largest inland exporter of wheat in the world.
Townspeople here even like to say _ apocryphally, alas, according
to Nabisco Co. _ that the Ritz cracker was named for Ritzville. (A
Nabisco spokesman says ``Ritz'' was chosen in the Depression
because of its ``luxurious, high-class'' connotation.)
</P>
<P>
   A large sign at the entrance to town boasts of all the trophies
won by the local branch of the Future Farmers of America at
national organization contests: agricultural issues, 1998;
parliamentary procedure, 1992 and 1997; land evaluation, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me at all,'' Erin Gordon, the manager of a
local video store, said of the burning. ``We know what they're
doing, and it's all a part of the growing cycle.'' Erin Lamping, an
insurance clerk, said, ``I hardly even notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others describe the situation very differently.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke comes, it is clearly an irritant, both to the
chest and to the eyes. And for the elderly, children and thousands
of people in the region with asthma or other health problems, it
can have far more serious effects.
</P>
<P>
   While the wheat burning is expected to get under way in a matter
of weeks, farmers who raise grass seed have already started to burn
in neighboring Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day, more than two dozen people called a state
health line there to complain about the smoke from a 1,100-acre
fire on the Rathdrum Prairie in northern Idaho. And at a day-care
center in nearby Post Falls, Idaho, workers kept nearly 150
children inside all day rather than expose them to the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beside themselves, they don't know what to do,''
said Ms. Hoffman of Save Our Summers, who is a veterinarian.
``They're sick and they're suffering and they're so disheartened.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much wheat stubble will be burned in the coming weeks
is unclear. Many farmers have struggled through a drought this
summer, alleviated only a bit by rains that have come in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with much more rain, the region clearly lived up to
its reputation as one of the most productive wheat-growing areas
anywhere, and the results of the harvest piled up in the grain
elevators that dot the rustic landscape, later to be shipped all
over the world. This year's harvest is expected to be down by 30
percent to 50 percent, which will also reduce somewhat the amount
of stubble in the fields and the smoke from it.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers do not burn their fields at all, using other
methods to clear them. Jerry Zahl, a farmer near Walla Walla and a
former board member of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers,
sent a letter to state agricultural officials earlier this year in
which he described field burning as ``a sin against the land, the
air and the water'' and urged that it be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But Blankenship said that almost any method of clearing the
fields carried environmental consequences. Erosion, for instance,
can ruin productivity and foul waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to strike a balance with all of the environmental
issues in play,'' Blankenship said. ``We're trying to comply with
the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act,
all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has turned increasingly contentious over the years.
Two environmental advocates were convicted of trespassing this year
and sentenced to small fines and community service for their role
in an effort to document burning practices last summer. And Save
Our Summers recently filed a lawsuit against the state Department
of Ecology, complaining that the agency withheld documents that
might show it was too permissive in striking a deal with the
farmers to reduce the burning.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups are pressing for drastic reductions in
the amount of burning that goes on now, and some leaders of the
anti-burn drive talk of pressing the state Legislature to outlaw
the practice altogether, a move that some farmers say could prove
ruinous to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would put too many family farmers out of business
altogether,'' Blankenship said. ``We feel boxed in. We're willing
to do our part for a better environment, but now they're asking us
to do more than our part.''

 &HT;    Labonte wins after 2-car pass
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ The chase for this year's Winston Cup
championship may be boring, but Sunday's Pepsi 400 featured some of
the most exciting racing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon engage in a
classic battle for the lead late in the 200-lap race, Bobby Labonte
sneaked past both of them at Michigan Speedway for his fourth
victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty neat to watch those two,'' Labonte said. ``If
you didn't clear both of them, you knew you were going to be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   After Labonte took the lead, he gradually pulled away from
Gordon to win by .865 seconds, averaging 144.332 mph. Rookie Tony
Stewart captured third place for the best finish of his career,
followed by points leader Dale Jarrett and Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   For Jarrett, it was the 13th race in a row he has placed sixth
or better. He expanded his lead in the points to a season-high 314
over Mark Martin, who finished seventh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to win, but more than anything, if we can finish in
the top five, we know they'll have a difficult time catching us,''
Jarrett said. ``It's one more race down and they know they've got
one less to be able to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The duel between Gordon and Earnhardt began to shape up soon
after a caution with 33 laps remaining. For six laps in a row,
Gordon tried to pass Earnhardt high and low on the track and was
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you come up on Earnhardt, he's going to be the
toughest guy to pass, especially when he's leading a race,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I was the guy who had to try to get by him, and
it killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was waiting patiently behind while the two Chevys raced.
With 17 laps to go, he engineered a stunning three-wide pass on
Earnhardt and Gordon. Labonte got drafting help from Stewart, his
teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing, to take the lead and he went
unchallenged the rest of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated that Bobby got us three-wide,'' Gordon said. ``That's
what I'm bummed out about. I knew if I could get by Earnhardt, it
would've been tough for anybody to get by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt began having handling problems with his car, and
narrowly held off a late charge from Chad Little to finish fifth.
It was Earnhardt's best performance since a second-place showing
six races ago at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale is driving as good as ever,'' car-owner Richard Childress
said. ``I was getting cold chills out there.''

GIANTS HOPE THEIR OFFENSE ISN'T PEAKING IN THE PRESEASON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No sacks of a Giants quarterback for the second
consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   Net yardage: 494, more yards than any Giants team had gained in
14 years.
</P>
<P>
   With Kent Graham, the starting quarterback, throwing for 269
yards in the first half, the Giants' passing total was 393 yards,
the most in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have scored 63 points in two preseason games. They
did not come close to scoring 63 points last November. In five
games.
</P>
<P>
   It might be useful to keep repeating this: it's only the
preseason. But something is up with the Giants' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have already had seven pass plays of 30 yards or
longer. In 16 regular-season games last season, the Giants had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Their third-down efficiency in the opening preseason game at
Minnesota and Saturday night's 27-20 victory over Jacksonville is
50 percent. Last year it was 30 percent in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The starting offense has had one sequence of three downs and
out, but twice it has needed just three plays to score a touchdown.
When the starting unit is playing, Brad Maynard has punted once. So
far, Maynard might as well bring a book to read on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's only the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' average gain per play so far is 6.7 yards. Last
year in the regular season, it was 4.4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Their average gain per pass attempted, a statistic widely
considered the most telling in pro football, is 11.1 yards. Last
season it was 5.1 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Giants have lost eight fumbles and the 1998 team lost
nine all season. But then, it's only the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   So, who are these guys?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'd feel more comfortable if we were putting up these
numbers in the regular season,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said
Sunday. The coach was nearly in retreat, trying as hard as he could
to pull the reins in on the galloping story of an offensive
metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've improved, but I'm still very guarded,'' Fassel said.
``Things change in the regular season. There's game planning, and
defenses react differently. I'm happy, but it's only a foundation
we have to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, however, sees the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``we're functioning as a different
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many places to start when explaining this
transformation, but the best place would probably be at the center
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams, the 11-year veteran who had to sit out the last
two seasons because of an eye injury, has forged a bond with the
other offensive linemen that has made them confident and
productive, especially when protecting Graham.
</P>
<P>
   This unit believes in Williams and the new offensive line coach,
Jim McNally, and it plays with a new poise and skill. Williams was
on the verge of a Pro Bowl season when he was injured, and his
presence alone, aside from his leadership qualities, improves the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scored their first touchdown Saturday night by
running behind Williams. A long pass play in the Giants' second
touchdown drive would not have happened if Williams had not
disengaged from his man to pick off a charging defender who was one
step from burying Graham in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for praise is the receiving corps. The receivers are
working as a blend, with disparate but compatible abilities, and
they are aggressively going for the football. The former is a
product of three consecutive years together, the latter is a result
of Graham's willingness to attack the defense with the long pass.
</P>
<P>
   Like a fielder in baseball who never gets a ball hit toward him,
a receiver can grow lackadaisical running his deep routes if he
never sees the football. This was beginning to happen to the
Giants, but since Graham took over with six games to go in the 1998
season, he has stretched the field, telling his receivers in
essence: go deep, I'll find you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the potential of this offense is,'' Graham said.
``There were things we had to unleash, so this doesn't surprise
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who might think the Giants' offensive success has come
against simplistic defenses still feeling their way in the
preseason, Graham said Saturday that Jacksonville was trying to
confuse the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bringing a lot of stuff at us _ changing rushes,
rolling coverages,'' he said. ``They fooled me a few times early
on. We adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are a few of the ways the Giants' offense is better so far
this season. There are more ways not quite as advanced, others not
yet proved unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only the preseason. &QL;

TURKS FEAR THAT IN NEXT QUAKE THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Nilhan Sesahan lives in an apartment with a
stunning view of the Bosporus strait, one of many reasons she loves
her ancient, vibrant city and will never leave it.
</P>
<P>
   But after the earthquake that devastated regions east of here,
Ms. Sesahan is thinking of moving to higher ground _ away from the
water and onto firmer soil with less crowded surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be another earthquake,'' she said. `'I know this, I
have read it in the papers, on the Internet. The city won't do
anything to get ready, but I have started thinking about what I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Geologists and seismologists here and abroad predict that the
next earthquake to hit Turkey is likely to be even more deadly,
erupting further west along the volatile North Anatolian fault,
probably in the densely populated city of Istanbul or in the Sea of
Marmara, south of the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next shock will come maybe 30, 40, 50 years from now, but
it will hit in the city of Istanbul, or in the Marmara Sea because
this is the last part of the North Anatolian fault,'' said Turgut
Oztas, a geological engineer who heads a branch of the Turkish
Architects and Engineers Association. ``We are trying to warn
official people about this. Everybody must be ready for this
inescapable fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the overwhelming earthquake disaster on
Tuesday, many residents of this giant city with an estimated
population of 12 million are more doubtful than ever that their
government is capable of planning for such a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust the government to plan for this,'' said Ms.
Sesahan, a sculptor. ``Take what is happening today as a model. The
people are being very helpful and supportive of one another, but
the government can't get real help to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scale of last week's disaster sinks in, many people
interviewed in downtown Istanbul expressed shame and disgust at
their government's handling of the crisis. They echoed the
widespread criticism in the Turkish press about the lack of
equipment and of trained personnel in a country that has suffered
repeated earthquakes over the last hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the first major earthquake in Turkey,'' said
Hilal Erkmen, who works in an advertising agency. ``We know we are
living on a fault line. We know from past earthquakes what is
needed. But it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Serder Balkaya, a student visiting Istanbul last week, said:
``The government is very inefficient. The foreigners came, and for
three days they have been bringing people out of the rubble while
the Turkish government did nothing but watch. That's the part that
hurts the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Alsoy Onder, a 29-year-old contractor whose brother was killed
by the quake in the city of Golchuk, said: ``We have no government.
They are a prop. They don't care about anything. They just work for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The most cynical assessment came from a group of five university
students, who refused to give their names. ``Absolutely nothing
will change,'' said one 18-year-old youth. ``We have no faith in
government. We have all been raised seeing the corruption all
around us.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cities hit by the earthquake, people have turned their
wrath on builders who skimped on materials, using thin iron rods
and concrete mixed with too much sand in obvious violation of
building codes. Often, people say, those violations are overlooked
by corrupt local officials from across the spectrum of Turkey's
political parties in return for cash donations by the builders, and
the votes of the new inhabitants, who were grateful to find
housing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the resort town of Yalova, a ferry ride from Istanbul, dozens
of buildings that collapsed in the quake had been built by a
well-known developer, Veli Gocer. He left the country after his car
was burned and his house stoned by furious residents. Interviewed
from Germany by a Turkish newspaper, Gocer admitted that he had
mixed concrete with sand from local beaches and said he had not
known any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state had stopped me, it wouldn't have come to this,''
he was quoted as saying. ``I am a victim of my own inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people interviewed were hopeful that this quake, the
worst in Turkey in this century, will compel officials to replan
the city, knock down shoddily constructed buildings and force
builders to abide by strict anti-earthquake requirements already on
the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next earthquake will be another disaster, because hundreds
of thousands of buildings in Istanbul are badly constructed,'' said
Ali Riza Yasa, a freelance writer. ``These should be torn down, but
how much of this can be done?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the intense public concern in the days after
the quake, experts have been pressing ahead with a proposed plan of
action. It calls for strict enforcement of existing building codes,
scrutiny of the construction process by private insurance
companies, and site inspections by local authorities _ which are
now not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Sezer Yilmaz, a 28-year-old soldier who was given special
leave after the quake struck his family's apartment _ but spared
their lives _ in the Istanbul district of Avcilar, doubts whether
local officials or the people themselves will draw lessons from the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will end up in the same situation,'' he said. ``We are a
passive people. Maybe for one or two years, people will pay
attention, but after that, they will forget again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people see hope in the spontaneous response from ordinary
Turks, who have flocked to the disaster sites, offering their
services and bringing food, medicine and bedding. In a country that
for decades discouraged the rise of voluntary civic associations,
this reaction is seen as a healthy sign of a growing citizen
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see people have greater expectation from
their government after this,'' said Lincoln McCurdy, president of
the American Turkish Council, who has lived in Turkey for almost 20
years. ``I've already seen the change. Once this mess is over,
people are going to say they have had enough with all the
corruption.''

 &HT;    Front row finds frustration fast
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Starting on the front row is usually a big
advantage for drivers. It was disaster for pole-sitter Ward Burton
and Mike Skinner at Sunday's Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was the first driver out of the race after colliding into
the retaining wall on turn 3 during lap 52. Skinner, starting
second, at No. 2, broke a rear-end gear while leaving the pits
earlier in the race and had to pull off the track for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The early departure of the No. 22 Pontiac was a devastating blow
for Burton, who had captured his first pole of the season. Burton's
problems started as soon as the race did, with Skinner taking away
the lead on the second lap.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had dropped down to sixth by lap 37 when he reported
problems with both steering and tire pressure. He was knocked out
of the race after apparently losing control of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what happened,'' Burton said. ``I'm OK,
other than some bruises and a headache. I'm just disappointed we
didn't have a better day.''
</P>
<P>
   Said crew chief Tommy Baldwin, ``I thought we were going to have
a top-five day. Another dead last (43rd place) ... what are you
going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner returned to the track and finished eight laps behind in
36th place.
</P>
<P>
   Caution flags
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart and Jeff Burton were involved in the day's biggest
wreck while battling for fifth place late in the race. As Stewart
tried an inside pass on the main straightaway of lap 162, he
appeared to be blocked toward the infield area by Burton.
</P>
<P>
   When Burton moved higher on the track, Stewart passed and
clipped the front of the No. 99 Ford, sending it into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff does that every time he gets behind me, he doesn't like
me passing him,'' Stewart said moments after the race.
</P>
<P>
   But after both drivers were called into the NASCAR trailer to
discuss the incident and review the tape, Stewart accepted the
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault,'' Stewart said. ``I came up on the track too
quickly. I thought I had (Burton) cleared. It's a shame; (the
wreck) took down a good car that is racing for points.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who was unhurt in the wreck, finished 12 laps down at
37th. He dropped two places in the Winston Cup points standings to
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Off track
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin and Jeff Burton, who are second and sixth in the
points standings, signed contract extensions to compete with Rousch
Roush Racing through the 2005 season. ``I've spent the last 12
years with (owner Jack Rousch Roush), and he's always made it
possible for me to race with the best people in the best cars. I
can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be'' ... The winner of TV
Guide's ``Star Car Sweepstakes'' will have his or her picture
placed on the hood of Kevin Lepage's car for the NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. ... Ricky Rudd denied rumors he has
discussed selling all or part of his racing team to A.J. Foyt, but
said he would not mind talking with the four-time winner of the
Indianapolis 500. Rudd also confirmed that the No. 28 car of Robert
Yates Racing would be his No. 1 choice if he gives up ownership to
concentrate on driving. ... Kevin Harwick, who is in the Craftsman
Truck Series, has been chosen the Busch Series driver next season
for Richard Childress Racing. ``When you grow up watching these
guys on television, there's going to be a little awe at first,''
said Harwick, 23. ``But then you have to have a reality check and
get on with it. Then it's time to start doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Time of race: 2 hours, 46 minutes, 16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Margin of victory: .865 seconds.

   Average speed: 144.332 mph.

FURLOUGH TRIUMPHS BY A NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Furlough, a 5-year-old daughter of Easy
Goer, staged a furious rush in the final yards Sunday to win the
Ballerina Handicap by a nose over Bourbon Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The race was so close that the next two horses, the favored
Catinca and Hurricane Bertie, finished in a dead heat for third,
another length and a half back.
</P>
<P>
   The four horses ran such a tight race down the homestretch of
the Saratoga Race Course that nobody was sure who had won,
including Shug McGaughey, who trains Furlough for Ogden Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was standing in the clubhouse,'' McGaughey said, ``I
thought she got beat a nose. When she got to the eighth pole, I
thought we had a good chance to win. But the other mare was still
running.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Bourbon Belle, who set a torrid pace throughout, racing
the first quarter-mile in 22 seconds, the half-mile in 44 3/5
seconds and three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 2/5. Meanwhile,
Furlough was running last in the field of 10 until Mike Smith
nudged her into action on the far turn. Then she came roaring out
of the pack in the final furlong and clipped Bourbon Belle at the
wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes from so far back, it was nice to get away good at
the start,'' Smith said. ``She settled down in the back of the
pack. Then she got on that long lope, and that's a good sign. When
she does that, she usually finishes strong. Once we got some
daylight, I asked her to run, and we got up there just in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlough had lost four races in a row since March and was the
7-1 fifth choice in the Ballerina. She completed the seven furlongs
in 1:23 and returned $16.40 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer John Kimmel said of his horse Catinca's race: ``You
can't go 15 wide and get left at the gate. Jerry Bailey said she
was standing fine in the gate but then got a little edgy. And when
she broke, she may have stumbled and gone to her knees.'' &QL;

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Beverly Jacoby didn't hesitate Sunday
when the mayor suggested that residents evacuate to higher ground
as Hurricane Bret menaced the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we treasure go into the car,'' said Jacoby, who
moved to Corpus Christi in May from Weatherford in North Central
Texas. She and her husband frantically loaded their most precious
belongings, including family photos and a cherished ``misprinted
$20 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, workers were hammering plywood across the windows
of her ocean-front apartment in preparation for the Category 4
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobys were among tens of thousands of residents who piled
into vans, cars, pickups and chartered buses and rolled onto
Interstate 37 for the bumper-to-bumper evacuation to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 80th anniversary of Corpus Christi's deadliest
hurricane, which killed an estimated 300 to 1,000 people. Residents
were taking no chances this time.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Loyd Neal said many people had heeded the city's warning
to evacuate, particularly those in low-lying areas such as North
Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor estimated that 30,000 people, about 10 percent of the
city's population, had moved inland in advance of the storm, but
Police Chief Pete Alvarez and others said the number may have been
significantly higher judging from the heavy traffic heading out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe us,'' the mayor implored residents in a televised
message. ``This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he was satisfied with the response, as well as with
the city's preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of these, but we practice often,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., less than two hours before the storm made landfall
south of Corpus Christi, the mayor said people who hadn't evacuated
``should stay in the city but leave low areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokesman Peter Teahen said government and Red Cross
officials agreed not to wait until Monday to decide whether to open
shelters in Corpus Christi ``because it's a force 4 hurricane, and
it's too dangerous for people to stay in the area due to possible
flooding and structural damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four Red Cross shelters opened in San Antonio quickly
filled with coastal evacuees, and more buildings were likely to be
requisitioned, Teahen said.
</P>
<P>
   Teahen flew in from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, before the Corpus
Christi airport was closed to all but emergency flights at 1:20
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals discharged patients who were able to leave Sunday and
were admitting only those requiring emergency treatment and women
in labor, said Laura Cole, spokeswoman for the Spohn Hospital
group. Staff and doctors were invited to bring family members with
them when they reported to work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern in Corpus Christi was that flooding would
contaminate the water supply, prompting the city to cut off service
to low-lying neighborhoods and North Padre Island at 9:30 a.m.,
said Juan Ortiz, the city's assistant director of emergency
management.
</P>
<P>
   Nueces County Sheriff Larry Oliverez said 325 inmates in a jail
annex that was not built to withstand 120 mph winds were evacuated
to safer quarters, as were boot camp and juvenile detention
residents.

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ With winds reaching 125 mph and a tidal
surge expected to reach 12 feet, Hurricane Bret rumbled ashore
early Sunday evening along the south Texas coast, hours after tens
of thousands of anxious residents evacuated inland along clogged
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the storm moved steadily, if somewhat
unpredictably, first steering directly at this heavily populated
coastal refinery city and then turning westward and hitting land in
rural and sparsely populated Kenedy County. The western edge of the
eye of the storm slowly touched land before 7 p.m. local time and
began pounding the county with heavy bands of rain and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, gale-force winds had begun buffeting the
long string of barrier islands that form the fragile outer wall for
much of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're being whipped,'' said Lt. Robert
Rodriguez, as he and several other police officers rode out the
storm in the evacuated resort town of South Padre Island north of
Brownsville, Texas. ``We're getting all the wind swirls, the
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   With the eye of the storm expected to reach land later Sunday
night, federal and state officials compared its potential ferocity
to Hurricane Andrew, which in 1992 caused more than $1 billion in
damage in Florida and Louisiana. Designated a Category 4 storm, or
extremely dangerous, Hurricane Bret was expected to dump 7 to 20
inches of rain and possibly unleash bands of tornadoes. Hours
before the landfall, Gov. George W. Bush asked federal officials to
declare seven coastal counties major disaster areas in order to
qualify for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, did begin to weaken as it reached land. James Lee
Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in
a briefing at 7 p.m. New York time that the hurricane had steered
away from populous Corpus Christi but still presented a serious
threat to south Texas. He said the tidal surge and heavy rainfull
could cause severe flooding as the storm moved farther inland
beyond Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the Rio Grande area and the
potential of flooding in that area,'' Witt said. ``It is a very
dangerous storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret is the first hurricane of the 1999 season and the first
major hurricane to threaten south Texas since Hurricane Allen
caused $55 million in damage in 1980. Last year, the area suffered
heavy flooding from two storms that drifted eastward from the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With many coastal areas susceptible to flooding, federal, state
and local officials began imploring residents to evacuate toward
San Antonio on Saturday afternoon. City officials in Corpus Christi
declared a state of disaster and declared a general but voluntary
evacuation until late in the afternoon, when remaining residents
were advised to find refuge in the city.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials evacuated 3,200 inmates to jails and
prisons further inland, while thousands of tourists vacationing in
the resort hotels of South Padre Island also fled the storm. The
U.S. Coast Guard closed the Corpus Christi ship channel, one of the
busiest ports in the nation, and answered several search and rescue
calls from boats struggling through the rough, surging waters of
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Schweikhard Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas Division of
Emergency Management, expressed concern that residents might fail
to heed evacuation warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a generation of Texans, either native to the
area or who have moved into the area, who have never experienced a
storm threat of this kind,'' Ms. Moss said. She added, ``Texas, to
this point, has been very, very fortunate, and obviously, it looks
like that luck has run out.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the mouth of the Rio Grande as far as 287 miles up the
Texas coastline to Galveston, residents heeded warnings and left in
droves. Motorists lumbered beneath black morning skies along
Interstate 37 out of Corpus Christi, pouring north and west toward
San Antonio and Austin. Electronic road signs along I-37 directed
the traffic to shelters in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Others fled along country roads through Nueces County, where
flat yellow and green fields seemed eerily still as clouds
approached from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get ugly,'' said Valerie Saenz, 25, as she
stopped at a convenience store in Corpus Christi for food en route
to San Antonio. ``I just packed up all my clothes.''
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sterling, 34, a Corpus Christi resident, left early Sunday
morning for San Antonio with his family. His wife, Susan, is
expecting their second child in nine days. ``She's nervous,''
Sterling said. He also said some of his neighbors had scoffed at
the evacuation order. ``I think they're crazy, plumb crazy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 miles offshore, waves reached 26 feet high, the
weather service said, and the tidal surge could surpass 15 feet
when Bret fully hits the coast. The threat of severe flooding
prompted Corpus Christi officials to evacuate 15,000 from Padre
Island, near Corpus Christi, and the local police closed the
causeway connecting that barrier island to the mainland. ``We
expect heavy flooding in that area, and we don't want those people
trapped by rising water,'' said Chief Pete Alvarez of the Corpus
Christi police .
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baughman, director of operations for FEMA, said Sunday
that rescue and response teams were clustered at a staging area at
Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, awaiting the end of the storm.
Baughman said officials were gathering generators, bottled water,
ice, blankets and cots to distribute to storm victims. Witt said
that the American Red Cross had opened 14 shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had initially tracked toward the northern coast of
Mexico, then shifted northward toward Brownsville before finally
taking aim at Corpus Christi. But late in the day, Bret shifted
course to the west, steering at rural Kenedy and Kleberg Counties,
raising hopes for less property damage and a diminished threat to
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want anybody to get hit,'' said Juan
Ortiz, deputy emergency management director in Corpus Christi.
``But for us, it's a positive thing. It has been a very
unpredictable storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rafael Cuellar Jr. of Kenedy County said his county had
not issued an evacuation order and that the county's 1,000
residents were seeking refuge in three emergency shelters. He said
that the large number of oak trees in the county had slowed past
hurricanes. His wife, Anita, had refused to leave. ``She doesn't
want to leave the little dogs,'' Sheriff Cuellar, 60, said of their
two pets.
</P>
<P>
   In Kleberg County, home of the King Ranch, perhaps the most
famous ranch in Texas, Marcos Perez, the chief sheriff's deputy,
said officers were canvassing the county, making checks on people
who had chosen to stay. Officers planned to check back after the
storm to make certain that those who remained were safe. In
Kingsville, the county seat, city officials ordered the 25,000
residents to evacuate or seek emergency shelter. At the King Ranch
itself, the ranch hands huddled in a central location and prepared
for storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just boarding everything up,'' said Wade Roberts, of the
King Ranch security staff.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Cameron County and Brownsville, County Judge
Gilberto Hinojosa said ``at least a couple of thousand people'' had
flocked to local shelters in a county of 360,000 people. On
Saturday, when weather officials had predicted that Brownsville
would take a direct hit, Hinojosa said county workers drove buses
to low-lying areas to evacuate residents, most of whom refused to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression there is a lot of complacency,'' he said.
``People didn't think it was going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moss, the state emergency management official, noted that
this weekend marked the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Andrew.
The most violent recent storm to his Corpus Christi was Celia,
which lashed the coast on Aug. 3, 1970, killing 11 people, causing
tens of millions of dollars in damages and flooding much of the
city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that two other storms are also forming that could
potentially threaten the East Coast of the United States. ``This
season has just really truly started.''

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PICCOTTS END, England _ With fields of shin-high wheat, a carpet
of white daisies, wild clover underfoot, lazy oaks overhead, Bob
Fiddaman's farm at the end of a winding lane bordered with
hedgerows provides an unlikely political battleground.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what it has become since Fiddaman offered to devote
some of his land to test planting of seed crops that have been
genetically modified _ GM in the shorthand of the battle-hardened.
</P>
<P>
   He and three other farmers whose willingness to take part in the
government-run trials was made public the week before last have
been targeted by protesters who have already invaded other such
plantings, trampling and ripping up roots in fields of oil-seed
rape and maize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite likely there will be some sort of direct action
against the crops at some point,'' said Andrew Wood of the protest
group Genetic Snowball. ``The public has made it clear they don't
want GM crops, and there is no need for these tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' acts of destruction, while illegal and extreme,
are an expression of the widespread opposition to the introduction
of genetically modified crops in Europe and particularly in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic modification of food has been a relatively unquestioned
phenomenon in the United States and Canada, with altered
ingredients in a range of processed food from soft drinks to beer
to breakfast cereals. It is also common in animal feeds and soya,
corn and cotton seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But its arrival here has set off alarms and united demonstrators
from lapsed causes in a powerful protest movement against what they
call ``Frankenstein food'' and the large multinational companies
promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no government agency in Europe with the regulatory
rigor of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to build consumer
confidence, and government approval can arouse suspicion as much as
it can provide reassurance. This is nowhere more evident than in
Britain, where the public is sensitized by the outbreak of mad cow
disease in 1996 and the government's tardy conclusion that it was
something that could harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain
that don't apply elsewhere,'' Fiddaman said, ``the fact that we are
an island, the fact that agriculture is not spread out across broad
spaces but is close to inhabited areas, and the whole tradition
here of wanting to keep land pure and unspoiled even by
conventional agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   A new MORI poll says 79 percent of the British public think that
farmland genetically modified crop testing of the kind Fiddaman has
agreed to should be stopped. Major food manufacturers, supermarkets
and fast-food chains have already announced the removal of all
genetically modified ingredients from their products sold in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, though on record as
being in favor of genetically modified foods, has been forced by
political pressure to impose a set of largely unenforceable
regulations on food outlets, demanding that they identify on menus
items that may have traces of genetically modified soya or wheat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central tenets of Blair's self-described
``modernizing'' program is the determination to see Britain become
a country in the forefront of technological innovation, and he has
been caught out by the furor over genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   The British press has seen the issue as one for crusading
journalism, and the scare headlines and wide publicity given to
selected scientific studies alleging danger prompted Blair to
accuse newspapers and broadcasters of fomenting ``hysteria'' and
``skewing'' coverage away from the more numerous studies finding no
fault with genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a moment where the Blair government's vaunted
ability to capture the public mood has failed it, in the process
reinforcing some underlying concerns about the otherwise popular
government _ that it is cocky, beholden to big business and
subservient to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of scientifically altered food is the subject of a
growing political dispute between Europe and the United States.
Last month, Washington imposed tariffs on food imported from
members of the European Union after the Europeans banned the
importation of American hormone-treated beef. The World Trade
Organization has declared the European ban unjustified because
there is no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef is
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, the American food company behind much of the
genetically modified food in Britain, has seen a large public
relations program aimed at halting its demonization by the British
public have just the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic modification at issue is a way of adding genes that
confer resistance to insect, fungal and viral pests to plants that
might otherwise die or require heavy doses of pesticides. It can
also, as in the case of Fiddaman's crops, foster
herbicide-resistance, meaning that weeds can be killed with a
single spray that leaves the crops standing.
</P>
<P>
   Objections to genetically modified food rest on the broad claims
that genetic manipulation is an act against nature, that the food
it produces is dangerous and that its cultivation damages the
environment. There is scant scientific evidence to support any of
these conclusions, and farmers like Fiddaman argue that only field
tests, the procedure the protesters seek to halt, can come up with
rational answers to people's worries.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters who have destroyed test sites say letting them
proceed would allow the escape of transplanted genes from crops to
related wild species and contaminate the environment. Recent
laboratory studies at Cornell University showing that monarch
butterflies were stunted and killed by eating pollen from
genetically modified corn received enormous attention here.

</P>
<P>
   The first case to arouse concern was a study conducted by Dr.
Arpad Pusztai, a 69-year-old scientist with the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, who told a BBC television
documentary last August that the British public was being used as
``guinea pigs'' for the testing of genetically modified food. He
said he based his conclusion on tests he had conducted in which
rats that were fed genetically altered potatoes experienced stunted
organ and brain growth and breakdowns in their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was immediately dismissed by Rowett, where he had worked for
36 years, and he was criticized by fellow scientists for going
public with tests that had not gone through the standard procedures
of peer review and publication.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert May, a noted biologist who is the government's chief
scientist, called Pusztai's research ``garbage.'' The Royal
Society, Britain's senior scientific academy, examined the study
and said it was ``flawed in many aspects of design, execution and
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The scare has mobilized a late-arriving consumer movement in
Britain and galvanized people with broad anti-establishment
concerns beyond food safety, ranging from anger at the growing
industrialization and corporate control of British agriculture to
opposition to the construction of new highways in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   They have received the backing of Prince Charles, a passionate
organic farmer, who scheduled a meeting with Pusztai, expressed
sympathy for his findings and decried the reaction of other
scientists to his study.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddaman, 54, has been farming the same land since 1971. He
pointed past a tractor and a tool shed to the field where he is
about to start planting genetically modified winter oil-seed rape.
``The protesters say they believe these crops may be dangerous, but
they refuse to let us go forward with the testing to see if they
are right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am wrong, I'll have to accept that,'' he said, ``but I
wouldn't be offering the fields if I thought it was going to
produce contamination.'' The owners of adjacent fields have backed
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds come from AgrEvo, a German joint venture of Hoechst AG
and Schering AG. They give the plants a tolerance for a herbicide
that kills all the weeds around them, thereby allowing Fiddaman to
reduce the amount of pesticides he will be spraying. Promoters of
genetically modified food argue that in this way their produce
actually benefits the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will be visiting unannounced throughout the yearlong
process, and their findings will go to the government agencies that
are judging the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been caught by surprise in past attacks, which
were often conducted at night by people in full-body
anti-contamination suits and goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty people, including Lord Peter Melchett, 51, the executive
director of Greenpeace U.K., were arrested in Norfolk last month
after they destroyed a field of crops. Melchett described the act
as one of ``decontamination'' and said his organization was
dedicated to ending ``the whole program of commercialization of GM
pollution disguised as science.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the field, William Brigham, 59, said: ``This has
nothing to do with genetically modified organisms. It's whether we
want democratic government in this country, or anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The local police have promised Fiddaman a quick response if he
calls with reports of trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's not much I can do,'' he said, ``The fields are
only protected by hedgerows. I don't mind their opposing the tests,
but I find their vandalism abhorrent. If they want to come and
stand over there with protest flags, I don't mind. But they
shouldn't trash the land.''

BUSH DECLARES 7 COUNTIES DISASTER AREAS, SEEKS FEDERAL DECLARATION
</HEADLINE>

By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hours before Hurricane Bret slapped the South
Texas coast, Gov. George W. Bush declared seven counties disaster
areas and called on President Clinton to issue an ``expedited
presidential disaster declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disaster comes like a thief in the night sometimes,'' Bush
said. ``Our hopes are that this storm, as ferocious as it may seem,
will not affect human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the news media were given an update on the state's
preparedness at the emergency command center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,600 troops from the Texas National Guard were on
standby near San Antonio, and all available state troopers were
helping evacuate people and coordinate emergency activities,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, swift water response teams and search-and-rescue
personnel gathered at the Alamodome in San Antonio in anticipation
of the storm's landfall. Also on standby were 10 Blackhawk
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said some 15,000 people were likely to seek public
shelter, and thousands more were expected to evacuate to hotels or
to the homes of friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always best to be prepared for the worst and hope for the
best,'' Bush said. ``Now it's just a matter of waiting.'' Bush's
disaster declaration covers the seven counties from the southern
tip of Texas to just north of Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, scheduled to take his presidential campaign back
on the road Wednesday, is tentatively set to tour south Texas on
Tuesday, an aide said. It is too early to tell if Bret will alter
Bush's campaign schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bracing for strong winds, officials prepared for heavy
flooding, particularly along the Rio Grande and Nueces rivers. Ken
Graham, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said
Bret could dump in excess of 20 inches near Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the storm, which is ``very tight and compact,'' will
not likely bring rain much farther north than Austin.

 &HT;    Maddux has chipped bone
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Braves' fans thought this pennant race was
nerve-racking enough, they were sadly mistaken because now there's
Greg Maddux to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who's won six starts in a
row to carry the Braves since the All-Star break, has a bone chip
in his right wrist, a splint on his arm and questions about his
future, both immediate and longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux injured the wrist on his pitching hand diving for a foul
pop against the Padres during his start on Saturday. Maddux pitched
the rest of that inning and another in Saturday's 6-2 victory over
the Padres, his 16th of the season, but by the end of the game it
was bothering him significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to pitch today, no chance,'' Maddux said Sunday.
``But I'm not going to worry about it until three or four days down
the road. We'll decide Wednesday, see what Bobby (Cox) wants to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   With an off day on Thursday, the Braves could come back with
Terry Mulholland on Friday on his normal four days' rest and go
back through the rotation. That would give Maddux nine days before
he would be up for his next start on Aug. 31 in Cincinnati. But he
could need longer.
</P>
<P>
   Given the significant season-ending injuries the Braves have had
to endure already _ what with the loss of Andres Galarraga
(lymphoma) and Kerry Ligtenberg (elbow) in the spring and Javy
Lopez (knee) and Odalis Perez (elbow) last month _ the Braves are
getting used to bracing themselves for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a huge factor if he is out for the year,'' Cox
said. ``But we can cover it. If we had to we might be able to go
the rest of the year (with a four_man rotation). If not, we've
still got (Bruce) Chen.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has not missed a start since April of 1997 when he missed
one start with a strained hamstring. He's never been on the
disabled list in his 13-year career in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The costly play came on an aggressive attempt by the Gold Glove
pitcher to snare a John Vander Wal popup on the track in front of
the visitors dugout at Turner Field. He got a piece of it, as did
Chipper Jones, before making a final and diving attempt to get it
and failing and he landed front-first on the ground, using his
right hand to brace his fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sliding into a base and kind of jamming your
wrist,'' Maddux said. ``That's what I thought I did. It's kind of
like when you roll your ankle playing basketball. I knew I did
something. I'm like `I'm going to try to pitch' and you wake up
(the next day) and it's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of injury that would require a cast or
immediate surgery, though Maddux might have to get the chip cleaned
out of his wrist in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's six wins since the All-Star break are one fewer than
the seven wins by the rest of the Braves starting rotation. After a
miserable May, Maddux has rebounded to have the same number of wins
as he did this point last season. Is he asking `Why now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Maddux said. ``This game has been real good to me. I'm
not going to question one thing that goes bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Said teammate Gerald Williams: ``I don't think we dwell on the
things we can't control. I know I don't. Certainly this game is not
based on playing 100 percent in terms of health. Sometimes you've
got to play hurt, sometimes you've got to play banged up and I'm
pretty sure Greg is going to pitch.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ By early evening, there was already a crush of young
professionals, families and couples lined up to eat at Arkady
Novikov's newest restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   For 130 rubles a plate (slightly over $5), Novikov was offering
an Oriental buffet of stir-fried vegetables, topped with a mound of
sliced meat. Festooned with colorful banners and other trappings
from the East, the restaurant has been a huge hit since it opened
near Pushkin Square a month ago. For a time, it had looked as if
the financial crisis that struck Russia last August would sound the
death knell for restaurants like Yolki-Palki, Novikov's chain of
Moscow eateries aimed squarely at the small but emerging middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   The plunging ruble was sending costs through the roof and
scaring away customers. Novikov's restaurants, established to serve
cheap food to the middle class, would soon be serving expensive
food to the poor, the 37-year-old restaurateur said glumly at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   One year and several prime ministers later, Novikov has
weathered the storm. By substituting home-grown produce for
imported ingredients and trimming his staff, he has managed to hold
down prices. Instead of collapsing, Yolki-Palki has even managed to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble dealt a heavy blow to the nation.
Russia's economic reformers were discredited. The capital's
fledgling financial sector was hit by massive layoffs. The
purchasing power of Russian consumers dwindled. And the ranks of
the poor swelled.
</P>
<P>
   But by using the particularly Russian talent of adapting to
seemingly any hardship, many people have managed to cling to
vestiges of their lives before the crisis. Some Russian enterprises
have even prospered, with the weakened ruble protecting them from
competition from foreign-produced goods, both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has made a cynical public even more distrustful of
the government and its seemingly endless promises of economic
reform. But a strange mixture of self-reliance, humor and weary
resignation have kept a nation famous for revolutions from falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians lost confidence in their country's future a year ago,
and they still have no faith in the government,'' Yevgeny Yasin, a
former economics minister under President Boris Yeltsin, wrote in
Moscow News. ``They also have more self-reliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the crisis, the basic precepts of the Russian economy
were very different. Russia's leading politicians and the
International Monetary Fund cast the ruble as a pillar of political
stability.
</P>
<P>
   A free-falling currency, one Clinton administration official
warned ominously before the devaluation, might even lead to
``Indonesia with nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Aug. 17, 1998, a dark day that Russians refer to
grimly, the way Americans might think of the 1929 stock market
crash, when the Yeltsin government announced it would no longer try
to prop up the ruble. A wave of panic swept the capital as the
ruble begin to slide from its exchange rate of 6 rubles to a dollar
to a rate of 20 to a dollar and even more.
</P>
<P>
   Russians raced to retrieve their savings from the nation's
poorly regulated banks, only to find that the banks had shut their
doors. Shop shelves were picked clean as consumers frantically
bought foreign televisions and old Soviet-era staples like salt and
toilet paper, fearing a return to the shortages of old.
</P>
<P>
   The rich were humbled but still managed to hang on to their
place at the top. Virtually none of the nation's oligarchs _ the
tycoons who dominate the economy and politics _ were displaced.
</P>
<P>
   For the poorest, life was so hard before the devaluation that
many barely noticed the crisis. None of them had credit cards, and
they lived off the potatoes and vegetables from their modest
kitchen gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic effects were felt by those in between: the
small middle class and the large number of working poor. As
unemployment rose and employers sought to cut costs by slashing
wages, millions of Russians slid from a threadbare existence into
absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 33 million people _ 22 percent of the population _
had incomes below $6 a month, the official poverty level, according
to the Russian government. Now 55 million people _ 37 percent of
the population _ live in poverty, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences were also huge. Sergei Kiriyenko, the
pro-free market prime minister, was ousted. Yevgeny Primakov, a
former Soviet official, was installed in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's approval ratings rose after he declared that he
lacked a master plan to pull the economy out of its crisis; the
public had become so mistrustful of the government that it
preferred inaction to bold new policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one I know expects anything from the government or any
other authorities,'' said Tatyana Tolstaya, one of Russia's most
trenchant writers. ``People try to survive without the government
as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving has not been easy, particularly in the far-flung ruins
of the Soviet state, where electricity and hot water are often a
luxury. And even in better-off cities like Moscow, the rising costs
of gas and food have prompted concerns about a return of inflation.
But for many Russians, the hardship may remain but the sense of
panic has gone.
</P>
<P>
   Eya Motskobili, a 37-year-old journalist at Kommersant, one of
Russia's leading financial newspapers, typifies the stoicism of
many middle-class Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Her monthly salary was slashed from more than $1,500 a month to
$250. Long years of toil went for naught when her bank refused to
return $8,000 in savings. And it became harder for Ms. Motskobili
to find the imported medicine that her mother needs to battle
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just beginning to feel like we were living in a
European country, so what happened was a real blow,'' she said
bluntly but without bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back on vacations, shopping at secondhand clothing
stores and buying food at wholesale markets, however, she has
managed to cope.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not an isolated story. Russian television recently
highlighted a former business manager who pumps gas for a living.
He was depicted not as a failure but as a hardy and philosophic
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class _ a group whose family incomes may have been
$1,000 a month or more before the crisis, and who became accustomed
to Western appliances and vacations abroad _ may have only a
fraction of the money it had a year ago. But it still has
middle-class values and has struggled hard to preserve what it
could of life before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   New Zhigulis, the boxy Russian automobiles, have displaced
foreign cars as prestige automobiles. Hotels at the Russian Black
Sea resort of Sochi have served record numbers of guests as
Russians have cut back on more expensive vacations in Spain and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the Internet has also soared as Russians look for the
latest financial news and for an escape.
</P>
<P>
   Having regained some confidence, some people are able to joke
about the crisis, and one of the most popular Web sites is a
collection of black humor about the debacle by Artemy Lebedev, a
leading graphic artist (http://www.tema.ru/roboty).
</P>
<P>
   ``I never miss a chance to take on a subject, but the idea was
to make people think that the crisis was not the end of the
world,'' Lebedev said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lebedev's parodies shows the ``consumer market basket''
after the crisis. It is an empty basketball net.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls also indicate that many Russians have
regained their equilibrium, shaky as it was.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the August 1998 crash, 60 percent were pessimistic
about Russia's future, according to the VTSIOM polling
organization. Now the percentage of pessimists has dropped to 54
percent, about the level before the crisis, returning Russia to its
unusual version of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The August crisis was a great economic shock, but the
psychological shock was even stronger,'' said Yuri Levada of
VTSIOM. ``But after several months the country began to calm
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russians have honed their survival skills and the government
has dithered over its economic strategy, some of the nation's
industries have begun to revive on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening ruble has raised the price of imported goods,
protecting domestic producers of cars, sausages and yogurt from
foreign competition. The currency devaluation has also made Russian
commodities more attractive for foreign buyers, helping exports
like timber and steel.
</P>
<P>
   The petroleum industry received a badly needed lift as the price
of oil rose. Falling oil prices were one factor that worsened the
effects of last year's economic crash.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, production of many consumer goods is down because
the average Russian has less money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Kazmina, a 72-year-old pensioner, knows that trend
well. She sells romance novels and calendars outside of her Moscow
apartment house to supplement her monthly pension of 500 rubles,
which was worth nearly $100 before the crisis but is now worth only
$20.
</P>
<P>
   These days, her customers are far more careful in parting with
their rubles than they used to be. And on one balmy day last week,
she had trouble making a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically everything we had this morning we still have,''
she said. ``I wouldn't say life has become that much worse, but
it's become more complicated. People spend more money on food and
on what they absolutely need to buy. So they have less money to
spend for this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Yolki-Palki chain, Novikov has worked hard to to cut
costs and keep his clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Novikov, who studied cooking at a Soviet institute as a young
man and was once rejected for a job at McDonald's after that
fast-food chain began to penetrate the Russian market, is an
energetic businessmen. He pioneered a series of expensive theme
restaurants before starting the mid-priced Yolki-Palki chain two
and half years ago. But Yolki-Palki was threatened by the crisis.
As with many restaurants at the time, most of its food came from
foreign suppliers. Now almost 90 percent is produced in Russia, a
major cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effects of the crisis have lingered. Because he has
held prices down and some customers have drifted away, Novikov
estimates that revenue is down about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are down. But at least there are profits, enough that
Novikov has expanded the chain to nine restaurants. His enthusiasm
for business, however, is tempered by uncertainty over the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to be prepared for anything in this country,''
he said. ``And you have to learn to rely on yourself.''

PARK GETS WIN BUT NOT BEFORE ALMOST OVERHEATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ On a team which so often plays without fire and
urgency, it seems bizarre that a player can have so much trouble
because he's too emotional. That's what manager Davey Johnson said
about Chan Ho Park, and the right-hander concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Park won for the first time in more than a month Sunday, but it
wasn't without a harrowing inning in which Philadelphia nearly
rallied from a four-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to sometimes try to do too much or overthrow,''
Johnson said. ``Good hitters come up and he tries to throw it 95
mph instead of hitting his spots and just throwing. Then he fights
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The bout ensued in the fifth of the Dodgers' 9-7 win. Park
prevailed but only after a pair of two-out walks and three
consecutive RBI singles pulled the Phillies within 5-4. Park (7-10)
got out of the jam and finished allowing four runs on six hits with
six walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to throw hard to make myself pitch
aggressively,'' Park said. ``Maybe I was too scared about the power
hitters to throw it down the middle because the last two days these
guys hit good, so how can I throw it down the middle? I have to
have more faith in my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Only left, not right: For the remaining 38 games Todd Hundley
will hit exclusively left-handed. But before the Dodgers catcher
stops switch-hitting for good, manager Davey Johnson would like
Hundley to rethink the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hate to see a kid quit switch-hitting,'' Johnson
said. ``I would like him to start with that again (hitting
right-handed) and work on it during the winter and see how he feels
going into the spring. You can always reverse it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley stopped switch-hitting a week ago and is 1 for 3 as a
lefty against left-handers. The one hit is a pinch-hit, three-run
double in Saturday's loss against Phillies lefty Scott Aldred. The
three RBI were one more than he had in 40 at-bats from the right
side this season.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstructive elbow surgery that knocked out Hundley for
most of 1998 and rendered him ineffective for the first two months
this season also cost him the opportunity to work on hitting from
his unnatural right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hundley) kind of reminds me of HoJo (former Met Howard
Johnson),'' Davey Johnson said. ``A real pretty swing from the left
side, short and choppy from the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Arnold down, Herges up: After the game, the Dodgers sent
right-hander Jamie Arnold to Triple-A Albuquerque and recalled
right-hander Matt Herges, who was sent down 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was 2-3 with a 4.91 ERA, but his stay in the minors isn't
expected to last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get Arnold a couple of starts and then bring him back,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The quick stint should have Arnold back when rosters expand
Sept. 1, and stretching out his arm will allow the Dodgers to start
him, if they choose, next month.
</P>
<P>
   __ In summation: Jose Vizcaino started at third in place of
Adrian Beltre, who sat out with a swollen ankle and is listed as
day-to-day. . . . A sign of what Johnson wants to accomplish with
lefty-hitting Todd Hollandsworth was on display. Despite lefty
Anthony Shumaker starting for the Phillies, Hollandsworth played
center field. He singled in his only at-bat against Shumaker, who
left after taking a Gary Sheffield line drive off his left hand in
the second inning.

IMF MAY SEEK WIDER INDONESIA INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The International Monetary Fund is reported to have
asked Indonesia to add its central bank to an investigation of bank
deals linked to President B.J. Habibie's governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The request would presumably widen a bank scandal has threatened
to undermine the fund's $42.3-billion bailout of the Indonesian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsigned letter dated Aug. 17 that has been widely
circulated to news organizations, the IMF's first deputy managing
director, Stanley Fischer, asked Indonesia's coordinating minister
for the economy, finance and industry to include the central bank
in an audit of payments involving Bank Bali, Indonesia's
government-appointed bank restructuring agency and a company with
links to Habibie's political party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy revolves around a fee of 550 billion rupiah ($78
million) that Bank Bali paid a company controlled by the deputy
treasurer of the ruling party to recover loans from a bank that the
restructuring agency had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians contend that the money went to Habibie's
campaign for election in November. A special committee of
Parliament is investigating the bank deals.
</P>
<P>
   An IMF spokesman declined to confirm the authenticity of the
letter or the request.

POSADA IS A SINGLE SHORT OF A CYCLE AS YANKS DOWN TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Coping with his horrible performance in the first
half of this season, Yankees catcher Jorge Posada trained himself
to focus solely on the challenges directly before him _ the next
inning, the next at-bat. Don't think about the past, don't think
too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   When Posada slammed a home run in his first at-bat Sunday and a
triple two innings later, however, he dreamed about the cycle _ a
single, double, triple and home run, baseball's version of a
straight flush _ as he stood on third base. Posada ended the day
just a single short of the cycle, but he and his teammates did
muster some badly needed offense while edging the Twins, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez pitched seven innings against an unusual
Minnesota lineup to become the Yankees' first 14-game winner this
season. The Yankees collected 13 hits, their most since Aug. 13;
they had reached double figures in hits just once since pounding
out 22 against the Twins nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were unusually subdued in their 6-1 loss to the
Twins and pitcher Eric Milton Saturday, some of them appearing
discouraged as they went through their at-bats in the later
innings, Shane Spencer and Scott Brosius in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis mentioned to some of the others that maybe they
didn't really have a good game plan against Milton and that maybe
they weren't as prepared as they should have been. ``If we don't
start scoring some runs, Texas is going to whip our butts,'' said
one player, looking ahead to the series against the Rangers that
begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed to be going badly for the Yankees at the
outset Sunday. Derek Jeter was thrown out at home plate in the
first inning, Minnesota's Joe Mays struck out four of the first
seven batters he faced, and the Yankees were grumbling about the
massive strike zone of Bill Miller, the plate umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs into the second inning, however, Posada drove a slider
into the upper deck in right, 407 feet away, and paused a moment to
watch the flight of the ball before rounding the bases with his
first home run in 46 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied 1-1 and the Yankees had a runner at first
when Posada batted in the fourth. He laced a line drive to center,
where Jacque Jones charged the ball on the artificial surface, only
to have it skip over his head and roll away. Posada pulled into
third with a run-scoring triple and began thinking of the cycle.
``For me to get a triple,'' Posada said later, ``about six guys
have to fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycles are less common than no-hitters, even more so for
catchers; Boston's Rich Gedman was the last catcher to hit for the
cycle, against Toronto on Sept. 18, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Posada hit the ball down the left-field
line for a run-scoring double, and right away, he began to think
about how difficult it would be to maintain his concentration and
get the last hit. The Yankees led 5-1 after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' lineup comprised players who batted left-handed
against Hernandez _ the first time Hernandez had ever seen that, he
said later. It was an attempt to exploit Hernandez's relative
weakness against lefties: Going into Sunday's game, right-handed
batters were hitting .196 against El Duque, left-handers .266.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's best weapon for retiring right-handed batters _ his
sidearm slider _ is largely ineffective against left-handers, and
Sunday, Hernandez had to find some other method.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez threw a lot of curveballs with his first pitch, to
about a third of the batters he faced, and then mixed fastballs and
changeups and largely shut down the Twins, who had two hits in the
first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees still had a four-run lead with two outs in the
seventh when the Twins' Javier Valentin singled. Cristian Guzman
swung and missed for the third strike, but the ball bounced past
Posada and Guzman reached first to keep the inning alive.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jones doubled and two runs scored, marring Hernandez's
pitching line: three runs (two earned) on four hits and three walks
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Posada's fourth at-bat, in the eighth, Luis Sojo
suggested that he bunt for the single, and Posada ``really
thought'' about that option. But he took a first-pitch fastball
right down the middle from Hector Carrasco _ ``He should've hacked
at that,'' Davis would say, wistfully _ before swinging weakly at a
pitch high and outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely trying to get a single,'' said manager Joe
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Posada took a called third strike, however, walking slowly away
from home plate while staring downward. Reporters informed him
after the game that the last and only Yankees catcher to hit for a
cycle was Buddy Rosar, in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, that just stinks,'' said Posada, rolling his head in
frustration.

 &HT;    Pennant race elicits yawns
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since their last game against the Braves on May 2, the
Reds have been out of sight, out of mind, but not out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Cincinnati arrives for a three-game series starting
today, there was no Reds-baiting in the Braves clubhouse. Chipper
Jones would rather focus his pennant-race thoughts on the New York
Mets in the NL East _ who are sticking to the Braves like gum on
the bottoms of their shoes _ instead of this possible rival for the
wild-card slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be big ... later on in the summer,'' the Braves third
baseman said, ``but right now we're just concentrating on winning
two out of three and staying within striking distance of the
Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a half-game lead in the NL East while Houston
leads Cincinnati by a half-game in the NL Central. Arizona is a
lock in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no extra excitement,'' said Brian Jordan, who had the
winning hit in the ninth inning Sunday in a 3-2 win over the
Padres, the 23rd time this season the Braves have won in their
final at-bat. ``Every game is a big game now. We want to win, and
you got Houston and Cincinnati and the Mets and Atlanta right
there. Somebody's going to be a wild card team, somebody's going to
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there hasn't been excessive excitement at the ticket
windows, either. Through Thursday, the most recent figures
available, the Braves had sold 28,806 for Monday's game, 35,587 for
Tuesday and 28,469 for Wednesday. Compare that to the Houston
series Aug. 9-11, when the attendance figures were 40,072, 38,303
and 39,578, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Have Braves fans taken October play for granted?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably spoiled a little bit,'' acknowledged Roy
Young, a fan who makes the trip from Tallahassee, Fla., as often as
possible. ``They just expect them to win, but they're in a
dogfight. ... I think the players are starting to feel the pressure
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, oung made his comments with the score tied in the
eighth inning, before the Braves won their 23rd game on their final
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue to win games in dramatic fashion,'' Jones
said. ``Hopefully we'll get some good pitching performances and
throw some offense on them and have a breather. I don't see that
happening, but surely we're going to have to keep our eye on the
scoreboard and stick to what's been successful the last little
while.''

KNOBLAUCH ONLY LAUGHS AT THE BOOS FROM HIS FORMER FANS

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Chuck Knoblauch passed Yankees Manager Joe Torre
in the dugout the other day, and Torre loudly imitated the
Metrodome announcer calling the second baseman's name: ``Chuuuuck
Knaaaaablock.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with a bellowing voice, Torre added the fan reaction to
Knoblauch's name here: ``Booooooo.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch laughed a bit, and nodding, he said, ``Yeah, they love
me here.''
</P>
<P>
   He played seven years with the Twins before forcing a trade that
brought him to the Yankees last year, and Knoblauch probably will
be booed here for the rest of his career. In 1998, he seemed
uncomfortable while playing as a target of the fans' wrath.
</P>
<P>
   But his teammates have noticed this year that Knoblauch has
grown comfortable with the situation and is even thriving on it. In
the three-game series this weekend, Knoblauch went 5 for 12 and
scored three runs, hearing boos in response.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the villain apparently appeals to Knoblauch. ``It's
all right with me,'' he said, shrugging. ``I always liked playing
in this park when I was here _ it's a pretty good place to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, booed by fans in Oakland since being traded to
the Yankees before last season, could relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get used to it and know it's coming, you just kind of
make light of it,'' Brosius said. ``They're watching somebody in a
position they would want to be in _ playing on a winning team. It
kind of cracks me up when I hear it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORRE LOOKS TO OCTOBER
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre does not enjoy the interleague play with the
Mets during the regular season, but he would be thrilled by a
subway World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it happens because that means we're in it,'' Torre
said. ``That's the whole key to this thing. Sure, I'd pull my hair
out, but if that means we're in it, that's fine with me. I'm not
choosy on who we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre grew up a New York Giants fan and was accustomed to seeing
them or the Brooklyn Dodgers meeting the Yankees in the World
Series. A Yankees-Mets World Series, Torre thinks, would draw
greater attention than Subway Series of the past ``because
baseball's bigger. It's more than a sport now.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Better luck vs. Hitchcock

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves might take extra satisfaction from their
three-game sweep of the Padres this weekend because Sterling
Hitchcock didn't get the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was pitching at Turner Field Sunday for the first time
since beating the Braves in the clinching game of last year's NL
Championship Series _ his second win of the series.
</P>
<P>
   He also pitched eight shutout innings against them in a Padres
win May 9 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Braves reached him for two runs in six innings,
although he struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an improvement,'' said Braves hitting coach Don Baylor.
``He's dominated us.''Jordan check
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan will visit a hand specialist today to see if
anything more can be done for his ailing right hand that was hit by
a Mike Thurman pitch on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   One solution may be another cortisone shot, but Jordan would
prefer not to because it would mean missing at least three to five
days with no guarantees of any loss of pain. He's had two shots in
the hand already and neither was effective.

 &HT;    Reds return to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time the Cincinnati Reds dropped their
equipment bags in Atlanta, the Braves filled them up with losses
and there were heads hanging lower than Tom Dooley's.
</P>
<P>
   3-0, 5-1, 5-3. . .all Atlanta victories, thanks for coming, and
watch traffic on I-85 on your way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   It was late April. The Reds were 9-11 when they hit Atlanta,
9-14 when they left. Against John Smoltz, Kevin Millwood and Odalis
Perez the Reds hit .109 over three games (10-92) and batted .100
with runners in scoring position, of which there were few.
</P>
<P>
   Reds' left fielder Greg Vaughn sensed it was a defining point
early in the season. With a flameout of that magnitude, it would be
easy to quit and say, ``We aren't even close to being
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   So Vaughn locked the clubhouse doors after the third defeat and
delivered a message to an all-ears team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it, it's all right, we'll get them tomorrow, keep your
heads up,'' Vaughn told them. It was not a chew-out session, it was
a positive re-enforcement message. ``Our intensity wasn't there and
I thought that needed to be brought up . . . and it was. I didn't
have the feeling they thought they could win every game we play.
And that's the only way to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe coincidence, maybe not. Since that day, the Reds are 64-35
as they gas up The Big Road Machine for a return three-game
engagement in Atlanta, beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't the same club they saw the last time,'' manager Jack
McKeon said. ``They beat Steve Avery, Pete Harnisch and Denny
Neagle. This time they're getting Brett Tomko, a better Pete
Harnisch (8-0 in his last 12 starts) and a much better Denny
Neagle.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden nearly puts the three games on the
same shelf with Armageddon when he said, ``This is our chance to
show we can play with
</P>
<P>
   those guys. They are the only team we haven't been able to play
with this year. It is the most important series of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Aaron Boone talks often with his brother Bret
Boone, Atlanta's second baseman, and Aaron senses Atlanta
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is happy for me and happy for our success, but I can tell
from his voice inflections that he thinks we are lucky or something
and we're not for real,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn didn't face Smoltz in Game One the last Braves series,
but was 0 for 6 with two walks and two runs (half the runs the Reds
scored in the three games) in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Atlanta will see a different Cincinnati team this week,
Vaughn said, ``I hope they just see who we are. We don't have to
prove anything to Atlanta. When you put on this uniform, you don't
have to prove anything to the other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You prove things to yourself _ can I stay in focus and can I
keep from cheating myself. That's all you can control. If you don't
do your best, you're not cheating the Atlanta Braves, you're
cheating yourself and the Cincinnati Reds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Come Wednesday, after Game Three of the series, Vaughn doesn't
expect to lock any clubhouse doors to deliver any inspirational
messages.

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SEVILLE, Spain _ Space is starting to get tight in the trophy case
at Marion Jones' house.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night after husband C.J. Hunter took a surprising gold medal
in the shot put, Jones took the first step in what is hoped to be a
glittering haul of her own by winning the women's 100 meters at the
World Track and Field Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was never threatened in the race, and her winning time of
10.70 seconds was the fastest in the world this year as she easily
beat out American teammate Inger Miller and Ekaterini Thanou of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off an emotional victory with C.J. last night and
coming in to get this win tonight, well, I'm extremely excited,''
Jones said. ``The goal for this whole week is to get five gold
medals for the family, and we started off in a wonderful fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the expected beginning to Jones' busy week as she will
also go for gold in the 200, the long jump and either the 4x100 or
4x400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   The long-jump finals are next up tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But first things first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was taking care of business in an event Jones has
dominated for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller may have lost whatever upset chance she had by
false-starting in the finals. Jones got away clean and fast and had
a lock on the race by the 30-meter mark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all of the advance hype surrounding her bid for four
golds here and five next summer in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,
there was pressure to start off right.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when Jones crossed the finish line, she pumped a fist into
the air, lifted both arms over her head and looked up into the
stands to find Hunter, who was cheering from a spot in the press
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right! That's right!'' Hunter shouted as his wife sped
through the last few meters and then took a joyous victory lap
around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I crossed the line and saw C.J., that was a very moving
moment for me,'' Jones said. ``This is not exactly the same feeling
as two years ago in Athens. That was my first gold medal at the
World Championships, and that made it special. This is a different
kind of satisfaction, knowing that I expected to win here and then
I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only real threat to Jones at all through the four
rounds of the 100 was Jones herself. She made a false start in
Saturday's second round and then another in Sunday's semifinals,
forcing her to sit back in the blocks in fear of disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night and again tonight in the semifinals, I seemed to
have trouble hearing the gun,'' Jones said. ``I don't know if it
was crowd noise or what, but that's why I was having trouble with
my starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I nailed my start in the finals. That, perhaps, is the
reason I was able to pull off the victory. I knew that Inger was
running extremely fast, and I knew that the woman from Greece was
running extremely fast, so I knew I had to be very ready and on my
toes. I think I executed well today. Before I stepped into the
blocks, what was going through my mind was that I had to execute my
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' 10.70 easily beat the World Championships record of 10.76
that she had set in the second round. In fact, until Miller's
personal best of 10.79 in the finals, Jones was the only woman in
the world to run under 10.81 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that I was not as relaxed as I could have
been tonight,'' she said. ``But I still ran 10.70. So I'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll also take her and Hunter's role as the first family of
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely different kind of feeling between my win
and C.J.'s win last night,'' Jones said. ``That meant so much,
because it was me getting to see my husband accomplish something
that means so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the witness firsthand to all of the days when C.J.
would come home from training hard. This is what I've heard about
him doing every single day since he won the bronze medal in '97. To
see him do it was such an incredible thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this was a start.''

IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO THINK OF NEXT YEAR

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo missed his summer vacation
because of the disabled-parking scandal, and from that frustration
has come a running joke: If UCLA corrals enough oral commitments
this fall, Toledo can take a makeup vacation in December, the
traditional height of recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including Toledo, actually expects the Bruins to fill
their scholarship allotment (approximately 18) before December, but
their seven commitments stand as the highest preseason total of the
Toledo era.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who held a light practice Sunday night, are
concentrating on linemen this fall. Only right guard Mike Saffer
and left tackle Blake Worley remain from 1998's heralded offensive
line class _ Scott Wiegand and Jeff Wright quit, Steve Morgan has
moved to defense _ while defensive linemen are the most-coveted
commodity in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get six or seven linemen, offense and defense,''
recruiting coordinator Gary Bernardi said. ``After the lines, it's
one guy here, one guy there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall recruiting hits high gear Sept. 1, when coaches begin
calling prospects. Here are seven names to watch from UCLA's
most-wanted list:
</P>
<P>
   __ Travis Johnson. A 240-pound defensive end from Notre Dame
High, Johnson is the best pass rusher in the state, a combination
of size and speed normally found on Florida State's roster. He
attended UCLA's scrimmage Saturday and said his finalists are
Michigan, Florida State, Tennessee, Ohio State, USC and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Alex Holmes. A 290-pound tight end from Harvard-Westlake,
Holmes has exhausted his prep eligibility and will spend the fall
comparing UCLA to Michigan, his father's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   __ Manual White. A 220-pound tailback from Valencia, White's
finalists are USC, Ohio State, Arizona State, Washington and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Bruins are pursuing White despite an oral commitment
from Sacramento tailback Albert Hollis, the state's top-rated
runner. Because sophomore DeShaun Foster could bolt for the NFL
after next season, the Bruins want two tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Paul Mociler. A 300-pound offensive lineman from St. John
Bosco, Mociler is as touted as recent UCLA signees Worley, Saffer,
Brian Polak and Shane Lehmann. His final three are UCLA, Cal and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matt Grootegoed. A 200-pound safety considered Mater Dei's
best prospect ever, he's considering UCLA and Michigan, according
to Student Sports Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   __ Willie Dixon. An elite receiver from Sacramento, Dixon has
UCLA, USC, Miami and Florida State on his short list.
</P>
<P>
   __ D.J. Williams. A 225-pound linebacker from powerhouse Concord
De La Salle, Williams is the most-coveted California prospect in
years (any position) and has drawn comparisons to a young Lawrence
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who's pursuing Williams, one college recruiter said, ``The
world.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Local update: Newbury Park tight end Will Svitek has received
scholarship offers from USC, Stanford, Ohio State, Arizona State
and Arizona but not UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bruins) are the only school that hasn't offered and it's
frustrating,'' Svitek said at Saturday's scrimmage. ``They told me
they haven't gotten a good evaluation because we ran a spread
offense last year and I didn't play normal tight end. But this
year, we're changing. The coaches said they'll look at me. I'll
have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming up: UCLA's next commitment could come from Groodegoed,
who's expected to announce before the season, or Carlsbad offensive
lineman Steve Vieira, who's also considering Colorado and
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets' grasp on first place was loosening during
their first game Sunday, with starter Octavio Dotel displaying none
of the poise of someone who nearly had a no-hitter in his last
start, with the Mets' hitters going up and down like express
elevators, and with Mark McGwire hitting his 49th and 50th home
runs and literally knocking the a light out in Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets abandoned their quiet Sunday drive and slammed on
the accelerator in the eighth inning, riding a Mike Piazza's
bases-empty home run and a grand slam by John Olerud to rally from
a 6-1 deficit. Stalling, they fell behind in the top of the ninth
and then _ sending the Shea Stadium crowd into late-September-like
hysteria _ scored two in the ninth inning to beat the Cardinals,
8-7. The victory kept the Mets in a first-place tie _ for a few
hours _ with the Atlanta Braves, who beat the San Diego Padres,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the long doubleheader was over, though, the Mets
(76-49) had fallen a half-game behind the Braves, entering a
three-game series against the Houston Astros, losing the second
game, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, the Mets scored just two runs off Cardinals
starter Garrett Stephenson over seven innings. Orel Hershiser, who
took the loss, allowed just three runs on six hits in seven
innings, and the Mets managed to stay close. But their bullpen
uncharacteristically blew up in the eighth when Billy Taylor and
Chuck McElroy came on and allowed four runs, including a three-run
double by Adam Kennedy that sailed over Matt Franco's head in left
field to give the Cardinals a 7-2 lead. Franco, who hit into a
bases-loaded double play to end the sixth-inning, took the blame
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets almost had another comeback when they scored three runs
in the ninth, led by Piazza's two-out pinch-hit two-run single that
gave him a Mets record, having driven in runs in each of his last
10 games. Still, the Mets were a bit deflated after missing a
chance to sweep the the series following such a spectacular finish
to the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You remember back to the good game but having a loss in the
second game, it takes some of the punch out of the win,'' Olerud
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' reaction to Edgardo Alfonzo's single to left that
drove in Franco for the winning run in the first game illustrated
how breathtaking that game was and how gripping the pennant race
is. Alfonzo had barely touched first base when he was engulfed by a
stream of giddy teammates who sprang from the dugout when his
grounder went through the gap, their bodies bobbing up and down
like buoys, practicing, it seemed, for celebrations they hope to
stage in the final six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can come back from five, why can't you come back from
one?'' Manager Bobby Valentine said, explaining his thoughts going
into the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Valentine exhaled hard like a man exiting a roller coaster.
``Wow,'' he said. ``That was a good game. No, lousy game. Good
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Valentine expressed admiration for the grit of
the rookie Dotel, but by the third pitch of the game _ which
leadoff hitter Joe McEwing launched into the left-field bullpen _
it was clear Dotel had none of the nasty stuff that no-hit the
Padres for six innings.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out J.D. Drew, Dotel yielded, on a 91 mph
fastball, another epic home run for McGwire. That shot, measured at
502 feet, shattered a light bulb in the 16 for Cardinal outfielder
Ray Lankford's number about 60 feet high on the scoreboard in
right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were up 3-0 by the end of the first and even
though Dotel labored with 25 pitches in the first inning, he stayed
in for five innings. He gave up another run in the third and was
got no help from the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Darren Oliver faced just three batters more
than the minimum through seven innings and gave up just one run, in
the fourth, when Rickey Henderson led off the inning with a single,
stole second and scored on a single by Olerud. When McGwire smacked
a less-than-mammoth shot off Jeff Tam, just clearing the fence in
left center, to extend the Cardinals' lead to 5-1, the Mets seemed
better off waiting for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Rey Ordonez led off the eighth with a double down the
left-field line. Luis Lopez grounded out and Henderson drew a walk.
Cardinals Manager Tony LaRussa yanked Oliver for Rick Croushore. He
walked Alfonzo to bring Olerud to the plate. Olerud was hitting
.305 entering the game, and he has drawn 100 walks hitting in front
of Piazza while hitting just 14 home runs. But on a 1-2 changeup,
Olerud's smooth stroke sent the Mets' fifth grand slam of the
season down the right-field line. The crowd, which had reserved its
greatest cheers until then for McGwire, erupted and the Mets
trailed by 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   With the roar not yet quieted, Piazza smashed a 1-0 pitch to
dead center to tie the score at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals recovered as Mets reliever Armando Benitez,
who ultimately got the victory, allowed a run in the top of the
ninth. Fernando Tatis hit a grounder that seemed destined for a
double play, but Alfonzo's throw to Olerud was high, pulling him
off the base and allowing Drew to score to give the Cardinals a 7-6
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo saved himself plenty of grief in the bottom of the
inning. With one out, Ordonez and Franco each drew walks from
pitcher Ricky Bottalico. Henderson, who drove in the go-ahead run
Saturday, singled to right field to score Ordonez and tie the at
7-7. The 40-year-old Henderson got on base all five times he came
to the plate Saturday. Sunday, he was merely 3 for 4 with two runs
scored and he allowed Alfonzo redemption with his dramatic
game-winning roller into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think,'' Valentine said, ``it's better than vintage Rickey,
and vintage Rickey was Hall-of-Fame material.''

 &HT;    New welcome mat appreciated by UGA's first-year students
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens _ As the alma mater thundered through Stegeman Coliseum,
University of Georgia freshman Chad Oliver and his friends from the
third floor of Hill Hall seemed to swell with pride as they sang
the unfamiliar tune, which marked the end of Opening Convocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Adams and Governor Miller, they made you feel like
you're not a Social Security number, you're one of them,'' said
Oliver, 18, who's from St. Marys. His friends, Chad Merck and
Torian White, nodded. ``This isn't just a bunch of faculty and
students, this is the family. I want to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The three young men, along with their resident assistant, Arun
Krishnamoorthy, were among the 4,000 or so people _ mostly
freshmen, their families and faculty _ who attended the first-ever
ceremony, which was designed to introduce and welcome incoming
students to the university.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the event came from student Gretchen D'Huyvetter,
who sat on the speaker's podium with President Michael Adams,
Athens Mayor Doc Eldridge, Student Government President Tricia Page
and Staff Council President Sarah Fraker, among others. They
praised the students for their accomplishments; told them to enjoy
their years at UGA; to become involved in campus life; and to
volunteer in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the podium was former Gov. Zell Miller, a UGA alumnus
and the featured speaker. He holds the Philip H. Alston Jr. Chair
in the Institute of Higher Education at UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is more of a process than a destination,'' said
Miller, who told the students to recognize the difference between
information and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He said the treasures they could gain at the university included
intellectual curiosity, tolerance and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you set out on this great adventure here at the University
of Georgia, I encourage you to take full advantage of the
opportunities to learn and grow and mature, and gather into your
life the real, lasting treasures that higher education offers,''
said Miller. ``You are on your way into a future I believe is full
of more promise than ever before.''

 &HT;    After slow start, it all falls in place for Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It couldn't have gotten much worse than the first
weekend in May. The Cincinnati Reds, new and improved and built to
last, were instead a flop, a loose collection of talents that had
been oversold in spring's annual rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves swept the Reds that first May weekend, allowing them
10 hits in 27 innings, outscoring them 13-4, while Cincinnati
settled deeper into last place, 5 1/2 games back just 23 dates into
the schedule. Reds manager Jack McKeon didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he understands now, though the questions have changed.
Instead of trying to make sense of the first weeks, he's trying to
understand the last ones. McKeon freely admits he doesn't know how
the game's new postseason set-up works, now that in the year's
biggest turnabout, his club finds itself in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we get in, who (cares) where it is,'' McKeon said.
``We'll play 'em any place. We're going to be tough anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe him. The Reds open tonight's three-game series at Turner
Field a team transformed, half a game behind Houston in the NL
Central, the best road team in baseball (38-17) and a possible
Braves postseason opponent. Since mid-May, the Reds are 59-31
(.656). Since the All-Star break, they have lost just one of 11
series, and have won the past nine _ the longest streak in the
majors this year.
</P>
<P>
   And they keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the starting pitching,'' general manager Jim Bowden
said, ``this team can go as far as it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no single explanation. Ron Villone, a journeyman
reliever, becomes a soild starter. Ex-Brave Denny Neagle cools a
sore shoulder for two months before returning in August with some
of his career's best work, bolstering the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of kids, foremost rookie Scott Williamson, become the
game's best bullpen. Left fielder Greg Vaughn stalks another
40-homer year. Shortstop Barry Larkin finally resembles himself.
Pokey Resse proves he can play second base. First baseman Sean
Casey, the league's No. 4 hitter, becomes a fullblown star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' said Braves second baseman
Bret Boone, who spent his previous five seasons in Cincinnati.
``(Right-hander Pete) Harnisch continued to do what he did last
year. The bullpen with the Williamson kid has made a big
differerence, though they already had a lot of talent there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lark is healthy and playing like he can play. Pokey stepped in
(for Boone) and did a great job, which they didn't know would
happen. I think the presence of Vaughn. even though he's hitting
around .220 or so, he has his 29 home runs. The emergence of Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the slow start was only that, magnified by early
pitching problems of Neagle, Jason Bere and Bret Tomko. Neagle has
a 3.64 ERA since rejoining the rotation July 30. Bere has been
since released and Tomko, demoted and recalled once, may lose his
job again when Steve Parris (7-1) comes off the DL this week.
</P>
<P>
   The late trade for Juan Guzman has fortified the rotation, which
is 15-6 in the second half and 10-3 in August. This in turn will
reduce bullpen exposure, which will only help down the stretch.
Between Danny Graves, Scott Sullivan and Williamson, whose 1.69 ERA
is lowest among NL relievers, all three will log 100 innings this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the right kind of arms to do it and our guys
do,'' McKeon said. ``Other than Williamson, who never pitched out
of the bullpen before, they are all accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves provide an acid test. Cincinnati has not won a series
in Atlanta in over four years. But these Reds are not about four
years ago or even last May. They are about the playoffs and October
and with the league's third best record (73-49), they are as
legitimate an entry to NL knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get in,'' McKeon said. ``Because then, anything
can happen.''

THEY TOOK A PICTURE AND IT DID LAST LONGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On page 33, there's Christy Mathewson limbering up in a New York
Giants uniform. You'd swear it was Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   On pages 72 and 73, Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Jack Coombs sits in
the shadows of the Ebbets Field clubhouse in 1916, wondering if his
career will ever return to the 31-win season he had with the
Philadelphia Athletics five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On pages 176-177, it's a carefree Pee Wee Reese on the dugout
steps with teammates Spider Jorgensen, Eddie Stanky and rookie
Jackie Robinson on April 15, 1947, moments before Robinson would
forever change the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, these images have not only been committed to film
but revived in the oversized book ``Classic Baseball Photographs:
1869-1947'' compiled by baseball historian Donald Honig ($20,
Smithmark Publishers, 182 pages). It was originally published five
years ago under the title ``Shadows of Summer,'' but a gem like
this will never be out of style as long as baseball fans long for
what the game looked like _ and, even in this case, felt like _
more than 100 years ago. Because these are pictures you feel.
</P>
<P>
   Everything old these days is called ``classic,'' but the word
should be saved for treasures such as this. The original
black-and-white photos are all given a sepia tone, which helps give
the effect of what Robert Creamer calls in the forward ``an
archeological dig.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many photographers in the early part of the
century worked anonymously, selling their work to newspapers or
wire services. One of the most famous, Charles Conlon, whose photos
were often published in The Sporting News, has seen books and even
a set of baseball cards issued of his collection. And his are
included in this. But Honig and his staff's attempt to identify the
other artists whose work graces the pages of this book produced
only seven names to go with some 160-plus pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a poetic conclusion to their search. Because for as
many photos as there are of the stars of that time period _ some
classics permanently etched in fans' minds, such as a DiMaggio
swing or a Cobb slide _ there are the anonymous ballplayers like
Dummy Taylor, Rough Carrigan, Red Dooin, Patsy Dougherty and Stuffy
McInnis, who would otherwise be just names in a history book if not
for someone deciding their portrait was worth the trouble to take.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Reese's recent passing and DiMaggio's death earlier
this year, this book becomes more valuable each year. And for 20
bucks, the price is right.

ON BASEBALL: METS CHASE THE PRIZE THAT MCGWIRE CANNOT REACH 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shawon Dunston was oblivious to history. After Mark
McGwire's 50th homer soared over the center-field fence Sunday at
Shea Stadium, it bounced off a fan's glove and back onto the
warning track. The ball was historic because no other player had
ever smashed 50 home runs in four consecutive seasons. Dunston, who
thought McGwire's scoreboard-bulb-breaking homer six innings
earlier had been the 50th, scooped up a sliver of history and
flipped it into the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire received a polite standing ovation for hitting Jeff
Tam's fastball 401 feet and achieving something that not even Babe
Ruth had ever accomplished. There was nothing raucous about the
treatment. It was the way astute fans should respond to an opposing
player and the way Mets manager Bobby Valentine would have
choreographed the scene. Nice, but not too noisy.
</P>
<P>
   The real noise came later. The Mets neatly upstaged McGwire's
antics and shoved the home run race aside in favor of the pennant
race by rallying from a five-run deficit to win dramatically the
first game of the doubleheader against St. Louis, 7-6. The drama
returned in the second game before the Cardinals doused a
ninth-inning rally and won, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an exciting day at Shea, with about half of the
50,139 fans in their seats when the six hours of baseball finally
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   They will remember McGwire's two homers, but they will also
remember how the Mets scored twice in the ninth to win the opener
and then behaved like 17-year-olds who had won a high school
championship. There were bearhugs and high-fives as McGwire
strolled off the field.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the Mets made the home run king a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Really, this is the way it should be. Even McGwire has admitted
this on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Run Race, Part 2, is not nearly as important as Pennant
Race, Part 200. McGwire and Sammy Sosa gave baseball fans
unforgettable thrills last season, and even though they are
frequently going deep again, the only way they will attend the
postseason is if Commissioner Bud Selig invites them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no competition in this,'' McGwire said. ``There's no
prize at the end of the season. The only prize at the end of the
season, and I've said this time and time again, is that World
Series trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are stylishly earning their chance for that trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Watch them rebound from a five-run deficit in the eighth on John
Olerud's grand slam and Mike Piazza's McGwire-like shot.
</P>
<P>
   Watch them obliterate a one-run deficit in the ninth on Rickey
Henderson's run-scoring double and Edgardo Alfonzo's game-winning
single. The splurge enabled the Mets to overcome a sluggish start
by Octavio Dotel and make McGwire envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who puts the uniform on wants to win; they want to go
to the playoffs and the World Series,'' McGwire said. ``Who
doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo considered McGwire's words and McGwire's statistics on a
shabby team and said; ``You can put up many, many numbers and
that's good for yourself. But everybody wants to win. That's what
this game is about.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the game, Dotel was slumped on a black couch
watching videotape of McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   After one of McGwire's homers, Dotel hastily rewound the tape,
studied the at-bat and noticed the fastball was on the inside
corner. Inside? Outside? With McGwire and fastballs, it usually
does not matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel had already permitted Joe McEwing's leadoff homer when he
fired a 91-mile-an-hour fastball off the outside corner and McGwire
rolled his wrists and sent the ball zooming toward right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball kept climbing until it resembled a golf ball and
crashed more than halfway up the scoreboard, destroying a bulb in
the numeral 6 in the 16 for Ray Lankford's uniform. The estimated
distance of McGwire's impersonation of Roy Hobbs was 502 feet. Six
hundred two would have been closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty good,'' said McGwire, who criticized the
seemingly short estimate. ``That did amaze me.''
</P>
<P>
   One year and three days ago, McGwire slugged his 50th,
coincidentally, off a Mets right-hander (Willie Blair) in the
seventh inning of the first game of a doubleheader. After his moon
shot in the first off Dotel, McGwire hit one off the right-handed
Tam in the seventh. Dunston saw the ball pop out of a fan's glove,
so he retrieved it and tossed it to another man holding his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was 51,'' said Dunston, who was acquired from
St. Louis last month. ``It was history. I felt so bad. I told Mark
I was sorry.'' McGwire said: ``If the father and the young kid have
it, so be it. Let them cherish it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, McGwire left New York wondering if he could
break a record. But this time, the record of 70 homers is his own,
so he said: ``I'm chasing myself. How can you get excited about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   As they did last year, the Mets, who have nine important games
with Houston and Arizona in 10 days starting Monday night, are
wondering if they can qualify for the post-season. But this season
should be different. This time, the Mets are a better bet and a
better story than McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be tough to beat,'' McGwire said. ``They've
got it rolling.''

 &HT;    Kelvin Moore's spirits are up despite broken neck
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. - Kelvin Moore laid in his hospital bed on Sunday
still unable to move most of his body, but at least the Cincinnati
Bengals safety
</P>
<P>
   was trying to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   And because of his effort, family and friends are beginning to
brighten up, just a couple of days after fearing the worst for
Moore, who broke his neck Friday night during the Bengals'
preseason game with the Detroit Lions at the Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's back to cracking his silly jokes,'' said Travis Moore,
Kelvin's brother. ``He'll say something like, 'Oh, my head hurts,'
but his spirits are up and that's what counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me smile that he still has his sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he knows he's lucky he wasn't paralyzed while
trying to tackle Detroit wide receiver Brian Stablein during the
third quarter. Moore broke the first vertebrae of his spine and
laid motionless on the AstroTurf for more than 15 minutes before
being taken to Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained at the hospital, where he was in intensive care
and listed in stable condition Sunday. Travis Moore said his
brother has some movement
</P>
<P>
   in his hands, but is still under medication and has been fitted
for a halo brace on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this week, he is scheduled to leave the hospital and
fly home to Los Angeles to receive treatment from a neck
specialist. He won't need surgery and a full recovery is expected,
his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Moore, a 6-foot, 203-pounder out of Morgan State, began
last season on the Bengals practice squad and was added to the
regular roster later in the year. He played special teams and
backed up safety Myron Bell.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few days, Moore has been visited by Bengals
owner Mike Brown, coach Bruce Coslet and several teammates,
including Bell. Travis Moore, a receiver for the Calgary Stampede
in the Canadian Football League, flew in from Canada on Saturday
after being granted a leave of action from his coach, arriving the
same day as his mother, step-sister and brother's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Moore, acting as the family spokesman, asked that no
other family members be interviewed. He said his family has
remained composed during this
</P>
<P>
   ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong, solid mom,'' Moore said. ``She's our rock.
The whole family in general is handling it well. You can't show a
whole lot of emotion at a time like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to agents, in this case Angelo Wright, who
visited his 24-year-old client Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the type of injury ... he's young and strong.
Frankly, I think he'll be OK,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bengals trainer Paul Sparling said Moore's career was
over, but Wright and family members believe the second-year pro
might play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the trauma subsiding, you can't make that statement
(that Moore's career is over),'' Wright said. ``Football-wise, the
first thing to do is to get him healthy. He's in a lot of pain, but
there was no damage to his spinal column. Once he's OK, then we'll
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really coming on and he was going to be a factor this
year, but this is the ugly side of this business. Of course, he's
disappointed. The tragedy and irony of this is he works hard
everyday and he has a clean body and mind.''

COASTAL CITY ESCAPES WITH LITTLE DAMAGE AS HURRICANE TURNS AWAY
FROM HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS

</P>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Residents of this coastal city were
breathing easier Sunday night as it appeared they would escape the
brunt of Hurricane Bret.
</P>
<P>
   After bearing down on the Corpus Christi area for more than 24
hours, the storm veered west and came ashore over sparsely
populated ranch land about 70 miles south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're relieved,'' said David Garcia, the Corpus
Christi city manager. ``We have some damage, but it's not nearly as
bad as it would have been from a direct hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the city's evacuation advisory would remain in
effect until the full extent of the storm's impact could be
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Oestreich, director of the American Red Cross office in
Corpus Christi, said Bret came ashore at the place it could do the
least damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping it would go that way because it's the
least-populated area in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the cows are happy, but we are,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, panicked residents jammed freeways as they
tried to heed official advisories to evacuate the city.
</P>
<P>
   Others, deciding to ride out the storm, emptied store shelves of
emergency supplies. Some were caught off-guard by the rapidly
developing storm while a few said they needed to stay behind to
protect property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a not a mandatory evacuation state, which means we
can't force people to leave,'' said Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   Bret was originally projected to hit farther south, in Mexico.
But Saturday night, about 24 hours before Bret's predicted
landfall, officials upgraded it to a major Category 4 hurricane and
said that the storm could hit near here.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuation orders were not issued for Padre Island until
Saturday night. The evacuation advisory for the Corpus Christi went
out Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Because Corpus Christi is entirely low-lying and vulnerable to
flooding, the nearest shelter was placed in San Antonio, two hours
away. Some residents who decided to stay behind said they simply
didn't have time to plan for such a trek. Many gasoline stations
were shut down Sunday. Those that remained open soon ran out of
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Zavala and his wife had reserved a hotel room in San
Antonio. But when he got to the front of the line at a station on
his way out of town, he found there was no gas left. ``Oh well,''
he said. ``I think we have enough to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most grocery stores were closed and those that remained open
were overwhelmed with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here since 2 a.m.,'' said Mark Moreno, a worker at
an HEB market who was still furiously stocking crate after crate of
eggs about noon Sunday. ``We still have everything but bread and
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic was another problem. Talk radio programs were
overwhelmed with calls from drivers on cellular phones, calling
with updates on the bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads leading out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   All the reports of problems leaving town proved discouraging for
some. ``It's too late to do anything,'' shrugged Kevin Patton.
``Traffic is already backed up on 37,'' the highway to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But Patton was not taking the storm lightly. He spent Sunday
afternoon helping a friend with six children move to slightly
higher ground from an apartment complex along the shore, known as
SeasideVillas. He said he hoped they would be safe in his home,
which was already boarded up and is a few miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   When they were not talking about the traffic, radio talk-show
hosts were railing about the antics of surfers enjoying the waves
while so many others were scrambling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was David Haynie, a 39-year-old real estate
executive, who just wanted the thrill of being near a big storm.
</P>
<P>
   Haynie spent the afternoon windsurfing off the beach near
downtown Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best it gets,'' said Haynie as he wrestled his
sail ashore, the wind already reaching a howl and the rain stinging
as it hit his face. ``My house is already boarded up, so I figured
I would have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to ride out the storm in his home, just a
couple of blocks from shore. ``I'm not worried,'' he said. ``I was
swimming before I was walking.''

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Hurricane Bret pummeled a desolate
region of the Texas coast with 125 mph winds Sunday, but heavily
populated areas appeared to have been spared major damage from the
Category 4 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people from Brownsville to Galveston evacuated
low-lying coastal areas, clogging public shelters and filling
motels as far inland as San Antonio as the first hurricane to
strike Texas in a decade made landfall in sparsely populated Kenedy
County.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared seven South Texas counties disaster
areas and called on President Clinton to issue an ``expedited
presidential disaster declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those fellow Texans
that are in harm's way,'' Bush said at a news briefing in Austin,
Texas, Sunday afternoon. ``A disaster comes like a thief in the
night sometimes. I hope this storm, as ferocious as it may seem,
will not affect human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi Mayor Loyd Neal said Sunday evening that damage
in the city of 275,000 had been minimal, mainly downed trees and
roof shingles blown off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a major, major storm hitting Corpus
Christi,'' said Neal, who runs an insurance agency.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding remained a major threat. Forecasters said the storm
could dump 10 to 15 inches of rain as it moved inland. There also
was concern that a storm surge would push water 10 to 15 above
normal levels, particularly in bays.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,600 Texas National Guard troops were put on standby
near San Antonio to provide assistance to hurricane victims, and
all available state troopers were helping evacuate people and
coordinate emergency activities.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the compact but powerful storm came ashore in late
evening in Kenedy County, aiming the brunt of its force at the
heart of the 825,000-acre King Ranch between Corpus Christi and
Raymondville. The legendary ranch, founded in 1853 by Capt. Richard
King, is bigger than the state of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   In Raymondville, a citrus farming community of 8,800 about 30
miles south of where the eye came ashore, wind gusts of up to 75
mph ripped off roofs and blew down trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we can just pray the Good Lord spares our
town,'' Mayor Joe Sosa said about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, pastor of the non-denominational Raymondville Christian
Center, urged those in flood-prone areas to seek shelter at a local
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 40 miles from the storm's
eye, whipping debris through Raymondville. Streets were deserted
except for a few cars that sought shelter under gas station
awnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting hit pretty hard right now, but there's no way of
telling whether we've seen the worst of it yet,'' said Pete
Fresquez, who was operating Raymondville's emergency hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Lebore Montoya, 45, a resident of Mexico who was trying to get
to Corpus Christi to be with his family, sought shelter at a gas
station in Raymondville when the storm hit. ``At a time like this,
I really want to be with my wife and kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's path was similar to that of Hurricane Allen, which
came ashore in the same region with 185 mph winds in 1980, causing
$55 million in property damage and killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   While winds of more than 100 mph were buffeting the scrub brush
and marshes of the coastal ranchland, wind gusts had not exceeded
55 mph in Corpus Christi as of 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite nonstop warnings of the approaching storm, people turned
out at Cole Park on the Corpus Christi bayfront in late afternoon
to see the impact of the edge of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Kira Ware, a married college student, took a Suburban-load of
relatives including her 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show her what a hurricane is like,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   As choppy waves smacked the rocky shore and sheets of rain began
falling, Ricky Rodriguez showed the view to his 11-year-old
daughter and her 13-year-old cousin. Then they headed home where
Rodriguez said he had a backup electric generator and, to see them
through the storm, ``a bunch of horror videos.''
</P>
<P>
   The landscaped boulevard along the bayfront was littered with
palm fronds shaken loose from surrounding trees. Fishing boats and
yachts were beached on traffic islands as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In Corpus Christi Sunday night, the major concern was that the
storm surge might push water over the 15-foot seawall and flood
downtown, which is lower than the man-made barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross and government officials in Corpus Christi decided
against opening shelters in the city, opting instead to wait until
Monday to assess the damage and see if the shelters were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings extended for about 200 miles along the coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville residents spent a hurried weekend preparing for the
storm. Moderate rain fell sporadically Sunday, but there was
otherwise no hint of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island, the barrier island linked to Brownsville by
a causeway, was evacuated by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Builder's Square on Texas 48, which is the road out of
the island, manager Charlie Velasco said his store remained open
until 2 a.m. as buyers streamed in asking for sheets of plywood and
compressed particle board to protect their windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6,000 sheets passed through his checkout counters by
midday, Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't sell one-tenth of that in a weekend,'' he
said. ``I got 1,100 sheets in last night at 11. By midnight, they
were gone. They say war is good for the nation's economy. I guess a
hurricane is good for my store's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Brownsville residents fled low-lying areas and
filled at least two shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared our house would be flooded, so we came here,''
said Molly Oyervides, 46, who huddled on the hallway floor of a
school with her 10-year-old daughter. Her husband, who works
nights, was curled up asleep on a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The school district provided cold-cut meals, bottled water and
soft drinks for those who sought refuge in the shelters, said
Maricela Zarate, the school principal who was doubling as a shelter
operator.

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Beverly Jacoby didn't hesitate Sunday
when the mayor suggested that residents evacuate to higher ground
as Hurricane Bret menaced the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we treasure go into the car,'' said Jacoby, who
moved to Corpus Christi in May from Weatherford in North Central
Texas. She and her husband frantically loaded their most precious
belongings, including family photos and a cherished ``misprinted
$20 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, workers were hammering plywood across the windows
of her ocean-front apartment in preparation for the Category 4
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobys were among tens of thousands of residents who piled
into vans, cars, pickups and chartered buses and rolled onto
Interstate 37 for the bumper-to-bumper evacuation to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 80th anniversary of Corpus Christi's deadliest
hurricane, which killed an estimated 300 to 1,000 people. Residents
were taking no chances this time.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Loyd Neal said many people had heeded the city's warning
to evacuate, particularly those in low-lying areas such as North
Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor estimated that 30,000 people, about 10 percent of the
city's population, had moved inland in advance of the storm, but
Police Chief Pete Alvarez and others said the number may have been
significantly higher judging from the heavy traffic heading out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe us,'' the mayor implored residents in a televised
message. ``This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he was satisfied with the response, as well as with
the city's preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of these, but we practice often,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., less than two hours before the storm made landfall
south of Corpus Christi, the mayor said people who hadn't evacuated
``should stay in the city but leave low areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokesman Peter Teahen said government and Red Cross
officials agreed not to wait until Monday to decide whether to open
shelters in Corpus Christi ``because it's a force 4 hurricane, and
it's too dangerous for people to stay in the area due to possible
flooding and structural damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four Red Cross shelters opened in San Antonio quickly
filled with coastal evacuees, and more buildings were likely to be
requisitioned, Teahen said.
</P>
<P>
   Teahen flew in from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, before the Corpus
Christi airport was closed to all but emergency flights at 1:20
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals discharged patients who were able to leave Sunday and
were admitting only those requiring emergency treatment and women
in labor, said Laura Cole, spokeswoman for the Spohn Hospital
group. Staff and doctors were invited to bring family members with
them when they reported to work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern in Corpus Christi was that flooding would
contaminate the water supply, prompting the city to cut off service
to low-lying neighborhoods and North Padre Island at 9:30 a.m.,
said Juan Ortiz, the city's assistant director of emergency
management.
</P>
<P>
   Nueces County Sheriff Larry Oliverez said 325 inmates in a jail
annex that was not built to withstand 120 mph winds were evacuated
to safer quarters, as were boot camp and juvenile detention
residents.

Monday to assess the damage and see if the shelters were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings extended for about 200 miles along the coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville residents spent a hurried weekend preparing for the
storm. Moderate rain fell sporadically Sunday, but there was
otherwise no hint of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island, the barrier island linked to Brownsville by
a causeway, was evacuated by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Builder's Square on Texas 48, which is the road out of
the island, manager Charlie Velasco said his store remained open
until 2 a.m. as buyers streamed in asking for sheets of plywood and
compressed particle board to protect their windows.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6,000 sheets passed through his checkout counters by
midday, Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't sell one-tenth of that in a weekend,'' he
said. ``I got 1,100 sheets in last night at 11. By midnight, they
were gone. They say war is good for the nation's economy. I guess a
hurricane is good for my store's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Brownsville residents fled low-lying areas and
filled at least two shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared our house would be flooded, so we came here,''
said Molly Oyervides, 46, who huddled on the hallway floor of a
school with her 10-year-old daughter. Her husband, who works
nights, was curled up asleep on a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The school district provided cold-cut meals, bottled water and
soft drinks for those who sought refuge in the shelters, said
Maricela Zarate, the school principal who was doubling as a shelter
operator.

RUSSIAN MONEY-LAUNDERING IS FOCUS OF INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven years ago, Natasha Gurfinkel, a young executive
at the Bank of New York, joined an elite contingent of American
bankers sent to Russia and made an important advance in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to help the new Russia create a Western-style
banking system, and her self-assured, savvy touch impressed top
bankers and regulators on the trip. Only a few months after her
return, she was promoted to head the bank's division for Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, she was taking on a big assignment for a woman at a
buttoned-down New York bank.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed perfect for the job. Fluent in her native Russian,
and able to move seamlessly from Wall Street to Moscow, she built a
lucrative business for the bank. New Russian companies needed
access to American money and American banks and Ms. Gurfinkel
became known as banker who could get things done.
</P>
<P>
   In New York she was a prominent member of a generation of young
Russian emigres who, armed with Western education, were rising
through the ranks of companies angling for business in Russia and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was at a dinner speech with a Russian leader or a
black-tie Russian ball, Ms. Gurfinkel was an important presence,
especially after she married Konstatin Kagalovsky, a one-time
reformer in the Kremlin who had become a wealthy Russian
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew her,'' said the former chairman of a major
Western bank that does extensive business in Russia. ``Number one,
because of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Ms. Kagalovsky was suspended by the Bank of New
York. She is a central figure in what federal investigators suspect
could be the biggest money-laundering scheme in history.
Investigators say billions of dollars may have been channeled
through accounts at the Bank of New York by Russian organized crime
as well as by embezzlement from Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious thing,'' said Ms. Kagalovsky during a brief
telephone conversation at the weekend. ``They've told me not to say
anything. I'm just sorry about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky is not the only bank executive involved in the
investigation. Lyudmila Edwards, known as Lucy, has been suspended
as well. Ms. Edwards, 41, and also Russian born, was a vice
president in the bank's London office working for Ms. Kagalovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of their role in any money laundering is unclear. The
suspension from their jobs does not mean they are guilty. Wall
Street companies have a long history of singling out ``rogue
employees'' who once raked in big profits as the masterminds of
financial scandals. It is a strategy often embraced by companies
anxious to insulate themselves from lawsuits and other trouble that
can follow embarrassing disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, government investigators raided Bank of New York
offices in New York and London, seizing documents from the offices
of Ms. Kagalovsky and Ms. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The British police also searched the apartment of Ms. Edwards
and her husband, Peter Berlin, who had control over one of the
accounts that authorities are examining _ an account through which
$4.2 billion in laundered funds is believed to have passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York said last week that it has been cooperating
with the federal investigation of the matter, which involves the
use of the bank to transfer funds from Russia to other countries.
The bank said there are no allegations of wrongdoing against it and
has repeatedly declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the women been accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The class of ``new Russians'' that Ms. Kagalovsky and her
husband belonged to emerged in Moscow in the early 1990s as Russia
threw open its markets to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   These younger Russians, many of them with high-paying jobs that
their parents never dreamed of, were in the vanguard of Russia's
embrace of capitalism. They could be picked out by the ubiquitous
cell phones, luxury automobiles, private security guards and pricey
restaurants they favored.
</P>
<P>
   Western bankers said Ms. Kagalovsky was a well-known member of
that world when she visited Moscow, often adorned in expensive fur
coats. Her husband, a former Russian government official, was a
senior executive at Menatep, a now insolvent Russian bank. He is
now the vice chairman of Yukos, a major Russian oil company.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was a long way from Ms. Kagalovsky's modest
beginnings. Born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in 1954, she
attended what was then Leningrad State University and earned the
equivalent of bachelor's and master's degrees in Oriental studies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she emigrated to the United States and eventually
enrolled at Princeton University, earning a master's degree in Near
Eastern studies. In 1986, she joined Irving Bank Corp., which Bank
of New York acquired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank she worked for Vladimir ``Mickey'' Galitzine, a
Russian emigre with a royal pedigree who headed its Eastern
European business. Both reported to Alan R. Griffith, head of
international banking, and Ms. Kagalovsky quickly won Griffith's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natasha was more pushy, whereas Mickey was more of a
gentleman,'' said a former Bank of New York employee familiar with
Ms. Kagalovsky's rise at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Galitzine said family problems in the early
1990s distracted him from his work and he began ceding more
authority to Ms. Kagalovsky.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992 she successfully leapfrogged Galitzine and won control
of the Eastern European division, although the two executives are
said to have remained friends. Galitzine declined to comment on any
aspect of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Kagalovsky, Ms. Edwards was born in Leningrad and
worked at Irving Bank, ending up as an assistant to Ms. Kagalovsky
and Galitzine.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Lyudmila Pritzker in 1958, and might have spent her
entire life in Russia had she not met a young American in the
merchant marine in 1977. Although she was only 19, she married him
that year at the U.S. consulate in Leningrad, a relative said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to the United States and lived in Illinois
briefly before moving further west. She became an American citizen
in 1981, but her marriage was troubled. She and her husband were
divorced in 1987, and Ms. Edwards moved to the East Coast,
eventually landing a job in banking.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bank of New York, Ms. Edwards worked hard enough to win
the London assignment, and she impressed competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very outgoing, a spunky woman, who really wanted to
take care of her clients,'' said a rival banker who competed for
business in Russia. ``She was very professional. People liked
her.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Ms. Edwards married Berlin, a Russian who
acquired U.S. citizenship through his marriage to her. And Berlin's
own business pursuits appear to be one focus of the federal
money-laundering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, 44, operated Benex, a company he appears to have run in
part from his home in Queens with a telephone and a personal
computer, an investigator added. For a period, Berlin also ran a
travel agency in New Jersey, also under the name of Benex, said a
Brooklyn investment manager who occasionally used his services.
</P>
<P>
   It was accounts related to Benex that sparked the massive
money-laundering investigation. The first federal subpoenas
produced 3,500 pages of documents related to Benex, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the services Benex provided was getting visas to the
United States for associates of Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, a
suspected Russian organized-crime leader, said an American
official.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich, Ms. Edwards and her husband could not be reached for
comment. In the past, Mogilevich has denied any ties to organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators also are trying to determine whether some
of the money channeled through the Bank of New York came from
Menatep, where Ms. Kagalovsky's husband once worked. Western
investors and Russian regulatory authorities suspect Menatep and
related companies of having looted money from Russia, allegations
that the companies have denied.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ms. Kagalovsky said she has retained Stanley
Arkin, a New York criminal defense lawyer noted for his involvement
in high-profile financial fraud cases. Arkin declined to comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Kagalovsky may wish she had examined some of her
clients more closely, although doing business with Russian
companies is never easy. As Ms. Kagalovsky said in a 1993
interview, Russian companies are not known for disclosing much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand business needs and try to assess
whether they will survive the coming years, often without the
benefit of annual reports or any written material,'' she told the
newspaper The American Banker.

SPOTLIGHT IS ON COMETS AS POSTSEASON BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This season, things were supposed to be different in the Women's
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of several elite professional players from the
defunct American Basketball League, the peace of mind that comes
with job security and the expanded playoff format were expected to
bring parity to the league and add last-minute drama to the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   But the more things changed, the more they remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   With the playoffs set to begin Tuesday night, Houston and the
Liberty, teams with the same core group of players with which they
started when the league began play three seasons ago, are atop the
Eastern and Western Conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the league's twice defending champions, the Comets,
are the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Cynthia Cooper, the WNBA's only most valuable player, and
the All-Star Sheryl Swoopes, the Comets (25-6) have the best record
in the league, home-court advantage throughout the playoffs and a
first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   If the chance to win a third straight title isn't enough
motivation to get Houston's high-scoring triumvirate of Cooper,
Swoopes and Tina Thompson going, the death last week of their
teammate Kim Perrot, the Comets' point guard and inspirational
floor leader, is bound to be added incentive. Perrot, 32, died
after a nine-month battle with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the Liberty rebounded from missing the playoffs
last season when it failed to win the conference title, which comes
with a first-round bye and home-court advantage in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Sting, which finished third in the East, had been
considered the team most likely to win the conference. The Sting's
lineup is younger, taller and, some thought, stronger than the
Liberty's, which is the oldest of the league's 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rebecca Lobo, the 6-foot-4-inch center-forward, whose
season ended 42 seconds after it began last June when she tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee, the Liberty was given
little chance of making a run at the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty (18-14), playing behind Kym Hampton, 36, Sue
Wicks, 32, and Teresa Weatherspoon, 34, stood its ground in the low
post, with help from the 6-2 rookie Tamika Whitmore and Crystal
Robinson, a 3-point sharpshooter from the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply believed in this core group, which is evident in the
fact that I haven't made many changes in that core during the first
three years,'' said Carol Blazejowski, the Liberty's general
manager, referring to Hampton, Wicks and Weatherspoon. ``Because we
understood that our roster was more veteran than some other teams'
and a little bit older, we added youth and size.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoff format was expanded this year from four to six
teams, adding a one-game elimination round for the second- and
third-place teams in each conference. The new format insures that
each conference will have a representative in the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Having clinched the Western Conference title two weeks ago,
Houston won five of its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are so focused right now, if I were a betting
woman, and I'm not, I wouldn't bet against Houston, although there
are competitors,'' Detroit Coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline said Sunday
during a coaches' conference call. The Shock will play host to
Charlotte in an elimination game tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Houston awaits the winner of Tuesday's elimination game between
the Los Angeles Sparks and the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks
(20-12) have the league's second-best record, followed by the
Monarchs (19-12). In head-to-head matchups this year, the Sparks
and Monarchs are 2-2, both winning one game on the opponent's
court. It is the first playoff appearance for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs will be without the 6-3 forward-center Yolanda
Griffith, their leading scorer and rebounder, who averaged 18.8
points (second in the league) and 11.3 rebounds (first). Griffith
sustained a partial tear of the medial meniscus in her right knee
two weeks ago against Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth is really weakened,'' Monarchs coach Sonny Allen
said. ``We didn't have a lot of depth to start with. Our success
against Los Angeles depends on us hitting free throws and not
turning the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks lead the league in scoring, averaging 76.5 points a
game, and in assists, with 18.1 per game. Factor in 6-5 Lisa
Leslie, their explosive center and the most valuable player in this
year's All-Star Game, along with a playoff-starved home crowd, and
the Sparks have the edge on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Orlando Woolridge was not overconfident Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death,'' he said. ``In a one-game elimination,
you can't afford to have a bad night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty will face either the Sting or the Shock. Charlotte
and Detroit both finished the regular season at 15-17.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
  Anindya Bhattacharyya was eager and ready to go. Maybe a tad
jittery, definitely full of potential excuses. Busy settling into a
new apartment and job, he said, he had not had much time to train
the past six months, just an occasional run around the track at the
Helen Keller National Center in Sands Point, N.Y., holding onto the
handrail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twice, he took a practice swim in Hempstead Harbor. He worked
out on the exercise bicycle in the gym once, but purchased a blue
tandem bicycle only the day before his first triathlon. Had not
even gone for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my first shock will be when I get in the cold water,''
he said Sunday morning, flipping his watch open and fingering the
dial to see how many minutes were left until the 12th annual
Seacrest-Tobay Triathlon would begin. ``After that everything will
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bhattacharyya, 29, who is known as Bapin, pulled off his
T-shirt and pulled on a bathing cap to swim six-tenths of a mile in
Oyster Bay Harbor, the first lap of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But before wading in, Bhattacharyya, a computer technology
specialist, had to be tethered to Jim Belanich, his support service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Bhattacharyya is deaf-blind. He cannot speak. He communicates
with tactile sign language, keeping his hand over his
interpreter's, reading the movement of his knuckles and fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try to go fast,'' he signed to Belanich,
figuring on completing the 15-kilometer cycling segment in 45
minutes and then running a 9- to 10-minute mile over the
5-kilometer (3.1-mile) course. ``But the main goal is just to
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Triathlons can be difficult for anyone. But for Bhattacharyya
and two other deaf-blind participants, Maricar Marquez and Brian
Farney, swimming past the orange buoys, pedaling the hills of Long
Island's North Shore and running the back roads would be nearly
impossible without a guiding hand and a system of signals and
touches.
</P>
<P>
   In the cycling segment, Bhattacharyya took the tandem bike's
rear seat, tapping Belanich twice when he needed to stop. To slow
down, he patted his side. When he needed water, he shook his hand.
And throughout the run, Bhattacharyya kept his hand on top of
Belanich's, which spelled out pebbles and potholes 20 feet in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bhattacharyya said the triathlon was just another
adventure. He finished in 2 hours 8 minutes, 670th out of the 900
individual participants. Marquez, 27, came in 486th, in 1:45:38,
well ahead of her 1:51:46 finish last year. She has Usher syndrome,
a genetic disorder that has gradually robbed her night and
peripheral vision, leaving about a 10-degree field of tunnel
vision. And Farney, 29, a computer student of Bhattacharyya's, who
has been training for the past three months and also has Usher
syndrome, finished 503rd, in 1:58:09.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Neinast, 46, of Rockaway Beach, who often bikes the 40
miles each way to his job as a branch manager for a home-care
company in Plainview, N.Y., took first place in the competition for
the fourth straight year, with a time of 1:00:46. Christine
Dunnery, 31, a teacher and marathon runner from Baldwin, was the
first female finisher in 1:09:02.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Walsh, a 14-year-old from Huntington, N.Y., who has a
genetic disorder and is unable to use his legs, completed his first
triathlon using a special hand cycle and racing wheelchair. ``I
accept my deaf-blindness and then I can do just about anything,''
Bhattacharyya said. ``I really don't feel I have limitations. I am
not thinking that because I am deaf-blind, I can't do things. I
can, so I accept those challenges, and I enjoy them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was stymied, he said, by having to walk up a hill during the
cycling portion. And coming downhill, his bicycle chain came off.
But that did not deter him from adding his results to the extensive
curriculum vitae posted on his Web site. He manages it himself,
using a special Braille display screen that hooks into the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deaf-blind people are like everybody else; there is no
difference,'' Marquez, a veteran rock climber, spelunker and sky
diver, signed through her interpreter, Kelly Shanahorn. Marquez
plans to run the New York City Marathon next year. ``I like to do a
lot of different things and get involved. I'm not the kind of
person who stays home. I am fascinated by life.''
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, Bhattacharyya said, he plans to try snorkeling. And
Farney said he was looking forward to a camping trip next weekend.

FED TO DECIDE IF INTEREST-RATE BOOST IS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All eyes will be on the Federal Reserve this week as its
{Federal Open Market Committee} convenes Tuesday to decide whether
another interest-rate boost is needed to preempt inflation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smart money in the financial community has been betting on a
quarter of a percentage point rise in the federal funds rate, which
is what banks charge one another for overnight loans. Since a
further tightening of monetary policy has been widely anticipated
on Wall Street, a modest rate boost has already been discounted by
the financial markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if the Fed does the expected, it probably will be a
positive rather than a negative development for investors. A boost
of more than a quarter of a point, however, might result in a
market setback. &QL; 
Wednesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect July's {existing home sales} report to show
that rising mortgage rates have finally taken their toll on the
housing resale market. The consensus of leading economists surveyed
by Thomson Global Markets expects an annual rate of 5.3 million. If
the call is on target, it would be a drop after June recorded a
10.6 percent jump from May's resale pace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - {Orders for durable goods} in July are forecast to have
reflected continued strength for manufacturing. Most economists
expect an increase of 1 percent, which would be a strong rebound
from June's relatively weak gain. An increase for the series, which
tracks demand for big-ticket items with a useful life of three
years or longer, would mark the 11th rise in 14 months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The Treasury has scheduled an {auction of two-year notes.} &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts don't expect any significant change in the Gross
Domestic Product numbers when the preliminary update for second
quarter is released. Last month's initial estimate for the
April-June period was an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   July's rise in {personal income} is forecast to have matched
June's increase, but {personal consumption} is expected to have
declined from the previous month. Economic analysts at Merrill
Lynch call for income to have risen a respectable 0.4 percent. On
the spending side, however, most analysts expect a rise of 0.3
percent, which would be half of June's gain. Any sustained decline
in spending would affect Gross Domestic Product figures for the
third quarter, because personal consumption fuels two-thirds of
economic growth. &QL;

HURRICANE SMACKS TEXAS COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ The first major Atlantic hurricane of the
season tumbled onto the South Texas coast Sunday afternoon,
bringing howling winds and stinging rains to a 220-mile area
stretching from the Mexican border to the resort peninsula of Padre
Island, and sending thousands of people fleeing inland for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bret made landfall after churning through the Gulf of
Mexico last week. By the time it hit the coast, Bret packed
sustained winds exceeding 125 miles an hour and poured several
inches of rain throughout the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reported deaths or serious injuries attributed to
the storm as of early last night, but emergency officials in
several Texas and Mexican cities said Bret's winds damaged scores
of buildings and downed trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   In low-lying areas along the coast, where many residents were
evacuated on Saturday, 15-foot-high waves slapped against piers and
ripped boats from their moorings. In Brownsville and Harlingen,
homes and businesses were shuttered and windows were taped.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Hurricane Andrew, a similarly compact storm that
swept across densely populated sections of southern Florida,
meteorologists and workers said Bret's eye moved through rural
areas between Brownsville and Corpus Christi, which helped to
minimize the number of victims and the amount of damage. Officials
also said that early warnings and evacuations helped save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been preparing for this since Thursday, when we expected
the storm to come this way,'' said Brownsville city manager Carlos
Rubinstein as he stood at a command center in the city's police
headquarters, where officials monitored the storm and its damage.
``We haven't been hit like this in a while, so there was the risk
that people would get complacent about preparations and warnings.
But so far, things seem to be under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret marked the first time the Texas coast had been hit by a
hurricane since Hurricane Jerry killed three people in October
1989. The last direct hit in on this area was Hurricane Allen in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the storm, which was classified as a powerful
Category 4 hurricane, passed near Port Mansfield betweeen
Brownsville and Corpus Christi about 5:10 p.m. local time and was
expected to continue moving farther north and west into Texas. The
strongest storms are classified as Category 5. By about 7 p.m., the
winds had died down slightly and the storm was downgraded to a
still-powerful Category 3.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service posted a hurricane warning from La
Pesca, Mexico, to Port O'Connor, Texas, south of Houston. The
strong winds and warm temperatures also prompted officials to issue
tornado warnings for inland areas. Mandatory evacuation orders were
issued for Padre and Mustang Islands as well as for Port Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Bret forced a mass exodus of residents and tourists throughout
the region. On Saturday, thousands fled South Padre Island, a
popular vacation resort, for the mainland. By late Sunday
afternoon, officials closed access to the area and said the
normally bustling island was a virtual ghost town. Many families
also packed cars and drove about 160 miles north to San Antonio,
where shelters were set up to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Austin, Governor George W. Bush said,
``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those fellow Texans that
are in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of others chose to take refuge in local schools and
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Homer Hanna High School in Brownsville, where officials
operated the largest shelter, 900 people, most of them poor
families with children and grandparents, huddled on blankets and
around small television sets in the school's hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Moore, the principal, supervised the shelter. ``Tomorrow
is supposed to be the first day of school,'' said Moore. ``But
these people have homes that are not secure enough to handle the
winds and floods. This is the safest place for them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Federico Trevino Zapata, 69, sat up against a set of yellow
lockers next to his wife, daughter, and mother-in-law. From his
blanket, he could see his two adult sons and their families about
25 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very comfortable here, but it's safer than our house,
which sits on blocks,'' said Trevino.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border, in the northern Mexican town of Matamoros
early Sunday morning, residents continued their last-minute
shopping for essentials. But by afternoon, when the storm's path
became clearer, Mexican officials said the threat to their coast
had lessened.

RESEARCHER HELD BY CHINESE TELLS OF ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Harrowing nights of nonstop interrogation,
intimidation, and sleep deprivation by Chinese secret police
probably drove a Massachusetts man to jump from a third-story
window, according to his Australian travel companion, who returned
home Sunday, a week after the two were detained in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Lafitte, 50, a scholar associated with the University of
Melbourne, said he and Daja Meston, 29, a researcher and former
Buddhist monk, were seized by 20 public security officers who
stormed their rooms early on Aug. 15 in the small town of
Xiangride, the site of an antipoverty project that was recently
approved for funding by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities separated the men, interrogated them, seized their
notes and film, and transferred them in a 28-hour journey across
mountain passes to the provincial capital of Xining, hundreds of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say Meston leaped from a window last
Wednesday, trying to escape detention. US officials who have
visited Meston in a Xining hospital say he is gravely injured, but
stable, with a broken back and internal organ damage. An American
doctor examined Meston for the third day Sunday, and said his
condition had not worsened, sources said. A decision has not been
made to evacuate him to another hospital, and officials note that
he is still under Chinese detention.
</P>
<P>
   Meston's wife, Phuntsok, a Tibetan exile, was granted a visa
Saturday and plans to fly to China as soon as possible to be with
her husband. ``My only wish now is to be with my husband, and to
bring him back home safely as soon as possible,'' she said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte was deported Saturday and put on a plane home, banned
from China for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said he was able to see Meston only when their caravan
of vehicles stopped, and ``even then I could see he was petrified,
absolutely terrified, and just couldn't get a handle on the
situation. I found it difficult, but manageable. I think it was a
lot harder for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meston, who recently completed coursework for a sociology degree
at Brandeis University, is described by friends as soft-spoken,
gentle, and attention-shy. Authorities may have been more
interested in Meston than Lafitte because Meston is a Tibetan
speaker, an American who was raised in a Tibetan monastery in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said he is concerned about the fate of Tsering Dorji, an
ethnic Tibetan and Chinese citizen who was translating local
dialect for them. He was separated from Lafitte and Meston, of
Newton, Mass., when they were detained. Dorji had also worked as a
translator for the European Union last October.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from his Melbourne home, Lafitte said that
after their arrival in Xining, he was kept under 24-hour watch by
two secret police officers who sat at his bedside. He said he was
awakened nightly about 1 a.m. and interrogated relentlessly for
about four hours on what he was doing in Qinghai, and forced to
sign numerous confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always the interrogation would begin one hour after I fell
asleep. They were very clear with me that `You are under the
coercive powers of the state security bureau. We can do anything,
you can do nothing. You must obey, you have no choice,' '' Lafitte
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this is exactly what was said to Daja, and that's
what drove him to utter desperation, perhaps over the brink,''
Lafitte said, discounting speculation that Meston's injuries might
have been inflicted by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we overestimate the physical crudity of the Chinese if
we think they would physically assault him like that,'' Lafitte
said. ``It's not his body they assaulted; it's his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte says he doesn't understand how he and Meston could be
accused of crimesbecause the Chinese government had said that
foreigners were welcome to visit the Qinghai project site
unaccompanied.
</P>
<P>
   The project has come under fire because of letters from local
Tibetans expressing fears about conflicts over limited resources if
50,000 Chinese and Muslim farmers are resettled on Mongol and
Tibetan herding lands. Lafitte is writing a book on Tibetan
grasslands, and studies herding communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to familiarize ourselves with the logic of the World
Bank project,'' Lafitte said. ``Nothing we did was secret,
everything was open.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said he had shown police a copy of the letter he had
written to the World Bank on his plans to come to Qinghai. In the
letter, he quoted the Chinese official statement of June 24 that
``visitors are welcome to have extensive contacts with local
people, unattended by Chinese officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a vindication, the letter was seized as evidence of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners need no special permit to visit Dulan County, where
the men were seized. Yet they were accused of trespassing in a
restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you make an illegal visit to an open area?'' Lafitte
asked. ``I tried at the cost of enraging my inquisitor to define
what is an illegal interview. At one point, he said, `If you talk
to anyone, that's an illegal interview.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities wanted to know where the men had been, with whom
they had spoken and what they were told. Lafitte said he did not
question anyone specifically about the World Bank project, nor
about anything that could be construed as state secrets, personal
grievances, or complaints against the government. Nor, he insisted,
did he share opinions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte told security officers he was a development specialist
who studies nomadic civilizations. ``But they kept yelling at me,
`What is your true purpose? Why are you here? We know what your
true feelings are!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that saved him, Lafitte said, was knowing ``that the
only thing to do was to plead guilty early and often and apologize
for everything I did. That is the Chinese system.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said that Meston, in contrast, from the moment they were
picked up, seemed ``extremely nervous about signing confessions,
signing records, putting his index finger in red wax'' to mark
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte said he told officers they were ``making a big mistake,
that the world was watching, that this will prove counterproductive
to China's goal of furthering development. But they never really
heard or understood me.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are mumblings within the World Bank that the $40
million funding for the Qinghai project that was narrowly approved
might now be in jeopardy. A bank inspection team is scheduled to
visit the site next month.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte urged the bank to hold China to its promise that it
would allow unfettered visits by interested parties to the disputed
project site.

TOMS RIVER MAKES CHILD'S PLAY OF LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES OPENER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ For anyone wondering whether the team from
Toms River, N.J., deserves the nickname ``Beast from the East,''
they needed only to watch this confident bunch devour the team from
Phenix City, Ala., Sunday night in the opening round of the Little
League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Combining masterly pitching with a couple of powerful swings,
Toms River took the next step toward defending its World Series
title by defeating Phenix City, 6-0, before a crowd of 12,400 at
Howard J. Lamade Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River is only the third American team to return to the
Little League World Series the year after winning the title. Toms
River plays Boise, Idaho, on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka, Japan, defeated Victoria, British Columbia, by 7-3 in the
tournament's first game Sunday. The World Series is divided into
four-team American and international divisions. After round-robin
play in the divisions, the division champions will meet for the
title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor of Toms River pitched his second consecutive
one-hitter and his fifth consecutive shutout. He was supported by
two home runs _ a two-run shot by Jeff Burgdorff in the first
inning and a solo home run by Steve Bernath in second inning. Toms
River scored five runs in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor has been dominant this post-season. With Sunday night's
shutout, he has pitched 30 innings without allowing a run. Three
days after tossing a one-hitter in the regional tournament final,
Gaynor again baffled the opposing team with a mix of control and
raw power, and a nasty curve every now and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game is very important,'' said Mike Gaynor, Toms
River's manager and Casey's father, ``since you probably only need
one win to get into the U.S. championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing my fastball and curveball today,'' said Casey
Gaynor, who started last year's championship game against Japan but
did not earn the victory. ``I just wanted to throw strikes and make
them hit the ball. I guess my curveball is getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor was just as important at the plate Sunday night. In three
appearances, he got one hit and scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't hit anything,'' said Bryan Woodall, the
Phenix City third baseman. ``And everything we hit, they caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Alabama threatened, Toms River was bailed out by its
splendid defense. It has been so long since Toms River has
committed an error, Mike Gaynor could not remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Toms River's supporters made the nearly five-hour
drive to watch their team make another run at winning the Little
League World Series. They are mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers
and friends _ and they all wore black T-shirts that read ``Beasts
of the East.'' Their rambunctious cheerleader wore a gorilla suit.
The fans stood and chanted, ``Let's go East!'' and ``The beast is
back!'' The chants were so loud they drowned out everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Fontenelli, the grandfather of Toms River shortstop Chris
Fontenelli, was among the fans who made the trip. ``My heart just
bursts with pride today,'' Fontenelli said. ``Did you see those
three putouts Chris made?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The team plays with such teamwork,'' he added. ``It's still
early in the tournament, but they really put it all together
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the fans' support, Casey Gaynor said: ``It's really great to
have everyone from town come down and cheer for us. It helps our
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms River is trying to defend its championship with an almost
entirely new team. Only Gaynor and Eric Campesi played in the World
Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game, Kazuki Sumiyama and Kazutoshi Adachi
combined on a two-hitter for Japan against Canada. Japan last won
the World Series in 1976. Canada has never won it.
</P>
<P>
   Sumiyama was moved to first base after five innings despite not
having allowed a hit and walking just one. Manager Tsutomo Kameyama
said he pulled Sumiyama as an icebreaker for Adachi, who will pitch
Monday against a team from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

TENNIS NEEDS SAMPRAS AND AGASSI AS MUCH AS THEY NEED EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These guys are nothing alike: in rivalries, as in romance,
opposites attract. Even the corporate marketplace has been
reverential: one is Image, the other Milk Mustache. Whatever club
one belongs to is a club the other, in a twist on Groucho Marx's
credo, would be loath to join.
</P>
<P>
   But they do share the same swoosh, the same tony tax bracket,
the same intrusion of premature hair loss, the same semisorrowful
single guy marital status and, crucial to a deluded sport that
seems to breathe much easier when they are jostling for the same
trophy, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are again sharing the rivalry
that heated up men's tennis when this decade began.
</P>
<P>
   With the decade and millennium's final U.S. Open set to begin a
week from Monday, their timing couldn't be better. Sunday, while
the top-ranked Sampras was in the Hamptons nursing a sore hip back
to health for the Open, Agassi was busy bulldozing Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, in the Washington final.
</P>
<P>
   The victory not only moved Agassi past Kafelnikov to second in
the rankings, it also gave him the second seeding for the Open. If
form holds, the next time Agassi and Sampras exercise their
decade-old Grand Slam rivalry, they will be back where it all
began, in the final of the U.S. Open, the major tournament that
launched Sampras in 1990 and ascribed Zen master status to Agassi
in 1994 before breaking his heart in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   More than the sum of its parts, their rivalry, heir apparent to
the truncated point-counterpoint of Borg-McEnroe, combines the
punch of Frazier-Ali with the crosstown one-upsmanship of the
Mets-Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys can really revive tennis in America,'' Jack Kramer,
the Hall of Famer whose logo launched a zillion wooden rackets,
raved from courtside in Los Angeles earlier this month as Sampras
beat Agassi in a transcendent two tiebreaker final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a certain buzz with the rivalry kind of kicking up,''
Sampras admitted after kicking Agassi off the court in two sets in
the ATP Championship semifinal on Aug. 14 in suburban Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for tennis in America to have us two competing and
going at it like we've been the past couple of months,'' said the
28-year-old Sampras, who has twice used Agassi as his whipping boy
in U.S. Open finals and last month earned a 12th Grand Slam singles
title, tying him with Roy Emerson's men's record, by outgunning
Agassi in their high-octane final at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He forces me to add things to my game,'' said Sampras, whose
game was already chock full of artillery sufficient to secure him
the year-end No. 1 ranking for a record six years in succession.
</P>
<P>
   But he credits his on-again off-again rivalry with Agassi, which
he leads by a comfortable 16-10 margin, with pushing him to the
sustained heights necessary to sculpture a career that will
outstrip past and future champions. Agassi defeated Sampras for the
1995 Australian Open championship, defeated him that year on hard
courts at the Lipton tournament and the Canadian Open to earn
bragging rights to the No. 1 ranking. After Sampras dethroned him
at the U.S. Open that year, a chastened Agassi seemed to lose
interest. Sampras missed him.
</P>
<P>
   This March, with the rivalry still in mothballs, the top-ranked
Sampras offered up a requiem. ``What we had a couple of years ago
with the Nike commercials and the different games, the
personalities, playing the finals of the Open, if we could have
continued that over the next couple of years, it would have done
wonders for this game,'' he said. ``It was the perfect scenario for
us to really carry this game to a new level. I wish we could have
been consistent, maybe one day to be compared to a Borg-McEnroe
rivalry, but it never really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Without it, men's tennis didn't have much of a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   The jaws of life in this case was the 1999 French Open title in
June. It put Agassi in the record book as the fifth man in history
and the first since Rod Laver to wrestle all four Grand Slam titles
into his possession, and it resurrected the rivalry, and men's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Agassi, divorced and disciplined at 29, jogged back
into the thick of things, validated by a title and record that
Sampras had yet to pocket. In July, with four years elapsed since
they butted heads with a Grand Slam championship at stake, came
their Wimbledon final and then, as if making the most of the second
chance granted their rivalry, came a final in Los Angeles and the
semifinal in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   That those decisions too went Sampras' way seemed to matter less
than the impassioned tennis they inspired. ``You get to a certain
level where it's not about what you do, it's about just how well
you do it; he has a game that lends for periods of time of
genius,'' was Agassi's Zen-like explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Their next clash, if Agassi has a say in it, will be the U.S.
Open final. ``If I could only have one,'' said the bald one,
unbowed despite bowing in eight of their last 10 bouts, ``I would
take it at the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, he and Agassi aren't selfish enough to
grab every trophy. ``It's not just going to be Andre and I for the
next couple of years dominating the game,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   But there wouldn't be many complaints if they did.

COLOR CHOICE OF THE FUTURE? AMERICA'S GOING GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The color of money these days comes in shades
of gray. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From silver cars to brushed-steel refrigerators to gray clothes,
cool colors are in. According to color analysts, consumers are
looking for high-tech colors that evoke the coming century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the whole gray movement continuing into the
millennium,'' said Pat Tunsky, creative director at Henry Doneger
Associates of New York, color advisers to several industries.
``It's more of a futuristic color; the metals with brushed and
satin finishes, not high-shine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Correctly predicting consumer color preferences can make the
difference between huge profits and product failures. Studies show
nearly 40 percent of consumers will switch vehicle brands if they
can't get their preferred color. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When predicting color trends, analysts weigh economics,
environment, politics, history, sports, psychology and other
factors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gray and silver show the strong economy and conservatism, while
green symbolizes harmony and counteracts emotional stress.
Psychologists say a move to red cars would reflect a
``spend-it-now'' mind-set. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White and green, which regained popularity in 1993 and faded in
1998, still are the most popular colors for cars in the United
States, but silver has gained popularity in automotive segments
from sport-utility vehicles to luxury cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which tracks automotive color choices, said silver and
gray cars posted increases of up to 17 percent in various
categories in 1998, the last figures available. In 1997, the
increase was less than 7 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues had been fairly depressed for a while but are showing
quite a bit of movement now,'' said Matt Kester, spokesman for the
GM Design Center in Warren, Mich. ``You're also going to see a lot
of grays out there, which includes silver.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nick Allen, a partner in several area auto dealerships,
including Independence Lincoln-Mercury, said silver and light blues
are hot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Honda line, we can't keep enough of the `heather mist,'
which is kind of a silver,'' Allen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christine Dickey, color and trim manager for Toyota Motor Sales
USA in Torrance, Calif., said silver was all but extinct as a car
color in the late 1980s and early 1990s, so the public hasn't seen
it in a long time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks fresh, and the new silvers are brighter, shinier,
more reflective,'' Dickey said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's 4Runner sport-utility vehicle comes in a ``desert
dune'' color that's not a white, beige or silver, but some of all
three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It took off from the get-go and is now our lead color in
sport-utilities,'' Dickey said. ``And the `millennium silver' is
the hottest color in the Lexus GS.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Color Marketing Group, an international, nonprofit
association of 1,500 color designers based in Alexandria, Va.,
predicted the gray movement two years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, small-appliance manufacturers are responding by putting
brushed aluminum on everything from coffeepots to men's shavers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are adding gold tones to make it look even more
sophisticated,'' said Randy Voss, product manager for Panasonic
Home and Commercial Products Co. in Illinois. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. wants to see stainless-steel appliances
before it will consider ordering from a manufacturer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we don't expect it to be a top seller, we want to
see it,'' said Peggy Palter, a spokeswoman for Sears. ``Stainless
steel is very hot, especially in high-end appliances. It's a style
statement.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum appliances complement other silver items in the
kitchen such as toasters, utensils and trim on older appliances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dean of Loma Vista Hardware in Westport said furniture
sales had been strong for items such as a brushed-steel coffee
table and love seats with brushed-steel trim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of influence also is from fashion,'' said Pat Verlodt,
president of Color Services &AMP; Associates Inc. in Huntley, Ill.,
color consultants to manufacturers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nike, for example, has added a splash of silver on some of its
shoe lines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several national retailers reported that one-third of their
recent clothing inventories has been gray or gray-hued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Moss, a fashion director for Macy's, said gray was a new
alternative to black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver and gray will be the highlight colors of the millennium
season as we celebrate the new year,'' Moss said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Color trends help motivate customers to make a purchase based on
style instead of waiting for an item to wear out. After a decade of
black as the fashion color, consumers were ready for a change, but
nothing too radical, according to the experts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to take one baby step into a new direction, and gray
has all the same properties as black. It's an empowering color,
very stable, very basic,'' said Leatrice Eiseman of the Pantone
Color Institute near Seattle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray ... is high-tech and futuristic into the new
millennium.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, hunter green was the accent color for
households in everything from towels to trash cans. Now, softer
shades such as pale pink and butter yellow will be trendy in
clothing, kitchen utensils, bathroom accessories, tiles and more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some companies are beginning to play with a more provocative
palette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is picking up the vibrant colors popular in urban
neighborhoods and using yellows, purples and oranges on its sporty
and small cars and trucks. The 1999 Mustang GT convertible comes in
such ``impact'' colors as ``grabber lime'' and ``grabber green
metallic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new and expensive treatment called ``mystic paint''
will cause cars to change colors under different lighting, say from
a purplish to a greenish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, experts expect silver to return to its
historic place as an accent color. That's not too bad when you
consider the once-hot color of avocado has all but fallen off the
consumer map. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver looks so elegant and adds a very, very high-society,
high-style effect into people's lives that doesn't necessarily cost
a lot,'' Voss said. ``Consumers very much want to get the best
value for the dollars available.'' &QL;

100-METER DASH TO GLORY FOR BOTH GREENE AND JONES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ The straw hat came spinning out of the stands
and landed on the fast track near Maurice Greene's incomparably
fast feet. It is the way Sevillans show approval at the bullfights,
the traditional form of entertainment in this traditional city, and
like a triumphant matador who had just been awarded both ears and
the tail by an approving jury, Greene leaned over and joyfully
tossed the hat back in the direction of its owner.
</P>
<P>
   He then celebrated American-style by completing a victory lap at
the world track and field championships with his nation's flag in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Greene had just recovered from a shaky start to catch Bruny
Surin of Canada and win his second consecutive world title in the
100 meters, missing his own world record by just one-hundredth of a
second. What made that American flag all the more appropriate was
that Greene's teammate Marion Jones had already won her second
consecutive world title in the women's 100.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm and remarkable night in Seville, and though
neither Greene's nor Jones' victory was anything close to a
surprise, the intensity and historic pace of both finals _ each
more hotly contested than predicted _ created a palpable buzz in
the Estadio Olimpico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought this was going to be a cakewalk, but I think
Bruny and I produced a great spectacle tonight, maybe one of the
best,'' said Greene, who finished in 9.80 seconds to Surin's 9.84,
which tied Surin with Donovan Bailey, the reigning Olympic champion
and a fellow Canadian, for the third best time in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely tough to run that fast and still finish
second,'' Surin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ran fast enough to finish first: getting off to a fine
start, controlling her power beautifully and crossing the finish
line in 10.70 seconds, the fifth fastest time in history. Only the
late Florence Griffith-Joyner in that unexpected and remarkable
summer of 1988 and Jones herself have run faster with a legal wind.
This was perhaps the most impressive time of Jones' short career
because her personal best of 10.65 came at relatively high altitude
last year in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But what was surprising about this race was that, despite Jones'
superb time, she beat her countrywoman Inger Miller by only
nine-hundredths of a second. Ekaterini Thanou of Greece, another
fast-rising sprinter, took the bronze medal in 10.84 seconds. In
all, six women broke 11 seconds, which had never happened before in
a women's 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no walk in the park anymore,'' said Jones, who has not
lost a sprint since 1997. ``Everybody is right there running
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed runs in Miller's family. A Californian, she is the
daughter of the former Jamaican Olympian Lennox Miller, who won a
silver medal in the men's 100 in 1968 and a bronze medal in 1972.
Lennox coached Inger until this season, when, with her father's
approval, she joined Greene and the team of runners who are coached
by John Smith, a former American Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a reputation for helping his athletes peak for major
championships, and Miller certainly peaked here, running three
personal bests in two days. Perhaps she should have sensed it
coming when she beat Greene out of the starting blocks in training
last week. ``We're going to see some really good rivalries going on
next year; obviously it's not a one-woman show,'' said Miller, who
will try to push Jones again in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Jones will try to win her second gold medal of
this championship on Monday night in the long jump. Her family
already has won two golds, and before Jones walked on the track to
race in the semifinals Sunday, her husband, CJ Hunter, who won the
shot-put on Saturday, made his trip to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very big motivation for me,'' said Jones, who watched
her husband's dramatic winning throw from the stands. ``I was very
emotional Sunday after CJ won the gold just because in my opinion
he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. It was a wonderful way
to start the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Greene and Jones burst to international
prominence on the same night in Athens by winning the 100s at the
world championship. Since then, they have established their
dominance, become major stars in Europe with high hopes at home and
broadened their ambitions. Jones wants to win an unprecedented four
gold medals here; Greene wants to win three and become the first
man to sweep the 100 and 200 in this championship.
</P>
<P>
   His chances improved considerably when his chief rival in the
200, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, withdrew from the semifinals in
the 100 Sunday night, citing a thigh injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on a silver platter now,'' said Ato Boldon, Greene's
training partner and the reigning world 200 champion, who is here
as a television commentator instead of a competitor because of an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   It was a brutally hot afternoon and early evening: one
thermometer in the city center at 6:30 p.m. showed a reading of 113
degrees. It made it rough on the competitors in the heptathlon, won
by Eunice Barber of France, who had to compete before the sun had
slipped behind the oval opening in the stadium. Korsten Kobs of
Germany, the gold medalist in the hammer throw, celebrated by
jogging across the infield and diving into the water-filled
steeplechase pit.
</P>
<P>
   But sprinters generally relish the heat, and Greene, who grew up
running in steamy Kansas City summers, relishes it more than most.
By the time Greene walked onto the track for the final, the
temperature had dropped to 86 degrees, and while the other
sprinters stood still near their blocks as their names were
announced, Greene paced and strutted in his lane, eyes wide,
shoulders bobbing and tongue slipping in and out of his mouth as if
he were preparing to devour something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he's getting ready for a bar fight, and, in
essence, he is,'' Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight would start poorly for Greene, however, as he stumbled
out of the blocks. But as Surin accelerated toward an upset, Greene
kept his composure and, in trademark fashion, his head down. He
caught the Canadian and moved in front slightly with about 20
meters remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 75 or 80 meters, I believed I was going to win,''
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Smith: ``I was impressed with the way he came back, Carl
Lewis-style.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was soon shouting up at Boldon in the stands that the
victory had been for him. The two are uncommonly close friends for
rivals, and shortly after Greene had returned the hat and the
compliment to the stands, Boldon and another friend, the hurdler
Larry Wade, went out on the track. The three were soon locked in a
collective embrace, but Greene stands alone in the record books
with the two fastest times in history, and if not for that stumble
Sunday night, the world record might already be lower than 9.79
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go faster, believe me, I can go faster,'' Greene said. &QL;

GOODY-TV (Undated) _ Never let it be said there's nothing new under
the television sun.Each fall season brings with it a raft of new
shows brimming with the promise of hope, the joy of discovery, the
sight of people puking on each other and the threat of eating dogs.
Oh, sorry. Those last two only apply to this fall season. They may
seem like unlikely trends, but at least five new shows include
eruptive nausea; characters in two others threaten to eat the
canine pets of other characters. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will

YODAVILLE _ It's Arizona's newest town. But don't expect the
citizens in the harsh desert near Mexico to vote or pay taxes.
That's because the 120 inhabitants, if you want to call stick
people that, are raked regularly with bombs, missiles and
machine-gun fire. Powerful lasers sweep their streets.
</P>
<P>
   This is Yodaville, a village of 167 buildings, some four stories
high, made from thousands of stacked, surplus cluster bomb
containers. It resembles a bleak, nightmarish Legoland. But
military planners say it's vital for training for future wars.
Finished two months ago, Yodaville, 35 miles southeast of Yuma on
the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, is the U.S. military's
first urban bombing range. It is replete with streets, street
lights and civilian and military cehicles. ``We even looked in

 CORRECTS SPELLING OF MANUEL (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo missed his summer vacation
because of the disabled-parking scandal, and from that frustration
has come a running joke: If UCLA corrals enough oral commitments
this fall, Toledo can take a makeup vacation in December, the
traditional height of recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including Toledo, actually expects the Bruins to fill
their scholarship allotment (approximately 18) before December, but
their seven commitments stand as the highest preseason total of the
Toledo era.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who held a light practice Sunday night, are
concentrating on linemen this fall. Only right guard Mike Saffer
and left tackle Blake Worley remain from 1998's heralded offensive
line class _ Scott Wiegand and Jeff Wright quit, Steve Morgan has
moved to defense _ while defensive linemen are the most-coveted
commodity in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get six or seven linemen, offense and defense,''
recruiting coordinator Gary Bernardi said. ``After the lines, it's
one guy here, one guy there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall recruiting hits high gear Sept. 1, when coaches begin
calling prospects. Here are seven names to watch from UCLA's
most-wanted list:
</P>
<P>
   __ Travis Johnson. A 240-pound defensive end from Notre Dame
High, Johnson is the best pass rusher in the state, a combination
of size and speed normally found on Florida State's roster. He
attended UCLA's scrimmage Saturday and said his finalists are
Michigan, Florida State, Tennessee, Ohio State, USC and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Alex Holmes. A 290-pound tight end from Harvard-Westlake,
Holmes has exhausted his prep eligibility and will spend the fall
comparing UCLA to Michigan, his father's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   __ Manuel White. A 220-pound tailback from Valencia, White's
finalists are USC, Ohio State, Arizona State, Washington and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Bruins are pursuing White despite an oral commitment
from Sacramento tailback Albert Hollis, the state's top-rated
runner. Because sophomore DeShaun Foster could bolt for the NFL
after next season, the Bruins want two tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Paul Mociler. A 300-pound offensive lineman from St. John
Bosco, Mociler is as touted as recent UCLA signees Worley, Saffer,
Brian Polak and Shane Lehmann. His final three are UCLA, Cal and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matt Grootegoed. A 200-pound safety considered Mater Dei's
best prospect ever, he's considering UCLA and Michigan, according
to Student Sports Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   __ Willie Dixon. An elite receiver from Sacramento, Dixon has
UCLA, USC, Miami and Florida State on his short list.
</P>
<P>
   __ D.J. Williams. A 225-pound linebacker from powerhouse Concord
De La Salle, Williams is the most-coveted California prospect in
years (any position) and has drawn comparisons to a young Lawrence
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who's pursuing Williams, one college recruiter said, ``The
world.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Local update: Newbury Park tight end Will Svitek has received
scholarship offers from USC, Stanford, Ohio State, Arizona State
and Arizona but not UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bruins) are the only school that hasn't offered and it's
frustrating,'' Svitek said at Saturday's scrimmage. ``They told me
they haven't gotten a good evaluation because we ran a spread
offense last year and I didn't play normal tight end. But this
year, we're changing. The coaches said they'll look at me. I'll
have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming up: UCLA's next commitment could come from Groodegoed,
who's expected to announce before the season, or Carlsbad offensive
lineman Steve Vieira, who's also considering Colorado and
Washington. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

ISLAMIC NATIONS URGED TO KEEP THEIR CITIZENS OUT OF REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia sought help Sunday from foreign governments
whose citizens it suspects are participating in the Islamic
uprising in the republic of Dagestan. President Boris N. Yeltsin
has called the conflict, now in its third week, a threat to
Russia's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Moscow claimed an important battlefield victory,
saying its forces had captured part of the village of Tando, a key
rebel base.
</P>
<P>
   But a rebel statement, released over the militants' Web site,
rejected the claim, saying that despite a major offensive by
Russian forces, the rebels still held the village. For most of the
past week the fiercest fighting has centered on Tando, a tiny
strategic village overlooking the town of Botlikh and the valley
where Russian forces are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' main bases are in two villages above Tando, Ansalta
and Rakhata.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rushailo, Russia's top law enforcement official, said
Sunday that volunteers from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia,
and Pakistan may be assisting the Chechen-led Islamic insurgents.
Rushailo said the Russian Foreign Ministry has sent appeals to
these countries, asking for assistance in stoping the alleged flow
of mercenaries into Dagestan. He added that Moscow did not believe
that the volunteers were acting with the blessing of their
governments.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Russia had alleged foreign
involvement. On Aug. 14, Russia sent a letter to the G-7, the
European Union and the Islamic Conference claiming that
``irrefutable facts attest that the terrorists are receiving
financial, material and other assistance from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began on Aug. 7, when Islamic militants, led by the
34-year-old Chechen rebel leader Shaimil Basayev, crossed over
Chechnya's rugged border with Dagestan and captured several
villages. The rebel's stated goal is to pry the region free from
Russia and create an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 until 1996, Moscow fought a bloody 20-month war
against Chechnya, which gained de facto independence from Russia.
After pulling out its troops in late 1996, Moscow continued to
claim the republic as part of Russia, despite being unable to
influence events there. Late last week, Russian warplanes struck
villages inside Chechnya near the Dagestan border. Chechnya's
president, Aslan Maskhadov, has repeatedly said that his government
has no ties to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Kremlin appeared to be preparing the
public for another long war in the region. In a radio interview
Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as
saying it was ``impossible to expect a quick solution'' to the
uprising and that the conflict represents a ``real threat to
Russia's integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Aug. 10 that Russian
forces would crush the rebellion in a matter of weeks, a claim that
now appears to have been optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Iskandarian, a Moscow-based analyst said the region is
slowly but surely sliding out of Moscow's orbit. ``The departure of
the Caucusus from Russia is not an act, but a process. This process
is real, it is happening, but it is happening slowly,'' said
Iskandarian. ``The process is cultural rather than political. If
you ask me if the Caucusus are going to cease to be a part of
Russia in the near future, I would say I don't know. But the
cultural process of seperation is definately taking place.''

NO RUNNING? NO PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ When USC defeated Purdue last August in
118-degree heat on the Coliseum field, players presented a game
ball to strength coach Matt Schiotz for their superior
conditioning. So it seems like Schiotz might be putting his
reputation on the line by advising USC coach Paul Hackett to have
the team skip wind sprints during two-a-day practices at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   But the strength coach is confident he is not letting the
players off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see we are in shape. I don't feel fatigue will be a
factor for us,'' Schiotz said. ``We're a lot stronger than we were
last year at this time. The guys are out here in better
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiotz said 80 percent of the team attended every summer
workout, as opposed to 63 percent last season. Although Hackett
admitted being ``concerned'' about not running, he decided to take
Schiotz's advice. USC finally resumed wind sprints Saturday and
Sunday because it only practiced once.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scrimmage follow-up: Hackett said after watching tapes of
Saturday's scrimmage he liked the way the Trojans' defense played
as a unit and thought it was ahead of the offense. He mentioned
reserve defensive linemen Bobby DeMars and Darren Collins as
players who stood out. Offensively, he liked quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst and offensive guard Donta Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was also impressed with linebacker Markus Steele, who
has been in camp two days, and said he could possibly start the
Hawaii game.
</P>
<P>
   __ What about the line? The offensive line has more experience
than last year but wasn't exactly dominating in the first
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like we improved at all, but they're all
stronger and quicker,'' quarterback Carson Palmer said. ``Some of
the guys were just drained by the end of the scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scholarship for Arbet? Hackett said it's early, but he might
consider giving freshman walk-on cornerback Kevin Arbet a
scholarship. Arbet, from Stockton, is the son of former USC wide
receiver Jeff Simmons, who caught 56 passes in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's made a real case at this point,'' Hackett said.
``I'm very impressed. I recruited his father.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bumps and bruises: Linebacker Zeke Moreno missed practice
with a hip flexor that has bothered him for several days, but he
will try to return today. Freshman wide receiver Marcell Allmond
(hamstring) is also expected back.

ORGANIC FARMERS STRUGGLE TO KEEP CROPS FROM CHEMICAL
CONTAMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALHOUN, Mo. _ Gary Anson worries that today's chicken manure
isn't what it used to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He struggles mightily to keep his corn, soybeans and wheat
pristine _ free of chemicals and laboratory-tinkered genetics. When
he succeeds, his crops earn organic status and fetch a premium
price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But keeping his fields unspoiled by high-tech agriculture is a
chore without end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals sprayed on a neighboring field can drift his way.
Pollen, blown from another farmer's genetically modified corn, can
travel miles in a storm. And Anson worries that the chicken dung he
used in the past to replace chemical fertilizer might now carry
remnants of feed made from gene-spliced corn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming at me from every direction,'' said the 62-year-old
organic farmer. ``I've got nowhere to hide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anson belongs to a growing class of farmers trying to sell food
in a lucrative market even as the planting of genetically
engineered crops explodes across the American breadbasket _
threatening to spoil the organic fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one level, organic farmers have much in common with their
neighbors growing genetically engineered crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both are fast-expanding sectors. While organic farmers still
till a relatively tiny part of the country's farmland, their
numbers have more than doubled in the 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government approved the use of gene-tailored
seed in late 1995 and it now dominates the corn, soybean and cotton
fields of America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organic and high-tech farmers both put greater investments in
their crops. Organic crops require a tractor to pass through a
field perhaps six times as much as with conventional farming.
Genetically engineered seed costs much more than conventional
hybrids and typically doesn't produce extra seed for planting a
crop the following year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet they can make for troublesome neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Jung, who farms organically near Cosby, Mo., contends
herbicide sprayed on a neighbor's field drifted across 70 acres of
his land in May 1998. He couldn't sell crops contaminated by
chemicals to the organic market, so he sued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although a settlement was reached earlier this month, the
contractor who was spraying the neighbor's field disputes that its
herbicide drifted over the Jung property. The herbicide is
commonplace on farms in the area and long has been used on foods
that end up on American dinner tables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But because Jung needed certification that his crops were
organic _ key to selling for premium prices on crops headed mostly
to Europe _ any contamination would spoil his crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was not organic,'' said Richard Yocum, the lawyer who
defended the herbicide sprayer, ``I don't think there would have
been any problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Jung worries about what he calls ``gene drift,'' genetically
modified plants from nearby fields pollinating his plants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule at all to say they can't come and plant that
stuff right next to me,'' he said. ``I'm defenseless.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet he concedes that his organic operation creates dilemmas for
his neighbors. If he were a conventional farmer, some windblown
herbicide or pesticide would go largely unnoticed and unlitigated.
But with Jung nearby, the time a neighbor has to spray is limited
not just by the planting schedule but by which way the wind is
blowing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something else,'' he said, ``for them to worry
about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organic market has been most vocal about crop
segregation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have been far more wary of chemicals in their crops
than Americans. They have been especially nervous, too, about
consuming genetically engineered crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That cost Chuck Walker the sale of 80,000 bags of corn chips at
$2.50 each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His Terra Prima firm has been selling Apache brand organic
tortilla chips in Europe since 1990. Last December, a Dutch
distributor's test revealed they contained a fraction of corn from
genetically engineered plants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It just devastated us,'' Walker said. ``We had to throw all
the chips away.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his company's organic-only reputation tarnished in Europe,
Walker said sales this year fell by nearly half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He checked records on the farms, elevators and the mill his corn
passed through. None showed any evidence of the genetically
engineered crop. He concluded that an organic farmer's field in
Texas _ ``it might have just been a few rows'' _ were pollinated by
a neighbor's laboratory-customized corn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What was special about the corn that contaminated his chips? It
was tinkered with genetically to build in the pesticide Bacillus
thuringiensis, or Bt, that kills the corn borer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have no problems with Bt. The pesticide, in fact, is a
natural substance that organic farmers use widely. The European
objection stems from designing corn genes to contain Bt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and Heinz have both moved to different producers so they
can assure their European customers that they don't rely on
genetically engineered corn or soybeans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ticciati heads Mothers for Natural Law, a group that
sprung from the transcendental meditation movement and lobbies
against genetically engineered food; she believes Americans pay far
too little attention to the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm always giving interviews to people in Europe,'' she
said. ``This is huge over there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies have yet to unearth any danger in consuming genetically
modified plants. Critics, in fact, worry primarily that the
long-term effects of consuming genetically modified foods are
unknown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the new technology can rattle off a string of
environmental benefits: greater production with less use of
chemical pesticides and herbicides and lower fuel bills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, for instance,
someone who once needed to spray several times a season to kill
weeds needs to do so only once. And, unlike traces of the
long-popular atrazine that still is found in soil on many farms,
the Roundup herbicide disappears days after application. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Beavis, a geneticist who has spent most of his career
working on agricultural problems, argues that boosting the yields
on Midwestern farms reduces pressure to level dwindling forests in
the rest of the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, he admits to sharing the worries of Europeans about the
health effects of genetically engineered crops and the risks of
introducing man-made species into the environment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have
approved their use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Beavis said, the challenge of keeping them separate from
organic foods is baffling. A crop that escapes drifting pollen
could still be contaminated in a cooperative's grain elevator or at
a mill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just virtually impossible to segregate,'' said Beavis,
now a researcher at the National Center for Genome Resources.
``We'd have to change our whole agricultural system to do that
(and) it would interfere with the freedom of farmers to do as they
please.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, organic farmers rely on buffers they plant
around their fields and informal neighbor-to-neighbor agreements
about when and where to plant what. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It could still make for a pretty uncomfortable situation if my
neighbor is growing Bt-corn,'' said Ed Reznicek, an organic farmer
near Goff, Kan., who trades labor and shares equipment with a
conventional farmer. ``You want to work with people, but it can be
hard for both sides.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes nature can help. Soybeans are self-pollinating, so the
wind poses no genetic contamination. Most corn varieties favored by
organic farmers tassel later in the season than those used by
conventional farmers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, a crop's organic pedigree came from inspectors such
as Margit Kaltenekker, who travels a circuit checking on farms for
the Organic Crop Improvement Association. She looks at fields,
discusses management techniques and peruses a farmer's receipts for
seed and fertilizer to establish the absence of chemical helpers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In today's agriculture, however, many organic farmers are also
spending hundreds of dollars per field for genetic tests to prove
their crops avoided contamination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for them,'' Kaltenekker said. ``They can do
everything right and still have things ruined by the guy a mile
away.''

ORGANIC FARMERS STRUGGLE TO KEEP CROPS FROM CHEMICAL
CONTAMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALHOUN, Mo. _ Gary Anson worries that today's chicken manure
isn't what it used to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He struggles mightily to keep his corn, soybeans and wheat
pristine _ free of chemicals and laboratory-tinkered genetics. When
he succeeds, his crops earn organic status and fetch a premium
price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But keeping his fields unspoiled by high-tech agriculture is a
chore without end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals sprayed on a neighboring field can drift his way.
Pollen, blown from another farmer's genetically modified corn, can
travel miles in a storm. And Anson worries that the chicken dung he
used in the past to replace chemical fertilizer might now carry
remnants of feed made from gene-spliced corn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming at me from every direction,'' said the 62-year-old
organic farmer. ``I've got nowhere to hide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anson belongs to a growing class of farmers trying to sell food
in a lucrative market even as the planting of genetically
engineered crops explodes across the American breadbasket _
threatening to spoil the organic fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one level, organic farmers have much in common with their
neighbors growing genetically engineered crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both are fast-expanding sectors. While organic farmers still
till a relatively tiny part of the country's farmland, their
numbers have more than doubled in the 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government approved the use of gene-tailored
seed in late 1995 and it now dominates the corn, soybean and cotton
fields of America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organic and high-tech farmers both put greater investments in
their crops. Organic crops require a tractor to pass through a
field perhaps six times as much as with conventional farming.
Genetically engineered seed costs much more than conventional
hybrids and typically doesn't produce extra seed for planting a
crop the following year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet they can make for troublesome neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Jung, who farms organically near Cosby, Mo., contends
herbicide sprayed on a neighbor's field drifted across 70 acres of
his land in May 1998. He couldn't sell crops contaminated by
chemicals to the organic market, so he sued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although a settlement was reached earlier this month, the
contractor who was spraying the neighbor's field disputes that its
herbicide drifted over the Jung property. The herbicide is
commonplace on farms in the area and long has been used on foods
that end up on American dinner tables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But because Jung needed certification that his crops were
organic _ key to selling for premium prices on crops headed mostly
to Europe _ any contamination would spoil his crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was not organic,'' said Richard Yocum, the lawyer who
defended the herbicide sprayer, ``I don't think there would have
been any problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Jung worries about what he calls ``gene drift,'' genetically
modified plants from nearby fields pollinating his plants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule at all to say they can't come and plant that
stuff right next to me,'' he said. ``I'm defenseless.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet he concedes that his organic operation creates dilemmas for
his neighbors. If he were a conventional farmer, some windblown
herbicide or pesticide would go largely unnoticed and unlitigated.
But with Jung nearby, the time a neighbor has to spray is limited
not just by the planting schedule but by which way the wind is
blowing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something else,'' he said, ``for them to worry
about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organic market has been most vocal about crop
segregation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have been far more wary of chemicals in their crops
than Americans. They have been especially nervous, too, about
consuming genetically engineered crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That cost Chuck Walker the sale of 80,000 bags of corn chips at
$2.50 each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His Terra Prima firm has been selling Apache brand organic
tortilla chips in Europe since 1990. Last December, a Dutch
distributor's test revealed they contained a fraction of corn from
genetically engineered plants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It just devastated us,'' Walker said. ``We had to throw all
the chips away.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his company's organic-only reputation tarnished in Europe,
Walker said sales this year fell by nearly half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He checked records on the farms, elevators and the mill his corn
passed through. None showed any evidence of the genetically
engineered crop. He concluded that an organic farmer's field in
Texas _ ``it might have just been a few rows'' _ were pollinated by
a neighbor's laboratory-customized corn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What was special about the corn that contaminated his chips? It
was tinkered with genetically to build in the pesticide Bacillus
thuringiensis, or Bt, that kills the corn borer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have no problems with Bt. The pesticide, in fact, is a
natural substance that organic farmers use widely. The European
objection stems from designing corn genes to contain Bt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and Heinz have both moved to different producers so they
can assure their European customers that they don't rely on
genetically engineered corn or soybeans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ticciati heads Mothers for Natural Law, a group that
sprung from the transcendental meditation movement and lobbies
against genetically engineered food; she believes Americans pay far
too little attention to the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm always giving interviews to people in Europe,'' she
said. ``This is huge over there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies have yet to unearth any danger in consuming genetically
modified plants. Critics, in fact, worry primarily that the
long-term effects of consuming genetically modified foods are
unknown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the new technology can rattle off a string of
environmental benefits: greater production with less use of
chemical pesticides and herbicides and lower fuel bills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, for instance,
someone who once needed to spray several times a season to kill
weeds needs to do so only once. And, unlike traces of the
long-popular atrazine that still is found in soil on many farms,
the Roundup herbicide disappears days after application. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Beavis, a geneticist who has spent most of his career
working on agricultural problems, argues that boosting the yields
on Midwestern farms reduces pressure to level dwindling forests in
the rest of the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, he admits to sharing the worries of Europeans about the
health effects of genetically engineered crops and the risks of
introducing man-made species into the environment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have
approved their use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Beavis said, the challenge of keeping them separate from
organic foods is baffling. A crop that escapes drifting pollen
could still be contaminated in a cooperative's grain elevator or at
a mill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just virtually impossible to segregate,'' said Beavis,
now a researcher at the National Center for Genome Resources.
``We'd have to change our whole agricultural system to do that
(and) it would interfere with the freedom of farmers to do as they
please.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, organic farmers rely on buffers they plant
around their fields and informal neighbor-to-neighbor agreements
about when and where to plant what. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It could still make for a pretty uncomfortable situation if my
neighbor is growing Bt-corn,'' said Ed Reznicek, an organic farmer
near Goff, Kan., who trades labor and shares equipment with a
conventional farmer. ``You want to work with people, but it can be
hard for both sides.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes nature can help. Soybeans are self-pollinating, so the
wind poses no genetic contamination. Most corn varieties favored by
organic farmers tassel later in the season than those used by
conventional farmers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, a crop's organic pedigree came from inspectors such
as Margit Kaltenekker, who travels a circuit checking on farms for
the Organic Crop Improvement Association. She looks at fields,
discusses management techniques and peruses a farmer's receipts for
seed and fertilizer to establish the absence of chemical helpers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In today's agriculture, however, many organic farmers are also
spending hundreds of dollars per field for genetic tests to prove
their crops avoided contamination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for them,'' Kaltenekker said. ``They can do
everything right and still have things ruined by the guy a mile
away.''

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL;

HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

FLAWED ARRESTS RISE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FORD FESSENDEN and DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dawad Joseph, a 16-year-old high school sophomore,
was walking to his mother's office with four friends one afternoon
in May 1997 when the young men found themselves in the middle of a
police drug sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said he was arrested on charges of possessing and selling
drugs, even though police records show no drugs were found on him.
Taken to the local police station house with about 10 other people,
he said, he was strip-searched and put in a holding cell for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning, when he was taken to the County Courthouse
for arraignment, he was abruptly freed after a prosecutor reviewed
his arrest and decided it would not stand up in court. Last year
the city paid Joseph's family $12,000 to settle a lawsuit for false
arrest, which city lawyers said stemmed from a case of mistaken
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Though crime in the city has ebbed to historic lows, the New
York City police arrested more people than ever last year. The
inevitable result, courthouse lawyers and some former prosecutors
say, is a surge in the number of flawed arrests. More and more of
those arrested, like Joseph, were jailed and released without ever
having been formally charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, prosecutors tossed out 18,000 of the 345,000 arrests
made in the city even before a judge reviewed the charges, more
than double the number of four years before.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, about 50 people a day are processed through the
booking system and released because prosecutors reject the charges
against them, often after they have spent hours or overnight in
packed holding cells.
</P>
<P>
   The police contend that the quality of their arrests has not
declined and that prosecutors are failing to prosecute after valid
arrests. But prosecutors are in some cases openly critical of the
quality of the Police Department's felony arrests. More than a
third of felony arrests were reduced before arraignment last year,
and a quarter more were later dismissed, both figures up
substantially from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   All told, more than 140,000 of the 350,000 cases disposed of in
court last year ended in a dismissal, a 60 percent increase in
dismissals over 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest increase has come in the use of a legal device
called adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, or ACD. Under an
ACD, charges against defendants are dismissed as long as they stay
out of trouble, typically for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The legal device was created to keep court dockets and jails
from becoming overcrowded, while giving minor offenders a chance at
a clean slate. Police officials say they do not like the
adjournments, but their use has skyrocketed during Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's administration _ more than 85,000 were handed out last
year, up from 35,000 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times computer study of refusals to prosecute in
Manhattan during the first six weeks of 1999 suggest that many of
the cases come from minority neighborhoods, which have been the
focus of much of the stepped-up enforcement activity of the city
police and the source of complaints of police harassment.

NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS ROSE 2 PERCENT IN YEAR ENDING IN MARCH
'98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Along with high tech, there's another growth
industry around: state and local governments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers they employ _ everybody from teachers to
police officers to highway laborers _ rose 2 percent in the year
ending in March 1998, according to a recently released report from
the U.S. Census Bureau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas stands out. Based on the size of its population, it has a
particularly large public payroll. Missouri ranked closer to the
middle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Payroll records in Johnson County, Kan., part of suburban Kansas
City, illustrate what's been happening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the county employed the equivalent of 2,300 workers.
Four years later, the number hit 2,900. Next year the number should
reach 3,400. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson County government has grown too large too fast,'' said
George Gross, chairman of the County Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments nationwide employed the equivalent
of 14.5 million workers, up from 14.2 million the previous year,
the census report shows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent the number of employees working the
equivalent of a full-time staffer. Governments actually employ more
people, some of whom work part-time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calculated on a per-resident basis, Kansas has more public
employees than all but five states. Missouri slightly exceeded the
national average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest areas of public employment: teachers in
elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities; police
officers; and firefighters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In Johnson County, we've added hundreds of employees over the
last four years,'' Gross said. ``I personally feel we can do with
fewer employees.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Told of the national census findings, Gross said, ``I find it
almost alarming.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Increases in public employment don't
automatically mean waste is occurring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, it can be argued that the needs of Johnson County
and other areas change as population rises. Jail expansion is one
reason for more employees in Johnson County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report was based on counts and estimates for
March 1998. In Missouri, public employment was 297,864, up from
290,054 the previous year. In Kansas, public employment was
167,295, up from 162,776. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it demonstrates that there could be administrative
savings,'' University of Kansas political science professor Burdett
Loomis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of reasons, including the size of a state and its
social and political history, control how many workers are employed
by government, Loomis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, he noted, has many small rural counties and school
districts. While consolidating them might lower public payrolls, he
said, communities wouldn't easily approve of losing their
courthouses, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, he said, Kansas created six institutions of higher
learning, deciding to give its young people plenty of educational
opportunities. Today, he said, the state probably wouldn't take
such an expensive step. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides cities, counties and school districts, Kansas sports a
long list of special types of local governments: everything from
utility supply boards to groundwater management districts. Other
states don't have so many. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansans like local government,'' said Don Moler, executive
director of the League of Kansas Municipalities. ``We have the
amount of services the public wants.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas should cut back on public workers, countered Karl
Peterjohn, executive director of the Kansas Taxpayers Network. Laws
to restrict spending and taxes, he said, would hold down the
payroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of government here, the survey reflects that
fact,'' Peterjohn said. ``We have no limitations on our ability to
grow government.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, he noted, has a state spending lid called the Hancock
Amendment, something that has been proposed but not enacted in
Kansas. And Missouri, he noted, has proportionately fewer public
employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau study raises those kinds of questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider Iowa, a state with a population similar to Kansas. On a
per-person basis, it doesn't employ nearly as many state and local
workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee, a state with nearly the same population as
Missouri, employs fewer public workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers do not include federal government workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president pro tem of the Missouri Senate, Ed Quick, a
Democrat, has seen the public-employee question from three sides.
He once worked as a firefighter in Kansas City. Then he served on
the Kansas City Council. Now he leads the state Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will agree on whether there are too many public
employees, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got those who think we do and those who think we
don't,'' Quick said. ``Overall, I don't think we're out of line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, having more workers should mean better
services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on a per-resident basis, Kansas has more street
and highway workers than Missouri, the Census Bureau report
showed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Past studies also have found Kansas roads in better condition
than Missouri roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citizens want a voice in local governments, said Sen. Dick Bond,
a Republican who leads the Kansas Senate. They have a lot bigger
voice in smaller towns than in cities the size of Kansas City, Bond
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joining together school districts or cities might result in
fewer public employees. But Bond said citizens aren't demanding
government consolidation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not hear an unhappy public,'' Bond said. &QL;

COMMENTARY: A CULTURE OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ One of the most remarkable
institutions in post-apartheid South Africa is the Constitutional
Court, created to enforce the rules of the new democracy. In its
courtroom the other day there was an argument that threw dramatic
light on the way this country, and the world, has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The case was this. South African immigration law provides that a
foreign ``spouse'' of someone here may be admitted as an immigrant.
Gay and lesbian individuals and organizations challenged the law's
constitutionality, arguing that it discriminated against same-sex
couples who were committed partners but could not legally marry.
</P>
<P>
   The new South African Constitution includes a sweeping Bill of
Rights. It forbids discrimination on grounds, among others, of
race, gender, religion, ``marital status'' or ``sexual
orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the government, Essop Patel urged the court to
uphold the immigration law despite those constitutional guarantees.
He said the concept of sovereignty gave Parliament plenary power
over immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can the immigration law be inconsistent with the
Constitution?'' the court's president, Arthur Chaskalson, asked.
Patel struggled to escape that and similar questions but finally
answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was discrimination, Patel said, it was allowable as a
way for the state to protect the institution of the family.
``Aren't you protecting stereotypes,'' Justice Laurie Ackermann
asked, of what sexual relations and family should be?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really needed in this country,'' Patel said, ``is a
law recognizing domestic partnerships.'' He asked the court to give
Parliament time to act. The judges asked how much time. He could
not say.
</P>
<P>
   Counsel for those challenging the law, Wim Trengove, was asked
by the judges what they should do if they agreed with him that it
was unconstitutionally discriminatory. Should they strike down the
benefit for alien spouses? Or read into the statute a like
advantage for same-sex partners? What about unmarried heterosexual
couples?
</P>
<P>
   Trengove said the court should confine itself to this complaint
and read into the law a benefit for homosexual life partners.
Members of the court expressed concern that that might put them in
too legislative a role.
</P>
<P>
   One notable aspect of the argument was the understanding,
respectful view that everyone took of homosexuality. South African
society, black and white, was in the past deeply homophobic. But
even the government's lawyer spoke critically of ``homophobia.''
And an editorial about the case in a conservative newspaper, The
Citizen, mocked objections to same-sex relationships and even
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking _ profoundly so _ was the commitment of the
judges and lawyers to the very process of constitutional law. For
not long ago the idea that a South African government would submit
itself to the decisions of a court on issues of civil rights and
liberties was unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994 South Africa had no written constitution. Judges were
bound to enforce whatever Parliament enacted. And the apartheid
government turned law into a mechanism of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   So the scene in that courtroom was a world turned upside-down.
Everyone accepted the principle of judicial review. Everyone was
comfortable with the idea that judges should have the last word on
what the government can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   From an authoritarian country, South Africa has become one
concerned with individual rights. Someone near the top of the
government said to me, ``After what we suffered, we want a culture
of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking to a Bill of Rights and judges to enforce it, South
Africa is part of an international trend. In this argument, the
lawyers and judges discussed cases in Canada, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk here of combining the Constitutional Court
with the longstanding appeals court for nonconstitutional issues.
Perhaps someday there should be a single court of last resort. But
for now only the Constitutional Court has the legitimacy to build
the legal foundation of the new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   All segments of society seem to have confidence in the
Constitutional Court. Its membership is diverse. Five of 11 judges
are black, six white. Two are women. One is blind. They include
professors and practitioners. Together, they are trying to do in a
few years what American judges have done over 200: bring a
constitution to life.

NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS ROSE 2 PERCENT IN YEAR ENDING IN MARCH
'98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Along with high tech, there's another growth
industry around: state and local governments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers they employ _ everybody from teachers to
police officers to highway laborers _ rose 2 percent in the year
ending in March 1998, according to a recently released report from
the U.S. Census Bureau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas stands out. Based on the size of its population, it has a
particularly large public payroll. Missouri ranked closer to the
middle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Payroll records in Johnson County, Kan., part of suburban Kansas
City, illustrate what's been happening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the county employed the equivalent of 2,300 workers.
Four years later, the number hit 2,900. Next year the number should
reach 3,400. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson County government has grown too large too fast,'' said
George Gross, chairman of the County Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments nationwide employed the equivalent
of 14.5 million workers, up from 14.2 million the previous year,
the census report shows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent the number of employees working the
equivalent of a full-time staffer. Governments actually employ more
people, some of whom work part-time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calculated on a per-resident basis, Kansas has more public
employees than all but five states. Missouri slightly exceeded the
national average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest areas of public employment: teachers in
elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities; police
officers; and firefighters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In Johnson County, we've added hundreds of employees over the
last four years,'' Gross said. ``I personally feel we can do with
fewer employees.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Told of the national census findings, Gross said, ``I find it
almost alarming.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Increases in public employment don't
automatically mean waste is occurring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, it can be argued that the needs of Johnson County
and other areas change as population rises. Jail expansion is one
reason for more employees in Johnson County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report was based on counts and estimates for
March 1998. In Missouri, public employment was 297,864, up from
290,054 the previous year. In Kansas, public employment was
167,295, up from 162,776. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it demonstrates that there could be administrative
savings,'' University of Kansas political science professor Burdett
Loomis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of reasons, including the size of a state and its
social and political history, control how many workers are employed
by government, Loomis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, he noted, has many small rural counties and school
districts. While consolidating them might lower public payrolls, he
said, communities wouldn't easily approve of losing their
courthouses, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, he said, Kansas created six institutions of higher
learning, deciding to give its young people plenty of educational
opportunities. Today, he said, the state probably wouldn't take
such an expensive step. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides cities, counties and school districts, Kansas sports a
long list of special types of local governments: everything from
utility supply boards to groundwater management districts. Other
states don't have so many. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansans like local government,'' said Don Moler, executive
director of the League of Kansas Municipalities. ``We have the
amount of services the public wants.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas should cut back on public workers, countered Karl
Peterjohn, executive director of the Kansas Taxpayers Network. Laws
to restrict spending and taxes, he said, would hold down the
payroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of government here, the survey reflects that
fact,'' Peterjohn said. ``We have no limitations on our ability to
grow government.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, he noted, has a state spending lid called the Hancock
Amendment, something that has been proposed but not enacted in
Kansas. And Missouri, he noted, has proportionately fewer public
employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau study raises those kinds of questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider Iowa, a state with a population similar to Kansas. On a
per-person basis, it doesn't employ nearly as many state and local
workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee, a state with nearly the same population as
Missouri, employs fewer public workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers do not include federal government workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president pro tem of the Missouri Senate, Ed Quick, a
Democrat, has seen the public-employee question from three sides.
He once worked as a firefighter in Kansas City. Then he served on
the Kansas City Council. Now he leads the state Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will agree on whether there are too many public
employees, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got those who think we do and those who think we
don't,'' Quick said. ``Overall, I don't think we're out of line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, having more workers should mean better
services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on a per-resident basis, Kansas has more street
and highway workers than Missouri, the Census Bureau report
showed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Past studies also have found Kansas roads in better condition
than Missouri roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citizens want a voice in local governments, said Sen. Dick Bond,
a Republican who leads the Kansas Senate. They have a lot bigger
voice in smaller towns than in cities the size of Kansas City, Bond
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joining together school districts or cities might result in
fewer public employees. But Bond said citizens aren't demanding
government consolidation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not hear an unhappy public,'' Bond said. &QL;

 &HT;    Travel-weary Texans head to inland shelters
 &HT;    By Andy Alford and Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Travel worn and anxious, they came to the
shelters here in droves.
</P>
<P>
   And when the crowds filled the schools and churches in San
Antonio, they headed to Austin seeking protection from Hurricane
Bret, which roared ashore late Sunday afternoon 70 miles south of
Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Men who had been driving for hours, urged on by the specter of
boiling black clouds in their rear view mirrors. Children with
sleep marks on their faces. Mothers toting babies and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the path of the storm, Ray Trevino had to make the
anguished decision to flee his Port Aransas home for San Antonio or
stay and face down the strongest hurricane Texas has seen since
Carla menaced the coast in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can replace the trailer, but we can't replace our lives,''
Trevino said. He, his wife and their three children found shelter
Sunday through the Red Cross at San Antonio's Trinity Baptist
Church. ``We come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the night Saturday, Trevino hovered near his radio and
agonized whether to leave home. Then, with storm force winds
already hammering the shore, police warned residents of the coastal
town that if they were going to go they should go now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even put plywood up,'' said Trevino, who left with
his family at 3 a.m. Later Sunday, he sat shoulder to shoulder with
his wife, Brenda, staring transfixed at weather broadcasts of the
storm. ``With winds of 145 miles an hour, there's no way our mobile
home is going to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevino rubbed his face with his hand; his wife patted his
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a long time to get something,'' she said. ``It's so
hard to leave it behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Settje, the shelter's assistant manager, said the church
was full of families like the Trevinos. About 380 would eat, sleep,
play and worry at the shelter until coastal officials said it was
safe to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Across San Antonio and in Austin, similar dramas unfolded as
families mentally tallied their losses. Some, even while they
carried plastic bags filled with family photo albums, clothes and
jewelry or valuables, mourned what they had to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gaines of Rockport, left his three dogs when he sought
shelter at the Alamo Heights High School shelter in San Antonio.
``They wouldn't fit in the car,'' he said Sunday from the Alamo
Heights High School shelter. What did fit were his wife, three
children, stuffed toys, stereo amplifier and the family Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, you have to have room for that,'' Gaines said.
``Things will come out all right. We'll just keep praying.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, about 115 spent the night at Reagan High School and
the Travis County Exposition Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to San Antonio they (Red Cross officials) directed
us up to Austin because places there were already filling up,''
said Roger Garcia, 39, a truck driver from Banquete who stayed at
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, Irene, cuddled their 2-week-old baby, Garcia said
he worried most about the power shortages and drinking water
shortages that often come with hurricanes. ``I did not want to
expose my baby to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin facilities can hold about 450 people each, said Steve
Collier, director of emergency operations for the City of Austin.
If the shelters fill up, other public buildings will be opened, he
said.

 &HT;    Hurricane Bret slips between heavily-populated areas, slams
Texas coast
 &HT;    By Diana Dworin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE, Texas _ Hurricane Bret, which threatened Brownsville
and Corpus Christi before settling on sparsely populated Kenedy
County, bore into Texas Sunday night with floods and power outages
but little of the predicted devastation.
</P>
<P>
   With a 140-mph vengeance, Bret ended the state's longest
hurricane drought since record-keeping began in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   Port Aransas lost power Sunday morning, and half the town
remained without power late Sunday. Sporadic loss of electricity
and phone service was reported in Kingsville and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful storm to threaten the state since Carla in
1961 had resulted in no reported deaths and little widespread
damage Sunday night. Extra officers brought in by Kingsville
officials were sent home before midnight, and in Corpus Christi,
City Council member Arnold Gonzales summed up the effect: ``Barely
a scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one was taking the storm entirely for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush placed more than 1,600 Texas National
Guardsmen on standby. He also declared seven coastal counties as
state disaster areas and called upon President Clinton for
expedited federal relief. The counties are Aransas, Kenedy,
Kleberg, Nueces, San Patricio, Willacy and Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those
fellow Texans that are in harm's way. A disaster comes like a thief
in the night sometimes. I hope this storm, as ferocious as it may
seem, will not affect human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret's path bypassed cities and barreled into rural Kenedy
County, home to fewer than 500 people and more than 50,000 head of
cattle at the historic King Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people fled the coast throughout the morning Sunday
to seek safety in emergency shelters as far away as Austin, where
Reagan High School and the Travis County Exposition Center were
housing more than 100 evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane's impact stretched deep into the coastal region
late Sunday, and meteorologists expected spin-off showers to hit
Central Texas as early as this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists from South Padre Island to north of Corpus Christi
brought Interstate 37 to a virtual crawl in the northbound lanes.
Large sections were gridlocked, and officials in Corpus Christi
told residents by mid-afternoon that they were better off staying
in town than getting stuck on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees had many reasons for leaving, and many reasons for what
they took with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Henkel, 17, said he wasn't worried because he had his
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got all my guitars in the back of my car,'' the Port Aransas
High School senior said. ``Left the school books at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evacuees were students at the State School in Corpus
Christi and patients at a Texas Department of Mental Health and
Mental Retardation facility in Nueces County. Some were evacuated
to San Antonio while others came to Austin State Hospital, which
planned to house about 90 of those evacuees, most whom live in
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Many opted not to leave the coast, and some even returned as
Bret approached.
</P>
<P>
   Elvert Mack, a life-long Corpus Christi resident, said he was
not afraid of the storm. He was filling up his car with gas at an
Exxon station on Interstate 37 near Choke Canyon State Park on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hurricane is wind and water and if God plans for us to live
it out we'll still be there tomorrow,'' said Mack, 44. He had
dropped one daughter off for her freshman year at Texas Tech
University in Lubbock, and he was on his way back to Corpus Christi
to join his 16-year-old daughter and other family members.
</P>
<P>
   At the King Ranch, one of the country's largest, employees were
sent home but the 55,000 head of cattle were expected to ride it
out. Wade Roberts, a security officer for the ranch, said the sheer
number of livestock made it impossible for workers to round them
up. ``This thing came up so fast,'' Roberts said. ``There's nothing
we can really do''
</P>
<P>
   Because Bret was one of the rare hurricanes to form in the Bay
of Campeche of the Mexico coast, it reached Texas only three days
after becoming a tropical storm. Most hurricanes originate across
the Atlantic, and take weeks to make landfall.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter warning made for rushed preparations and
evacuations, but most areas reported little severe damage Sunday
night. However, with rainfalls of up to 20 inches possible, as well
as a wide area primed for tornados, optimism was guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists first thought Bret would hit in northern Mexico
or the Lower Rio Grande Valley. But it stubbornly stayed in the
Gulf before finally turning inland. Ken Graham, a National Weather
Service representative, said Bret moved slowly and strengthened
quickly because of two weather features: a high pressure system
centered over New Mexico, with clockwise winds trying to push Bret
to the west, and a low pressure system over Mexico bumping Bret
from the south with counter clockwise winds that tried to push it
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a battle of the meteorological features,'' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a category 4 storm, Bret was similar in size and magnitude to
Hurricane Andrew when it made landfall in Florida in 1992. Andrew
killed 14 people and caused more than $15 billion in damages.
Bret's path resembled 1980's Hurricane Allen, which packed winds of
185 mph and did $55 million in property damage but killed only two
people when it came ashore.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide emergency team kicked into action Sunday as
officials from a variety of agencies coordinated emergency duties
ranging from aircraft pooling to public safety to communication.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Air Patrol has flown satellite telephones to the coast
as backups if power lines go down, and amateur radio operators in
the storm area established a communications network with the state
police Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 60 national guard helicopters are positioned in the region
to aid in search and rescue operations, and state water rescue
teams in the Hill County have been alerted for possible flooding.

<P>
   HARTFORD _ More than 12,000 men had packed into a basketball
arena for this weekend's rally of the Promise Keepers, the
evangelical Christian men's group, by the time the Rev. Jack
Hayford began sharing a spiritual crisis he said he faced about six
weeks ago. It seems his cable system had reassigned the channel
numbers and as he surfed around for the new homes of CNN and ESPN,
he ran across a scrambled X-rated station.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see, just to be very blunt here in this gathering of
guys,'' he told the crowd, ``there was very clearly a breast
there.'' Hayford, 65, of Van Nuys, Calif., said he continued
flipping but started to wonder what was on the channel. He headed
back, then stopped. As he tells it, he prayerfully said, ``My
God,'' and decided to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the channel number still, but it doesn't even tempt me,
brother,'' he said, to applause sprinkled with ``Amen,''
``Hallelujah'' and simply, ``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Hayford was talking a guy's language _ skin, temptation, cable
and the clicker. Promise Keepers calls it ``the male context,'' and
it begins with the setting for its revivals, most of which take
place in stadiums or sports arenas. The group has largely faded
from public view since its ``Stand in the Gap'' rally drew hundreds
of thousands of men to the National Mall in Washington in 1997. The
group has shrunk but is still huge, with 180 full-time employees
and annual revenues of $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ministry, based in Denver, is pushing into the
Northeast, trying to bolster its membership and diversify its
overwhelmingly white following by connecting with African-American
and ethnic churches. The drive began last month in Philadelphia,
continued Friday and Saturday at the Hartford Civic Center, and
moves on Oct. 1 and 2 to the Continental Airlines Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, a piano, then horns and finally drums rose behind
Hayford as he began to call men to accept Jesus as their personal
savior. Soon the men were linking arms and clasping hands. Some
pushed their palms heavenward while others formed circles, gently
swaying as men streamed down to the stage for the altar call.
Within minutes, the front of the arena began to look like a
Pentecostal mosh pit, with some of the men doing jumping jacks to
the pounding music.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in their life, these men are free, and they
love it,'' said Lance Morgan, 36, of Reading, Pa., who was
attending his fifth Promise Keepers gathering. ``I can put my arms
around this man, because we both enjoy the same savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers justifies its all-male events by saying that
women have groups of their own, and by saying that men are less
inhibited if wives are not along. For legal reasons, women are not
turned away. But few go.

   Promise Keepers was founded in 1990 by Bill McCartney, the
former football coach at the University of Colorado. By 1996, the
group had a staff of 360, revenues of $87 million and drew 1.1
million men. Last year, financial problems forced the group to lay
off its entire staff temporarily, and it drew a total of just
453,000 to its rallies. Now the group is looking overseas, and
plans to hold its first international conference in Johannesburg
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The events have always been overwhelmingly white, but organizers
say they have worked hard to reach across racial lines by reaching
out to black churches. Still, Promise Keepers officials said they
were disappointed by the racial makeup of this weekend's gathering.
Edgar D. Barron, a Promise Keepers vice president who is black,
said he estimated that the audience was about 10 percent minority.
</P>
<P>
   The rallies often draw pickets from feminist groups; this
weekend, about 20 members of the Connecticut branch of the National
Organization for Women demonstrated in a drizzle outside the Civic
Center. Laura Montgomery Rutt, the national organizer of Equal
Partners in Faith, a group founded to counter the Promise Keepers,
asserted that the rallies ``take the legitimate spiritual needs of
men and manipulate them to promote a political agenda,'' which she
described as anti-homosexual and anti-women. (The official Promise
Keepers view of homosexuality is that it is a sin equal to adultery
or premarital sex, since the group approves of sex only in
marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   One wife who was left behind this weekend, Patricia Rock, 34,
said she did not mind that her husband, Jim, attended with two of
their sons, Elijah, 8, and Jared, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are the leaders,'' she said by telephone from their home
in Enfield, N.H. ``Whether Jim is right or wrong, God will bless me
for going along with what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers used to charge an admission fee of about $60.
Since last year, in response to what the ministry's officials said
was a directive from God, only an offering is taken. The Hartford
program included 10 minutes for a presentation of ``PK's Financial
Needs.'' The organizers' private schedule listed 16 minutes for the
``passing of buckets.''
</P>
<P>
   Promise Keepers speakers do not mix with attendees, and are
whisked off the stage during a hymn that closes their
presentations. Burly security volunteers with headsets and black
T-shirts prevent anyone from approaching the speakers. ``You ever
been to a Rolling Stones concert?'' asked Bob Havey, the event's
local media captain. ``This is no different.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few, it was too much. Marshall J. Darling, 55, a mortgage
banker who is a lay reader at his Episcopal church in Andover,
Mass., said the stories he had heard on the bus ride down and on
the arena floor indicated that ``a lot of these people are in major
league pain, and grab onto this for solace.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, though, said they found it to be a wholesome experience.
During the final hymns of a Promise Keepers event, volunteers pass
out trash bags and the small amount of litter quickly disappears.
The master of ceremonies, Bob Horner, declared, ``Not only is the
stadium clean, a few of us got clean in the process.''

TEXAS COAST ESCAPES WORST OF POWERFUL HURRICANE
<TEXT>
<P>

<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI _ The state's most powerful hurricane in nearly
20 years spent most of its sound and fury Sunday on rural coastal
ranch land between Brownsville and Corpus Christi, sparing the
urban centers it had been menacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very dangerous storm,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Gene Hafele said, ``but if there's something good to
say about Bret, at least it picked one of the most uninhabited
areas of our coastline to make landfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Early forecasts had the eye of the storm headed for this resort
city, which led to the evacuation of nearly 30,000 people, Mayor
Loyd Neal said. After a day of traffic jams and the frantic
clearing of grocery store shelves and lumber yards, the city of
300,000 breathed a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, authorities reported no injuries or major
destruction from the storm. The National Weather Service issued a
flash flood warning for Nueces, San Patricio and Kleberg counties,
where 2 to 3 inches of rain fell hourly. People in low-lying areas
were ordered to evacuate immediately.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m. today, officials said they will take a closer look at
the damage and decide whether to recommend that people return to
the city. Meteorologists were predicting 10 inches to 15 inches of
rain, however, that could cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   The compact, slow-moving storm, packing 145 mph winds and the
threat of tornados to come, lumbered inland near Baffin Bay, 75
miles south of Corpus Christi, about 6:15 p.m. Its winds cut a
50-mile wide swath, narrow for a hurricane, through ranch land
populated by more cattle than people.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, the Category 4 storm had been downgraded to a
Category 3, with sustained winds of 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   By noon today, the weakening storm was expected to be heading
toward Laredo with less than 50 mph winds, but flooding remained a
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often these storms will continue to wreak havoc for
several days just because of rain,'' Hafele said. ``It's just kind
of hard to forecast that though.''
</P>
<P>
   What officials feared was a scenario like last year. Tropical
Storm Charley, which brought a deluge to the Rio Grande Valley city
of Del Rio last August, resulted in flooding that killed nine
people. About a month later, remnants of Tropical Storm Frances
caused floods in the Houston area killing three people $300 million
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, Gov. George W. Bush had declared a
preemptive state of disaster in seven counties, Aransas, Cameron,
Kenedy, Kleberg, Nueces, San Patricio and Willacy. The governor
also sent a request to President Clinton to speed help to coastal
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The state emergency operations center in a large bunker under
the Department of Public Safety headquarters in Austin housed
representatives from 29 state agencies from the National Guard to
the Health Department, all prepared for a deadly outcome. Medical
teams, mobile hospitals and rescue workers were on standby, but
Bret was shaping up a lot more like Hurricane Allen of 1980 than
Charley or Frances.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, packing even stronger winds than Bret, roared across the
Caribbean headed straight for Brownsville but stalled, lost
strength and eventually made land north of the city. It caused $55
million damage and killed two people.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, as Bret surged inland from the remote coastline
south of Corpus Christi, more than 100 area residents huddled
inside a sturdy brick elementary school in the tiny town of Sarita.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the winds were knocking down trees and limbs and rocking
cars. Yet there seemed to be a surreal calm in the building, with
children playing in classrooms where floors were covered with
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the worst of it right now,'' said Nito Serna, a
security guard at a local ranch, taking shelter in the school.
``About half the town is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another seeking shelter in the building was John Cordaway of
Houston. Cordaway said he had come down to help board up his
mother's home and had to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the storm) caught me off guard. I tried to go back north
but I had to turn around,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   ``Among an estimated 120 people at a shelter set up in the
Riviera High School gym in Kleberg County, to the north of Sarita,
were Lupita Mendez, 44, and her 14-year-old son, Michael and her
elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez had expected the storm to be a rough one. ``That's why I
got my parents who live in the trailer park to come. I live in a
small house in Riviera, and I didn't want to stay by myself. I
think we`ll be OK here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Corpus Christi officials tried to look ahead. ``What
we're preparing for is the aftermath,'' said Police Chief Pete
Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done all we can to deal with the evacuations,'' said
City Manager David Garcia. ``The storm is upon us now and there's
not much we can do but wait to see what effects the wind and the
rain will have. We are now active in planning for the recovery once
the rain and the wind pass us.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the city positioned emergency and road crews to
clear debris and open roads once winds have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Central Power &AMP; Light were optimistic that
conditions were improving Sunday night. They hoped to be able to
cross the causeway to Mustang Island where half the homes in the
resort town of Port Aransas were without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said South Padre Island was mainly deserted Sunday after
most of that island's 15,000 residents heeded the warning to
evacuate and began leaving their beachfront homes. Eastbound lanes
on the John F. Kennedy Causeway, linking the city to the island,
were closed at 11 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 37, the main artery out of Corpus Christi, was packed
with evacuees streaming out of the city Saturday night and Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters in San Antonio were brimming with refugees from coastal
regions. The Red Cross, with four shelters full and a fifth
filling, was ready to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll open more as we need them,'' spokeswoman Cindi Wright
said, noting the Red Cross has agreements with 109 locations for
shelters in Bexar County alone. ``We've been practicing and
preparing for this for a long time.... This is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said some flooding was expected in the Corpus Christi's
low-lying areas such as Flower Bluff, on the city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern was structural damage caused by the storm. City
officials, however, said all new construction along the Corpus
Christi bayfront after Hurricane Allen was in compliance with
building codes requiring structures to withstand hurricane-strength
winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building codes have been strictly enforced,'' the police
chief said, ``but anytime you have a hurricane of this category you
have to be concerned. I don't care how secure your building is,
you're still subject to damage.''

COMPETITORS AND OTHERS WOO MCI CUSTOMERS  
 LATEST OFFER IN OVERSEAS CALLS  
 ANOTHER FREE OFFERING FROM A WEB-SITE OPERATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet service providers who were hit by blackouts
or slowdowns during a 10-day partial failure of MCI Worldcom Inc.'s
high-speed network have been approached by industrious competitors
hoping to steal them away from MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   One company whose salesmen have been calling to offer an
alternative high-speed connection to the Net's backbone is UUNet.
But that offer comes with an asterisk: UUNet is a wholly owned
subsidiary of MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet providers contacted by representatives of UUNet
expressed anger that they were not told during the sales pitch
about the relationship between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea when they called they were part of the same
company,'' said Phyllis Porta, owner of LA Connections of Santa
Clarita, Calif., an Internet provider serving 500 customers. She
said that MCI Worldcom's ownership of UUNet should have been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, MCI Worldcom said UUNet controlled its own,
separate high-speed access to the Internet backbone and thus was
not selling access to the same network that was disrupted for 10
days starting Aug. 5. Linda Laughlin, a company spokeswoman, said
it was not uncommon for divisions within MCI Worldcom, the United
States' No. 2 long-distance company, to have ``channel conflict,''
meaning they compete for the same customers.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom last week attributed blame for the failure to an
upgrade of software made by Lucent Technologies Inc. About 30
percent of MCI Worldcom's high-speed network customers were
affected, and on the weekend of Aug. 14-15 the company took the
network down altogether for 24 hours to restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   UUNet's overtures represented competition not just to its
corporate cousins but in some cases to MCI Worldcom customers, like
DataXchange, which buys network access wholesale from MCI Worldnet
and sells it to 150 Internet providers. About 66 of its customers
were blacked out completely during MCI Worldcom's partial failure.
</P>
<P>
   _ MATT RICHTEL
</P>
<P>
   Latest Offer in Overseas Calls: Free but Not Commercial-Free
</P>
<P>
   And now, free international phone calls _ if you can tolerate a
15-second advertisement at the beginning of each call, followed by
another ad interrupting the conversation every three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the proposition behind a very young, very small start-up
called Cortex Telecom, based in New York. For now, Cortex offers
free calling between only five cities _ Brussels, London, Miami,
New York and Paris. But the company is seeking $15 million from
venture capitalists and plans to use the money to expand its
network to dozens of other cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The service is fairly simple to use. In each of its five cities,
Cortex has a local access number. A would-be user calls, answers
about 20 demographic questions and then receives a code to use for
calls to any of the other four cities. (Oddly, it is not possible
to sign up at the company's Web site, www.cortextelecom.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The only fee borne by the user is the cost of a local call to a
Cortex access number, and the user can talk as long as he or she
wants. But every three minutes, a 15-second advertisement is
played, and it is not possible to talk over the advertisement.
Among Cortex's initial advertisers in English are the Ronald
McDonald House, the Flatotel in New York (where Cortex is based)
and Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about five minutes of every hour is given over to
advertising. In contrast to the 13 minutes of every hour devoted to
advertisements on another free service, prime-time broadcast
television (including promotions for coming shows and public
service announcements), five minutes seems relatively unintrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But just because consumers are willing to accept interruptions
during passive viewing of fare like ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place,'' that does not necessarily mean they will accept
interruptions in their international conversations. A company
called Broadpoint offers free domestic long-distance calls, but its
customers generally have to listen to advertisements only before
the call begins.
</P>
<P>
   _ SETH SCHIESEL
</P>
<P>
   Another Free Offering From a Web-Site Operator
</P>
<P>
   If your mother sends you unsolicited advertising, is it still
junk mail?
</P>
<P>
   This and perhaps other questions arise as a result of a Miami
start-up that is offering to transform postal service from a model
based on stamps to one based on advertising. On the Web, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The company: Postage4free.com.
</P>
<P>
   The concept: Starting Monday, the company is giving away 10
stamps and 10 envelopes to people who visit its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: The envelopes have advertisements. Some of these are
attached with perforation, which the sender rips off. Others are
printed on the back and inside.
</P>
<P>
   But in this instance, the price of a 33-cent stamp and an
envelope is a bit more than just having to look at an ad. To sign
up, participants must answer nine demographic questions about
things like their interests and hobbies, ownership of pets, and
whether they wear glasses or contact lenses. The envelopes they
receive are supposed to carry ads selected to match those
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Krop, the company's president and a co-founder, said
the idea behind gathering demographic data to personalize the ads
was that ``people are getting coupons they can actually use.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at this point, consumers may have to settle for whichever
advertisers the company can sign up. Krop said Postage4free.com was
still trying to sell the positions.
</P>
<P>
   As for your mother, Krop said that Postage4free's envelopes did
not qualify as junk mail, because people were participating
voluntarily. But what about the recipients of the letters, who
presumably had not agreed to participate?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' he allowed. Apparently lacking a
good answer, he noted: ``There is no clutter or waste with our
product. And the front of the envelope is completely white.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother would no doubt be proud.

 &HT;    Coastal Texans buzz into action before Bret's arrival
 &HT;    (EDS: Loyd is cq.)
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE, Texas _ First, there's the prayer _ that Hurricane
Bret passes over this town's stucco-covered Laundry Maid
Laundromat. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ if that doesn't work as well as owners Randy Nielsen, 43,
and his brother-in-law Randy Kell, 45, hope _ there's always
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our bread and butter,'' Neilsen said as he boarded up
the windows and doors Sunday morning to protect the coin-operated
washers and dryers. ``I expect the worse.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most powerful hurricane in decades arrived on the lower
Texas coast, Nielsen and Kell spent the day like most of the 28,000
residents in this town located 30 miles southwest of Corpus
Christi: getting ready for the storm and, in many cases, preparing
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting that the area would take a beating, Kingsville Mayor
Phil Esquivel said he held off until about 2:30 p.m. from opening
shelters in this city so residents who could evacuate would.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, some 65 people were in the Memorial Middle School
shelter and traffic was picking up with residents carrying blankets
and other belongings in plastic laundry baskets, canvas totes and
trash bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it was this serious,'' said LeRoy Velasquez,
24, explaining why he didn't evacuate. ``We thought it was going
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Lydia Silva thought, too. She was in Harlingen,
where the storm was first expected to hit, and headed to her
mother's home in Kingsville Saturday, right with Bret's path. ``Now
I'm trying to turn around and go home,'' Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kingsville H-E-B on King Highway, shoppers whizzed
through aisles, filling their carts Sunday morning. Produce bins,
bread and canned-food shelves were cleaned out and residents
pounced on cases of bottled water when workers wheeled a
just-arrived shipment to the front of the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this since yesterday. We got wiped out at 6
p.m.'' said H-E-B employee Mike Garcia, 27, whose hair dripped from
the downpour that was pounding the parking lot outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are going to ride it out. I'm getting out
of here. As soon as I'm off, I'm going to San Antonio,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   South of Kingsville in Corpus Christi, Mayor Loyd Neal had
called Gov. George W. Bush by 8 a.m. and asked him to declare the
coast a disaster area to speed assistance. The early call
demonstrated that officials were not expecting to be spared by
Bret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here during Celia, with 140-mile-an-hour winds, and it
was a giant urban renewal project,'' Neal said. Celia hit Corpus
Christi in 1970 and caused $50 million in damage. Neal said the
city enforces windstorm building codes, but they have not been
effectively tested since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often you need to find out if you are doing the right
things by the way. It's a hard way to do it, but we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The busiest spot in Corpus Christi Sunday was the downtown
marina and Corpus Christi yacht club. Boat owners worked their way
through a lengthy waiting list to use heavy equipment to bring
their boats onto land.
</P>
<P>
   By about 11:30 a.m., Douglas Beck's Moonspinner was in a
shorefront parking lot. but the chore had left him with little time
to do much for himself. He would stay put in Corpus Christi, he
said. ``I was thinking yesterday it was going into Brownsville. Now
it's too late to do anything,'' said Beck, 75.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rudy Benavides and Paul Lara, 35, were helping
Phillip Lara, 29, bring his shrimping boat, dubbed Bay King,
ashore. ``If it goes down, I go down too,'' said Benavides. ``My
family left and went to San Antonio. They wanted me to go with
them, but I think this is one of my priorities.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWFIELD, N.J. _ To 10-year-old Bryan Corley, Camp Mountain
Meadow is a place to make friends without being judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, almost nobody likes me, because I'm different,'' he
said. ``They say I'm weird and they're just mean. The kids here
accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's parents, Marie Corley and Tara Klein, are lesbians and
say they have suffered from prejudice and discrimination. Because
of a stalker, they have had to move several times.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Mountain Meadow, which operates for two weeks every August,
was created in 1992 to give children like Bryan whose parents are
gay, lesbian or transsexual a place where they can be themselves
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to know people who are like you, or at least have
parents like you,'' said Bryan, one of 67 campers this year. ``You
get to have friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Meadow offers daily forums where the children can
discuss common problems, as well as more typical summer camp
activities like athletics, crafts and theater.
</P>
<P>
   With its tents and wooden shacks, the camp at first glance seems
much like any other. But on closer examination, its particular
character becomes more apparent. While there is laughter, it rarely
has the abandon typical of elementary school children. Hellos are
easy to come by, even for a stranger, but smiles are much less
frequent. A seriousness infuses every action, no matter how
fanciful, with analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they've been through these ordeals with all of the
hatred toward them, a lot of these kids have been forced to grow up
too soon,'' said Andre Cruz, 20, a camp counselor from New York.
``They'll say things like `People don't understand me and don't
know enough about me to know that I'm just like them.' And I sit
there and think: While it's great that they know how to express
themselves in such a way, I wonder how many talks did they have to
have with their parents to finally understand this, and how much of
it really sinks through.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about how their parents' lifestyles had affected
their own lives, the campers' initial responses were guarded and
stoic: Their parents' lives posed no problems for them. In the
course of conversation, however, bits and pieces of private agonies
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never tell any of my friends about my mother,'' said
11-year-old Evan of Pennsylvania, whose mother is bisexual. ``They
would humiliate me. It's her life and that's fine with me. But I
know that I'm not going to be bisexual or something like that when
I grow up. I want to get married and have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from such families, many of the campers have been
encouraged to express their individuality. Bryan said that
classmates jeer at him because he wears funny hats, and shorts with
hearts on them, and because he will not make fun of a retarded
friend.

   Reuben Jacobs, 11, of Amherst, Mass, will transfer from a
private day school to a public school in the fall because the day
school principal objected to his appearance and dress on several
occasions. The principal would not allow him to wear dreadlocks,
saying they ``were a disfigurement to the image of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that it might catch on as a fad or something, and he
didn't want his son braiding his hair,'' said Reuben, who also said
he suspected that racism, as well as homophobia, was a factor in
his difficulties at the school.

   Nearly all the campers define themselves as bisexual. The camp
physician, Dr. Alexis Lieberman, said that while it was unlikely
that more than 10 percent of the campers were homosexual or
bisexual, their self-identification as such was a personal and
political statement.

   ``It's strange to hear a 7-year-old say `I'm bisexual,''' said
Dr. Lieberman, a pediatrician. ``But that's how they feel. They see
sexuality in broad terms because of their parents, and feel
comfortable with it. Eventually, they'll choose one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Many campers said they believed their presence at the camp and
Mountain Meadow's very existence had reaffirmed the validity of
their lives and those of their parents.

   ``I don't have to hide who my family is, that my mom's a

her second year at the camp. ``I'm really shy and I don't usually
tell people that. But it would be nice if I could.''

TOUGH WEEK ON THE HUSTINGS TESTS BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a father, Texas Governor George W. Bush doesn't
want his twin, teenage daughters to experiment with drugs. As a
son, Bush hated it when a reporter asked his father, President
Bush, if he had ever committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   As the front-running GOP presidential candidate, Bush went
through a rough week because those personal considerations have
trumped the conventional political wisdom that says Bush should
give an unequivocal answer about whether he ever used illegal
drugs, according to people close to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The drug-use question smothered Bush's campaign last week, as
reporters tried various tacks to get at the issue. On Wednesday and
Thursday, they asked whether Bush could meet the drug-free
standards for working in the federal government. Then on Friday,
outside a homeless shelter in Akron, Ohio, Bush was asked what
anti-drug message he had given to his own children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I'm going to leave my daughters out of this
campaign,'' but replied that parents have a responsibility to make
up for their youthful mistakes by warning their children to stay
away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers is, have
we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes?''
the 53-year-old Bush said. ``And I think the message ought to be to
all children, `Don't use drugs. Don't abuse alcohol.' That's what
leadership is about.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Ralph Reed said he believes the governor, like
many baby boomers, had some youthful indiscretions but did not use
hard drugs. Reed said Bush won't respond to unsubstantiated rumors
about using drugs, including cocaine, because he is uncomfortable
answering personal questions that demean politics and could hurt
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father, Bush had told his daughters not to use drugs,''
said Reed, a Bush adviser. ``An awful lot of young people like them
are on the cusp of making decisions about their future, and he
doesn't want them to say, `The president of the United States did
that, so I can do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Bush deeply resents that his father was asked in an
Oval Office interview if he had ever had an extramarital affair.
``He has an emotional feeling about the undignified way his dad was
treated, and he strongly thinks that we are exacting a cost on
public servants that is vicious and negative and has gone way
beyond the call of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, last week's media drumbeat so rattled his campaign that
Bush was forced to shift from his just-say-no stance. In answer to
a question Thursday about his ability to pass FBI background checks
for drug use, Bush indicated that he had not used illegal drugs at
any time during the past 25 years. A day earlier, Bush told the
Dallas Morning News he had not used drugs in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has mishandled the issue,'' said John Zogby, a New
York pollster. ``By slowly chiseling away at his hard-line
position, it looks like he is doing a kabuki dance around the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls show the public is almost equally divided on the issue
of whether a candidate should disclose past cocaine use. In a new
Time magazine poll, conducted Thursday, 49 percent of the
respondents said yes, and 48 percent said no. When the respondents
were asked if cocaine use in his 20s would disqualify Bush from the
presidency, the results were more lopsided: 84 percent of the
public said no; 11 percent said yes. (The poll had a margin of
error of 3.3 percentage points.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to hurt Bush,'' said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate
University. ``Not only is the electorate sort of fed up with this
line of questioning, but it doesn't think the issue of drugs should
be dredged up if it doesn't interfere with public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said this is not a risk-free strategy for Bush.
First, he may be cast as a hypocrite for stressing moral
responsibility in his campaign and at the same time refusing to
answer some, but not other, questions about his own values. Bush
has been frank on the issue of adultery, saying he has been
faithful to his wife, Laura, and about alcohol, admitting he gave
it up at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk, said William Kristol, editor of the conservative
Weekly Standard, is that Bush will face serious consequences, and a
media ``feeding frenzy,'' if he discloses or evidence surfaces that
he once used hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am as sympathetic as anyone to the notion that people
deserve a zone of privacy and the right to say `none of your
business,' '' Kristol said. ``But using cocaine is a felony, a
matter of criminal law, and even if it was a long time ago, the
questions still will come: `Did you buy it, did you sell it, were
you toking off every night?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the Time poll, 35 percent of the respondents said they
thought Bush had used cocaine at some point in his life, 18 percent
thought he did not, and 47 percent said they weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What never ceases to amaze me is the degree to which
politicians don't understand that the public is forgiving of
mistakes, but not of coverups and lies,'' said L. Brent Bozell III
of the Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group.
``Bush should have come clean with an answer and told the truth.
Now he has dug himself into a hole.'' Bozell has endorsed publisher
Steve Forbes for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As the week drew to a close, Bush acknowledged that there wasn't
anything uplifting about the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that politics can be unnecessarily ugly,'' Bush
said in Akron, ``and I'm trying to purge the system of ugly
politics.''

SHEFFIELD TURNED OUT JUST GRAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Cal Ripken proved a big guy can play shortstop,
but it took Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra to
revolutionize the position. They hit .325 or club 40 homers or
drive in 120 runs a season, and in the process prove a
defense-oriented position can produce offense in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, when A-Rod and the gang were mere high schoolers,
Gary Sheffield figured he'd be the one to do all that. Before that
could happen, though, Milwaukee turned him into a third baseman.
Then Florida made him an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having endured his third position change, he's the Dodgers
left fielder having another solid, if not splendid, season. He hit
his sixth career grand slam and drove in six runs in Sunday's 9-7
win against Philadelphia in the series finale at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is hitting .310 with 21 homers and 66 RBI and has a
.413 on-base percentage. Nice numbers for an outfielder, but if he
were a shortstop they would be groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time when I came up, there wasn't a power-hitting
shortstop like Cal Ripken or Barry Larkin,'' said Sheffield, a
five-time all-star. ``That was the thing I was thinking about,
changing the whole attitude of the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Brewers drafted a young, hotshot prospect named
Billy Spiers to be their shortstop for the next decade. Sheffield,
who returns to Milwaukee today as the Dodgers open a three-game
series, was moved to third. He replaced Paul Molitor, who was being
switched to designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody (knew) what he would be like in the
major leagues. Maybe in the minor leagues they knew,'' said Dodgers
center fielder Devon White, who played with the Angels during
Sheffield's Milwaukee days. ``He was always known for his bat.
That's what people knew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortstop was THE position. I fell in love with the spot,''
Sheffield said. ``My range was there, the glove was there. I made
some errors, but it was because I believed in my arm and thought I
could throw anyone out when I didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson lamented earlier this season that,
when he managed in New York, the Mets tried to acquire Sheffield
but failed. Johnson, who loves offense, said he would have kept
Sheffield at shortstop, understanding the huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was traded to San Diego before the 1992 season and
that's where he blossomed offensively. Spiers, a journeyman now
with Houston, has 38 career homers. Sheffield has topped that in
one season.
</P>
<P>
   A year after being traded to the Padres, he hit .330 with 33
homers and 100 RBI. Playing for the Marlins in 1996, he hit .314
with 42 homers and 120 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite missing what amounts to a full season due to
injuries, Sheffield has averaged 26 homers and 80 RBI over the last
five years. He's hit .291 in that span and stolen 80 bases.
</P>
<P>
   Would Sheffield's name be mentioned in the same way as
Rodrigeuz, Jeter and Garciaparra are had he remained in the
infield? ``No doubt,'' Johnson said. ``He had a great arm, great
hands. Had the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team marred with inconsistency this season, Sheffield has
not only become a voice of reason, he's been the Dodgers' most
consistent player. It was his double in the first that gave Chan Ho
Park the first two runs of what would become a 5-1 lead after two
innings. And when the Phillies scored three times during a Park
meltdown in the fifth to pull within a run, Sheffield smashed his
sixth career grand slam off reliever Steve Montgomery an inning
later to give the Dodgers a 9-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It came an inning after Montgomery knocked down Sheffield with
an inside pitch. The two exchanged barbs before Sheffield and
catcher Gary Bennett engaged in a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole series they threw close to my head four times,''
Sheffield said. ``I was telling him how well he was wearing his
uniform. He told me my cleats were nice, with the No. 10 on them.''

EVA SHAIN, 81, A PIONEERING BOXING JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eva Shain, the first woman to serve as a judge at a heavyweight
championship boxing match when she was assigned to the Muhammad
Ali-Earnie Shavers bout at Madison Square Garden in 1977, died Aug.
19 at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital and Medical Center. Mrs. Shain, who
lived in Fort Lee, N.J., was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank, a longtime ring
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain, who was among the first female judges in New York
State, judged some 50 title bouts. She worked at fights in New
York, New Jersey, Nevada, Canada and Europe over a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the idea of being a trailblazer,'' Mrs. Shain said
of her pioneering role. ``It was something I wanted to do. It was a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain, a native of Jersey City who worked as an interior
decorator and bookkeeper after attending New York University,
agreed reluctantly to accompany her husband to a Golden Gloves bout
at Madison Square Garden one night in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to watch two men beating each other up in the
ring,'' she recalled. ``Besides, there were never any women at the
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   But she remembered how she ``totally fell in love with boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a precise science,'' she said. ``After that, I
went to every fight with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain went on to judge amateur bouts for eight years. In
July 1974, the New York State Athletic Commission named Carol
Polis, the wife of a former boxer and referee, Bob Polis, as the
first woman to be a professional boxing judge in the state. Mrs.
Shain and Carol Castellano, whose husband, Tony, was a judge, were
the next female judges, gaining their licenses in March 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain received word that she would judge the Ali-Shavers
bout, on Sept. 29, 1977, only hours before the fight. ``I really
did not expect it,'' she recalled. ``That morning I had gone to the
doctor, and he told me to stay home because I had a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali won the bout on a unanimous decision, Mrs. Shain giving him
9 of the 15 rounds and feeling elated that she had reached the
pinnacle of her calling, ``like when an opera singer sings at the
Met.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain, who worked with her husband in promotions and sales
at a toy company when she was not involved in boxing, remained
active as a judge until last December.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Harvey
Shultz, of Hackensack, N.J., and a daughter, Barbara Brocklehurst,
of Franklin Lakes, N.J., both from a previous marriage; a brother,
Jack Inwood, of Paramus, N.J.; a sister, Florence Schiffman, of
Tamarac, Fla., and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shain, the ring announcer at seven title fights for which
Eva Shain was a judge, recalled that the first time they worked
together, ``As I announced the judges, there was about a
three-second pause _ it was so emotional I couldn't get her name
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, his wife quipped, ``We're married, and he forgot
my name.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1984, a tempest of sorts arose when John Branca, the
chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, announced plans
to name three female judges to the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Mustafa
Hamsho middleweight championship bout at the Garden, saying, ``This
fight needs some publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hagler's handlers, Pat Petronelli, complained that ``it's
a man's game'' and ``there's going to be a lot of blood and I don't
want the three judges throwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shain did work the bout _ a third-round knockout by Hagler
_ but the other two female judges were assigned to a title fight on
the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Hagler's corner man need not have worried about Mrs. Shain being
squeamish amid boxing violence, as her husband noted in remembering
a conversation Ali once had with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali said to her, `Eva, if you're wearing a blouse or a skirt
and blood got on it, would it bother you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``She replied, `Well, it's not my blood.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali laughed. He said, `I didn't expect that answer.'''

WILBERT OLIVER, 89, WHO INFLUENCED FUNERAL-HOME POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ill., Texas, S.C.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilbert Jean Oliver, whose 1973 federal lawsuit had the
practical effect of forcing funeral homes throughout the United
States to provide equal services to blacks and whites, died on
Tuesday at a hospital in Marksville, La. He was 89 and lived in
Mansura, La.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura, where he lived
all his life, for discrimination after it refused to provide
visitation for his deceased mother, Martha Pierre Oliver, because
she was black.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights
organization in Montgomery, Ala., advanced his case in federal
court, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers
Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks
or offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same prices
that they charged whites.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver won his case.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law
Center and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled
the case, said, ``Although the case was not binding, because it
never reached the Supreme Court, it served notice to funeral homes,
and even cemeteries and other businesses, that if they practiced
discrimination against blacks they could be violating federal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees said that after the ruling was announced, his organization
heard reports from across the country that previously segregated
funeral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``black funeral homes continue to
prosper in the South as a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaon Escude, a spokesman for the funeral home, said that his
grandfather, who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit,
provided all services, including embalming, but stopped at offering
visitation to blacks ``because, if he did, he thought he'd lose
business from whites.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his grandfather's competitors at the time would
not accept any black clients at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. August Thompson, who was Oliver's priest when his
mother died, said Oliver had been distraught when he was told that
the funeral home would not permit visitation for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived in what used to be called a shotgun house, because it
was so flimsy that if you fired a shotgun at the house it would go
right through it,'' Thompson said. ``He wanted a better place for
visitation for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Escude Funeral Home rejected his request, Oliver, a
salesman for John Deere, arranged to hold the wake in what was
described in his lawsuit as ``a run-down storage building on the
grounds of Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is survived by his wife, Catherine Carmouche Oliver of
Mansura; two sons, Wilbert Jr. of Chicago and Carroll of Kingwood,
Texas; a foster son, Francis Sarpy of Charleston, S.C.; six
daughters, Catherine Demouy and Jacqueline Batiste of Mansura,
Sister Laurita Oliver of New Orleans, Eloise Lee of DeRidder, La.,
Geraldine Barbin of Marksville and Hattie Turner of Alexandria,
La.; 39 grandchildren; 72 great-grandchildren, and 13
great-great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just an ordinary man, one of the common people and not
a crusader,'' Thompson said. ``Life was a little harder for him
because he had lost his left arm in an accident, but none of the
local lawyers would touch the case. I directed him to Julian Bond,
who was then president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Bond
took the case and within a month it was decided.''

PLANNING FOR DISASTERS PITTED AGAINST NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress insists that citizens have a right to know the dangers
they face from nearby factories or chemical plants, but the CIA,
FBI and other security agencies want to keep secret exactly how bad
things can get if there are catastrophic leaks or explosions.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed an order on Aug. 5 that authorized
criminal sentences and fines of $1 million a day against anyone who
releases parts of that type of information to an unauthorized
person.
</P>
<P>
   The information on potential hazards can be vital, even
lifesaving, to firefighters, police, rescue workers and others
responding to a disaster, but some of those officials are reluctant
to take the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are clearly concerned at the size of penalties and made
it clear they did not want the responsibility for the data,'' said
Lisa McArthur, EPA clean air coordinator for the Pacific Northwest.
McArthur, who is orchestrating the release of chemical data, has
been meeting with emergency planners for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 deaths from a leaking chemical plant in Bhopal, India,
in 1984 got the attention of Congress. Lawmakers feared that local
and state emergency teams in this country might not know exactly
what was behind the factory doors or in the huge storage tanks in
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act and gave the EPA the
job of determining the potential for disaster at companies that use
or store large quantities of any of 132 toxic or flammable
chemicals. June 21st of this year was the deadline for the nation's
36,000 bulk chemical users to submit their information. Only about
14,000 complied.
</P>
<P>
   The required information included:
</P>
<P>
   _A breakdown of the type and amount of hazardous chemicals
stored or used in the facility.
</P>
<P>
   _A risk-management plan that is revised every five years.
</P>
<P>
   _The company's plan for responding to emergencies
</P>
<P>
   _A history of accidental chemical releases during the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   _The off-site consequences of the worst-case scenario from a
major release of hazardous material.
</P>
<P>
   It is this last category that has worried security experts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FBI nor other security agencies involved in
evaluating the dangers of the information getting into the wrong
hands were willing to discuss, for publication, their specific
concerns in the release of worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   However, an executive summary prepared by the security experts
call the worst-case scenarios ``a blueprint for terrorists'' and a
``nationwide guide of what to blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise information that will tell those wishing to do harm
where to place their explosives will also tell those who must
control the catastrophe how to best plan for it.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA fully supports the public's right to know about local
environmental threats,'' said a position paper from headquarters,
``but we are also committed to addressing all national security
concerns raised by the FBI, CIA and other security agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans called for all the data but the worst-case
scenarios to be placed on the Internet. The public, citizen groups
or other interested parties would have to request the restricted
data by filing a Freedom of Information Act request. However, the
legislation signed by Clinton exempts the scenarios from being
released to the public for at least the next year.
</P>
<P>
   For some industries, such as nuclear power plants, worst-case
scenarios have always been a key part of the licensing process.
Somewhere in the hundreds of volumes of reports and studies the
utility prepares for government licensers are calculations of how
much radiation might escape in the most severe release, how far
will it go and in which direction. Medical experts are also
required to calculate the most likely immediate and long-term
health effects to the public from this exposure.
</P>
<P>
   This information allows emergency planners to determine such
things as the best evacuation routes, the number and placement of
alert sirens and whether the risks are so high that the public
should not try to outrun the toxic plume but seal up their houses
and stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   But, most important, knowledge of precisely how dangerous the
chemical hazards could be will make it easier for the public to
respond to evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA data will be the first time a worst-case scenario has
been prepared, let alone released to public officials, by many of
the country's chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece of information most useful for the public is the
off-site consequences and EPA's program makes far less sense than
was intended if we can't use that data,'' said Robert Koster, an
air pollution compliance specialist for Oregon's Department of
Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we can alert people living near these
facilities, give them advance notice that they might get a midnight
call and what they should do when the sirens go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Johnson, Auburn's fire chief and the chairman of the
Washington State Emergency Response Committee, also believes the
risk data is important and will allow emergency workers to do a
better job protecting the public. And he says the threat of the
million-dollar fine comes with the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If most appointed or elected officials looked hard at the
liability they take with the job, they wouldn't get out of bed in
the morning,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do understand the potential danger of certain information
getting into the wrong hands, but I don't understand exactly what
EPA expects us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA's McArthur said it is not her agency, but rather Congress
that is restricting the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is trying to balance the public's right to know with
concern about terrorist access to data,'' she said. ``You can
definitely see the pendulum swing between when Congress was very
concerned about the public's right to know, when the law was
proposed in 1990 and now to where the Congress is concerned about
terrorists getting the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel this is very useful information for emergency
responders to have. It's very important and we will do all we can,
but we cannot force them to take it.''

ALFONS BACH, 95, DESIGNER OF TUBULAR FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Fla., Minn.) (ms) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfons Bach, a versatile modern designer of tubular steel
furniture and other objects whose work was included in exhibitions
of contemporary American industrial art at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, died Aug. 19 at a nursing home in Pensacola, Fla. He was 95
and had lived in Pensacola since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bach was born and reared in Germany, moved to New York in 1926,
became a free-lance industrial designer and founded a design firm
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His objects were in several of the Metropolitan Museum's
biennial shows of contemporary industrial art, beginning in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   A tubular steel table and two chairs that he designed are at the
Yale University Art Gallery. James D. Beebe, a specialist in the
history of the decorative arts, said Sunday that tubular steel
furniture designed by Bach for the Lloyd Manufacturing Co. was made
at its factory in Menominee, Mich., from the 1930s until 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really until the 1930s that modernism took a really
strong hold on furniture design'' in the United States, said Beebe,
who is a master's degree candidate at the Bard Graduate Center for
Studies in the Decorative Arts and is writing his thesis on the
Lloyd company. He said that designs done for the company by Bach
and a colleague, Kem Weber, are ``icons for their period'' in
furniture design, which was 1930s modernism, including more and
more streamlining as time passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fantastic pieces,'' Beebe said. ``You see the
marriage of design and industry; you see two people who were very
proficient in the design rhetoric for their time producing work for
a company which was highly significant in developing the
tubular-steel manufacturing technology that made this furniture
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach's style in this work was ``definitely not as angular as the
Bauhaus School,'' he added, but ``showed the transition between the
Bauhaus and the streamlined modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the table at the Yale gallery, David Barquist, a
curator there, wrote in a 1992 book: ``This table exemplifies the
overall rectilinearity of Bach's designs'' for the Lloyd company.
</P>
<P>
   Bach's drawings and papers are in the collections of the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.
</P>
<P>
   His work also has been included in exhibitions at the Museum of
Modern Art and elsewhere, and in a one-man show at the Stamford
Museum in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He did designs for General Electric, the carpet makers
Bigelow-Sanford, the metalsmiths Keystone Silver, the linen makers
Pacific Mills and other clients. He also painted.
</P>
<P>
   Bach was a former president of the American Designers Institute.
His honors included a medal from the Industrial Designers Institute
and a design award from the Fifth Avenue Association.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Magdeburg, Germany, grew up in Munich and studied
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, who lived for years in Connecticut, is survived by his
wife, the former Anita Stewart; two sons, Alfons S., and Alexander
S., both of Pensacola; two daughters from an earlier marriage that
ended in divorce, Florence M. Bach of Ottawa and Betsey G. Gooder
of Franklin, N.C.; four grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Anita and Alfons Bach honeymooned in Hawaii, where they bought
four 17th-century sliding-door panels that once belonged to a Kyoto
Zen temple. In 1989 they sold the panels to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art. Mrs. Bach said, ``We wanted them to be someplace where they
could be seen and taken care of.''  &QL;

BARBARA FISHMAN, 60, SLOAN-KETTERING BENEFACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barbara White Fishman, an art director at advertising
agencies who developed breast cancer and became a benefactor of the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died Aug. 19 at the center.
She was 60 and lived in Manhattan and in Remsenburg, N.Y., where
she kept a studio.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was the breast cancer she had fought since it was
diagnosed in 1985, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, who was known professionally by her maiden name, once
said in an interview that the illness ``refocused my energies to
help others.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave $5 million to Sloan-Kettering to renovate its 42-bed
Women's Inpatient Center for the diagnosis and treatment of
gynecological cancers. She helped design and decorate the center to
create a soothing atmosphere, and to provide library space with
computers and a lounge. The center, opened in late 1997, bears her
name and is decorated with her photographs and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   She was responsible for the Barbara White Fishman Breast Cancer
Counseling Program at Sloan-Kettering. It offers individual and
group counseling, including art therapy, to women with breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White was known as the ``art angel'' at the La Guardia High
School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan. She was a
board member of the Friends of La Guardia and provided money so
hundreds of needy art students could buy supplies and obtain
scholarships for summer courses at the Art Students League of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White also helped students from poor neighborhoods take
summer arts classes at the Vermont Studio Center, and she was a
chairwoman of its board. She financed art scholarships for students
at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, a native of New York, was a 1960 graduate of the
Cooper Union School of Art and was a trustee of the school. At
Cooper Union, she endowed a program that helps visiting art
scholars and art critics.
</P>
<P>
   Professionally, Ms. White designed fabrics for a textile company
and designed album covers and liner notes for CBS Records. She held
executive positions at various advertising agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's marriage to Dr. Jack Fishman ended in divorce. She
is survived by three sons, Neil, Leslie and Daniel Fishman, all of
Manhattan; a sister, Mimi Inorio of Clinton, Conn., and her
companion, Jack Talan of Manhattan.

<P>
   Patricia Beer, a British poet concerned with death, theology and
the mysteries of everyday existence, died on Aug. 15. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause and place of her death were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beer was among the few candidates for successor to Ted
Hughes, Britain's poet laureate, who died in October.
</P>
<P>
   Her poems have been described by critics and scholars as sly,
dry, ironic and economical with well-observed landscapes.
Occasionally they were also called prosaic, gloomy, flat and almost
housewifely.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Motion, Britain's new poet laureate, reviewing her
``Selected Poems'' in The New Statesman in 1980, said Ms. Beer
``admits to having been `a child who dared not seem/Gloomy,' but
over the years she has become increasingly prepared to say what she
feels. The fear of death and the lack of absolute religious
security have proved more than a match for her instinct to explain
and placate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beer's themes often included theology, mortality and daily
existence. In ``Middle Age'' she wrote:
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere I look it is the same,
</P>
<P>
   The churchyard or the other side of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The one who is not lying there
</P>
<P>
   Could have been.
</P>
<P>
   And in the poem ``Home,'' she wrote:
</P>
<P>
   Out of the window
</P>
<P>
   I see the opposite roofs
</P>
<P>
   Fitting well like ours.
</P>
<P>
   This house is as warm
</P>
<P>
   And secure as bath water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet very often
</P>
<P>
   Through the double glazing
</P>
<P>
   I imagine people crying,
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere out there.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Reader, I Married Him'' (1975), a study of the female
characters of Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell and
George Eliot, Ms. Beer ``demonstrates with wit, wide knowledge and
a bare minimum of footnotes that even the greatest of women
novelists were enthralled by the need of preserving the superior
position of men,'' wrote Carolyn G. Heilbrun in The New York Times
Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Her first volume of poetry, ``The Loss of the Magyar,'' was
published in 1959. Among her other books of poetry were ``The
Survivors'' (1963), ``The Resurrection'' (1967), ``The Estuary''
(1971), ``Driving West'' (1975), ``Poems'' (1979), ``The Lie of the
Land'' (1983), ``Collected Poems'' (1989), ``Friend of Heraclitus''
(1993) and ``Autumn'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote a novel, ``Moon's Ottery'' (1978), and a
childhood memoir, ``Mrs. Beer's House'' (1968), about her
upbringing in a family of Christian fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Beer was born on Nov. 4, 1919, in Exmouth, Devon. She
was brought up by members of the strict Plymouth Brethren sect; her
first poems were hymns. She went to Exeter University and received
a degree in literature from Oxford University. She taught English
at the University of Padua in Italy from 1947 to 1949, and at the
British Institute in Rome from 1949 to 1951.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to England in 1953 and taught at the University of
London. She also reviewed books for The Daily Telegraph in the
1980s and contributed to The London Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   Her first marriage ended in divorce. In 1964, she married John
Damien Parsons, an architect, who survives her.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra B. O'Leary, an economic adviser in three White House
Administrations and a former deputy assistant secretary of state,
died on Aug. 9 at her home in McLean, Va. She was 50.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, James.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Leary served as an economic adviser, from 1986 to 1992, to
Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker 3rd in the
Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Her duties included helping former communist countries make the
transition to capitalist systems. She also worked during the
Persian Gulf War securing international financial support and on
developing economic policies for the Middle East in the aftermath
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Leary stayed on at the state department as an economic
adviser when the Clinton administration took over in 1993, and, in
1995, she became a deputy assistant secretary of state for economic
policy, until 1996. Her primary focus was East Asian and Pacific
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she was a professor at the Foreign Service
Institute and the National Defense University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Leary was born in Hackensack, N.J., on June 16, 1949, and
graduated from Smith College. She received a master's degree in
international affairs from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies and a doctorate in political science from
Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the state department, Ms. O'Leary worked in
various positions at the Office of the United States Trade
Representative, the treasury department and the Department of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, Ms. O'Leary is survived by two daughters,
Glynis O'Leary and Abigail O'Leary, both of McLean; her father,
Boniface Brazaitis, and a sister, CB Lovell, both of Columbia, Md.

BAFFERT'S WEEK GOOD AND BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ If the past week was an omen, Bob Baffert will
either win big or lose big in next Sunday's Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry we can't be more helpful than that.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leading thoroughbred trainer had a week of highs
and lows, including Silverbulletday's smashing victory at Saratoga
and Real Quiet's season-ending injury here, and ending fittingly
with Tout Charmant winning and Excellent Meeting finishing up the
turf course in the Del Mar Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get real excited about this because I'm
disappointed with Excellent Meeting,'' Baffert said after Tout
Charmant's $21.60 victory under David Flores in the Grade I,
$250,000 race for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Favored Excellent Meeting, racing on grass and ridden by Chris
McCarron, each for the first time, couldn't overcome some minor
traffic trouble and came in second to last in the field of 10. She
was five lengths behind Tout Charmant at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   It was Excellent Meeting's fourth defeat in five starts since a
hard-earned fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby. This,
combined with Silverbulletday's nine-length victory in the Alabama
Stakes on Saturday, effectively ended the contest for best filly in
the Baffert barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made a nice run (on the backstretch), but she couldn't
sustain it,'' said McCarron, who took over from Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as she comes out no worse for wear, then (owners John
and Betty Mabee) are OK,'' Baffert said, indicating Excellent
Meeting won't try grass again.
</P>
<P>
   Tout Charmant, winning for the third time in 10 starts for
Baffert, became the first double stakes winner at the Del Mar meet,
surviving an inquiry into the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay, who rode runner-up Smooth Player, and Corey
Nakatani, on third-place Sweet Ludy, complained that Tout Charmant
forced them to steady. The stewards disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Flores will seek their fourth Del Mar stakes win
together in the $1 million Pacific Classic. Flores is scheduled to
ride 3-year-old General Challenge. Baffert also plans to enter
River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the Classic, the probable field grew to eight when
Saudi Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. announced it will
run Lazy Lode and Smile Again. Gary Stevens and Garrett Gomez will
ride, with Stevens getting his choice of horses. Also expected for
the 1\-mile race: favored Mazel Trick, Malek, Barter Town and Jack
Grandi.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Tout Charmant and earlier maiden-race winner Simply
Fantastic ($85) made it a rough day for pick-six bettors. A double
carryover puts more than $825,000 in the pot today. . . . At
Emerald Downs near Seattle, Budroyale and Garrett Gomez bounced
back from a weak run in the San Diego Handicap to prevail in a
stretch duel with Mike K in the Longacres Mile. Bob Baffert-trained
favorite Classic Cat finished last in his first start since April.
. . . At Ferndale, Ebonist and Danny Boag led the field past the
finish line four times to win the Humboldt County Marathon, at 1|
miles the longest dirt-track U.S. stakes.

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ With winds reaching 125 mph and a tidal
surge expected to reach 12 feet, Hurricane Bret rumbled ashore
early Sunday evening along the south Texas coast, hours after tens
of thousands of anxious residents evacuated inland along clogged
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the storm moved steadily, if somewhat
unpredictably, first steering directly at this heavily populated
coastal refinery city and then turning westward and hitting land in
rural and sparsely populated Kenedy County. The western edge of the
eye of the storm slowly touched land before 7 p.m. local time and
began pounding the county with heavy bands of rain and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, gale-force winds had begun buffeting the
long string of barrier islands that form the fragile outer wall for
much of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're being whipped,'' said Lt. Robert
Rodriguez, as he and several other police officers rode out the
storm in the evacuated resort town of South Padre Island north of
Brownsville, Texas. ``We're getting all the wind swirls, the
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   With the eye of the storm expected to reach land later Sunday
night, federal and state officials compared its potential ferocity
to Hurricane Andrew, which in 1992 caused more than $1 billion in
damage in Florida and Louisiana. Designated a Category 4 storm, or
extremely dangerous, Hurricane Bret was expected to dump 7 to 20
inches of rain and possibly unleash bands of tornadoes. Hours
before the landfall, Gov. George W. Bush asked federal officials to
declare seven coastal counties major disaster areas in order to
qualify for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   The storm began to weaken as it reached land and was downgraded
to a Category 3 by 7 p.m. Early fears of the potential for
tremendous property damage and loss of life diminished as the
hurricane veered away from Corpus Christi and moved across the flat
countryside of Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   But James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, cautioned in a briefing at 6 p.m that the hurricane still
presented a very serious threat to south Texas. He warned of the
possibility of severe flooding from heavy rainfall that was
expected to continue throughout Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the Rio Grande area and the
potential of flooding in that area,'' Witt said. ``It is a very
dangerous storm.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m. the fastest winds had dropped to 115 mph as the land
continued to diminish the strength of the storm. There were no
reported injuries, but officials, who remained in shelters, said it
was too early to assess real damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bret is the first hurricane of the 1999 season and the first
major hurricane to threaten south Texas since Hurricane Allen
caused $55 million in damage in 1980. Last year, the area suffered
heavy flooding from two storms that drifted eastward from the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With many coastal areas susceptible to flooding, federal, state
and local officials began imploring residents to evacuate toward
San Antonio on Saturday afternoon. City officials in Corpus Christi
declared a state of disaster and declared a general but voluntary
evacuation until late in the afternoon, when remaining residents
were advised to find refuge in the city.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials evacuated 3,200 inmates to jails and
prisons further inland, while thousands of tourists vacationing in
the resort hotels of South Padre Island also fled the storm. The
U.S. Coast Guard closed the Corpus Christi ship channel, one of the
busiest ports in the nation, and answered several search and rescue
calls from boats struggling through the rough, surging waters of
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Schweikhard Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas Division of
Emergency Management, expressed concern that residents might fail
to heed evacuation warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a generation of Texans, either native to the
area or who have moved into the area, who have never experienced a
storm threat of this kind,'' Ms. Moss said. She added, ``Texas, to
this point, has been very, very fortunate, and obviously, it looks
like that luck has run out.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the mouth of the Rio Grande as far as 287 miles up the
Texas coastline to Galveston, residents heeded warnings and left in
droves. Motorists lumbered beneath black morning skies along
Interstate 37 out of Corpus Christi, pouring north and west toward
San Antonio and Austin. Electronic road signs along I-37 directed
the traffic to shelters in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Others fled along country roads through Nueces County, where
flat yellow and green fields seemed eerily still as clouds
approached from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get ugly,'' said Valerie Saenz, 25, as she
stopped at a convenience store in Corpus Christi for food en route
to San Antonio. ``I just packed up all my clothes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sterling, 34, a Corpus Christi resident, left early Sunday
morning for San Antonio with his family. His wife, Susan, is
expecting their second child in nine days. ``She's nervous,''
Sterling said. He also said some of his neighbors had scoffed at
the evacuation order. ``I think they're crazy, plumb crazy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of severe flooding prompted Corpus Christi officials
to evacuate 15,000 from Padre Island, near Corpus Christi, and the
local police closed the causeway connecting that barrier island to
the mainland. ``We expect heavy flooding in that area, and we don't
want those people trapped by rising water,'' said Chief Pete
Alvarez of the Corpus Christi police .
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baughman, director of operations for FEMA, said Sunday
that rescue and response teams were clustered at a staging area at
Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, awaiting the end of the storm.
Baughman said officials were gathering generators, bottled water,
ice, blankets and cots to distribute to storm victims. Witt said
that the American Red Cross had opened 14 shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had initially tracked toward the northern coast of
Mexico, then shifted northward toward Brownsville before finally
taking aim at Corpus Christi. But late in the day, Bret shifted
course to the west, steering at rural Kenedy and Kleberg Counties,
raising hopes for less property damage and a diminished threat to
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want anybody to get hit,'' said Juan
Ortiz, deputy emergency management director in Corpus Christi.
``But for us, it's a positive thing. It has been a very
unpredictable storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rafael Cuellar Jr. of Kenedy County said his county had
not issued an evacuation order and that the county's 1,000
residents were seeking refuge in three emergency shelters. He said
that the large number of oak trees in the county had slowed past
hurricanes. His wife, Anita, had refused to leave. ``She doesn't
want to leave the little dogs,'' Sheriff Cuellar, 60, said of their
two pets. By 10 p.m., however, they were in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kleberg County, home of the King Ranch, perhaps the most
famous ranch in Texas, Marcos Perez, the chief sheriff's deputy,
said officers were canvassing the county, making checks on people
who had chosen to stay. Officers planned to check back after the
storm to make certain that those who remained were safe. In
Kingsville, the county seat, city officials ordered the 25,000
residents to evacuate or seek emergency shelter. At the King Ranch
itself, the ranch hands huddled in a central location and prepared
for storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just boarding everything up,'' said Wade Roberts, of the
King Ranch security staff.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Cameron County and Brownsville, County Judge
Gilberto Hinojosa said ``at least a couple of thousand people'' had
flocked to local shelters in a county of 360,000 people. On
Saturday, when weather officials had predicted that Brownsville
would take a direct hit, Hinojosa said county workers drove buses
to low-lying areas to evacuate residents, most of whom refused to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression there is a lot of complacency,'' he said.
``People didn't think it was going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moss, the state emergency management official, noted that
this weekend marked the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Andrew.
The most violent recent storm to his Corpus Christi was Celia,
which lashed the coast on Aug. 3, 1970, killing 11 people, causing
tens of millions of dollars in damages and flooding much of the
city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that two other storms are also forming that could
potentially threaten the East Coast of the United States. ``This
season has just really truly started.''

CAROLINA POWER TO ACQUIRE FLORIDA PROGRESS FOR $5.3 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that will create a Southeastern utility with 2.5
million customers, the Carolina Power and Light Co. agreed Sunday
to acquire the Florida Progress Corp. for $5.3 billion in cash and
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies approved the deal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Florida
Progress, based in St. Petersburg, will receive $54 a share in cash
or a new share of common stock in a Carolina Power and Light
holding company. The cash and stock components will be adjusted if
more than 65 percent of Florida Progress shareholders choose cash
or more than 35 percent pick stock. The price is a 21 percent
premium based on Florida Progress' closing price of $44.625 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   William Cavanaugh, the chairman and chief executive of Carolina
Power and Light, who will have those posts in the merged company,
said the holding company structure would be in place by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the transaction, which is subject to
approval by shareholders and state and Federal regulators, to be
completed within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal is completed, the combined company will need to
cut about 7 percent of its work force, the companies said, leaving
about 16,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Korpan, the chairman and chief executive of Florida
Progress, will retire from his current posts once the transaction
is completed and will join the Carolina Power board.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Progress, which began as the St. Petersburg Electric
Light and Power Co., has its headquarters in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be based in Raleigh, N.C., where
Carolina Power and Light has its headquarters.

GATESES COMBINE FAMILY FOUNDATIONS TO CREATE GIANT CHARITABLE
OUTFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NEIL MODIE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The world's richest man has created America's richest
charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have
consolidated two family philanthropic entities into a $17.1 billion
powerhouse, fueled by three quarterly contributions that added a
total of $15.1 billion in assets this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent contribution, occurring this month, was a
Microsoft stock transfer that enlarged the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation by $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed organization combines the William H. Gates
Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation and will maintain
their focus on global health and education, foundation
co-chairwoman Patty Stonesifer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gateses' current rate of giving, the couple, whose worth
is valued at $71 billion, soon could have the world's wealthiest
foundation in terms of assets. According to the Chronicle of
Philanthropy, a newspaper that reports on non-profits, the
London-based Wellcome Trust has assets of $19.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from New York Sunday, Stonesifer said
she didn't know whether the Gateses intend to add a
multibillion-dollar donation in the fourth quarter of 1999 as they
have in each of the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what their timing is,'' she said. ``But they
have made a firm commitment to return the majority of their wealth
to society, and the foundation is their vehicle for doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 donations vaulted the Gates Foundation past the $13
billion David and Lucile Packard Foundation, now the nation's
second largest, and the $11.4 billion Ford Foundation, now in third
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle of Philanthropy said that with the latest
donations, ``the Gateses have given far more money than any other
living American.''
</P>
<P>
   The publication compared the Gateses' giving to the $4.1 billion
donated by duty-free store entrepreneur Charles F. Feeney, more
than $2 billion given away by former ambassador and publishing
magnate Walter H. Annenberg; a comparable sum donated by financier
George Soros, and $1.3 billion given or promised by CNN founder Ted
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the newly consolidated Gates Foundation are Stonesifer,
a former Microsoft senior vice president who is co-chairwoman and
president, and Gates' father, William H. Gates Jr., a retired
Seattle attorney who is co-chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the foundation is moving into new headquarters, 60,000
square feet of leased space in Seattle's Eastlake neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gates has operated the William H. Gates Foundation
largely out of his home office in Seattle's Laurelhurst
neighborhood. Stonesifer has run the learning foundation out of a
small office above a Redmond, Wash., pizza parlor.
</P>
<P>
   The combined organization has about 130 employees, of whom more
than 100 work with the Gates Center for Technology Access. It
provides training to bring Internet access and other technology to
libraries in urban and rural communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stonesifer said much of the Eastlake office space will be taken
up with classroom space where librarians and educators will work
with the Gates Center staff to increase public access to technology
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in endowment and the merger really just allows us
to sharpen the foundation's work in global health and learning,''
Stonesifer said. ``It allows us to identify and fund additional
programs in both of those areas'' and to eliminate overlap.
</P>
<P>
   The merging of the two foundations and the quantum increase in
their assets were disclosed by Newsweek magazine Sunday in
announcing a cover story about Gates in its Aug. 30 issue, which
reaches newsstands today.
</P>
<P>
   The article tells about the Gateses' charitable giving and
portrays the Microsoft boss as a fun-loving, good-humored family
man delighted with his role as a father of two young children.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying story describes Melinda Gates as very much his
equal partner.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story's title: ``Bill Just Wants to Have Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The articles could substantially soften Gates' reputation for
ruthlessness, a characterization exacerbated by negative publicity
from the Justice Department's ongoing antitrust suit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   From the inception of the first of the two Gates foundations in
1997, they have spent or committed $707.4 million, including $322.1
million for global health projects, $300.7 million for education,
$54.7 million for programs in the Pacific Northwest and $29.9
million for other philanthropic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest projects have included donations to build new
libraries, to help buy the Loomis Forest, an important
North-Central Washington wildlife habitat, to save it from logging
and road building; and to help finance a public sculpture garden in
the downtown Seattle waterfront area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to give to a wide range of civic and social
efforts across the Pacific Northwest,'' Stonesifer said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's global health initiatives have included $50
million to accelerate development of a new malaria vaccine; $100
million to speed the delivery of lifesaving vaccines to children in
developing countries; money to a Columbia University program to
prevent maternal death in pregnancy and childbirth in poor
countries, and $1 million to help develop an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Recent grants in the learning field have included $200 million
to bring computers, Internet access and training to libraries in
low-income communities in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Other grants have gone to the Teacher Leadership Project and
Smart Tools Academy in Washington state to improve access to
technology and training throughout the K-12 system at the
administrative level.
</P>
<P>
   Stonesifer said she and the senior Gates are meeting in New York
this week with representatives of other large foundations to
discuss how charitable programs among groups with common interests
might complement each other. The meeting was arranged by Dr. Vartan
Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation.
