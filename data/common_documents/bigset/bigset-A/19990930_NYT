MUSTANGS ARE YOUNG, HURT, NOT HOPELESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The SMU Mustangs discarded their unpopular red jerseys with the
New York Jets sleeves and returned to conventional blue last
weekend, not that it did much good.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hawaii discarded two ugly losing streaks, including one
of 15 in a row on the road and another involving 24 consecutive
road losses in WAC play that dated to a time when no one outside of
Arkansas had ever heard of the Clinton family. The 20-0 romp was
the third consecutive victory for the Rainbow Warriors (3-1), who
had previously snapped the nation's longest losing streak at 19
with a home victory against NCAA Division I-AA Eastern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   This one was witnessed by 15,131 mostly distraught fans at the
Cotton Bowl, and if matters do not improve quickly, the next home
throng might be closer to 1,500. The Mustangs are 0-3 and have been
shut out twice and outscored, 99-19.
</P>
<P>
   Is SMU really that bad?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, but the view from The Hilltop is not a cheery
one at the moment. In the finest tradition of American soap opera,
the Mustangs are young, hurt, and riding a string of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season's opening snap, three of the team's best
players _ a defensive lineman and two veterans of the offensive
line _ were lost for the year through surgery. Linebacker Vic
Viloria, the WAC defensive freshman of the year in '98, is
academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener against Arkansas, 26 Mustangs played their
first college game. Tackle to tackle, the offensive line consisted
of five players who had never played their respective positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the debacle against Hawaii, the Mustangs fumbled a scoring
chance at the 2-yard line and had two touchdowns _ a 70-yard run
and an interception return _ erased by penalties. Thus far,
freshmen and sophomores have accounted for 90 percent of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have a long way to go,'' SMU coach Mike Cavan
said. ``We've been through this before, and as coaches we just have
to keep our heads up and hope the kids will follow. But I don't
think I've ever had a team where this many things went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a win, and about all I can say is, hope is never
lost.'' Around the WAC Although his team is involved in a presumed
``showdown'' with Fresno State this week, TCU's Dennis Franchione
says there might not be a farthing's difference between top and
bottom in the WAC. ``I wouldn't be surprised if the eventual
champion has two (league) losses,'' he said. ``Right now, it looks
like anybody can beat anybody any time.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Hawaii. June Jones turned down a chance to
coach the San Diego Chargers to return ``home,'' brought in 25
fresh players, installed the run-and-shoot (NFL version), hired
Greg McMackin (Seahawks) as defensive coordinator, and is 3-1 at a
program generally regarded as Doormat of the Foreseeable Future.
``It's not always how good you are,'' Jones said. ``It's a matter
of putting 11 guys out there all going in the same direction.'' If
so, it's a new direction for the Rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a tough road trip out there,'' says UT-El Paso's
Charlie Bailey, whose Miners (2-2) will make the trip this week.
``I don't think we've got anybody on the squad who's ever been to
Hawaii _ but they've all heard about it, and that's the problem.
While you're out there lookin' at the beach, they roll you under.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey, who began coaching when the Beatles were young
(1964) and never met a Lost Cause he couldn't love, does not roll
under easily. Last year he was the old WAC's Pacific Division coach
of the year in ``The Sporting News'' for going 3-8 (with several
near-misses) at a program suffering from long-term futility and
loss of scholarships through NCAA penalty. Last week, he dragged
his team 45 miles up the road for a grudge match in Las Cruces
against an ancient arch-foe (New Mexico State) that was 3-0 and had
just whipped Arizona State by four touchdowns. He won, 54-23. ``We
got (running back) Elzie Johnson back, and we just kinda
exploded,'' he explained, innocently.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Rice (1-3), fresh off losses to Michigan and _ by
five points _ Texas, displaying signs in Saturday's victory against
Navy that it has abandoned its mistake-prone mode of the first two
weeks and is back to normal Owls football. One quarterback got hurt
and the other ran for 105 yards. Rice won with one turnover and 37
minutes in time of possession. This would not normally be
remarkable except that the foe was fellow spread-option devotee
Navy _ which should know how to handle this stuff.

 &HT;    Mets top Braves, halt skid at seven
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets registered a pulse on Wednesday night just
in time to flatline Greg Maddux's chances of 20 wins, kill the
Braves' eight-game winning streak and save their own postseason
hides with a 9-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Jarring themselves out of a seven-loss spiral with a seven-run
fourth inning, the Mets chased Maddux with the kind of inning that
they had to figure was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   It started humbly but just wouldn't stop. All eight batters
Maddux faced collected hits, some of which barely made it out of
the infield. But by the time John Olerud came to the plate, Maddux
couldn't keep the ball in the yard. Olerud drove the sixth grand
slam of his career to the Mets' bullpen in right field to complete
the worst inning of Maddux's season and possibly his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give them credit,'' Maddux said. ``They put the
ball in play and found some holes and Olerud got the big hit. I
wasn't really too upset with how I pitched in that inning. I was
upset with the outcome. I thought that was a pretty good pitch (the
fastball to Olerud), bad pitch selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's homer made it 8-2 Mets and basically 19-9 on the season
for Maddux, who left the game a Mike Piazza single later for his
earliest exit of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had scored nine runs in their previous four games
against the Braves _ all losses. The win kept them 1 1/2 back of
both the Reds and Astros in the wild-card standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were due, I think,'' said Brian Jordan, who drove in the
Braves' runs. ``We've been fortunate. They got the bounces
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the night, the Braves needed three wins in their final
five games to guarantee themselves home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The loss broke a string of six consecutive wins Maddux has had
against the Mets going back to 1996 and meant the Braves won't have
a 20-game winner for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go figure,'' Maddux said. ``Probably my worst year in a while
and I have a chance to win 20. I'm disappointed about it. (But) I
think I'm ready for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has lost three of his past four starts after winning
eight in a row. Not much of a postseason tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to end the way I ended today,'' Maddux said.
``But I feel good about the way I've thrown the ball, felt good
about the way I threw the ball tonight. Everybody knows our season
starts next week.''

ASTROS DRAW EVEN WITH REDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The race is back even.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed as though the red-hot Cincinnati Reds might
be too much for the wilting Houston Astros, Mike Hampton, the
Astros' best pitcher, stepped up and the Houston bats woke up.
Before 52,242 fans in the Astrodome Wednesday night, the Astros
erased the one-game lead the Reds had grabbed the night before and
regained a tie in the National League Central with a 4-1 victory,
ending Cincinnati's six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams now lead the New York Mets by a game and a half for
the wild-card spot and both will take Thursday off before closing
out the regular season. The Astros will be home against the Los
Angeles Dodgers in a three-game series, while the Reds finish up
with three games in Milwaukee against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling at the plate Tuesday, the Astros made the most
of seven hits, including a two-run home run by Daryle Ward. But the
real key was on the mound, where Hampton looked every bit the Cy
Young award winner he should become.
</P>
<P>
   As another Astros 20-game winner, Jose Lima, who lost the first
game of the series, said before Wednesday night's game: ``We're
human, but we don't need to be losing ball games at this time of
the year. We need to do the things we did early in the year _ go
eight innings and give the ball to Billy Wagner to close the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton went eight innings and gave up one run on seven hits,
striking out eight, in running his record to 21-4 before letting
Wagner close it out. With one out in the ninth, Wagner got Mark
Lewis to line out to him, then doubled up catcher Jason LaRue at
first to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's 21 victories matches an Astros mark set in 1979 by Joe
Niekro. Wagner recorded his 38th save and 100th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the best part of the season?'' Hampton said after the
game. ``No, that'll be when we win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Into the fourth inning of Wednesday night's game, there was a
World Series atmosphere in the Astrodome, which closes after this
season and has never been host to a Series. Although Hampton, who
is now 11-2 in the Astrodome this season, gave up a single off the
left-center-field wall to Sean Casey in the first inning, he shut
down the Reds after that. And Cincinnati's Steve Parris didn't
allow a hit until the third, when Tony Eusebio singled.
</P>
<P>
   In the Astros' fourth, with the game scoreless, Jeff Bagwell got
a three-run rally going when his sharp grounder spun shortstop
Barry Larkin around and forced a high throw _ and error _ to first.
Carl Everett then slammed a one-out double into the right-field
corner, sending Bagwell to third. Bagwell came across with the
first run of the game on a groundout by Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ward took Parris' 1-2 pitch over the right-field wall for
his eighth home run of the year and the Astros' 166th of the season
to make it 3-0.

TCU DEFENDER TAKES LIFE EASY, PLAYS LIKE A WHIRLWIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When discussing defensive end Aaron Schobel, TCU coach Dennis
Franchione adopts a reverential tone, his voice filling with awe
and admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron,'' he says, ``has figured out in life how to do only as
much as is necessary to get the job done, in every situation. And
that's it ... there is absolutely no wasted energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After observing this phenomenon for three seasons, safety Curtis
Fuller is prepared to offer further evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see Aaron walking down the sidewalk,'' he said,
laughing, ``he looks like he's been sedated.''
</P>
<P>
   Schobel himself insists that this is a simple misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not lazy,'' he says. ``I only ``appear'' to be lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this approach seems highly effective for the 6-foot-4,
244-pound junior from Columbus, who was an All-Western Athletic
Conference selection last year and seems destined to become TCU's
all-time sacks leader. With four in three games this year, he has
18 1/2 career sacks, chasing the school record of 22 set by Royal
West from 1991-94.
</P>
<P>
   Schobel, however, is no mere sack specialist. After forcing
three fumbles and blocking a kick last year, he has caused a fumble
and a safety this season. His two high-tackle career games came
against option teams, Rice and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a good football player,'' Franchione says. ``He has
instincts a lot of people don't have about getting to the ball.
He's our pride, a tremendous competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Franchione adds, laughing, ``He'll make a tremendous play
and then look like he's so tired he'll never make another.''
</P>
<P>
   Schobel, who is joined on the team by brother Matt, a sophomore
wide receiver, and cousin Bo, a freshman defensive end, admits that
in most circumstances, he's not exactly hyper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate running,'' he says. ``It's such a nuisance. And I
absolutely dread practice ... 24 periods out there just doesn't
appeal to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like to take notes in class. I'd rather just sit
there and listen, but the professors don't like it when you do
that. I walk real slow, I a guess I dress kind of sloppy, but it's
just the way I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm faster than I look, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schobel's speed has been his major trademark as a
defensive end. After Arizona rushed for 14 yards and allowed six
sacks and two safeties, Wildcats coach Dick Tomey observed, ``Aaron
Schobel is a tremendous football player, he has such great speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was fast enough to catch 98 passes during a high school
career in which he was variously a wide receiver, tight end,
defensive end and linebacker. Many of the passes were thrown by his
brother, an All-American high school quarterback who was originally
at Texas A&AMP;M but transferred to TCU last year and switched to wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M also recruited me, as a tight end,'' Aaron Schobel says,
``but I wanted to play defense, and that's a big reason why I came
to TCU. I did OK at linebacker in high school but defensive end is
my position. I can see the field better from that spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bo, a widely recruited defensive end and the son of
former TCU player Bob Schobel, arrived this year and now the three
Schobels share a house with backup quarterback Jeff Dover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two families are partners in Schobel's Restaurant in
Columbus, so we were all pretty close growing up,'' Schobel says,
although he adds that this did not interfere with the usual
brotherly scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably had about a hundred,'' he says. ``I always won, of
course. Well, I guess he (brother Matt) finally won one, but it was
because someone was holding me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all making out OK now. We keep the house pretty neat,
although the yard may not always be mowed. We cook pretty well but
we don't do much of it, because our folks keep sending us food that
we just heat up.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Schobel is prepared to take some aspects of life as
they come, he has now become focused on at least one goal on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I never thought about at first,'' he says.
``But now, I really want that sack record.'' nn

AVON'S STOCK DECLINES 27 PERCENT AFTER WARNING ABOUT PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Avon Products Inc. on Wednesday became the latest
multinational consumer products company to be pummeled by investors
after management announced a surprise warning that it expected to
report disappointing financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Avon shares fell $9.875, or 27.6 percent, to close at $25.8125
after the company said it was suffering from weak economies abroad,
currency volatility and stiff domestic competition. The
announcement came a day after Gillette Co. made a similar
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, said it would meet
expectations of earning 34 cents a share in the third quarter,
which ends Thursday, but would probably be short of analysts'
estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected profit of
63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, but Avon said Thursday that
it expected profits to be even with or only slightly higher than
the 56 cents earned in the period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Avon, which is based in New York, gets two-thirds of its profits
from outside the United States but is being hit by domestic woes as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of a currency devaluation in Brazil and
increased competition and heavy sales discounts in Mexico,
``results are not expected to reach the level previously
anticipated'' in Latin America, said chairman and chief executive
Charles Perrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, in the U.S., trends in beauty sales in the fourth
quarter are expected to improve significantly over third quarter,
but we are seeing weakness in early sales of holiday gifts, causing
us to revise the sales outlook in the U.S.,'' Perrin said. Avon had
expected domestic revenue to increase by 5 percent but now says it
will not meet that target.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Avon expects to report a double-digit increase in
profit over last year's $1.48 a share. Analysts polled by First
Call had expected the company to earn $1.71 but revised the number
Wednesday to $1.64. Some also downgraded the stock, despite Avon's
assurances that it was adopting a growth strategy and expected
sales growth to pick up next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. market, the company is facing an image problem as it
tries to further broaden its appeal beyond customers loyal to the
Avon Lady, analysts said. ``I've never seen a successful attempt to
take a brand that is on one level and try to take it up market,''
said Melissa Grant, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read LLC. Like
such formidable competing brands as Revlon and Cover Girl, Avon is
a well-known franchise but suffers from a low-brow image that has
long ``had a certain stigma attached to it,'' Ms. Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while investors were clearly caught off guard by the
weakness on Avon's home turf, they were reacting in large part to
the troubles abroad. ``The problem with the stock today is that
there is a lot of confusion over what is going to happen next year
and whether Latin America is going to be a lingering problem,''
said Robert Izmirlian, an analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Avon's warning came a day after Gillette, the Boston-based maker
of razors and blades, similarly stunned investors by forecasting
bad news. Gillette said after the market closed Tuesday that
results in its third quarter would not meet forecasts because of
weak economies abroad, currency translation issues and weakness in
its Braun and stationery businesses. Investors sent the stock to a
three-year low Wednesday at $33.4375, down $3.5625, or 9.6 percent.
Shares of other consumer giants that have recently had trouble
abroad, including Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., also declined Wednesday.
P&AMP;G's stock closed at $95.8125, down $3.125, or 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the kind of thing we need to expect more in
the future,'' Izmirlian said. In times of economic turmoil abroad,
``it's not always easy to assess the magnitude of the effect on a
company,'' he said. ``In the past, these companies really had some
steep multiples; going forward, investors need to be a little more
cautious.''

THE CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
UNDATED - None of McCain's battles have caused so much uproar _
especially in his own party _ as campaign-finance reform.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He surprised everyone by teaming with Democrat Russell Feingold
and drafting a bill that would cut the legs out from under the
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's target was ``soft money'' _ unlimited contributions
given to political &UR; parties by corporations. He sees this as the
ultimate evil in government, greasing the wheels for special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say this is a bit high-handed, especially coming from
a man who accepted $112,000 in campaign contributions from Charlie
Keating and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that McCain's stand on campaign-finance reform
has not prevented him from working Washington, D.C., for campaign
cash or accepting tens of thousands of dollars from corporations
who are under the thumb of the Commerce Committee, which McCain
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The committee holds sway over a number of key industries,
overseeing issues ranging from cable and satellite television rules
to airline deregulation to access to telephone long-distance
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this seeming contradiction, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott fired a salvo at McCain after he tried to re-energize
his campaign-finance bill in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think, when you're out there raising money right and
left,'' Lott told The New York Times , ``and then you're talking
about how you need to reform the system, it rings a little
hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he will persist because he believes the public wants
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans care very much that it is now legal for a
subsidiary of a corporation owned by the Chinese Army to give
unlimited amounts of money to American political campaigns,''
McCain says. ``Most Americans care very much that the Lincoln
bedroom has become a Motel 6 where the president of the United
States serves as the bellhop.''
</P>
<P>
   Though outspoken in Congress, McCain has resisted criticizing
other Republicans during the presidential race. Instead, he's
decided that Clinton makes a good whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kosovo conflict broke out, public affairs shows went
running to McCain, and he didn't disappoint them. He became the
first major political figure to question Clinton's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kosovo worked out in Clinton's favor, McCain didn't
really take a hit, said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department
of politics and international relations at Drake University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing backfired,'' Goldford said. ``McCain didn't propose
something, some use of force, that backfired and had tremendous
casualties and was a disaster. ''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was ultimately Clinton's call, ``McCain could take a
principled position and not worry about whether it actually worked
or not,'' Goldford said.
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from Kosovo, McCain says, Clinton has pursued a
``feckless, photo-op foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain blames the president for gutting the military, which has
seen its numbers reduced in recent years. He points to 11,000
military personnel on food stamps and pilots leaving the Navy and
Air Force in record numbers to fly for commercial airlines, where
they can make more money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also wants the armed forces rebuilt to better deal with
modern threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a military that is structured to fight a tank battle
on the plains of Europe,'' McCain says. ``What we need is a force
that can be moved around the world on short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that base closings are a must and that the government
must provide proper health care for World War II veterans. He says
it's an `` absolute disgrace'' that veterans are being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   How does one rebuild the military and cut taxes at the same
time? For McCain, that means targeting pork-barrel projects and
weapons systems that he deems unnecessary, such as the Sea Wolf
submarine, which will cost $4 billion apiece.
</P>
<P>
   He also promises to repair Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``More young Americans believe that Elvis is alive then believe
they'll ever see a Social Security check,'' McCain says, adding
that many in Congress don't see the need to repair Social Security.
``They figure, ` Since I'll be gone by then, I'll let you figure it
out yourselves. And you don't vote, so hell.'' &QL; sub`A very effective
voice' &QL;  Some
have criticized McCain for failing to pass a piece of major
legislation during his 17 years in Congress. McCain-Feingold died,
as did his anti-tobacco bill. His line-item veto did pass, but it
was later tossed out by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said McCain shouldn't be
judged on the number of bills he passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should look at a person's success by how many bills they
stopped,'' Salmon said. ``He's been a very effective voice at
cutting wasteful spending. I don't judge a person based on how many
bills they get through. . . . I think that's a bogus way of
appraising somebody's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was first elected to the House in 1982 and served two
terms. As a freshman congressman, he broke from the pack in
criticizing President Reagan's decision to station troops in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In a House floor speech in September 1983, McCain called for the
withdrawal of all U.S. Marines from Lebanon. He was one of 27
Republicans to defy Reagan openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer we stay in Lebanon, the harder it will be for us to
leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, McCain was tragically proved right when the
Marine barracks were bombed, killing 241 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   That speech drew national press for McCain, who was lauded in
Rolling
</P>
<P>
   Stone magazine and was listed as a ``Republican on the rise'' by
U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his second House term was dominated by talk of him
running for the Senate, though in 1985, he drew more national
attention when he returned to Vietnam with CBS news legend Walter
Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McCain was elected to the Senate, replacing legendary
Arizona conservative Barry Goldwater. In 1998, McCain was elected
to his third term.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McCain has earned his maverick status. He's not
afraid to make a controversial floor speech, though some argue they
have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   His defiant nature plays well in Arizona, a conservative state
with a sagebrush-rebellion mentality. GOP voters also like McCain's
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he's been a good Republican, in some ways
more conservative than Goldwater. During most of his years in
Congress, he has been in the minority party.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McCain voted with his party 81 percent of the time.
He voted to convict Clinton during the president's impeachment and
supported the Contract With America.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan years, McCain followed the party line, voting
for prayer in public schools, the 1986 tax reform act, continued
subsidies for tobacco companies and the reintroduction of some
handgun sales.
</P>
<P>
   He voted against the Equal Rights Amendment, funding for the
Clean Air Act and opposed the 1983 nuclear freeze resolution.
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, he would go against the tide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McCain voted with a two-thirds majority to override
Reagan's veto of sanctions against South Africa. The next year, he
outfoxed the administration and stopped an attempt to funnel $28
million from a poverty food program into a raise for Department of
Agriculture employees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, McCain is
shepherding the deregulation of the telephone industry as well as
dealing with burgeoning issues involving transportation, cable
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has made a name for himself by fighting wasteful
government spending, which often takes the form of pet federal
projects in congressmen's or senators' districts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign rhetoric, McCain notes that Congress
looks at appropriations bills ``the way Willie Sutton looked at
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   To root out the pork, McCain has stationed a staffer at
Appropriations Committee meetings. He also pushed the line-item
veto, which would allow the president to remove certain elements of
a bill while allowing the legislation to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Although it passed, the courts struck down the line-item veto in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently started his ``It's Your Country'' Web site
(www.itsyourcountry. com), to monitor pork and corporate welfare.
It includes ``the daily outrage,'' naming companies that get huge
federal subsidies in exchange for contributions to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also targeted Big Tobacco, seeking to raise taxes on
cigarettes to help states pay their smoking-related health care
costs, finance an anti-smoking advertising campaign and pay for
health research.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry mounted a $40 million national advertising
campaign to defeat McCain's anti-tobacco bill, and it ultimately
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers are the children of America,'' McCain said after
the bill went down. &QL; subWatching his temper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, John McCain is on his best behavior. He is focused
on becoming president, and he's not going to let his temper get in
the way. When reporters chase him on the street and ask for just
one more question, McCain is accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything,'' he says. ``Anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been this way. More than one reporter has
picked up his phone in the morning to hear McCain shrieking on the
other end, furious over some injustice.
</P>
<P>
   When The Republic ran an editorial cartoon about his wife
Cindy's drug addiction, the senator didn't speak to his hometown
paper for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon, by Steve Benson, The Republic 's Pulitzer
Prize-winning cartoonist, showed Cindy McCain holding an emaciated
child upside down by the ankle and shaking him over a field of
starving children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit your crying and give me the drugs,'' read the caption.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has yelled at bureaucrats, dressed down fellow
members of Congress and earned the name Senator Hothead from
Washingtonian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizona elected officials have been scarred by run-ins with
McCain, who brooks no disloyalty _ you are either with him or
against him.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is a shrewd campaigner. He knows he can't show that
side if he's going to reach the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   His flaws remain below the surface, and they aren't drawing a
lot of press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to have some new twist to it or new information,
something like, hey, did you know . . .'' McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people who will attack me. I've heard
some of the damnedest things said about me. I was on a radio show
in Charleston (S.C.), and someone calls up and says, `Did you ever
commit adultery with prostitutes in Subic Bay?' '' McCain recalls,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said the last time I was in Subic Bay was 1966, but no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once every couple weeks, some hand grenade is lobbed into the
headquarters with some stupid statement or charge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has one advantage: Much of his dirty laundry already has
been aired.
</P>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ McCain's campaign van is rocketing down the road
to another event, another 100 people who want to shake his hand,
hear his words, hope against hope that he'll be president.
</P>
<P>
   He's leaning way back in the seat, answering questions about
Vietnam, about Charlie Keating, about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Just for a moment, his eyes close and he slumps a little, the
weight of the campaign on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's asked to define his message. McCain's eyes flutter
open. The van is pulling to a stop in front of someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform,'' McCain says as the door slides open.
</P>
<P>
   There is faint smattering of applause from the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Principle,'' he says. ``And freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he is gone. &QL;

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Mishael Bertrand said it might have looked
like a lazy afternoon jog, when she ran up and down a two-way road
in her hometown of Pottsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists honked their horns as they drove by. Sometimes, they
would wave, and Bertrand would wave back. Bertrand, a track athlete
at Texas-Arlington, said it was actually fun to see a lot of people
in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the road (Farm Road 120), which Bertrand calls ``the only
main one in town'' was her place of work, and she spent this past
summer being anything but lazy. Bertrand had measured distances
with her car and marked lines on the road.
</P>
<P>
   She started and stopped at different intervals to mix things up.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand, much to the delight of Mavericks track and field coach
John Sauerhage, made an unexpected commitment to cross country. An
800-meter specialist, she started to see results halfway through
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called coach Sauerhage and told him I was excited about the
cross country season, and I don't think I've ever said that
before,'' Bertrand said. ``I felt like, last year, I let the cross
country team down. I wanted to prove this year that I could do it.
This time, I actually put a lot of effort and hard work into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two meets into the 1999 cross country season, Sauerhage could
see Bertrand's work on that road was paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 57th _ seventh on Texas-Arlington's team _ at
last season's Southland Conference Cross Country Championships,
Bertrand has opened her junior season with a bang. She was seventh
overall _ first on Texas-Arlington's squad _ at the Texas-Arlington
Invitational at Vandergriff Park on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, she showed it wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand led the Mavericks again with a 12th-place finish at the
SMU Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerhage said Bertrand's improvement, combined with a solid
recruiting class, has helped change his mind about his team's
chances this fall, and he has gone from waiting for the indoor
season to thinking his team could win the SLC title.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington has three meets before the Nov. 1 SLC meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are scheduled to compete Friday at the UNT
Invitational in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I get so fired up about her is that I've
seen her do some things that are borderline world class,''
Sauerhage said. ``This is world class, the way she has decided to
step up and commit herself to doing whatever it takes to improve.
Some people talk and daydream about doing great things. Mishael is
actually doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   A better season in cross country is the immediate goal at the
end of Bertrand's road, but she said it's not the ultimate one.
Bertrand's specialty is the 800 meters, and she said she considers
herself more of a sprinter than a distance runner.
</P>
<P>
   She was the 1997 Class 3A state champion in the 800 meters and
the runner-up in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   During the last outdoor track season, Bertrand ran a season-best
time of 2 minutes, 9.72 seconds at the Texas-Arlington Open. She
went on to win the SLC title, but she finished below the NCAA
automatic qualifying time of 2:05.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a lot of speed and a lot of endurance in the
800,'' Bertrand said. ``I've always had speed. What I've lacked is
the endurance to last two laps. Training for cross country will
give me a lot of strength in the 800.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauerhage said Bertrand could trim five seconds off her time,
enough to qualify for nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said he can see a 2:04 or 2:03 in Bertrand's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to be stronger, and it's apparent that she has
recognized that,'' Sauerhage said. ``When you have speed, strength
and confidence, you can pop a big race. The first thing for her to
do is be an NCAA qualifier, and that's not dreaming. She has that
kind of talent. Cross country is just a bonus. No matter how she
finishes in that, she is laying the groundwork for a great track
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand laid that groundwork on that road in Pottsboro, the
``only main one in town.'' nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Oklahoma offensive guard Jay Smith couldn't be
blamed if he was bitter toward the Sooners' football program.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the 6-foot-4, 295-pound senior signed with
Oklahoma out of Lamar High School. Smith said he was impressed with
the Sooners' tradition of winning, especially in 1993 when Oklahoma
defeated five Southwest Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sooners have been anything but traditional during his
time at Oklahoma. And Smith has had anything but a conventional
career with the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   He's experienced two near-debilitating injuries, seen a
revolving door of coaches and languished through three consecutive
losing seasons. But when No. 23 Oklahoma takes the field Saturday
against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., Smith will see the Sooners
return to the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil, Smith said he doesn't regret his decision
to play here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned more as a person about life, about playing for so
many coaches, assistant coaches, position coaches and learning all
their different philosophies,'' he said. ``This year, they're
working hard to turn this thing around. I don't think I would have
learned this much about life playing at one place with one coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's six-year tenure at Oklahoma has earned him the
distinction of being the first football player in NCAA history to
have played for four head coaches. With one redshirt year and one
medical hardship year, he's also been around long enough to
experience the Sooners' early resurgence this season. It is as if
he's come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is an experienced veteran lineman in a dynamic
pass-oriented attack that has the 3-0 Sooners leading the nation in
scoring, total offense and passing. Smith's primary job at left
guard is to protect quarterback Josh Heupel and give the nation's
total-offense leader time to throw the football.
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting to play in the nationally televised game against
a team steeped with tradition is motivation enough for Smith, who
has battled through two Achilles' tendon injuries at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd be around for this game,'' he said. ``I
worked hard all summer to get ready to play in this game. It's an
important game for the program _ and for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing seasons haven't gotten to him as much as missing games
after undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I was ever going to play again,'' said Smith,
who was on crutches for four months. ``The changing of coaches
hasn't been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith played for Gary Gibbs, Howard Schnellenberger, John Blake
and now Bob Stoops. The constant for Smith has been former
assistant coach Merv Johnson, who recruited Smith and remains with
the Oklahoma program as director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Johnson) was an old-time coach and I wanted to play for him
and I wanted to play in the Big Eight and play in the Orange
Bowl,'' Smith said. ``The tradition here is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had no desire to play for a SWC school, but he
didn't realize the Big 12 Conference was forming until he arrived
at OU in the fall of 1994. ``If I'd known, I would have looked at
the Texas schools in the Big 12,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith isn't looking back. He's happy with the medical
hardship ruling that allowed him the sixth year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to prove to everyone that I could come back
from two major injuries in the same place,'' he said. ``I've proven
to everyone that I can come back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith takes some kidding for his longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Junior fullback Seth Littrell calls Smith ``one of our old men
around here.'' Offensive coordinator Mike Leach said Smith
``probably has played for more coaches than I've worked for.''
</P>
<P>
   But offensive line coach Mark Mangino, who works with Smith on
the Sooners' new blocking techniques, said he appreciates Smith's
experience: ``He really brings some age to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL fades in and out of his reality, said Smith, who's
working on a masters in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some days when I'm thinking about wanting to make
the NFL. And there are other days I think about wanting to make a
difference in the business world,'' he said. ``If I keep playing
and don't get injured, there could be some places where I can fit
in in the NFL. If not, I can complete my graduate school.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he's been part of the Sooners program for so long
amazes even Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weird thing dawned on me the other day out on the practice
field,'' Smith said. ``I leaned back and looked around and realized
that I'm about two months from being 24 years old and here I am out
here with guys 18, 19 and 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys playing football might play two or three years in
the NFL and they can be done at 24. Here I am still playing.''

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - For many politicians, the Keating scandal would have
been too much to overcome. But McCain refused to go down easily.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He employed a dual strategy. He would make himself accessible to
any reporter anywhere who wanted to talk about the Keating Five,
and he wouldn't let the controversy detract from his work as a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   McCain grimly marched about the country, struggling to clear his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say, it was not an easy time,'' said Torie Clarke,
McCain's former press secretary. ``But because of the strategy he
decided to pursue . . . nobody had time to sit around and feel
sorry for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hobnobbing with the press had an unexpected side
effect. Reporters started to like him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain always returned phone calls. He showed up for his
television appearances. He was willing to go off the record to help
reporters unearth certain stories. He answered questions bluntly,
without much political tap dancing.
</P>
<P>
   For Beltway reporters bored with bureaucrats, McCain was fresh,
new and different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in town,'' Clarke said, ``from the makeup artist at
the local news station to the producers and directors, every
reporter and every editor, loves working with John McCain because
he does not stand on ceremony, he has no airs.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the 1992 election, some thought McCain was in
trouble. President Bush was flagging in the polls, and McCain was
coming off the Keating scandal. His Democratic opponent was Claire
Sargent, a Phoenix community activist. Former Gov. Evan Mecham was
running as an independent despite having been impeached and removed
from office in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's image improved in 1991. Soon after the Persian Gulf
War broke out, McCain was in demand. The phone began ringing off
the hook the day POWs were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Today Show called, and we started on The Today Show at
four-something in the morning,'' said Scott Celley, a former aide.
``The last thing I remember him being on was Australian Nightline,
which was done here at Channel 10, a few blocks away, at close to
11 p.m. He was on television or the radio every minute of that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain became a regular on public affairs shows, using his
expertise as a former Navy pilot and POW. McCain quickly became a
national authority on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The din of the Keating Five began to lessen. McCain stayed on
message and began to distance himself from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, McCain received 58 percent of the vote in the three-way
election, easily winning a second Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not go as well for Charlie Keating. In January 1993,
a federal jury convicted him of 73 counts of wire and bankruptcy
fraud in the collapse of American Continental and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison but
served just 50 months before the conviction was overturned on a
technicality. In 1999, at age 75, he pleaded guilty to four counts
of fraud for siphoning some $975,000 from American Continental
before he had declared bankruptcy in 1989. He was sentenced to time
served.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, McCain was lionized in The Nightingale's Song , a book
that examined the military and political careers of McCain and four
other Annapolis graduates, James Webb, Robert McFarlane, John
Poindexter and Oliver North.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Timberg devotes two of his 475 pages to the Keating
scandal and says this about it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripped of the veneer of sleaze that coated the affair,
McCain's defense of his actions was solid and credible. It didn't
matter. The Keating Five label endured, shabby journalistic
shorthand that made up in simplemindedness what it lacked in
precision.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, McCain was considered a front-runner to be Bob Dole's
running mate in the race against Clinton and Al Gore, before Dole
picked Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Keating Five scandal is barely mentioned. In most
national profiles of McCain, it has been reduced to one paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows it will never disappear altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be on my tombstone,'' McCain told 60 Minutes' Mike
Wallace. ``One of the Keating Five.'' &QL; 
MCCAIN ERUPTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, despite McCain's battering over Keating, he
didn't stop throwing his weight around Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some public officials are still stinging from McCain's volcanic
temper.
</P>
<P>
   One is Democrat Paul Johnson, the former mayor of Phoenix and an
unsuccessful candidate for governor. During Johnson's stint as
mayor, he saw McCain's temper up close, and it makes him think
twice about McCain becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His volatility borders in the area of being unstable,''
Johnson said. ``Before I let this guy put his finger on the button,
I would have to give considerable pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he got a full dose of McCain's anger when he was in
Washington in 1992, dealing with a federal land swap that involved
the Phoenix Indian School. He and McCain, who disagreed over the
issue, were in a hearing room with other mayors when hostilities
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Start a tape recorder. It's best when you get a liar
on tape,' '' Johnson recalled. ``Then I said something back to him,
and before you knew it, we were nose to nose and chin to chin. No
blows were exchanged, but we were as close to being 14-year-old
boys as we possibly could be. . . . Testosterone was flowing all
over place.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who also fought McCain's plan for a regional airport,
marvels at his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, gosh, you never dealt with a more brutal individual,''
Johnson said. `` He was very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's penchant for bullying state officials essentially
destroyed his relationship with Grant Woods, who served as state
attorney general from 1990 until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, son of powerful Mesa contractor Joe E. Woods, was an
early McCain staffer. He provided key help in McCain's first run
for Congress, mainly by persuading his influential father to
support McCain in Mesa over several local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of Joe Woods in the district was about 100 times
more important than the support of Grant Woods,'' the younger Woods
said. ``When he went with McCain, it made it OK for the old guard
to support McCain rather than one of the locals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woods-McCain relationship began to chill in 1994 when Woods
started investigating bid-rigging allegations surrounding Gov. Fife
Symington's government cost-cutting program, Project SLIM. Despite
pressure from other Republicans, including McCain, Woods pursued
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McCain had become very close to Symington. Even
their staffs were tied together. Symington's former chief of staff,
Wes Gullett, is McCain's deputy campaign director and is married to
McCain aide Deb Gullett.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that McCain called for the scalp of Gov. Evan
Mecham, who was impeached and removed from office, but let
Symington slide when he was under indictment for bank fraud.
Symington later was convicted and resigned, but his conviction was
overturned earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the state was operating smoothly under Symington,
which was not the case with Mecham. He bristled when it was
suggested that he was protecting a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really won't answer that kind of insinuation,'' McCain said.
``I do what's best for the state. I do what's best for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added, ``Of course (Symington) was a friend of mine. I
had a friendly relationship with Gov. Mecham before he got into the
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said McCain didn't like it when he investigated Symington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he probably liked to be in the loop,'' Woods said.
``Consequently, when he wasn't, and then I kept investigating
Republicans or criticizing Republicans . . . he never could get
over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared clear to me that the only way I could return to
his good graces was to be a good boy, and I wasn't willing to be a
good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McCain and Woods had it out over Symington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just did not approve of me constantly making life difficult
for Republicans, and I made it clear that it wasn't going to
change, and we weren't going to have any more of these
conversations. We haven't talked in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods ultimately obtained a $725,000 civil settlement in the
SLIM case.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he finds it ironic that McCain, Mr. Maverick in the
Senate, didn't want Woods to assume the same role in the Arizona
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's OK to be the maverick but not tolerate mavericks
around you,'' Woods said. &QL; 
WIFE'S DRUG SCANDAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the national stage seemed to care about McCain's
foibles. By the early 1990s, his political rehabilitation was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   What McCain didn't know was that the Keating scandal had already
claimed another victim, one from McCain's own family.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1994, a group of Valley journalists received a strange
phone call from Jay Smith, McCain's political strategist.
</P>
<P>
   They were offered an exclusive in exchange for agreeing to
certain terms. They would attend individual interview sessions Aug.
19 and sit on the story until Aug. 22. The five journalists _ three
print reporters, a television reporter and a radio reporter _
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they went to the McCain home, where they were told
an incredible story.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain told them that she had been a drug addict for three
years. From 1989 to 1992, she was addicted to Percocet and Vicodin.
Worse, she had stolen pills from the American Voluntary Medical
Team, a relief organization that she founded to aid Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I wanted to be able to face my children,''
she said at the time, ``for them to know I wasn't lying to them.
They're too young to fully understand right now, but someday they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy blamed two back surgeries and the Keating Five scandal _ a
mix of physical and emotional pain _ for driving her to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to unravel when a Drug Enforcement Administration
audit found irregularities in AVMT's records, prompting an
investigation, Cindy told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as the Keating affair surfaced again during McCain's
run for a second Senate term, Cindy's parents confronted her about
her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   What had been so clear to Cindy's parents was lost on McCain,
who said he hadn't noticed his wife's addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' McCain said at the time. ``Naturally, I felt
enormous sadness for Cindy and a certain sense of guilt that I
hadn't detected it. I feel very sorry for what she went through,
but I'm very proud she was able to come out of it. For her, it was
like the Keating affair had been for me _ a searing experience, and
we both came out stronger. I think it has strengthened our marriage
and our overall relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid prosecution on drug charges, she would enter a federal
diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   In telling her story, Cindy got choked up when she told of
federal drug agents knocking on her door, asking about missing
pills.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters were sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy had always been physically fragile. She suffered two
miscarriages early in her marriage to McCain until doctors
determined she was a ``DES baby.'' Cindy's mother had been given
the drug diethylstilbestrol during her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s and '50s, DES was thought to prevent
miscarriages. Instead, it caused numerous birth defects, including
deformed uteruses in female offspring. Doctors finally detected the
problem and took special precautions during Cindy's third
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there were long separations, because Cindy couldn't
travel while pregnant. Besides, she preferred Arizona to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy told the reporters that she finally entered The Meadows, a
drug-treatment center in Wickenburg, and went to anti-dependency
meetings twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she said, a hysterectomy ended the nagging back pain
that had driven her to the painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   So why go public a year later?
</P>
<P>
   ``If what I say can help just one person to face the problem,
it's worthwhile, '' she said. ``They should know it's OK to be
scared. It's OK to talk about it. And there's nothing wrong with
staying home, carpooling and potty-training a 3-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Cindy's heartfelt confession, the hand-picked journalists
did what Smith expected. They painted Cindy as the victim, a
courageous soldier beating back the devil of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But there was far more to the story. The reporters had been the
victims of a spin job. It became apparent the next week, as more
details came out.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain had organized the interviews to head off a far more
negative story, one that centered on a former AVMT employee who
accused Cindy McCain in a lawsuit of ordering him to conceal
``improper acts'' and `` misrepresent facts in a judicial
proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The accuser was Tom Gosinski, who had been fired from AVMT in
1993. It was he who had tipped the DEA to check out Cindy's
organization. His lawsuit had been filed as a warning shot _ his
real allegation was that Cindy McCain had fired him because he
``knew too much'' about her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The details were in a 212-page report from the Maricopa County
Attorney's Office that was about to become public when McCain
arranged the interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, County Attorney Rick Romley entered the fray at the
request of McCain lawyer John Dowd, who charged that Gosinski was
extorting the McCains by offering to settle the case for $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   By asking Romley to investigate, Dowd helped create a public
record that otherwise wouldn't have existed. When the report was
released, McCain lost control of the story. Reporters who had been
cut out of Cindy's private interview sessions, including those from
The Republic, pursued it with new vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated that his spin had failed to take, McCain refused to
talk to reporters who weren't invited to Cindy's private
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd, who would later defend Gov. Fife Symington, put it plainly
to a Republic reporter who called him for comment:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to talk to Cindy. You're not going to talk to
me. You're not going to talk to anybody associated with us. Have
you got the message?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new allegations were surfacing, feeding the press
frenzy for fresh angles, especially in light of McCain's silence.
</P>
<P>
   Gosinski alleged that Cindy had asked him to lie to make it
easier for her to adopt a baby from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Backed up by court documents, the McCains denied there was
anything improper in the adoption. They noted that the adoption
probably saved the girl's life, as her cleft palate would not have
allowed her to survive in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gosinski's credibility started to slip. In Romley's
report, several AVMT staffers said Gosinski had privately
threatened to blackmail Cindy if she ever fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gosinski's lawsuit was dropped and he was never
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The issue hasn't quite died. During a recent campaign swing
through South Carolina, a New York Daily News reporter asked Cindy
about her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   She replied that she has been drug-free for eight years, but she
acknowledged that she will always be in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a real problem,'' she said, ``and I dealt with my
addiction head-on. '' &QL;

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
UNDATED - None of McCain's battles have caused so much uproar _
especially in his own party _ as campaign-finance reform.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He surprised everyone by teaming with Democrat Russell Feingold
and drafting a bill that would cut the legs out from under the
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's target was ``soft money'' _ unlimited contributions
given to political &UR; parties by corporations. He sees this as the
ultimate evil in government, greasing the wheels for special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say this is a bit high-handed, especially coming from
a man who accepted $112,000 in campaign contributions from Charlie
Keating and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that McCain's stand on campaign-finance reform
has not prevented him from working Washington, D.C., for campaign
cash or accepting tens of thousands of dollars from corporations
who are under the thumb of the Commerce Committee, which McCain
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The committee holds sway over a number of key industries,
overseeing issues ranging from cable and satellite television rules
to airline deregulation to access to telephone long-distance
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this seeming contradiction, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott fired a salvo at McCain after he tried to re-energize
his campaign-finance bill in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think, when you're out there raising money right and
left,'' Lott told The New York Times , ``and then you're talking
about how you need to reform the system, it rings a little
hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he will persist because he believes the public wants
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans care very much that it is now legal for a
subsidiary of a corporation owned by the Chinese Army to give
unlimited amounts of money to American political campaigns,''
McCain says. ``Most Americans care very much that the Lincoln
bedroom has become a Motel 6 where the president of the United
States serves as the bellhop.''
</P>
<P>
   Though outspoken in Congress, McCain has resisted criticizing
other Republicans during the presidential race. Instead, he's
decided that Clinton makes a good whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kosovo conflict broke out, public affairs shows went
running to McCain, and he didn't disappoint them. He became the
first major political figure to question Clinton's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kosovo worked out in Clinton's favor, McCain didn't
really take a hit, said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department
of politics and international relations at Drake University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing backfired,'' Goldford said. ``McCain didn't propose
something, some use of force, that backfired and had tremendous
casualties and was a disaster. ''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was ultimately Clinton's call, ``McCain could take a
principled position and not worry about whether it actually worked
or not,'' Goldford said.
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from Kosovo, McCain says, Clinton has pursued a
``feckless, photo-op foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain blames the president for gutting the military, which has
seen its numbers reduced in recent years. He points to 11,000
military personnel on food stamps and pilots leaving the Navy and
Air Force in record numbers to fly for commercial airlines, where
they can make more money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also wants the armed forces rebuilt to better deal with
modern threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a military that is structured to fight a tank battle
on the plains of Europe,'' McCain says. ``What we need is a force
that can be moved around the world on short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that base closings are a must and that the government
must provide proper health care for World War II veterans. He says
it's an `` absolute disgrace'' that veterans are being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   How does one rebuild the military and cut taxes at the same
time? For McCain, that means targeting pork-barrel projects and
weapons systems that he deems unnecessary, such as the Sea Wolf
submarine, which will cost $4 billion apiece.
</P>
<P>
   He also promises to repair Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``More young Americans believe that Elvis is alive then believe
they'll ever see a Social Security check,'' McCain says, adding
that many in Congress don't see the need to repair Social Security.
``They figure, ` Since I'll be gone by then, I'll let you figure it
out yourselves. And you don't vote, so hell.'' &QL; 
`A VERY EFFECTIVE VOICE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized McCain for failing to pass a piece of major
legislation during his 17 years in Congress. McCain-Feingold died,
as did his anti-tobacco bill. His line-item veto did pass, but it
was later tossed out by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said McCain shouldn't be
judged on the number of bills he passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should look at a person's success by how many bills they
stopped,'' Salmon said. ``He's been a very effective voice at
cutting wasteful spending. I don't judge a person based on how many
bills they get through. . . . I think that's a bogus way of
appraising somebody's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was first elected to the House in 1982 and served two
terms. As a freshman congressman, he broke from the pack in
criticizing President Reagan's decision to station troops in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In a House floor speech in September 1983, McCain called for the
withdrawal of all U.S. Marines from Lebanon. He was one of 27
Republicans to defy Reagan openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer we stay in Lebanon, the harder it will be for us to
leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, McCain was tragically proved right when the
Marine barracks were bombed, killing 241 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   That speech drew national press for McCain, who was lauded in
Rolling
</P>
<P>
   Stone magazine and was listed as a ``Republican on the rise'' by
U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his second House term was dominated by talk of him
running for the Senate, though in 1985, he drew more national
attention when he returned to Vietnam with CBS news legend Walter
Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McCain was elected to the Senate, replacing legendary
Arizona conservative Barry Goldwater. In 1998, McCain was elected
to his third term.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McCain has earned his maverick status. He's not
afraid to make a controversial floor speech, though some argue they
have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   His defiant nature plays well in Arizona, a conservative state
with a sagebrush-rebellion mentality. GOP voters also like McCain's
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he's been a good Republican, in some ways
more conservative than Goldwater. During most of his years in
Congress, he has been in the minority party.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McCain voted with his party 81 percent of the time.
He voted to convict Clinton during the president's impeachment and
supported the Contract With America.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan years, McCain followed the party line, voting
for prayer in public schools, the 1986 tax reform act, continued
subsidies for tobacco companies and the reintroduction of some
handgun sales.
</P>
<P>
   He voted against the Equal Rights Amendment, funding for the
Clean Air Act and opposed the 1983 nuclear freeze resolution.
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, he would go against the tide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McCain voted with a two-thirds majority to override
Reagan's veto of sanctions against South Africa. The next year, he
outfoxed the administration and stopped an attempt to funnel $28
million from a poverty food program into a raise for Department of
Agriculture employees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, McCain is
shepherding the deregulation of the telephone industry as well as
dealing with burgeoning issues involving transportation, cable
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has made a name for himself by fighting wasteful
government spending, which often takes the form of pet federal
projects in congressmen's or senators' districts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign rhetoric, McCain notes that Congress
looks at appropriations bills ``the way Willie Sutton looked at
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   To root out the pork, McCain has stationed a staffer at
Appropriations Committee meetings. He also pushed the line-item
veto, which would allow the president to remove certain elements of
a bill while allowing the legislation to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Although it passed, the courts struck down the line-item veto in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently started his ``It's Your Country'' Web site
(www.itsyourcountry. com), to monitor pork and corporate welfare.
It includes ``the daily outrage,'' naming companies that get huge
federal subsidies in exchange for contributions to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also targeted Big Tobacco, seeking to raise taxes on
cigarettes to help states pay their smoking-related health care
costs, finance an anti-smoking advertising campaign and pay for
health research.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry mounted a $40 million national advertising
campaign to defeat McCain's anti-tobacco bill, and it ultimately
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers are the children of America,'' McCain said after
the bill went down. &QL; 
WATCHING HIS TEMPER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, John McCain is on his best behavior. He is focused
on becoming president, and he's not going to let his temper get in
the way. When reporters chase him on the street and ask for just
one more question, McCain is accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything,'' he says. ``Anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been this way. More than one reporter has
picked up his phone in the morning to hear McCain shrieking on the
other end, furious over some injustice.
</P>
<P>
   When The Republic ran an editorial cartoon about his wife
Cindy's drug addiction, the senator didn't speak to his hometown
paper for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon, by Steve Benson, The Republic 's Pulitzer
Prize-winning cartoonist, showed Cindy McCain holding an emaciated
child upside down by the ankle and shaking him over a field of
starving children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit your crying and give me the drugs,'' read the caption.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has yelled at bureaucrats, dressed down fellow
members of Congress and earned the name Senator Hothead from
Washingtonian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizona elected officials have been scarred by run-ins with
McCain, who brooks no disloyalty _ you are either with him or
against him.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is a shrewd campaigner. He knows he can't show that
side if he's going to reach the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   His flaws remain below the surface, and they aren't drawing a
lot of press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to have some new twist to it or new information,
something like, hey, did you know . . .'' McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people who will attack me. I've heard
some of the damnedest things said about me. I was on a radio show
in Charleston (S.C.), and someone calls up and says, `Did you ever
commit adultery with prostitutes in Subic Bay?' '' McCain recalls,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said the last time I was in Subic Bay was 1966, but no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once every couple weeks, some hand grenade is lobbed into the
headquarters with some stupid statement or charge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has one advantage: Much of his dirty laundry already has
been aired.
</P>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ McCain's campaign van is rocketing down the road
to another event, another 100 people who want to shake his hand,
hear his words, hope against hope that he'll be president.
</P>
<P>
   He's leaning way back in the seat, answering questions about
Vietnam, about Charlie Keating, about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Just for a moment, his eyes close and he slumps a little, the
weight of the campaign on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's asked to define his message. McCain's eyes flutter
open. The van is pulling to a stop in front of someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform,'' McCain says as the door slides open.
</P>
<P>
   There is faint smattering of applause from the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Principle,'' he says. ``And freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he is gone. &QL;

CUT IN FIBER CABLE DISRUPTS INTERNET TRAFFIC NATIONWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet traffic across the United States was severely disrupted
Wednesday when a gas company in Ohio accidentally sliced through a
fiber cable with a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   The cut, which occurred around noon Eastern time about 30 miles
east of Cleveland, slowed traffic to the point that data
transmissions between the East and West Coasts were taking 20 to 50
times longer than they do on a normal business day. Some companies
experienced more severe disruptions and were forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   While fiber cuts are not uncommon, the size of the cable that
was cut Wednesday _ a bundle of fibers carrying 40 gigabits, or 40
billion bits, of data a second _ is extremely rare, said Bill
Woodcock, network architect for Zocalo, a regional Internet service
provider in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen plenty a quarter this size, but my impression is
that if this is not the largest to date it's very near,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic most affected was data that would normally travel
through the fibers that were cut. This traffic was rerouted to
other parts of the global network, but the net effect was
congestion that slowed all data moving through large stretches of
the nation's Internet arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate customers whose internal networks used the severed
cable, Woodcock said, ``might not be able to access their corporate
data base or retrieve mail from their mail server.''
</P>
<P>
   GTE Corp., which owned portions of the cable that was cut,
estimated Wednesday night that the cable would be repaired by 9
p.m. Eastern time. When that deadline passed, though, officials at
some affected companies said they were being told that
thunderstorms in Ohio were making it difficult to offer accurate
estimates concerning when the repairs would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear which Internet service providers, or ISPs, own
or lease the fiber that was cut. Several service providers can own
chunks of fiber that run through the same cable, or one company can
own it and lease portions of it to other ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fiber belonged to GTE, which purchased it two years
ago from Qwest. ``The majority of our Internet customers are still
up _ they are seeing degraded performance, but they are still up,''
said Vaughn Harring, a spokesman for GTE Internetworking, the
Internet division of GTE.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that some customers' service had degraded so
far that they were effectively off line.
</P>
<P>
   Many reports issued by Internet service providers said that some
of the fiber was owned by a division of MCI Worldcom, but the
company would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not impacting MCI Worldcom,'' a spokesman for that
company said, adding that the cut was not affecting customers of
MCI Worldcom's Uunet subsidiary either.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rand, senior vice president and chief technical officer for
the Internet service provider Abovenet, said his company's traffic
was down about 20 percent, mostly because of problems with other
ISPs. Abovenet's traffic from San Jose, Calif., to Chicago, he
said, was down to 25 percent of its normal capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as it could be,'' Rand said.

JOHNNIE COCHRAN QUITS TV JOB TO JOIN MANHATTAN LAW FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., best known as a criminal
defense lawyer with star power and neon neckties, announced
yesterday that he was trading in his Court TV program to join a
personal injury law firm in Manhattan that advertises with a
toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran will bring his fame from the O.J. Simpson case, and the
resources of the 33 lawyers in his Los Angeles-based firm, to
Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek &AMP; Shoot, creating the nation's
largest personal-injury law firm, Cochran's new partner, Philip
Damashek, said Wednesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers around the city said the new entity _ to be known as The
Cochran Firm, Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek &AMP; Shoot _ would
become a formidable power in plaintiff law, with more than 60
lawyers. Cochran will gain the infrastructure he has lacked, they
said, and the Schneider firm will gain the rainmaking prowess it
wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marriage made in litigation heaven,'' said Sanford
Rubenstein, who has worked with Cochran representing Abner Louima,
who was brutalized by a police officer in the bathroom of a
Brooklyn station house. ``These are some of the finest trial
lawyers in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schneider firm has won major verdicts for its clients in
classic New York damage cases, such as $100 million for a mother
and child hit by a police car, and $104 million for two brothers
who were paralyzed after diving off a pier into shallow water.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also represents Antoine Reid, the squeegee man shot in
a fight with an off-duty police officer at a Bronx intersection, in
his civil lawsuit against the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he would continue to represent victims of police
misconduct. His clients have included the family of Amadou Diallo,
the unarmed immigrant killed by police officers this year. In
August, the Diallo family began efforts to dismiss Cochran and his
so-called dream team of lawyers, who still, technically, represent
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Watters, one of the lawyers in the Diallo case, said he
believed that the merger would liberate Cochran from managerial
duties: ``He'll now have a large staff that will be at his
availability. It probably frees him up of a lot of things he's been
doing on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began six months ago, Damashek said, when he and
Cochran worked on the case of a woman whose three children were
killed when her car was hit by an ambulance in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of meetings, and then we met each other at a
party following the Holyfield-Lewis fight,'' Damashek said. ``He
made it clear that he was interested in beginning a New York firm,
and I thought it would be better if he joined ours.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Cochran used some lofty language to
explain why he believes in seeking compensation for victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have domestic tranquillity when people can seek redress
and not bring their grievances to the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran also said he would end ``Johnnie Cochran Tonight,'' a
program on legal issues running weeknights on Court TV.

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY,  OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - As a war hero and U.S. senator, John McCain's life
has been chronicled in pictures.
</P>
<P>
   There are grainy mug shots of a young McCain, printed in U.S.
news papers after his jet was shot down over North Vietnam. There
are black-and-white images of his return, grinning and waving, his
hair turned prematurely gray by 5{ years of malnutrition and
torture in a Hanoi prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   In happier times, there is McCain holding his newborn daughter
while his wife, Cindy, smiles from her hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an innocent vacation picture that symbolizes McCain's
Achilles heel and carries the reminder of the scandal that
threatened his political career.
</P>
<P>
   In the picture, which was taken in the Bahamas, McCain is seated
on a bandstand while wearing an outra geous, straw party hat. Next
to him on the dais, a bottle tipped to his lips, sits Charles
Keating III, son of developer Charles H Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
   McCain calls the Keating scandal ``my asterisk.'' Over the
years, his opponents have failed to turn it into a period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all started in March 1987. Charles H Keating Jr., the
flamboyant devel oper and anti-porn crusader, needed help. The
government was poised to seize Lincoln Savings and Loan, a
freewheeling subsidiary of Keating's American Continental Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As federal auditors crawled all over Lincoln, Keating was not
content to wait and hope for the best. He'd spread a lot of money
around Washington, and it was time to call in his chits.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first stops was Sen. Dennis DeConcini. The Arizona
law maker was one of Keating's most loyal friends in Congress, and
for good reason. Keating had given thousands of dollars to
DeConcini's campaigns. At one point, DeConcini even pushed Keating
for ambassador to the Bahamas, where Keating owned a luxurious
vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Now Keating had a job for DeCon cini. He wanted him to organize
a meeting with the regulators. The message: Get off Lincoln's back.
Eventually, DeConcini would set up a meeting between five senators
and the regulators. One of them was John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain knew Keating well. His ties to the home builder dated to
1981, when the two men met at a Navy League dinner where McCain was
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Keating walked up to McCain and told him that
he, too, was a Navy flier, and that he greatly respected McCain's
war record. He met McCain's wife and family. The two men became
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Keating always took care of his friends, especially
those in poli tics. John McCain was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, during McCain's first run for the House, Keating held a
fund-raiser for him, collecting more than $11,000 from 40 employees
of American Continental Corp. McCain would spend more than $550,000
to win the primary and the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, during McCain's second House race, Keating hosted a
$1,000-a-plate dinner for McCain, though he had no serious
competition and coasted into his second term. When McCain pushed
for the Senate in 1986, Keating was there with more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, McCain had received about $112,000 in political
contributions from Keating and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had also carried a little water for Keating in
Washington. While in the House, McCain, along with a majority of
representatives, co-sponsored a resolution to delay new regulations
designed to curb risky investments by thrifts like Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his history with Keating, McCain was hesitant about
interven ing. At that point, he had been in the Senate only three
months. DeConcini wanted McCain to fly to San Fran cisco with him
and talk to the regulators. McCain refused.
</P>
<P>
   Keating would not be dissuaded.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24 at 9:30 a.m., Keating went to DeConcini's office and
asked him if the meeting with the regula tors was on. DeConcini
told Keating that McCain was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's a wimp,'' Keating re plied, according to the book
Trust Me, by Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden. ``We'll go talk
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating had other business on the Hill and did not reach
McCain's office until 1:30. A DeConcini staffer had already told
McCain about the wimp comment.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Keating presented McCain with a laundry list of
demands for the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Keating that he would attend the meeting and find
out whether Keating was getting treated fairly, but that was all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keating gave me the clear impres sion that he expected me to
do more,'' McCain said later. ``He had several specific requests.''
</P>
<P>
   When Keating questioned his cour age, McCain invoked his POW
expe rience. He told Keating that he didn't spend 5{ years in the
Hanoi Hilton to be called a coward.
</P>
<P>
   The two argued, then Keating stormed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dust-up, McCain at tended not one but two meetings
with the regulators. McCain later explained that he thought it was
the right thing to do, because Keating was a constituent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would live to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting, on April 2 in DeConcini's office, included Ed
Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, as well as four
senators: DeConcini, McCain, Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had a clandestine air. Gray came alone. None of the
senators brought their aides. DeCon cini asked Gray to withdraw a
regulation in order to help Lincoln. Gray shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   For Keating, the meeting was a bust. Gray told the senators that
as head of the loan board, he worried about the big picture. He
didn't have any specific information about Lincoln. Bank regulators
in San Francisco would be versed in that, not him. Gray offered to
set up a meeting between the senators and the San Francisco
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The second meeting was on April 9. The same four senators
attended, along with Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich. Also at the meeting
were William Black, then deputy director of the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., James Cirona, president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of San Francisco, and Michael Patriarca, director of
agency functions at the FSLIC.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with The Republic, Black said the meeting
was a show of force by Keating, who wanted the senators to pressure
the regulators into dropping their case against Lincoln. The thrift
was in trouble for violating ``direct invest ment'' rules, which
prohibited S&AMP;Ls from taking large ownership posi tions in various
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is a really small club, like the cliche goes,''
Black said. ``And you really did have one-twen tieth of the Senate
in one room, called by one guy, who was the biggest crook in the
S&AMP;L debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said the senators could have accomplished their goal ``if
they had simply had us show up and see this incredible room and
said, `Hi. Charles Keating asked us to meet with you. 'Bye.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The five senators, including McCain, seemed like a united front
to Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``They presented themselves as a group,'' Black said, ``and
DeConcini is the dad, who's going to take the primary speaking
role. Both meetings are in his office, and in both cases it's `we'
want this, with no one going, `What do you mean we, kemo sabe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to nearly verbatim notes taken by Black, McCain
started the second meeting with a careful com ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents
in a proper fashion,'' McCain said. ``ACC (American Continental
Corp.) is a big employer and important to the local economy. I
wouldn't want any special favors for them. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said the comment had the opposite effect for the
regulators. It made them nervous about what might really be going
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was the weirdest,'' Black said. ``They were all
different in their own way. McCain was always Ham let . . .
wringing his hands about what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a former astronaut and the first American to orbit the
Earth, was not as tactful.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs,''
he told the regulators. ``If things are bad there, get to them.
Their view is that they took a failing business and put it back on
its feet. It's now viable and profitable. They took it off the
endangered species list. Why has the exam dragged on and on and
on?''
</P>
<P>
   Added DeConcini, ``What's wrong with this if they're willing to
clean up their act?''
</P>
<P>
   Cirona, the banking official, told the senators that it was
``very unusual'' to hold a meeting to discuss a particular company.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini shot back: ``It's very unusual for us to have a
company that could be put out of business by its regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went on. McCain was quiet, while DeConcini carried
the ball. The regulators told the senators that Lincoln was in
trouble. The thrift, Cirona said, was a ``ticking time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Patriarca made a stunning comment, according to transcripts
released later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sending a criminal referral to the Department of
Justice,'' he said. ``Not maybe, we're sending one. This is an
extraordinarily serious matter. It involves a whole range of
imprudent actions. I can't tell you strongly enough how serious
this is. This is not a profitable institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement made DeConcini back off a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminality surprises me,'' he said. ``We're not
interested in dis cussing those issues. Our premise was that we had
a viable institution concerned that it was being overreg ulated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we say to Lincoln?'' Glenn asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Black responded, ``with regard to the criminal
referral. They haven't, and won't be told by us that we're making
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't told them?'' Glenn asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Black. ``Justice would skin us alive if we did.
Those referrals are very confidential. We can't prosecute anyone
ourselves. All we can do is refer it to Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, McCain was done with Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I was troubled by the appearance of the meeting,''
McCain said later. ``I stated I didn't want any special favors from
them. I only wanted them (Lincoln Savings) to be fairly treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Black doesn't completely buy that argument. If McCain was
concerned about Keating asking him to do things that were improper,
why go to either meeting at all?
</P>
<P>
   Black said McCain probably went because Keating was close to
being the political godfather of Arizona and McCain still had
plenty of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keating was incredibly powerful,'' Black said. ``And
incredibly useful.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reservations aside, Keatingaccomplished his goal. He
had bought some time, though the price was very high.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the San Francisco regulators finished a yearlong
audit and recommended that Lincoln be seized and placed in
receivership. But the report was virtually ignored because of
politics on the bank board.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was being replaced as chairman by Danny Wall, who was more
sympathetic to Keating.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, which described Lincoln as a thrift reeling out of
control, sat on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1987, the investigation was taken away from the San
Fran cisco office, away from Black and Patriarca. In May 1988, it
was transferred to Washington, where Lincoln would get a new audit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a win for Keating. A battle, not the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the move sparked a triumphant party at the posh head
quarters of American Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Someone hurled a computer from the second floor, shattering a
win dow. Keating, all 6-feet-5 of him, struck a Superman pose and
ripped open his shirt to display a hand-drawn skull and crossbones
over the letters FHLBB _ the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary climbed onto a desk to take photos, and American
Conti nental executive Robert Kielty joined her. Keating grabbed a
roll of tape and lashed their legs together.
</P>
<P>
   Potted plants were knocked over. Beer and champagne were spilled
on the carved wood desks. Kielty took a bottle of champagne and
poured it down another secretary's blouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get this champagne colder,'' Keat ing yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Back in San Francisco, Black was fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we were shot in the back,'' he would say later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reprieve, Keating's busi nesses continued to spiral
downward, taking the five senators with him. News of the meeting
leaked out, and now all five men were answering some very
embarrassing questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you lean on regulators for Charlie Keating?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you get campaign contribu tions in exchange for your
coopera tion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you protect Keating?''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the five senators had ac cepted more than $300,000 in
contri butions from Keating, and their critics added a new term to
the American lexicon:
</P>
<P>
   Keating Five.
</P>
<P>
   As the S&AMP;L failure deepened, the sheer magnitude of the losses
hit the press. Billions of dollars had been squandered. The Keating
Five be came shorthand for the kind of political influence that
money can buy. The five senators were linked as the gang who went
to bat for an S&AMP;L bandit.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;L ``trading cards'' came out. The Keating Five card showed
Charles Keating holding up his hand, with a senator's head adorning
each finger. McCain was on Keating's pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   As the Keating investigation dragged through 1988, McCain dodged
the body blows. Most landed on DeCon cini, who had arranged the
meetings and had other close ties to Keating, including $50 million
in personal loans from Keating to DeConcini's aides.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain made a critical error.
</P>
<P>
   In spinning his side of the Keating story, McCain adopted the
blanket defense that Keating was a constitu ent and that he had
every right to ask his senators for help. In attend ing the
meetings, McCain said, he simply wanted to make sure that Keating
was treated like any other constituent.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was far more than a constit uent to McCain, however.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 8, 1989, The Republic revealed that McCain's wife and
her father had invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping center in
April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that the McCains, sometimes accompanied
by their daughter and baby-sitter, had made at least nine trips at
Keating's expense, sometimes aboard the American Continental jet.
Three of trips were made during vacations to Keating's opulent
Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also did not pay Keating for the trips until years after
they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over
Lincoln. Total cost: $13,433.
</P>
<P>
   When the story broke, McCain did nothing to help himself. When
re porters first called him, he was furious. Caught out in the
open, the former fighter pilot let go with a barrage of cover fire.
Sen. Hothead came out in all his glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a liar,''' McCain snapped Sept. 29 when a Republic
reporter asked him about business ties be tween his wife and
Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the spouse's involvement, you idiot,'' McCain said
later in the same conversation. ``You do under stand English, don't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   He also belittled the reporters when they asked about his wife's
ties to Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to you to find that out, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he played the POW card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Vietnamese didn't ques tion my ethics,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper ran the story a few days later. At a news conference,
McCain was a changed man. He stood calmly for 90 minutes and
answered every question.
</P>
<P>
   On the shopping center, his defense was simple. The deal did not
involve him. The shares in the shopping center had been purchased
by a partnership set up between McCain's wife and her father.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also had to explain his trips with Keating and why he
didn't pay Keating back right away.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, McCain admitted he had fouled up. He said he
should have reimbursed Keating immedi ately, not waited several
years. His staff said it was an oversight, but it looked bad,
McCain jetting around with Keating, then going to bat for him with
the federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lincoln continued to founder despite the best efforts
of DeConcini to fend off the regulators. In spring 1989, DeConcini
called Wall and asked the bank board chairman to allow Keating to
sell Lincoln. He also phoned William Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and asked that he let the sale go
through.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, DeConcini's pleas were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1989, two years after the Keating Five meeting, the
govern ment seized Lincoln, which declared bankruptcy. In September
1990, Keating was booked into Los An geles County Jail, charged
with 42 counts of fraud. His bond was set at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   During Keating's eventual trial, the prosecution produced a
parade of elderly investors who had lost their life's savings by
investing in Ameri can Continental junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1990, the Senate Ethics Committee convened to decide
what punishment, if any, should be doled out to the Keating Five.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, who would later represent President Bill Clinton
in the Paula Jones case, was the special counsel for the committee.
In his opening remarks, he slammed De Concini but went lightly on
McCain, the lone Republican ensnared with four Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Senator McCain, there is very substantial
evidence that he thought he had an understanding with Senator
DeConcini's office that certain matters would not be gone into at
the meeting with (bank board) Chairman (Ed) Gray,'' Ben nett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, there is substantial evi dence that, as a result of
Senator McCain's refusal to do certain things, he had a fallout
with Mr. Keating.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the ultimate survivor, had dodged another &UR; missile.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Keating Five, McCain received the most direct contribu
tions from Keating. But the investi gation found that he was the
least culpable, along with Glenn. McCain attended the meetings but
did noth ing afterward to stop Lincoln's death spiral.
</P>
<P>
   To McCain's credit, he said no one made him attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCain's defenders is Mel McDonald, a former U.S.
attorney from Arizona and former legal con sultant for American
Continental. McDonald says the Charlie Keating of 1987 was very
different from the Keating of today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Keating was a successful businessman and one of
Arizona's largest private employers.
</P>
<P>
   In McDonald's view, there was no question the regulators were
treating Keating unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been a pillar of the community,'' McDonald said. ``He
contacted his senators and says, hey, we've got some regulators
running amok. And the truth of the matter is they were. If there
was such a big fraud, why in the hell did it take the regulators so
long to find it? Were they tripping every day and hitting their
heads and forgetting what they were doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's losses eventually were set at $3.4 billion, the most
expensive failure in the national S&AMP;L scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Once Keating was indicted, people went looking for scapegoats,
McDonald said, and found the Keat ing Five.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with the benefit of hind sight, and after Keating's
world came crumbling down, decided they were going to impose
today's standards on decisions that were made four or five years
ago, and it was unfair,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who defend the Keating Five also note that they had a
letter _ provided before the meetings _ from Lincoln's auditor,
accounting firm Arthur Young.
</P>
<P>
   An Arthur Young accountant, Jack Atchison, said the government
audit of Lincoln was inordinately long and bordered on harassment.
The length of the probe was odd, Atchison reasoned, because Keating
had turned Lincoln from a failing thrift into a viable entity.
</P>
<P>
   Atchison later was hired to work for Keating at $900,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also looked good in contrast to DeConcini, who continued
to defend Keating until fall 1989, when federal regulators filed a
$1.1 billion civil racketeering and fraud suit against Keating,
accusing him of siphoning Lincoln's deposits to his family and into
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain received only a mild rebuke from the Ethics
Com mittee for exercising ``poor judg ment'' for intervening with
the federal regulators on behalf of Keat ing. Still, he felt tarred
by the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of it was wrong,'' McCain said recently. ``It's
a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting
with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of
undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that Bennett, the independent counsel, recommended
that McCain and Glenn be dropped from the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history, the Ethics Committee overruled
the rec ommendation of the independent counsel,'' McCain said.
``I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that I was the only
Republican of the five and the Democrats were in the majority (in
the Senate).''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain owns up to his mistake:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was judged eventually, after three years, of using, quote,
poor judg ment, and I agree with that assess ment.''

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - In 1979, John McCain came face to face with his
future.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Hawaii, attending a military reception. While there,
he met a young, blond, former cheerleader named Cindy Hensley.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible stroke of luck for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   How fortunate could one man be? Here was McCain, who had his eye
on Congress, meeting a young, attractive beer heiress from Arizona,
which was adding a congressional district in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recalls that both he and Cindy fudged their ages at
first. McCain made himself a little younger and Cindy made herself
a little older. They found out their real ages when the local paper
published them. McCain was 43, Cindy 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our marriage,'' McCain cracks, ``is really based on a
tissue of lies.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were dating, McCain called Cindy from Beijing, where
he was traveling with a contingent from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee while she was in the hospital recuperating from
minor knee surgery. She thanked him for the lovely flowers in her
room, sent from ``John.''
</P>
<P>
   What McCain didn't tell Cindy was that he hadn't sent the
flowers. They were from another John, who lived in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thanked him,'' Cindy notes with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   After a whirlwind courtship, John asked Cindy to marry him. But
there were some details to clear out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   McCain needed a divorce from his wife of 14 years, Carol, who
had been badly injured in a car accident while McCain languished in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage had been strained by his years of absence, along
with McCain's admitted affairs after re turning from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1980, less than a year after he met Cindy, McCain
petitioned a Florida court to dissolve his marriage to Carol,
calling the union ``irretrievably broken.'' Bud Day, a lawyer and
fellow POW, handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought things were going fairly well, and then it just came
apart,'' Day recalls. ``That happened to quite a few. . . . I don't
fault (Carol), and I don't really fault John, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In the divorce settlement, McCain was generous with Carol, the
mother of their daughter Sydney and two other children, whom McCain
had adopted. Among other things, McCain gave Carol the rights to
houses in Florida and Virginia, and agreed to pay her medical bills
for life.
</P>
<P>
   Except for signing the property settlement, Carol did not
participate in the divorce. A court summons and other paperwork
sent to her during the proceeding went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the judge entered a default judgment and declared the
marriage dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, McCain married Cindy in Phoenix, and they moved
there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was immediately plugged into Arizona's power elite.
Cindy's father, Jim Hensley, owned a Phoenix Anheuser-Busch
distributorship that had made him a millionaire many times over.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that McCain was interested in a political
career. In the six years after he returned from Vietnam, he had
been in rehab and then was assigned to a political post, working in
the Navy's Senate liaison office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While there, McCain made friends with such political movers as
Sen. Gary Hart and Sen. John Tower, who was the ranking Republican
on the Armed Services Committee. He also met Sen. Bill Cohen,
</P>
<P>
   now the secretary of Defense, who ended up being the best man at
John and Cindy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, McCain retired from the Navy, mostly because of his
badly injured knees and shoulder, compliments of his North
Vietnamese captors. Hensley gave his new son-in-law a job as vice
president of public relations, but McCain was soon bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Hensley didn't care about PR,'' said Bill Shover, a former
executive with Phoenix Newspapers Inc. who met McCain in 1981.
``When you have the Budweiser franchise, you have a license to
steal. You don't need PR.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for McCain to meet wealthy power brokers
such as developer Charles Keating Jr. and Fife Symington III, who
would later be elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Local pols suggested McCain start slowly by running for the
state Legislature, but McCain would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make up for time lost as a POW, McCain wanted Arizona's
new congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a problem. The new district was in Tucson. For McCain
to move from Phoenix to Tucson would open him up to criticism as a
carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Fate lent a hand. In January 1982, Rep. John Rhodes retired from
the 1st District seat, which includes the East Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Rhodes announced his retirement, Shover got a call
from McCain. He could hear noise in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you?'' Shover asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the freeway,'' said McCain, who had stopped at a
service station to call Shover. ``I'm on the way to Mesa to buy a
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have told the tale of John McCain winning the 1st
Congressional District by wearing out three pairs of shoes.
McCain's footwear definitely took a beating during the race, but it
was more greenbacks than soles that swept McCain into the U.S.
House of Representatives in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's first campaign benefited from his wife's personal
wealth, some of which had been tied up in a trust set up in 1971 by
her parents,
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Marguerite ``Smitty'' Hensley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the trust expired and was dissolved, giving Cindy
McCain a half interest in Western Leasing Co., a truck-leasing
business controlled by her father, said Trevor Potter, general coun
sel to the McCain 2000 campaign and former chairman of the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Cindy McCain received $639,000 from Western Leasing, ac
cording to a financial disclosure report filed by McCain. Potter
said that figure reflects Cindy's income on paper, not the actual
cash she received, which was about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, that same year, the McCains lent $169,000 of their
own money to the campaign. Western Leasing, in part, made those
loans possible, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her financial assets played a part in allowing them to loan
money to the campaign,'' Potter said. ``And her financial assets
included the income from Western Leasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Leasing was not the only income the McCains had in 1982.
They earned a combined $130,000 in salary and bonuses from Hensley
and Co., the beer distributorship controlled by Cindy's father.
John also had his Navy pension, which paid $31,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one pretends that Cindy had no money at all,'' Potter said.
``It was hers. And it wasn't something Jim (Hensley) had given her
for the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Under 1982 election rules, it was legal for McCain to tap his
wife's assets, as well as his own, when making personal loans to
the campaign. In 1983, the rules were rewritten, with tighter
guidelines on the use of family money.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, including the personal loans, McCain would raise
more than $550, 000 to win the seat. &QL; 
AN ALLY IN THE PRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain had money, and he also had another staunch ally in
Phoenix: Darrow `` Duke'' Tully, publisher of the state's largest
newspaper, The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Upon meeting McCain, Tully regaled him with stories of his own
military service as an Air Force pilot in Korea and Vietnam. The
two men quickly hit it off and soon were spending a lot of time
together. Cindy McCain and Tully's second wife, Pat, also got along
well. Both were far younger than their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Tully had logged many hours in Air Force simulators learning how
to fly F-16s. He bragged about a simulated dogfight between him and
McCain on the Goldwater gunnery range in southwest Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke said he had gotten John in his sights and shot him
down,'' Shover recalls. ``John couldn't maneuver very well, because
of his (formerly) broken arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tully immediately started grooming McCain for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Shover said Tully was practically McCain's PR man, hosting
dinners to introduce him to the Valley's movers and shakers. He set
up guest columns for McCain in PNI's flagship newspaper, The
Republic. In one of them, McCain gave a tear-jerking account of
Christmas in Hanoi. Tully became godfather to one of McCain's
children.
</P>
<P>
   With his connections and war record, McCain was taken seriously
by the Republican establishment. Plus, McCain had charm. Women were
drawn to him, and men respected him as a man's man.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a very engaging guy,'' Shover recalls. ``You could
not help but like John.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was vulnerable on one count. He was not from Arizona and
looked like he was shopping for a congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, at a candidates forum, McCain settled the carpetbagger
issue for good. After noting that he had been a military brat and
moved around his whole life, McCain played his ace in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place I lived the longest in my life was Hanoi,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was clear McCain had the tools to reach political
office on his own, Tully helped open the door. Armed with a war
chest provided by such people as Keating and Symington, McCain
conducted a tireless door-to-door campaign and beat his primary
opponents. He easily rolled over his Democratic challenger in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Tully and McCain would only get closer, and McCain would
influence the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, The Republic's editorial board was trying to decide
whom to endorse for sheriff. The candidates were Ken Oliver, a
Democrat and retired FBI agent, and Dick Godbehere, a lawn-mower
repairman and twice-wounded Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Shover said the board was leaning toward Oliver, who had real
law-enforcement experience. But Tully got a phone call, and once he
returned, he overruled the board and endorsed Godbehere.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the meeting, I got Duke alone and asked him, `What the
hell was that all about?' '' Shover recalls. ``He said, `Oh, that
call was McCain. He said we've got to get Godbehere elected.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get him elected. And it was a complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Godbehere, who got McCain's nod as a Republican and decorated
Navy veteran, had a rocky time as sheriff. He staged drug busts,
hoping to glean publicity, and fought with officials over a plaque
bearing his name on the Madison Street Jail in downtown Phoenix. He
finally filed a $64 million lawsuit against The Republic, which was
tossed out in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McCain says he remembers supporting Godbehere but doesn't
recall whether he asked Tully to endorse him. Tully, McCain notes,
made up his own mind anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of The Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, McCain
could do no wrong. Political columnists adopted him like a lost
puppy. Late Gazette columnist John Kolbe blasted McCain's
Republican primary opponent in 1982, Jim Mack, for calling McCain's
first wife to dig up dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, McCain won a second term in the House, facing only
token opposition. He was already hunting bigger game. McCain wanted
to succeed Barry Goldwater, who was retiring from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's main stumbling block was Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a popular
Democrat with deep family ties in the state. McCain's people
decided early on that the race would be half won if they could
persuade Babbitt to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much a strategy as it was a reality,'' recalls
Torie Clarke, McCain's press secretary from 1983 until 1989. ``The
theory was, if we worked really hard . . . if John really could get
his roots deep in Arizona, it became less and less likely that
Babbitt would want to run against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also was toying with a run for president in 1988, two
years after he would have been elected to the Senate. McCain's
people kept the pressure on, making it clear that McCain planned an
all-or-nothing assault on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1985, Babbitt made it official: He wasn't running for
the Senate. In May, five-term Congressman Bob Stump also took a
pass, giving McCain an open field for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   To face McCain, the Democrats fielded Richard Kimball, a tall,
good-looking 37-year-old with an offbeat personality. Urged on by
Tully, The Republic
</P>
<P>
   and Gazette editorial pages tore into Kimball, a former member
of the Arizona Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Republic columnist Pat Murphy blasted a Kimball position paper
because it contained grammatical and spelling errors. Kolbe, now
firmly in McCain's corner, also lampooned Kim ball, saying he
suffered from ``terminal weirdness.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone knew that McCain was Tully's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tully) was really pushing John,'' Shover said. ``He liked
him. (McCain) was probably the guy Duke wanted to be. Duke was this
Walter Mitty type.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mitty to be sure. All of Tully's war stories were pure
fiction. McCain, like everyone else, had been fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Tully invented his military history to live up to the
expectations of his father, whose other son had been killed in a
military training accident.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1985, the pressure of living the lie was building up
inside Tully, causing him to drink and alienate his wife, Pat.
After she filed for divorce, Tully, in his own words, ``was begin
ning to crack up.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to drop not-so-subtle hints to people that he had never
served in the military. Then, on Oct. 25, a concerned secretary
summoned Shover to Tully's office.
</P>
<P>
   Shover found Tully stepping on his plaques and certificates and
throwing them into a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to protect his boss, Shover told him to quietly get
rid of his uniforms and to stop telling his fake war stories.
</P>
<P>
   Tully refused to be quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he was trying to get caught,'' Shover said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, word leaked out to Tully's enemies, one of whom was
Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins, who had been smacked by The
Republic for taking a trip with his family at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, along with freelance aviation writer Dick Rose, began
to investigate Tully's background. The day after Christmas, Tully
told Shover that Collins would have a press conference to expose
him.
</P>
<P>
   Shover drafted Tully's letter of resignation and called
Indianapolis, the headquarters of The Republic's parent company,
Central Newspapers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Tully's reign was over.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early press calls was to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response was kind of like, `Yeah, I have heard of Duke
Tully. I'm sorry about what happened to him. Any other questions?'
'' Shover said.
</P>
<P>
   Shover said McCain was a political opportunist who moved quickly
to distance himself from Tully.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, he walked,'' Shover said. ``He used Duke Tully
to gain what he got in his life and he left him just when Duke
needed him most.'' &QL; 
`SEIZURE WORLD' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Tully threw Kimball off balance, since he had sought
to paint McCain as a tool of the newspaper and its publisher. For
the next few months, Kimball darted and dashed around McCain,
throwing a lot of punches and landing none.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took Kimball seriously, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worried, we sweated, we were concerned every single day,''
Clarke said. ``From the first to the last, until Election Day . . .
that's probably the reason John is so successful. That's the way he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1986, McCain gave Kimball an opening, jokingly referring
to Leisure World, a retirement community, as ``Seizure World.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimball launched another series of attacks, calling McCain
``bought and paid for'' by special interests, since much of
McCain's campaign contri butions came from political action
committees in four industries: defense, real estate, petroleum and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball also noted that McCain was a millionaire because of his
wife's interests in the beer distributorship owned by her father.
Kimball wasn't shy about airing the Hensley family laundry.
</P>
<P>
   He had dug up old newspaper clips that showed Jim Hensley had
been an underling to well-known power broker Kemper Marley Sr., a
rich rancher and wholesale liquor baron with ties to the 1976
car-bomb murder of Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II (Hensley was a bombardier on a B-17 that was
shot down over the English Channel), Hensley and his brother Eugene
went to work at Marley-owned liquor distributorships in Phoenix and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the Hensley brothers were convicted of falsifying
records to con ceal, government lawyers contended, the illegal
distribution of hundreds of cases of liquor. The sales occurred
from 1945 to 1947, postwar years when liquor was rationed and in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hensley was sentenced to a year in federal prison. Jim
Hensley got six months, but his sentence was suspended. He received
probation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Jim Hensley was again charged with falsifying records
at Marley's liquor firms. The companies were defended by William
Rehnquist, who would go on to become chief justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court. Hensley was found not guilty. &QL; 
`STANDING ON A SOAPBOX' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1986, as Kimball gained ground on McCain in the Senate
race, the candidates agreed to debate on television.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain was a good deal shorter than the lanky Kimball, he
stood on a riser behind the podium. At one point, Kimball called
him on it, saying McCain was ``standing on a soapbox'' to make
himself look taller.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was angry but kept his cool. The next day, he got mad all
over again when he saw himself standing on the riser on the front
page of The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate was mostly a draw, McCain enjoyed a huge
fund-raising lead, outspending Kimball nearly 4 to 1. On Election
Day, McCain steamrolled Kimball, 60 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain went to a downtown hotel for his acceptance speech, an
event chronicled in The Nightingale's Song by Robert Timberg.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Smith, McCain's political consultant, was told to make sure
McCain stood on a riser as he delivered his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arriving at the hotel shortly after McCain, Smith saw
reporters and well-wishers huddle together on the stage,'' Timberg
wrote. ``From the midst of the throng, he heard a familiar voice
floating upward, thanking the voters for sending him to the Senate.
Familiar but disembodied. McCain had seen the riser and kicked it
aside. The White Tornado had become the Invisible Man.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, McCain was a hot property and was rumored to be George
Bush's choice for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Dan Quayle came popping out on the dock in New Orleans,
the last name eliminated for consideration by the AP wire was John
McCain,'' said Scott Celley, a McCain aide at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But in October 1989, everything came crashing down around
McCain. &QL;

SOME TEACHERS SAY RESULTS OF NEW REGENTS TEST ARE DECEPTIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With much fanfare, New York state three years ago
announced that it would abolish its basic competency tests and
require all high school students to pass its rigorous series of
Regents tests before graduating, in the hope of sending a shock to
a system that was providing many students with a second-class
education.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the results of the first revamped test _ the English
Regents _ are being tabulated, a remarkable trend is emerging: a
substantial majority of students statewide have passed the new
test. But some teachers say that while the test may be just as
rigorous as past Regents tests, the state set such a low threshold
for passing and teachers graded the essay portions so leniently,
there is little evidence that student achievement has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   The scores are coming out as many of the nation's governors and
corporate executives are meeting in Palisades, N.Y., to discuss how
to impose standards and cope with the resulting problems.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that if the scores were higher than
expected, it was because students and teachers worked hard to meet
the new standards. Thousands of the weakest students, they added,
have not even taken the test yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence that this is an easy exam,'' said Richard
P. Mills, the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But many teachers who scored the test said it would do little to
restore the confidence of colleges and employers in the value of a
high school diploma, especially in New York City, where lax
promotion and graduation standards have been under attack. A
smaller majority of New York City students also passed, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials plan to release the test scores within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One teacher said that the students in her class who passed the
new English Regents exam, with low passing scores, routinely failed
the writing test given by City University and would need extensive
remedial work to succeed in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the miracle,'' said Gerri Gewirtz, an English
teacher at Walton High School in the Bronx. ``I feel good for the
kids because so many of them passed the Regents, but as far as the
standards are concerned, it's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bonnici, principal of the High School of Fashion
Industries in Manhattan, said that the percentage of his school's
students who passed the Regents test this year with scores near the
minimum of 55 was roughly the same as the percentage who passed the
simpler competency test in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said easy scoring is one way states across the country,
including New York, can take credit for tougher standards while
avoiding the political, financial and emotional consequences of
holding back huge numbers of students. In other states, parents
have sued school districts for failing to prepare their children
for graduation tests. Raising standards, said Diane Ravitch, an
education historian and former assistant secretary of education in
the Bush administration, is much easier than raising achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either there has to be a dramatic improvement in instruction
or the test has to be easier,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ``Something's got
to give.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the state Board of Regents _ New York's
policy-making body for education _ offered students a choice of two
tests _ a traditional and academically demanding series of
``Regents tests'' in subjects like English, mathematics, chemistry
and world history _ and far simpler, one-day ``Regents competency
tests.'' Only the competency test was required for graduation while
good marks on the more demanding Regents were considered feathers
in the cap of a college applicant. Last school year the competency
test was abolished.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials vehemently denied that the scoring
system was lenient. Chris Carpenter, a spokesman for the state
Education Department, said Wednesday that in field tests, 40
percent of the students who took the new test received scores below
55 _ a result that was alarming to state officials and suggested
that the grading was sufficiently tough.
</P>
<P>
   He said that papers would be audited to make sure that teachers
were not manipulating the grading standards. ``We are not going to
turn a blind eye or wink while it happens,'' he said. ``Lord help
the principal who has done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said along with those who failed the test, which is
usually taken in the junior year, thousands more have not even
taken it, and could still be barred from graduating. He said there
was evidence that those who did not take the test were the weakest
students, and had been prevented from taking it by school officials
who were afraid of looking bad.
</P>
<P>
   Other state officials said they intentionally set a low passing
score, to be fair to students who had come through a system
governed by decades of debased standards. But they said students
would have to work much harder as the passing score is raised to 65
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a lot of technical advisers, national experts,
and we gave the system time to adjust and be in transition,'' said
James Kadamus, deputy state education commissioner.

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - ``THE PLANTATION,'' HANOI, AUGUST 1968 _ John McCain
sat on a stool, his teeth broken, his body battered from a savage
beat ing, his arms tied behind him in torture ropes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guard entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready to confess your crimes?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   Every two hours, one guard would hold McCain while two others
beat him. They kept it up for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain lay on the floor, a bloody mess, unable to move.
His right leg,
</P>
<P>
   injured when he was shot down, was horribly swollen. A guard
yanked him to his feet and threw him down. His left arm smashed
against a bucket and broke again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached the lowest point of my 5{
</P>
<P>
   years in North Vietnam,'' McCain would write later. ``I was at
the point of suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is chronicled in The Nightingale's Song, by
Robert Timberg:
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain) looked at the louvered cell window high above his
head, then at the small stool in the room. He took off his dark
blue prison shirt, rolled it like a rope, draped one end over his
shoulder near his neck, began feeding the other end through the
louvers.''
</P>
<P>
   A guard burst into the cell and pulled McCain away from the
window. For the next few days, he was on suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's will had finally wilted under the beatings. Unable to
endure any more, he agreed to sign a confession.
</P>
<P>
   McCain slowly wrote, ``I am a black criminal and I have
performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died and the
Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He would never forgive himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had learned what we all learned over there,'' he would write
later. `` Every man has a breaking point. I had reached mine.'' &QL; 
BRUSH WITH DEATH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. John McCain was not thinking about a cell in the Hanoi
Hilton when he took off in his A-4E Skyhawk from the USS Oriskany
on the morning of Oct. 26, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   As a pilot, McCain had led a charmed life, surviving a bad
accident on the USS Forrestal about two months before.
</P>
<P>
   The Forrestal was stationed in the Tonkin Gulf, preparing for a
mission. McCain was strapped into his jet, warming up the engine.
Suddenly, a missile on another plane misfired, shooting across the
deck and slamming into McCain's fuel tank. The missile didn't
detonate, but the impact spilled hundreds of gallons of highly
flammable aviation fuel on the deck. McCain's plane was engulfed in
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   As a fire blazed beneath him, McCain scrambled out of the
cockpit, then dropped and rolled through the burning aviation fuel.
Slapping out the fire on his flight suit, McCain started back to
assist another pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Then the first bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Flaming shrapnel whizzed across the flight deck. One man was
decapitated; others were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was knocked backward, and small pieces of metal peppered
his chest. As the crew frantically fought the fire, more bombs and
planes exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 134 men lost their lives, and the Forrestal was
almost abandoned. McCain's injuries were minor.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, McCain transferred from the Forrestal to the
Oriskany, another aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, McCain would fly his 23rd sortie over Vietnam, join
ing a 20-plane mission to bomb a power plant in Hanoi, the North
Vietnamese capital, which had been off-limits to U.S. attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An officer warned McCain to be careful, that some of the pilots
might not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about me,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi was well-defended against air attack. As McCain approached
his target, surface-to-air missiles the size of telephone poles
filled the sky. Suddenly, his instrument panel lit up. A missile
had locked on to his plane.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dropped his bombs and began to pull up. Suddenly, a
missile sheared off his right wing, sending his plane spinning
toward earth, out of control. McCain ejected, breaking his right
leg and both arms. He regained consciousness as he settled into a
small lake in the center of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's battered body sank 15 feet to the bottom of the muddy
lake. He managed to kick his way to the surface with his one good
leg, but his equipment dragged him back down. Finally, as he went
down for a third time, McCain used his teeth to inflate his life
preserver and bobbed to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   North Vietnamese pulled McCain from the lake, stripping off his
clothes. McCain felt a twinge in his right knee and was horrified
to see his leg bent at a 90-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, my leg,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   A man slammed a rifle butt down on McCain's right shoulder,
shattering it. Others bayoneted him in the foot and groin.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was thrown onto a truck and taken to Hanoi's main
prison. He was placed in a cell and told he would not receive any
medical treatment until he gave military information. McCain re
fused and was beaten unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day, two guards entered McCain's cell. One pulled
back the blanket to reveal McCain's injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the size, shape and color of a football,'' McCain
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of blood poisoning that would lead to death, McCain told
his captors he would talk if they took him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought in this doctor we called Zorba, and he examined
me, took my pulse and turned to this other guy we called The Bug
and said something in Vietnamese, and The Bug said, `It's too late,
it's too late,' '' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If you take me to the hospital, I'll get well.' Zorba
took my pulse again and shook his head, and The Bug said, `It's too
late.' And they took me back to my cell.''
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, McCain's cell door burst open, and The
Bug rushed in, saying, ``Your father is a big admiral. Now we take
you to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   It had taken some time, but the North Vietnamese figured out
that McCain's father, Jack, was a major Naval commander for the
United States. They started calling McCain ``The Crown Prince. '' &QL; 
MAINTAINING SILENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain was moved to a filthy hospital, where blood and plasma
were administered. He recovered a little but was still in sorry
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, McCain was told that a Frenchman wanted to talk to him and
would take a message back to McCain's family.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, the North Vietnamese tried to set McCain's
shattered right arm, which was broken in three places. Without
anesthetic, a doctor using a fluoroscope worked on the arm for 90
minutes, with McCain screaming in pain. The arm had two floating
bones, and the doctor could not set it properly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the doctor gave up and wrapped a cast around McCain
from his neck to his waist and down his right arm to his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   They moved McCain to a new room with clean white sheets. Soon
afterward, a North Vietnamese known as The Cat arrived. He was the
commander of all prison camps in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, The Cat told McCain that ``the French
television man is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that McCain realized his visitor was a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I want to be filmed,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat wouldn't be dissuaded. He told McCain that he needed two
operations and that he would not get them if he didn't say he was
grateful to the Vietnamese people and sorry for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The French TV crew arrived, led by a reporter named Francois Cha
lais. On the film, which was shown later on CBS television, McCain
looks drugged. He wasn't. He was in agony from the abortive attempt
to set the bones in his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Chalais that his treatment was satisfactory. This
upset The Cat, who stood behind McCain and told him to say he was
grateful for humane and lenient treatment. McCain refused. When The
Cat pressed it, Chalais broke in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he told me is sufficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the film, McCain told his wife, Carol, and his children that
he was getting well and that he loved them. When the North
Vietnamese insisted that McCain call for a quick end to the war,
Chalais waved them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is the food?'' Chalais asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not Paris, but I eat it,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   The interview ended, and McCain was taken to his dirty room. The
North Vietnamese operated on his knee, accidentally cutting the
ligaments on one side. Throughout his stay as a POW, McCain could
never walk right. Among his fellow POWs, he earned the nickname
``Crip.'' &QL; 
BLAME THE AMERICANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks in the hospital, McCain was taken to a prison
camp known as The Plantation and placed in a cell with George
``Bud'' Day and Norris Overly, both Air Force majors.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one look at McCain, Day was convinced that the North
Vietnamese had brought McCain to their cell to die and planned on
blaming the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely skinny, and he was just about filthy,'' said
Day, a lawyer in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. ``He had food and drink
and liquids run all over his face. He had a pretty good beard . . .
he probably weighed less than 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in this great big white cast, and his hair was snow
white. He just looked like he was absolutely on the verge of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Day said McCain's injured right arm jutted from his body cast
like a stick ``sticking out of a snowman.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, Day remembers McCain's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes were extremely bright, they had that real fever
luster,'' Day said. ``I just took one look at him and had no qualms
that he was going to die, and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his poor condition, Mc Cain still was happy to see
fellow Americans. The men spent the night whispering among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., Day was convinced that McCain had a decent chance to
live, providing the fever did not get him. Slowly, McCain began to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a very determined guy with a lot of spirit,'' Day
said. ``It's kind of like when you see a horse, a young colt, and
you just know this is a strong-spirited animal. You could see all
that in him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, it seemed, was too tough to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was not going to help the Lord take him out,'' Day said.
``If the Lord was involved in taking him out, John was resisting
all the way. If the Lord was helping him, John was giving Him 100
percent of his effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first days, McCain could not wash or feed himself without
help. The task of nursing McCain fell to Overly, since Day had been
tortured in ropes and had little use of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give Norris a lot of credit,'' Day said. ``Norris
took care of John like a baby, like it was his own child. There was
no question that he loved John. He did things for John that only a
parent would do for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, North Vietnamese dignitaries would stroll by to
gawk at the prize prisoner. Since McCain's father was an admiral,
the North Vietnamese thought McCain's family was very wealthy. They
would ask how many corporations his father owned. McCain just
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he was nursed back to health. McCain's infections were
healing, now that he could wash regularly. Soon, he could hobble
around in his cell for a few minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, Overly was removed from the cell and placed with
two other prisoners who were going to be released early.
</P>
<P>
   Early release was forbidden by the military's Code of Conduct.
To prevent the enemy from subverting prisoners or using them as
propaganda tools, officers were to accept release in the order they
were captured. That meant that the first man to be released should
have been Navy Lt. Everett Alvarez, who had been shot down on Aug.
5, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Overly and two others accepted early release. The
other POWs soon dubbed the practice the ``Fink Release Program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has spoken with Overly only once since the war, during a
short phone conversation after McCain was released in 1973. But
Day, who won the Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam, has
made his peace with Overly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been in (Overly's) shoes, maybe I would have done
things differently than I did,'' said Day, who retired from the Air
Force in 1976 as a full colonel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back from Vietnam all crippled up and all screwed up,
and a lot of that could have been avoided if I had given the gooks
a lot of the stuff they were really pushing me for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was the right thing, so I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once McCain was able to walk on his own, Day was moved out. For
two years, McCain would be alone in his cell,
</P>
<P>
   which he described in U.S. News &AMP; World Report after his
release:
</P>
<P>
   ``My room was fairly decent-sized _ I'd say about 10 by 10. The
door was solid.
</P>
<P>
   There were no windows. The only ventilation came from two small
holes at the top in the ceiling, about 6 inches by 4 inches. The
roof was tin, and it got hot as hell in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room was kind of dim _ night and day _ but they always
kept on a small light bulb so they could observe me.'' &QL; 
CODE TALKERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1968, McCain heard some noise in the cell behind him
at The Plantation and began tapping on the cell wall, a common way
for POWs to communicate. The call-up sign was the five-tap ``shave
and a haircut,'' and the other prisoner would answer with two taps.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks he got no answer, but finally two taps came back.
Using a cup to the wall, McCain could hear the other prisoner and
managed to give him the tap code. He finally gave McCain his name _
Ernie Brace.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, all Brace could do was tap out ``I'm Ernie Brace''
and then collapse into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Brace was a decorated former Marine who had flown more than 100
combat missions in Korea. He had been accused of deserting the
scene of an aircraft accident, was court-martialed and received a
dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't keep Brace out of the war. As a civilian pilot,
he flew for a CIA-backed airline and was shot down over Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Brace had spent 3{ years in a bamboo cage with his feet in
stocks and an iron collar around his neck. During the ordeal, he
almost lost the use of his legs. He escaped three times, and when
he was captured the third time, he was buried in the ground up to
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   After a year had passed, McCain and Brace were communicating
with other prisoners in the camp, shuttling messages back and forth
with the tap code.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, 1969, a guard jerked open Brace's cell door. The
incident is recounted in Brace's book, A Code to Keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are in bad trouble for communicating,'' the guard said.
``You are being taken to a harsher place.''
</P>
<P>
   Blindfolded, Brace was put into a truck with soldiers and other
prison ers. As the vehicle rolled through Hanoi, Brace felt someone
tapping a message on his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' said the message. ``I John McCain. Who U?''
</P>
<P>
   Brace said tears began forming in his eyes as he grabbed his
friend's hand, squeezing out the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``EB here.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered early release, Brace turned it down, citing the military
code. &UR; He was the longest-held civilian POW in Vietnam. &QL; 
AN OFFER TO GO HOME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In June 1968, McCain was taken to an interrogation room where
The Cat awaited him. He was joined by another man, ``The Rabbit,''
who spoke very good English.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat spent two hours in seemingly aimless conversation,
telling McCain about how he had run French prison camps in the
early 1950s. He said that he had released some prisoners early and
that they had thanked him later. He also mentioned that Norris
Overly had gone home ``with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   All of sudden, The Cat blurted out: ``Do you want to go home?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told him he'd have to think about it. He'd been hit by a
bout of dysentery and was in poor shape. He was losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain knew the real reason the North Vietnamese wanted to
release him. He was the son and grandson of admirals (his father,
Adm. Jack McCain, had been made commander of all U.S. forces in the
Pacific in July 1968.) McCain's release would help the North
Vietnamese propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain realized that the Code of Conduct gave him no choice.
Alvarez, who was being held elsewhere, was supposed to be the first
man released. McCain couldn't let down his father and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew it wasn't the right thing to do,'' he said. ``I
knew that they wouldn't have offered it to me if I hadn't been the
son of an admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't think it was the honorable thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, McCain met with The Cat again. The North
Vietnamese turned the screws. The Cat told McCain that President
Johnson had ordered McCain home. McCain asked to see the orders.
The Cat didn't have any.
</P>
<P>
   Then the North Vietnamese commander produced a letter from
McCain's wife, Carol, saying, ``I wished that you had been one of
those three who got to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain calmly told The Cat that the prisoners must be released
in the order they were captured, starting with Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fourth of July, McCain had a final sit-down with The Cat
and The Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our senior officer wants to know your final answer,'' The
Rabbit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My final answer is the same,'' McCain said. ``It's no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cat, who been seated behind a pile of papers, grabbed an ink
pen and snapped it in half. Ink spurted all over the desk. He rose
and kicked the chair over behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They taught you too well,'' he said, then left, slamming the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, McCain would find himself tied to a stool, and the
guards would literally beat the ``black air pirate'' confession out
of him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's account was confirmed in a cable from Averell Harriman,
who was President Johnson's envoy to the Paris peace talks.
Harriman had tea with a Vietnamese official, who mentioned that
McCain had refused early release. &QL; 
A CHRISTMAS SERVICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve 1968, about 50 POWs, including McCain, were
herded into a room decorated with flowers for a makeshift church
service.
</P>
<P>
   The North Vietnamese were intent on milking the ceremony for
every bit of PR value. Cameramen moved around the room, filming the
ceremony. Flash bulbs popped in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain and other prisoners were busy exchanging
information. One of the guards, conscious that he was being filmed,
smiled while he told McCain to stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cursed the guard and kept briefing another prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to go home,'' McCain said. ``I was tortured for it.
They broke my rib and rebroke my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain pressed on, and the guards kept trying to quiet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our senior ranking officer is Colonel Larson,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No talking!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain cursed them again and flashed his middle finger toward
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken back to his cell, where he waited for his beating.
It didn't come until the day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1969, the North Vietnam ese asked McCain to write a
letter to U.S. pilots asking them not to fly over North Vietnam.
When he refused, they made him stand for hours and hours.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain tired and sat down, a guard jumped on his injured
leg. McCain was back on crutches for the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1969, things began to look up for the POWs for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon had taken office in January. During the Johnson
administration,
</P>
<P>
   released POWs weren't allowed to talk about bad conditions in
the prison camps for fear that such complaints would make things
even worse for the men still being held.
</P>
<P>
   That changed under Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1969, under pressure, the North Vietnamese began
releasing sick and injured prisoners. Among them were Navy Lt.
Robert Frishman, who had a badly injured arm, Air Force Capt. Wes
Rumble, who was in a body cast with a broken back, and Navy Seaman
Doug Hegdahl, who had lost 75 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The men held press conferences, telling the horrifying details
of torture and mistreatment. After that, treatment of POWs began to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, the torture had almost stopped. The food improved. The
guards seemed almost friendly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's barred cell door had been covered with wood to keep him
from looking out and from getting any ventilation. But in fall
1969, the board was removed at night to cool McCain's cell. And
prisoners were allowed to bathe more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very amazing,'' McCain would write later.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1969, McCain was moved to the Hanoi Hilton. There he
met with a Cuban journalist who asked McCain general questions
about the war.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, a photographer came in and started snapping
pictures, though McCain had said he didn't want his picture taken.
After that, he refused to meet with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1970, McCain was moved into a room called ``Calcutta,''
which had no ventilation. There, McCain suffered from heat
prostration and another bout of dysentery and was cut to half
rations.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1970, McCain was moved to a room that housed 45 to
50 prisoners. In February 1971, the prisoners defied their captors
and held a church service. When the men presiding over the service
were taken away by guards, the men started singing The Star
Spangled Banner very loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a riot, the guards rushed in with ropes and subdued the
men. A few days later, McCain and others were moved to a punishment
camp the prisoners called Skid Row. Though the conditions were
filthy, McCain said, the prison was a piece of cake compared with
conditions in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 and 1972, conditions gradually improved. McCain, whose
weight had dropped to 105 during his first years in Hanoi, began to
regain some of his health. He was allowed to exercise, which eased
the boredom and made it easier to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crippled but mentally fierce,'' recalled Orson Swindle,
who roomed with McCain for the last two years of their
incarceration. ``He was stiff-legged and had awkward movement of
both arms. He did the funniest push-ups I've even seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his arms was sort of crooked . . . he did push-ups with
a tilt to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were in a big room with a large concrete slab in the
center and a 3-foot-wide, horseshoe-shape path around the slab.
They would exercise by walking along the path.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John would run in place, it was sort of humorous to watch
him,'' Swindle said. ``One leg would bend, and the other wouldn't.
It was a sight to behold.''
</P>
<P>
   To entertain themselves and the other men, McCain and Swindle
organized `` Sunday Night at the Movies'' _ retelling, and in some
cases performing, scenes from Hollywood films they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorites was One-Eyed Jacks,
</P>
<P>
   a Marlon Brando movie in which Brando is beaten by a worthless
sheriff played by Slim Pickens. McCain and Swindle especially loved
the part where Brando calls Pickens a ``scum-sucking pig.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1972, McCain had a front-row seat to a full-scale
bombing attack on Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most spectacular show I'll ever see,'' McCain later
wrote in U.S. News and World Report. ``. . . The bombs were
dropping so close that the building would shake. The SAMs were
flying all over, and the sirens were whining _ it was really a wild
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the bombing had been conceived by Nixon, the actual
orders had been given by McCain's father, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's father never wrote him during the war because of the
propaganda value of such a letter. He did, however, try to pass
McCain a secret message once, according to a passage in Faith of My
Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to his wife, McCain was using a fairly obvious code
to send messages back to the States. Naval intelligence, fearing
that McCain would be caught, apprised the admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. John McCain Jr. sent a hidden message in a letter Carol
wrote to McCain: ``JUNIOR URGES CAUTION PLEASE STOP THIS.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger McCain never saw it, because the North Vietnamese
withheld Carol's letters.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1973, McCain had been moved back to The Plantation.
The prisoners sensed that the war was nearing its end. The guards
hardly bothered them.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, McCain was playing bridge with Swindle and two
others when he was dealt a perfect hand. But McCain made a rookie
mistake and lost his advantage. The other men teased him
unmercifully.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain stopped talking to Swindle, who slept right next
to him on the floor. This went on for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be walking on the path, and I would say, `Hi, John,'
and John wouldn't respond,'' Swindle said.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, the guards came in and ordered Swindle to pack his
gear. As one of the first pilots captured, Swindle was in line to
be released.
</P>
<P>
   As Swindle was being ushered out, a frantic McCain rushed up to
his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``John comes running up and says, `Orson, Orson, I've really
been a jerk the last few days.' I said, `I don't even want to talk
to you,' and I turned away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked back at him and winked, and I had a big grin on
my face, and I said, `I'll see you at home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In March, McCain joined a group of prisoners who were put onto
trucks and driven to Gia Lam Airport in Hanoi. McCain said he
didn't believe he was leaving until he actually spoke with an
American in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it wasn't that overwhelming. It was one of those
things that you had anticipated for so long, nothing could have
lived up to my expectations,'' McCain said. ``It's like when a kid
waits for Christmas, and then it arrives, and it can't quite live
up to what he expected. ''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, The Rabbit read off their names, and they boarded
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's long ordeal was over. &QL;

IN LAS VEGAS, GIULIANI RAISES $100,000, PLUS $29 AT CRAPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As New York's City Hall was locked in a tense
standoff with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani raised $100,000 for his almost-certain Senate campaign in
a casino hotel where the fountains dance in nightly shows to the
voices of Gene Kelly and Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was a preview of the pressures the mayor will face as
he simultaneously governs New York City while preparing for a
campaign that is expected to be the most expensive and brutal in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, city officials have been trading legal threats with
the Brooklyn museum over an exhibition, set to open Saturday, that
includes artwork the mayor has declared offensive. But Giuliani
himself is far from the escalating conflict, in the middle of a
three-day jaunt through Washington, Nevada and California that is
expected to be his single most lucrative fund-raising trip to date.
</P>
<P>
   His stop in Las Vegas also created some slightly incongruous
tableaux, as the mayor who boasts of curbing crime and banishing
sleaze from New York discussed his adventures at the craps table _
he won $29 _ and lauded the local casino magnates for their civic
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The host of Wednesday afternoon's fund-raiser, in Le Cirque
restaurant of the $1.9 billion Bellagio hotel, was Stephen Wynn,
the chief executive of Mirage Resorts and a major donor to both the
Republican and Democratic parties. The lunch for Giuliani, which
included Las Vegas' major casino owners, had been arranged by
Revlon billionaire Ronald Perelman, a supporter of Giuliani's and a
friend of Wynn's.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at the lunch, Giuliani praised the guests for
helping to bring about the resurgence of Las Vegas, where gorgeous,
fake European hotels rise above the dust of the bad old hotels that
the Rat Pack made famous.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has boasted of curbing crime and banishing sleaze
from Times Square, also said he was not at all uncomfortable
raising money in a restaurant that was directly across from row
upon row of slot machines and blackjack tables, all under the
casino's yellow- and pink-fringed awnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the gambling industry in Las Vegas makes a tremendous
contribution,'' the mayor said in brief remarks to reporters after
the lunch, as the slot machines clanged in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added that during his nearly 24-hour stay in Las Vegas
he had played craps for about an hour Tuesday night at the Bellagio
with Peter Powers, a former deputy mayor and Giuliani's longtime
friend. Giuliani reported that as he and Powers each won $29, a
patron of the casino had told him that he hoped the mayor would win
_ not at gambling, the mayor said, but in his pursuit of statewide
office.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch came in the middle of the three-day political trip by
the mayor to four fund-raising events that were expected to raise
$350,000 for his unannounced Senate race next year against Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton's aides say her goal is to raise $25
million for her campaign, and possibly $10 million of that by the
end of the year. Giuliani said this week that he expected to raise
$15 million to $20 million for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, one of the most powerful men in Nevada, contributes
heavily to both major parties, although in the last five years he
has leaned toward the Republicans. During the last presidential
campaign, however, he attended a $25,000-a-plate Democratic Party
fund-raiser. And last spring, Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democrat
from Harlem, flew to Las Vegas to accept a $250,000 check from Wynn
for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn owns four casino hotels in Las Vegas as well as half of
another, the Monte Carlo. He is building a new casino in Atlantic
City, tentatively called Le Jardin, and spends enormous amounts of
time wooing politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn praised Giuliani after the lunch for his ``fearless
approach'' and his ``very keen mind,'' but at the same time did not
appear to rule out having a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton. ``Well, I
haven't been asked,'' he said, when he was questioned about
planning any event for her. ``But this was a pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wynn at his side, Giuliani said he was in favor of
legalized gambling in New York City, and added that ``both New
Jersey and Nevada offer very good models of how to do it.'' In
Washington this week, Giuliani also said that he was in favor of it
as long as there is ``a commission to make sure that organized
crime stays out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani in fact established a commission in 1997 to investigate
the background of applicants for casino licenses, and through that
has made it difficult and expensive for struggling gambling boat
operators using the city's offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has mentioned the federally owned Governors Island as
the possible site of a future casino, but only as a idea for years
in the future. A spokesman for Wynn said Wednesday that the casino
owner had no plans for any developments in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening Giuliani spoke at a Los Angeles fund-raiser at
the Beverly Hills Hotel, attended by 40 local Republican officials
and businessmen, where he was asked about the museum dispute in New
York. The mayor made no mention of his deputies' allegations that
the museum conspired with a private auction house to inflate the
value of the art displayed, and instead repeated that his primary
objection to the exhibit was its use of public money for what he
called a ``disgusting'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he particularly objected to a painting of the
Virgin Mary surrounded with elephant dung and what he described as
``private parts of a woman's body splattered all over.''

<P>
   John R. Crews, who as an Army sergeant in World War II won the
Medal of Honor by single-handedly capturing a German
automatic-weapons position while severely wounded, died on Saturday
in Oklahoma City, his hometown. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Sue.
</P>
<P>
   As springtime 1945 arrived, Allied forces crossed the Rhine and
embarked on the climactic battles of the war in Europe. On April 8,
Staff Ssergeant Crews, a squad leader with the 253rd Infantry
Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division, was advancing with his company
toward the German village of Lobenbacherhof when his platoon leader
was wounded by machine-gun and automatic-rifle fire from a hill on
their right flank.
</P>
<P>
   Crews rushed the German stronghold with two men. One was killed
and the other badly wounded, but Crews continued to advance up the
hill in the face of heavy fire. Storming troops who were well dug
in, he fired his M-1 rifle at point-blank range to kill two men of
the machine-gun crew and grabbed a weapon from the hands of a
German soldier he had wounded. Then he charged the automatic-rifle
position, was badly wounded in the thigh , but silenced that site
with rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
   His actions so unnerved the remaining German soldiers that seven
surrendered to him and the others fled. While the enemy was
concentrating on Crews' one-man onslaught, the other members of his
company had moved into the village.
</P>
<P>
   When medics who came to Crews' aid experienced difficulty
keeping the prisoners under control, he grabbed a rifle while still
on his stretcher and helped herd them off.
</P>
<P>
   On June 25, 1948, he received the Medal of Honor from President
Harry S. Truman at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Crews, a native of Golden, Okla., joined the Army in
December 1942. He served as a military policeman before entering
combat in Europe in December 1944 with the 63rd Division. In
addition to winning the Medal of Honor, he received the Silver Star
and two Bronze Stars.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving military service at war's end, he earned a
bachelor's degree from Oklahoma City University and was a
supervisor at a meat-products company in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Jon, of
Oklahoma City, and Mark, of Colorado Springs, and two daughters,
Phyllis Engle and Diana Moore, both of Oklahoma City, all from his
marriage to the former Joan Adams, who died in 1996; a brother,
Marion, of Chandler, Okla.; two sisters, Vera Ewbanks of Paragould,
Ark., and Bernice Dawson of Richmond; a stepson, Mike Tuma, and a
stepdaughter, Linda Robertson, both of Oklahoma City; 18
grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Crews was reluctant to talk about his combat
experiences. ``I didn't care whether anyone knew,'' he said in an
interview with The Daily Oklahoman last May. ``It was difficult to
talk about. It just left such an emotional load.'' But he took part
in a tribute to Medal of Honor winners at Indianapolis over the
last Memorial Day weekend and recently spoke to recruits at Fort
Sill, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting him the Medal of Honor, Truman asked, ``Where did
you get the courage to fight like you did?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned at home, `` Crews replied, ``that you do everything
you're told. I saw no difference in my military orders.''

NEW WILLIAM MORRIS CHIEF DISMISSES 10 TALENT AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ At least 10 motion picture agents in New York and
Los Angeles were dismissed Wednesday by the William Morris talent
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals were made by Jim Wiatt, who recently became
president and co-chief executive of the 101-year-old agency.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Wiatt, who has been in the job only several weeks
after working at International Creative Management for 22 years,
stunned talent agents at William Morris as well as rival agents and
studio executives.
</P>
<P>
   Several longtime New York-based agents were among those
dismissed, including Gene Parseghian _ whose clients included Judi
Dench, Daniel Day-Lewis and Joseph Fiennes _ as well as Johnnie
Planco. Those two agents had worked for William Morris for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why Wiatt had moved so quickly to trim back the
agency, whose movie division had been overshadowed in recent years
by its highly successful music, television and literary units. In
the last week, at least four other talent agents had quit at
William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, and the agency, declined to comment. But a William Morris
executive close to Wiatt said the dismissals were not related to
cost-cutting as much as seeking to ``redefine'' the agency. ``It's
about Jim's vision of the future and the people with whom he wants
to grow the company with,'' said the executive, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But rivals in the talent-agency business were scathing in their
comments, speaking of ``the bloodletting'' at one of the most
stable, successful and enduring agencies in the entertainment
business.
</P>
<P>
   The head of one rival agency said executives at his company had
already received phone calls late Wednesday for jobs from some of
those dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Several rival agents said the central reason for the departures
seemed to be the influx of the new, high-priced agents to William
Morris from ICM _ besides Wiatt, an associate, David Wirtschafter _
and that this had led William Morris to oust some veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But the suddenness of the dismissals of agents in their 40s and
50s, who may now have trouble finding work, surprised rivals of
William Morris in Hollywood. ``Johnnie's been there for more than
25 years _ how do you do that to someone?'' a rival agent remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt quit his No. 2 position at International Creative
Management on Aug. 6, and took over the top motion-picture job at
the film side of William Morris only a few days later. His
departure was the biggest talent agency upheaval since Michael
Ovitz left the Creative Artists Agency to take on the presidency of
Walt Disney Co. in 1994. Ovitz was later dismissed by Disney
chairman Michael Eisner, and is now a talent manager.
</P>
<P>
   At William Morris, Wiatt succeeded Arnold Rifkin, who resigned
as president and co-chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   He brought over most of his clients, among them Eddie Murphy and
Sylvester Stallone. William Morris' top money makers include Bruce
Willis _ whose status is now unclear because he was represented by
Rifkin _ as well as John Travolta, Bill Cosby, Clint Eastwood and
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, several agents announced that they were
leaving William Morris. These included Frank Frattarol, the co-head
of talent on the East Coast, and Jim Crabbe, a senior literary
agent.

GAME WITH ORIOLES A RAINOUT, BUT YANKEES MOVE CLOSER TO CLINCHING
DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Umpire Durwood Merrill walked on the field and waved
his arms dramatically, indicating for all fans at Camden Yards that
Wednesday night's game between the Yankees and the Baltimore
Orioles was postponed. There was something missing from the
picture, however: rain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rain when the umpires made their decision, which
was based on ominous forecasts of heavy showers expected to deluge
the city at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Orioles will play a makeup game Thursday, as
part of a day-night doubleheader. Roger Clemens will pitch against
the Orioles' Mike Mussina in the first game, at 1:05 p.m., and
Orlando Hernandez faces Baltimore's Matt Riley in the second game,
at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill surprised manager Joe Torre of the Yankees with the
postponement because of how he handled the hour leading to the
decision. The game was scheduled to start at 7:05, but at 6:45,
Merrill told Torre that showers were expected shortly and that the
chances of getting the game in would be better if the starting time
was backed up to 7:35. Clemens and Mussina did not warm up.
</P>
<P>
   But as Merrill learned more about the forecast, he changed his
course of action, even though it was not raining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to take the heat,'' Merrill said. ``I know it's not
raining, but all I can go on is the best information I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said he did not want to start the game and then have to
stop it after only two innings, particularly since the rain was
expected to last all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to lose a game with Clemens and Mussina,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without playing, the Yankees' clinching number in the
American League East dropped to one after the Boston Red Sox lost
the second game of a doubleheader Wednesday night. A Yankee victory
or Boston loss would mean the Yankees had won the division.

ADVERTISING: `DOT-COM' COMMERCIALS OFTEN SKIRT BOUNDS OF GOOD
TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One television commercial for Outpost.com featured gerbils shot
out of a cannon. Another, for Ecampus.com, featured a college kid
belching the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   This is dot-com _ home of some of the best and worst advertising
in the industry. Dot-com advertising seems to be the place where
practically no bodily function is too private and no rude behavior
too coarse to be featured in a spot. It is also the habitat of
clever and ingenious creativity that takes risks in the high-stakes
race for category dominance on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost the job of dot-com advertising is to gain
top-of-mind awareness,'' said Brian Mulhern, senior vice president
at Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, a unit of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi PLC that creates Outpost.com advertising. ``When I sit down
to buy on the Internet, if I don't remember the actual name of the
site and remember it first, then there's no chance that that
company is going to get my sale.''
</P>
<P>
   And, appropriate for the Internet, speed is everything. The
speed at which an Internet company can establish brand awareness is
key. Some 5 million new households will come online this year,
bringing the number of Internet-accessible households in the United
States to 39 million, according to Charlene Li, senior analyst with
Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to establish brand awareness right now,''
said Ms. Li. ``It's all about capturing and retaining customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whle taking risks is anathema in the corporate world, dot-com
advertisers say there is little choice. They have a lot of money
from venture capital and initial public offerings and an edict from
investors to acquire customers fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies that need to create brands within very
short order,'' said Ellis Verdi, president of DeVito/Verdi in New
York, which creates the Ecampus.com advertising. ``Wall Street is
expecting results in months, and that almost requires that they
push the envelope. There's a sense that there's one big gold pile
out there and everyone is running for it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of 1999, companies advertising
online services spent $755 million, up from $230 million for the
first half of 1998, according to Competitive Media Reporting, which
tracks advertising spending. More spending is projected as the
fourth quarter shapes up to be a crucial time for many dot-com
retailers that are trying to grab holiday shopping sales for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With increased competition among Web sites _ and there seems
to be a million of them _ you have to be out there in the
marketplace just to be seen, and whoever shouts loudest will come
out on top,'' said Eric Goldberg, a media planner with DeWitt Media
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg predicts that heavy dot-com advertising will contribute
to a tight media inventory next year, which could push up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Because Web companies and services are new, Ms. Lee said the
advertising did not have to protect existing brand images. And
because the companies are part of the Internet, Ms. Lee said
consumers understand that Web advertisers have more ``license to be
wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ A commercial for Beyond.com, tagged ``the place to buy
software,'' features a corporate drop-out who works at home in the
nude, much to the chagrin of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   _ To get its tag _ ``Textbooks and stuff. Cheap'' _ across,
Ecampus.com shows a college student so broke that he resorts to
frying a pet goldfish for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a spot for Outpost.com, a pack of wolves is released among
a high school marching band after it forms the word Outpost.com.
The reason? To get viewers ``to remember our name,'' according to
an announcer.
</P>
<P>
   The companies do not seem overly concerned about offending
people. Mulhern said Outpost.com received about 17,000 letters
concerning the spot that featured the gerbils, with 60 percent
expressing support for the ad. Only a handful of consumers even
commented on the band commercial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one inherent danger of bizarre advertising is that
viewers will not know what is being advertised, Verdi said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Mulhern said that Outpost.com's second flurry
of ads _ spoofs of 1950s science-fiction movies _ promotes various
benefits that the company offers, including free overnight delivery
of goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seeded our name with the original campaign, now we really
need to differentiate the company from everyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the advertising needs to be sharp because it is
intended to reach hip, young people. Boo.com, a site that will
begin operations later this year, will sell sports apparel and
footwear and offer advertising that features anti-fashion figures:
computer geeks. TV ads to be shown in November will depict geeks
trying desperately to participate in sports. Print ads, taken from
the television spots, feature scenes like a geek in running shorts
on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Shapiro, Boo.com director of marketing, says geeks are
cool and the perfect anti-status image. NBC recently began a TV
series called ``Freaks and Geeks.'' ``Geeks have become heroes;
they're chic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The outrageousness of some dot-com advertising has forced
brick-and-mortar companies like Staples Inc. to reconsider whether
their online advertising is outrageous enough _ and they haven't
always opted to go that extra step.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at the landscape of on-edge advertising, we saw
that they were doing things to get people's attention and perhaps
shock them into logging on,'' said Jeanne Lewis, president of the
Staples.com unit. ``But we realized we didn't need to do that
because we already have a creative strategy with our existing
advertising that does get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lewis said she appreciated a lot of the dot.com
advertising for its edginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ideal is to combine the newest techniques out
there with some good basic marketing fundamentals that can't be
forgotten,'' Ms. Lewis said. &QL;

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - Annapolis, Md., 1955 _ Midshipman John McCain and his
roommate, Frank Gamboa, are eating lunch at the mess hall at the
U.S. Naval Academy when a first classman, a ``firstie'' in Naval
parlance, begins dressing down a Filipino steward.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was just being nasty to him,'' Gamboa recalls. ``(The
firstie) was obviously not in a happy mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa hardly notices this ex change, but young John McCain is
paying close attention. Since the steward is an enlisted man, he
cannot fight back. The firstie is being a bully, a no-no at the
Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The man outranks everyone at the table. McCain and Gamboa are
barely past being plebes, the school's lowest rank. Fearing
trouble, other underclassmen eat quickly and leave. The steward
becomes disconcerted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain can take no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, why don't you pick on someone your own size?'' McCain
blurts out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a moment of silent shock at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you say?'' replies the firstie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you stop picking on him?'' McCain says. ``He's doing
the best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your name, mister?'' snaps the firstie, an open threat
to put McCain on report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midshipman John McCain III,'' McCain says, looking straight at
the upperclassman. ``What's yours?''
</P>
<P>
   The firstie saw the look in McCain's eyes. And fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy got so flustered he just got up and left the table,''
Gamboa recalls.  &QL; 
A FAMILY IN SERVICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain had plenty to live up to at the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   There was his grandfather, Admiral John ``Slew'' McCain, Class
of 1906, a grizzled old sea dog who commanded aircraft carriers in
the Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Slew McCain's peers at the Naval Academy were Chester Nimitz and
William `` Bull'' Halsey, who would become major commanders during
World War II. One of Slew McCain's first assignments was as
executive officer on a gunboat in the Philippines commanded by
Nimitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would hunt and fish, and every now and then they would
stop in for their mail,'' the younger McCain said recently in a TV
interview. ``Can you imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the military passed a regulation that aircraft
carriers could be commanded only by aviators. Already in his 50s,
McCain's grandfather went to flight school.
</P>
<P>
   He crashed five airplanes but got his wings and went on to
command a carrier. He eventually would rise to command all U.S.
carriers in the Pacific, under Halsey. Planes under Slew McCain's
command participated in a number of battles, including Leyte Gulf,
</P>
<P>
   and once sank 49 Japanese ships in a day.
</P>
<P>
   According to his grandson, McCain was the quintessential combat
officer _ a throwback, a gregarious, beloved commander who didn't
worry whether his uniform was pressed. But the war, and his
lifestyle, taxed his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very hard life to start with,'' the younger McCain
recalled recently. ``He smoked and he drank and he didn't take care
of himself. Also, the strain of operations in World War II was
immense.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese surrendered aboard the USS Missouri on Sept.
2, 1945, Slew McCain was there. He can been seen in the famous
picture, standing in the front row of U.S. officers. He was 61
years old, but he looked 80.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he had been sick for two weeks, at least since a
cease-fire was called on Aug. 15, 1945. Around that time, the elder
McCain talked with John Thach, who recalled the conversa tion in
the book Carrier Warfare in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had been staying in his sea cabin, popping his head out
only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admiral, you don't feel very well, do you?'' Thach asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' McCain responded, ``this surrender has come as kind of
a shock to all of us. I feel lost. I don't know what to do. I know
how to fight, but now I don't know whether I know how to relax or
not. I am in an awful letdown. I do feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the surrender, the old man would see his son, John
S. McCain Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   a submarine commander. The younger McCain had been given the job
of escorting Japanese submarines into Tokyo Bay. Father and son
posed for a picture aboard the Proteus, a submarine tender.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time John McCain Jr. would see his father alive.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the surrender aboard the Missouri, the elder
McCain flew back to Coronado, Calif. Thach went to visit him and
noted that he looked even worse. A few minutes into the visit,
McCain said he wanted to lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Thach went to San Diego to visit his father-in-law. A short time
later, he got a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   John ``Slew'' McCain had died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, next to his
brother, William Alexander McCain, a cavalry officer known as
``Wild Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCain, who graduated from West Point, chased Pancho Villa
with Gen. Blackjack Pershing, served as an artillery officer during
World War I and attained the rank of brigadier general.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, Faith of My Fathers, McCain details his
Scotch-Irish roots, noting that his great-aunt was a descendant of
Robert the Bruce, an early Scottish king.
</P>
<P>
   On this continent, McCain's roots date to the American
Revolution. An early ancestor, John Young, served on Gen. George
Washington's staff. After the family moved to Mississippi, a number
of McCain's ancestors fought in the Civil War on the side of the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's grandfather grew up on the family plantation in Carroll
County, Miss. He first attended the University of Mississippi, then
entered the Naval Academy. &QL; 
`HE WAS A TOUGH GUY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, John McCain was no scrubbed angel when he
reached the Naval Academy in 1954. At Episcopal High, a private
boarding school in Alexandria, Va., McCain was a rebel, earning the
nickname ``McNasty'' from classmates who didn't dare cross him.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-9, McCain was an excellent lightweight wrestler in high
school. One of McCain's school friends, Malcolm Matheson, said
McCain was no bully but took no guff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always got along with him, but he was a tough guy,''
Matheson said. ``He was small but feisty. He's always been that
way. . . . If you messed with him, you probably would end up on the
wrong side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his rebellious nature, Mc Cain was destined to attend
the Naval Academy, like his grandfather and his father (Class of
'31) before him.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Thunman, who commanded McCain's plebe, or first-year, class,
said he had no idea that McCain came from an old Navy family but
said the young man immediately impressed him. The plebe battalions
competed in sports, McCain as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   What he lacked in skill, he made up for in ferocity, Thunman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a real kick out of him,'' Thunman said. ``It was clear
that nobody was going to take him down without a hell of an
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunman said he noticed McCain had a quick mind and a good sense
of humor. He quickly emerged as a leader in his group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood out because he was just one of those people that you
liked and you got a chuckle out of,'' Thunman said. ``He was
somebody who was always moving at top speed in one direction or
another. He was never one to hang back.''
</P>
<P>
   A free spirit, McCain chafed under the strict rules of the
academy. Each year, he was always in the ``Century Club, ''
students with more than 100 demerits.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly small stuff _ messy quarters, unshined shoes,
reporting late to formation, things like that, recalls Gamboa, who
roomed with McCain for three years at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I, we got a lot of demerits,'' Gamboa said. ``It was
almost impossible not to.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's grades were good in the subjects he enjoyed, such as
literature and history. Gamboa said McCain would rather read a
history book than do his math homework. He did just enough to pass
the classes he didn't find stimulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood low in his class,'' Gamboa said. ``But that was by
choice, not design.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, everyone wanted to hang out with McCain, who grew
up around Washington and knew all the best parties. And with his
good looks, McCain attracted plenty of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call him John Wayne McCain,'' Gamboa said. ``He was
graying at the temples, and it made him more dashing. . . . It was
a real adventure living with John.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bio in the academy yearbook said it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sturdy conversationalist and party man. John's quick wit and
clever sarcasm made him a welcome man at any gathering. His bouts
with the academic and executive departments contributed much to the
stockpiles of legends within the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   One such bout almost ended in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The further cadets rose in the academy, the fewer demerits they
were allowed. Naturally, McCain was pushing the limit as his senior
year neared an end.
</P>
<P>
   McCain already had been skirting the rules. He and some friends
had bought a television, which was prohibited. They would gather in
their rooms on weekends, watching boxing on Friday nights and a
Western, Maverick, on Sundays. The men kept the TV hidden in a
``pipe locker,'' a space between the dormitory rooms that housed
plumbing, heating and ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, the company officer got to crawling around in there,
and he found the TV,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, all the men involved would play a game similar to
``paper, rock, scissors'' to determine who would get the demerits.
But Gamboa and the others wouldn't let McCain take the chance _ the
30 demerits from the TV would get him kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to, but we just insisted,'' Gamboa said. ``The guy
who took the demerits (a model midshipman named Henry Vargo) had
none.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also offered advice to the lovelorn. More than one
midshipman made his way to McCain's room to ask for advice on a
romantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, Gamboa was writing a thank-you letter to a date (a
custom in those days), when McCain came up and snatched the letter
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible letter,'' McCain said. ``Did you have fun
with her? Do you want to see her again? Here, I'll tell you what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa and McCain remain close to this day. The friendship says
something about McCain, notes Gamboa, a first-generation
Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met at the Naval Academy, they had nothing in
common. Gamboa was the son of immigrant parents from a little town
in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. McCain was the son and
grandson of naval officers and attended private schools in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But to McCain, race and status meant nothing, Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think John McCain had even been associated with
Hispanics or any minorities, given where he lived and the school he
went to, but yet he picked me, a Mexican-American, to be his
roommate,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the comment that he has always done well with
minorities. He's the most colorblind person I've ever met in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats me like a brother.'' &QL; 
CHOOSING A CAREER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the men graduated from the Naval Academy, they had to make a
choice as to what branch of service they would enter, the Navy or
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa said he always knew what McCain would pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question in our minds that he was going to
be flier,'' Gamboa said. ``He was an adventurous spirit, and that's
what he would do.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain's roommates _ Gamboa, Keith Bunting and Jack Dittrick
_ it was still an open question. Until they met Jack McCain, John's
father.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the elder McCain won the Silver Star while
commanding two submarines: the USS Gunnel, which sunk freighters
and battled Japanese destroyers in the Pacific; and the USS
Dentuda, which was on hand at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   While his son attended the Naval Academy, Jack McCain was living
in nearby Washington, working as the Navy's senior liaison officer
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, John McCain and his roommates would go to his
father's house, where the elder McCain would chomp cigars and tell
them about the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we went to John's house, we would get a blue and
gold pep talk from Jack McCain,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McCain was not subtle. To his friends, he was known as
``Good Goddamn McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Annapolis Class of 1970, Jack McCain made light
of the antiwar slogan ``make love, not war,'' by noting that naval
officers ``were men enough to do both,'' according to Faith of My
Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best naval officer I ever met in my life,'' Gamboa
said. ``I think that's where John got his love of history, from his
father. His father's den was filled ceiling to floor with books,
and the majority were on history.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack McCain made a big impression on the midshipmen. McCain and
his roommates joined the Navy, and all reached the rank of captain
_ Bunting as a submariner, Dittrick as an aviator and Gamboa on
surface ships. John McCain went to flight school.
</P>
<P>
   During training, McCain had several close calls, including a
crash in Corpus Christi Bay and a collision with power lines in
Spain. In both cases, he emerged virtually unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, while stationed in Pensacola, Fla., McCain started a
relationship with Carol Shepp, a tall Philadelphia model he first
met while at Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next year, the two were married in Philadelphia. John soon
adopted Carol's two children from a previous marriage. In 1966,
they had a daughter of their own, Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, McCain was sent to Vietnam as a bomber pilot on an
aircraft carrier. Carol would not see her husband again for almost
six years. &QL;

INTRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
``Can honour set a leg? No: Or an arm? No: Or take away the grief
of a wound? No: Honour hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is
honour? A word. What is in that word honour? Air. A trim
reckoning.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Henry IV, Part I &QR; 
GREENWOOD, S.C. _ There is a grim determination to Sen. John McCain
as he rises to address the Republican faithful. He moves stiffly
through the heavy air of the gymnasium, his war injuries still
evident.
</P>
<P>
   There is his sore right knee, broken years ago when he ejected
from a bomber over North Vietnam. There is his aching right
shoulder, shattered by his captors. There is his hair, turned
prematurely white by mistreatment and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are his political wounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is the edge McCain carries that led to angry outbursts
with reporters during the Keating Five scandal. The defiant tone in
his attacks on pork-barrel spending and calls for campaign-finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But for McCain, it's not about falling down. It's about getting
up again.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he rose to speak, the lights had dimmed, and
patriotic images had flashed on a screen: an American flag, a pilot
in a flight suit, a senator shaking hands with President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when America is searching for heroes to lead us,'' a
narrator intoned, ``it has the genuine article in John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the scripted themes of McCain, 63, as he sets out on
his carefully calculated campaign for the GOP nomination for
president _ genuine hero, proven leader, man of integrity in a
wayward time.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is no comic-book hero, drawn in two dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   He's sometimes driven by courage and duty, sometimes by anger
and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think life is a series of contradictions,'' said Jay Smith,
who worked on McCain's first four campaigns. ``Life is complex. Who
among us is so simplistic that you can just pigeonhole?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he's become a champion of campaign-finance
reform. More than a decade ago, he took free trips to the Bahamas
with savings and loan tycoon Charles Keating. He continues to take
big money from interests before his committees.
</P>
<P>
   He's amassed a rogues' gallery of troublemaking former pals _
Keating, Gary Hart, John Tower, Fife Symington, Duke Tully _ who
hardly square with his ambitions as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he's pilloried tobacco companies, though his wife
owes her personal millions to beer sales.
</P>
<P>
   He has romanced the national press while warring with Arizona
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his personal integrity yet admits he wasn't
faithful to his first wife, Carol, who was injured in a horrific
car accident while McCain was in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He courts the veteran vote yet is despised among veterans who
believe there are still POWs alive in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He was hawkish on Kosovo, yet as a freshman congressman, he
opposed Reagan's sending of Marines to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Some say McCain's seemingly principled positions _ as on tobacco
and campaign-finance reform _ are all for show, helping him build
his maverick image with a windmill tilt or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both instances (tobacco and campaign-finance reform), he
took positions that were doomed to failure and stuck to them,''
said Grant Woods, former Arizona attorney general and an early
McCain protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of federal legislation, we're in the same position
today that we were in five years ago. I wonder what the point of
that is. If you truly want to accomplish something on the issue,
you've got several ways to go, and this one has produced nothing _
and by nothing, I mean nothing.'' &QL; 
INTENSE, LIKABLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend any time around McCain and you quickly find that he is
well-read, intense, likable. He can talk Robinson Crusoe or
Saturday Night Live. He can lead the bull session or just listen.
One minute he is chatting about a Sports Illustrated story he read
about Bobby Allison (``One of the greatest NASCAR drivers ever, and
he's living on the charity of others'') and the next he is shaking
his head over World War I and the Battle of the Somme (``That's the
argument for media coverage. They never would have put up with
it.'')
</P>
<P>
   While at the Naval Academy, McCain let some subjects slide,
spending his time reading history and literature and, of course,
howling at the moon. He graduated fifth from the bottom of his
class.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's sense of humor, sometimes indelicate, gets him in
trouble. Back when he entered politics, he once referred to the
Arizona retirement community of Leisure World as ``Seizure World.''
More recently, it was a crude joke about Chelsea Clinton that
raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain can be funny.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to South Carolina, state director Trey Walker
was stumbling his way along the aisle of the moving campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trey,'' McCain said, ``is on a work-release program.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance at a Gridiron Club dinner in Washington,
McCain appeared at the podium, wearing a jacket ridiculously
covered with fake ribbons and medals, and cracked:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I ask myself every morning while shaving in front
of the mirror is: OK, John, you're an incredible war hero, an
inspiration to all Americans. But what qualifies you to be
president of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   From staffers, McCain inspires a loyalty not often found in
Washington. He treats them like extended family, always remembering
a child's name or a sick relative. Some have been with McCain for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be around him,'' longtime aide Deb Gullett says.
``He cuts up all the time. If you screw up, you feel worse about it
than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have snickered about aides combing McCain's hair and
dusting off his suit jacket before television appearances. What
they do not realize is that McCain cannot do it himself _ his
shoulders are too damaged.
</P>
<P>
   For exercise, McCain walks. He's hiked nearly every trail in
Arizona, from the well-known to the obscure. He often drags along
his family and staff.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else, McCain is a relentless hiker. On a
recent trip to Lake Powell, he led his party through a slot canyon
where the water was almost over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett jokingly dubbed it ``The McCain Death March'' and vowed
not to return.
</P>
<P>
   In all this hubbub, McCain's family, including wife Cindy, stays
in the background. Cindy has no interest in politics. She has
agreed to travel with McCain once or twice a month, but she'd
clearly rather be at home raising her four children, ages 14, 13,
11 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is at home,'' she says simply.
</P>
<P>
   After a well-publicized bout with an addiction to painkillers in
the early 1990s, Cindy no longer reads the newspaper. She keeps up
with news by listening to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cindy and John go weeks without seeing each other.
It's a sacrifice they've made to raise their children in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I wish he were there on that particular
evening,'' Cindy said. ``But I wouldn't change our life in any
way.'' &QL; 
A LITTLE FREELANCING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, McCain frustrates his handlers. He
doesn't repeat the message often enough, frequently choosing to
freelance. And if McCain wants to stand and answer questions, to
hell with the carefully prepared schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to try,'' said John Weaver, McCain's national
political director. ``We'd say, `Senator, we have to go,' and he
would just look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who earned the nickname ``White Tornado'' in Congress
belies his years by working a schedule that would bury men half his
age. While campaigning, his days often last from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can outwork any other candidate,'' McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is much work to do, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is broken, and the White House is stained by the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. McCain plans to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for president to be someone,'' McCain said
recently. ``I'm running to do something. This is your country, my
friends. And I'm running for president to give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says his background makes him qualified to be president.
He is the son and grandson of admirals. He flew Navy attack bombers
in Vietnam. He spent close to six years in a North Vietnamese
prison camp. He served two terms in the House of Representatives
and was elected to his third Senate term last year.
</P>
<P>
   He's not in awe of the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously aware of the enormous responsibilities,'' he
said. ``But I don't find it intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have yet to meet John McCain. With Texas Gov.
George W. Bush leading the polls, the national press has been
content to sketch McCain as a caricature:
</P>
<P>
   Former prisoner of war. Crusader for reform and breath of fresh
air in Washington. One of the Keating Five, but the media tone on
that seems to be, who cares, really?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since McCain is not yet a threat, nobody is talking much about
his negatives,'' Woods said. ``Because of the Bush phenomenon,
(McCain's) avoided scrutiny. He'll stay under the radar just
because we really don't have a race.'' &QL; 
THE POW FACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tilton, N.H. _ At Oliver's Diner, a woman shyly walks up to
mccain, her eyes moist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 30 years to meet you,'' she says, and
thrusts out her hand.
</P>
<P>
   McCain looks down. The woman is holding a stainless steel POW
bracelet, embossed with the lettering LCDR JOHN McCAIN III
10-26-67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very touched,'' McCain says. ``Very touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Tilton says she started wearing McCain's bracelet when she
was 7 years old. It was given to her by her father, a retired
lieutenant colonel in the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Tilton said she first noticed McCain when he was elected to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wait a minute, I know him,' '' she said. ``Every
time he came to New Hampshire, I thought, `Maybe I'll meet him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw a notice for the breakfast, Tilton decided it was
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrific,'' she said. ``I've been waiting a long
time.'' &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows that being a war hero is not enough to be elected
president. But it doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   His military experience gives him a trump card over a generation
of draft dodgers and National Guardsmen, those who avoided the war
that stole much of McCain's youth.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was McCain who turned down an early release
offered because his father was an admiral. McCain knew it was a
propaganda ploy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It was McCain who rotted in prison and was beaten to a pulp
while Bill Clinton studied at Oxford and George W. Bush flew
National Guard jets in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This gives McCain instant credibility on two key campaign
issues, foreign policy and national defense, that make Bush and
other non-combatant candidates a little queasy.
</P>
<P>
   To tell his story, McCain doesn't need to drag out his medals,
which include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit,
Distinguished Flying Cross and a fistful of others. His experiences
were chronicled in a book, The Nightingale's Song, by Robert
Timberg, as well as an A&AMP;E special that might have been titled John
McCain: Hero or God? McCain just released his own book about his
family and his Vietnam experience, Faith of My Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   That book conveniently ends with his release from North Vietnam,
skipping the less ennobling things that happened later.
</P>
<P>
   His war story, and the bluntness of his personality that goes
along with it, appeal to people.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is his New Hampshire driver, Frank Cartier, a
28-year-old Manchester firefighter and Gulf War veteran whose unit
led the 1st Marines into Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier had always admired McCain and became his first volunteer
in New Hampshire when he saw a blurb in the local paper. Cartier
said McCain impressed him right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier said most candidates would just shake your hand and look
to the next person. Not McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wearing my Marine tie clip,'' Cartier recalled. ``And he
looked me right in the eye and said, `Thank you for serving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Marine, you get a sense of who you would want to lead you
into battle. I would gladly take the hill for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of impact McCain hopes to have, to bring
younger voters back into the fold. As he campaigns, McCain often
notes that the last election had the lowest voter turnout among 18-
to 26-year-olds of any election in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shameful thing, my friends,'' McCain said, ``when
young people say we are corrupt. But to a certain extent, they are
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also is attracting others into the fray, people who have
never participated before. One is Rick Kamp, a 50-year-old
marketing executive who hosted a meet-and-greet for McCain at his
home in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp rented a tent for the back yard and brought in a bartender
and mountains of sandwiches for the guests, who would be tapped for
donations before the end of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   By the time things got started, it was raining in Concord. The
crowd squeezed into Kamp's living room. As McCain spoke with a
C-Span camera crew looking on, Kamp and his wife beamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my maiden voyage in political activism,'' Kamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, who sought out the McCain campaign on his own, said he
wanted to support a candidate who is willing to take tough stands
and fight for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the type who needs an overnight poll to tell him what
to think or what to say on any given day,'' Kamp said. ``I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the adulation, McCain says there is one thing he might
change about his public persona: He doesn't want to be the ``POW
Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be strategy disguised as humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he doesn't want to be the POW candidate, but it's an
integral part of his resume,'' said Jay Smith, who runs a public
relations firm in Washington. ``It's something people respond to
for positive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use what you can use.''
</P>
<P>
   At every McCain rally, there are large posters of McCain as a
young pilot, standing next to his bomber. In South Carolina, when
McCain was introduced in stifling meeting halls, the speaker would
note that ``John McCain spent five and a half years in a place much
smaller and hotter than this.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, McCain spins stories about being a POW, though
usually about other brave prisoners. He often notes that he was not
a hero but served in the company of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a lot of talent to get shot down,'' McCain is
fond of saying. ``I was able to intercept a surface-to-air missile
with my own airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   When he talks of the war, or about another soldier's courage, it
reminds people he is no phony.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the state Veterans of Foreign Wars convention
in New Hampshire, McCain recalled the tale of Mike Christian, a
fellow POW who used red and white cloth to sew an American flag
inside his prison uniform. Every night, the POWs hung up
Christian's shirt and recited the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the North Vietnamese guards found the flag. They took
Christian from the cell and beat him severely. When he was
returned, his ribs were broken and his face badly bruised. The
other POWs cleaned up Christian the best they could.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, as McCain struggled to sleep on the concrete
slab that was his bed, he looked over into the corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, beneath that dim light bulb, with a piece of white
cloth and a piece of red cloth and his bamboo needle, his eyes
almost shut from the beating that he had received, was my dear
friend Mike Christian, making another American flag.'' &QL;

 EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 3  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - ``Can honour set a leg? No: Or an arm? No: Or take away
the grief of a wound? No: Honour hath no skill in surgery then? No.
What is honour? A word. What is in that word honour? Air. A trim
reckoning.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Henry IV, Part I &QR; 
GREENWOOD, S.C. _ There is a grim determination to Sen. John McCain
as he rises to address the Republican faithful. He moves stiffly
through the heavy air of the gymnasium, his war injuries still
evident.
</P>
<P>
   There is his sore right knee, broken years ago when he ejected
from a bomber over North Vietnam. There is his aching right
shoulder, shattered by his captors. There is his hair, turned
prematurely white by mistreatment and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are his political wounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is the edge McCain carries that led to angry outbursts
with reporters during the Keating Five scandal. The defiant tone in
his attacks on pork-barrel spending and calls for campaign-finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But for McCain, it's not about falling down. It's about getting
up again.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he rose to speak, the lights had dimmed, and
patriotic images had flashed on a screen: an American flag, a pilot
in a flight suit, a senator shaking hands with President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when America is searching for heroes to lead us,'' a
narrator intoned, ``it has the genuine article in John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the scripted themes of McCain, 63, as he sets out on
his carefully calculated campaign for the GOP nomination for
president _ genuine hero, proven leader, man of integrity in a
wayward time.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is no comic-book hero, drawn in two dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   He's sometimes driven by courage and duty, sometimes by anger
and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think life is a series of contradictions,'' said Jay Smith,
who worked on McCain's first four campaigns. ``Life is complex. Who
among us is so simplistic that you can just pigeonhole?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he's become a champion of campaign-finance
reform. More than a decade ago, he took free trips to the Bahamas
with savings and loan tycoon Charles Keating. He continues to take
big money from interests before his committees.
</P>
<P>
   He's amassed a rogues' gallery of troublemaking former pals _
Keating, Gary Hart, John Tower, Fife Symington, Duke Tully _ who
hardly square with his ambitions as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he's pilloried tobacco companies, though his wife
owes her personal millions to beer sales.
</P>
<P>
   He has romanced the national press while warring with Arizona
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on his personal integrity yet admits he wasn't
faithful to his first wife, Carol, who was injured in a horrific
car accident while McCain was in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He courts the veteran vote yet is despised among veterans who
believe there are still POWs alive in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He was hawkish on Kosovo, yet as a freshman congressman, he
opposed Reagan's sending of Marines to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Some say McCain's seemingly principled positions _ as on tobacco
and campaign-finance reform _ are all for show, helping him build
his maverick image with a windmill tilt or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both instances (tobacco and campaign-finance reform), he
took positions that were doomed to failure and stuck to them,''
said Grant Woods, former Arizona attorney general and an early
McCain protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of federal legislation, we're in the same position
today that we were in five years ago. I wonder what the point of
that is. If you truly want to accomplish something on the issue,
you've got several ways to go, and this one has produced nothing _
and by nothing, I mean nothing.'' &QL; 
INTENSE, LIKABLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend any time around McCain and you quickly find that he is
well-read, intense, likable. He can talk Robinson Crusoe or
Saturday Night Live. He can lead the bull session or just listen.
One minute he is chatting about a Sports Illustrated story he read
about Bobby Allison (``One of the greatest NASCAR drivers ever, and
he's living on the charity of others'') and the next he is shaking
his head over World War I and the Battle of the Somme (``That's the
argument for media coverage. They never would have put up with
it.'')
</P>
<P>
   While at the Naval Academy, McCain let some subjects slide,
spending his time reading history and literature and, of course,
howling at the moon. He graduated fifth from the bottom of his
class.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's sense of humor, sometimes indelicate, gets him in
trouble. Back when he entered politics, he once referred to the
Arizona retirement community of Leisure World as ``Seizure World.''
More recently, it was a crude joke about Chelsea Clinton that
raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain can be funny.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to South Carolina, state director Trey Walker
was stumbling his way along the aisle of the moving campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trey,'' McCain said, ``is on a work-release program.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance at a Gridiron Club dinner in Washington,
McCain appeared at the podium, wearing a jacket ridiculously
covered with fake ribbons and medals, and cracked:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I ask myself every morning while shaving in front
of the mirror is: OK, John, you're an incredible war hero, an
inspiration to all Americans. But what qualifies you to be
president of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   From staffers, McCain inspires a loyalty not often found in
Washington. He treats them like extended family, always remembering
a child's name or a sick relative. Some have been with McCain for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be around him,'' longtime aide Deb Gullett says.
``He cuts up all the time. If you screw up, you feel worse about it
than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have snickered about aides combing McCain's hair and
dusting off his suit jacket before television appearances. What
they do not realize is that McCain cannot do it himself _ his
shoulders are too damaged.
</P>
<P>
   For exercise, McCain walks. He's hiked nearly every trail in
Arizona, from the well-known to the obscure. He often drags along
his family and staff.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else, McCain is a relentless hiker. On a
recent trip to Lake Powell, he led his party through a slot canyon
where the water was almost over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett jokingly dubbed it ``The McCain Death March'' and vowed
not to return.
</P>
<P>
   In all this hubbub, McCain's family, including wife Cindy, stays
in the background. Cindy has no interest in politics. She has
agreed to travel with McCain once or twice a month, but she'd
clearly rather be at home raising her four children, ages 14, 13,
11 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is at home,'' she says simply.
</P>
<P>
   After a well-publicized bout with an addiction to painkillers in
the early 1990s, Cindy no longer reads the newspaper. She keeps up
with news by listening to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cindy and John go weeks without seeing each other.
It's a sacrifice they've made to raise their children in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I wish he were there on that particular
evening,'' Cindy said. ``But I wouldn't change our life in any
way.'' &QL; 
A LITTLE FREELANCING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, McCain frustrates his handlers. He
doesn't repeat the message often enough, frequently choosing to
freelance. And if McCain wants to stand and answer questions, to
hell with the carefully prepared schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to try,'' said John Weaver, McCain's national
political director. ``We'd say, `Senator, we have to go,' and he
would just look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who earned the nickname ``White Tornado'' in Congress
belies his years by working a schedule that would bury men half his
age. While campaigning, his days often last from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can outwork any other candidate,'' McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is much work to do, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is broken, and the White House is stained by the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. McCain plans to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for president to be someone,'' McCain said
recently. ``I'm running to do something. This is your country, my
friends. And I'm running for president to give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says his background makes him qualified to be president.
He is the son and grandson of admirals. He flew Navy attack bombers
in Vietnam. He spent close to six years in a North Vietnamese
prison camp. He served two terms in the House of Representatives
and was elected to his third Senate term last year.
</P>
<P>
   He's not in awe of the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously aware of the enormous responsibilities,'' he
said. ``But I don't find it intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have yet to meet John McCain. With Texas Gov.
George W. Bush leading the polls, the national press has been
content to sketch McCain as a caricature:
</P>
<P>
   Former prisoner of war. Crusader for reform and breath of fresh
air in Washington. One of the Keating Five, but the media tone on
that seems to be, who cares, really?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since McCain is not yet a threat, nobody is talking much about
his negatives,'' Woods said. ``Because of the Bush phenomenon,
(McCain's) avoided scrutiny. He'll stay under the radar just
because we really don't have a race.'' &QL; 
THE POW FACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tilton, N.H. _ At Oliver's Diner, a woman shyly walks up to
mccain, her eyes moist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 30 years to meet you,'' she says, and
thrusts out her hand.
</P>
<P>
   McCain looks down. The woman is holding a stainless steel POW
bracelet, embossed with the lettering LCDR JOHN McCAIN III
10-26-67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very touched,'' McCain says. ``Very touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Tilton says she started wearing McCain's bracelet when she
was 7 years old. It was given to her by her father, a retired
lieutenant colonel in the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Tilton said she first noticed McCain when he was elected to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wait a minute, I know him,' '' she said. ``Every
time he came to New Hampshire, I thought, `Maybe I'll meet him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw a notice for the breakfast, Tilton decided it was
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrific,'' she said. ``I've been waiting a long
time.'' &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows that being a war hero is not enough to be elected
president. But it doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   His military experience gives him a trump card over a generation
of draft dodgers and National Guardsmen, those who avoided the war
that stole much of McCain's youth.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was McCain who turned down an early release
offered because his father was an admiral. McCain knew it was a
propaganda ploy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It was McCain who rotted in prison and was beaten to a pulp
while Bill Clinton studied at Oxford and George W. Bush flew
National Guard jets in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This gives McCain instant credibility on two key campaign
issues, foreign policy and national defense, that make Bush and
other non-combatant candidates a little queasy.
</P>
<P>
   To tell his story, McCain doesn't need to drag out his medals,
which include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit,
Distinguished Flying Cross and a fistful of others. His experiences
were chronicled in a book, The Nightingale's Song, by Robert
Timberg, as well as an A&AMP;E special that might have been titled John
McCain: Hero or God? McCain just released his own book about his
family and his Vietnam experience, Faith of My Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   That book conveniently ends with his release from North Vietnam,
skipping the less ennobling things that happened later.
</P>
<P>
   His war story, and the bluntness of his personality that goes
along with it, appeal to people.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is his New Hampshire driver, Frank Cartier, a
28-year-old Manchester firefighter and Gulf War veteran whose unit
led the 1st Marines into Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier had always admired McCain and became his first volunteer
in New Hampshire when he saw a blurb in the local paper. Cartier
said McCain impressed him right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier said most candidates would just shake your hand and look
to the next person. Not McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wearing my Marine tie clip,'' Cartier recalled. ``And he
looked me right in the eye and said, `Thank you for serving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Marine, you get a sense of who you would want to lead you
into battle. I would gladly take the hill for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of impact McCain hopes to have, to bring
younger voters back into the fold. As he campaigns, McCain often
notes that the last election had the lowest voter turnout among 18-
to 26-year-olds of any election in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shameful thing, my friends,'' McCain said, ``when
young people say we are corrupt. But to a certain extent, they are
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also is attracting others into the fray, people who have
never participated before. One is Rick Kamp, a 50-year-old
marketing executive who hosted a meet-and-greet for McCain at his
home in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp rented a tent for the back yard and brought in a bartender
and mountains of sandwiches for the guests, who would be tapped for
donations before the end of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   By the time things got started, it was raining in Concord. The
crowd squeezed into Kamp's living room. As McCain spoke with a
C-Span camera crew looking on, Kamp and his wife beamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my maiden voyage in political activism,'' Kamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, who sought out the McCain campaign on his own, said he
wanted to support a candidate who is willing to take tough stands
and fight for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the type who needs an overnight poll to tell him what
to think or what to say on any given day,'' Kamp said. ``I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the adulation, McCain says there is one thing he might
change about his public persona: He doesn't want to be the ``POW
Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be strategy disguised as humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he doesn't want to be the POW candidate, but it's an
integral part of his resume,'' said Jay Smith, who runs a public
relations firm in Washington. ``It's something people respond to
for positive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use what you can use.''
</P>
<P>
   At every McCain rally, there are large posters of McCain as a
young pilot, standing next to his bomber. In South Carolina, when
McCain was introduced in stifling meeting halls, the speaker would
note that ``John McCain spent five and a half years in a place much
smaller and hotter than this.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, McCain spins stories about being a POW, though
usually about other brave prisoners. He often notes that he was not
a hero but served in the company of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a lot of talent to get shot down,'' McCain is
fond of saying. ``I was able to intercept a surface-to-air missile
with my own airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   When he talks of the war, or about another soldier's courage, it
reminds people he is no phony.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the state Veterans of Foreign Wars convention
in New Hampshire, McCain recalled the tale of Mike Christian, a
fellow POW who used red and white cloth to sew an American flag
inside his prison uniform. Every night, the POWs hung up
Christian's shirt and recited the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the North Vietnamese guards found the flag. They took
Christian from the cell and beat him severely. When he was
returned, his ribs were broken and his face badly bruised. The
other POWs cleaned up Christian the best they could.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, as McCain struggled to sleep on the concrete
slab that was his bed, he looked over into the corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, beneath that dim light bulb, with a piece of white
cloth and a piece of red cloth and his bamboo needle, his eyes
almost shut from the beating that he had received, was my dear
friend Mike Christian, making another American flag.'' &QL;

BEING SAME RX FOR DEATH IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Doctors at the Arizona State Hospi tal must deal
every day with the criminally insane, so they know the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A patient first loses touch with reality. Simple logic
disappears from conversation and is replaced by ranting about
justice, conspiracies and the need to eradicate evil de mons.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious cases, like the one facing doctors here, a
deranged subject makes meticulous plans to kill the perceived
guilty party.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is available, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Advancements in psychiatry and pharmaceuticals now make it possi
ble to better care for the mentally ill, often restoring them to a
function ally rational condition through use of newly developed
wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the problem facing local shrinks is:
</P>
<P>
   How do you medicate an entire crazy state?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult time for us, to have the government
taking this position,'' said Dr. Jerry Dennis, the State Hospital's
chief medical officer. ``I'm trying to let others sort out the
political stuff. Mental health has always been one of these areas
that are highly political. But I'm going to abide by what I need to
do as a physician. That's what I am. I'll let the political chips
fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   What the good doctor means but can't come right out and say is _
Arizona has gone nuts. &QL; 
CASE IN POINT
</P>
<P>
   Residing currently at the State Hos pital in Phoenix is
convicted murderer Claude Maturana.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, Maturana and a man named Stephen Ballard convinced
16-year-old Glenn Estes that there was a party in the desert to
which they were all invited.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the men drove Estes to a remote location west of
Tucson, where Maturana shot him a dozen or so times and Ballard
slit his throat with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard got life.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana got the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   What state officials found out over Maturana's time on death
row, how ever, is that he's completely off his rocker. He's been
certified a schizo phrenic by a couple of different doctors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arizona law, the state cannot execute someone who
isn't competent enough to know what's about to happen to him.
However, if a condemned lunatic were to receive enough medical
treatment to make him reasonably lucid, he then could be killed.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Maturana was shipped off to Phoenix, where
doc tors at the local laughing academy were told to tighten up a
few of his loose screws then graduate him magna cum dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis wouldn't do it. FIRST, DO NO HARM
</P>
<P>
   For months, physicians at the State Hospital have given Maturana
enough medication to keep him relatively stable, but not enough to
restore him to legal competency.
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, he can't be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ethical requirements we must meet as doctors,''
Dennis said. ``One of them tells us that anything contributing to a
patient's ultimate execution is unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the state is trying to hire an outside health
professional who'd be willing to give Maturana enough drugs to make
him legally compe tent, something I'd go along with if officials
here agreed to have them selves chemically elevated to the same
level.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then they'd see the insanity of a law that says we must
make a killer well before we kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Pardons and Paroles could recommend that the
governor commute Maturana's sen tence to life without parole, after
which he'd get treatment. But that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't going away,'' Dr. Dennis said. ``I'm aware
of at least one other death-row inmate who may be coming here after
being declared incompetent. We must deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But how? It now may be possible for doctors to stabilize the
criminally insane, but not in a state suffering from an incurable
lack of common sense. E.J. Montini can be reached at (602) 444-8978

ART DEALER IS ARRESTED FOR EXHIBITION OF LIVE AMMUNITION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A prominent Manhattan art dealer was arrested on
Wednesday night at her Fifth Avenue gallery, where an exhibition
included a vase full of live 9-mm cartridges for visitors to take
home as souvenirs, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, Mary Boone, was charged with unlawful distribution
of ammunition and with resisting arrest, said Det. Joseph
Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   She was also charged with possession of unlawful weapons and
possession of stolen property for another piece in the one-man show
by the sculptor Tom Sachs, which featured homemade guns, Pentangelo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone was being held at the Midtown North precinct house
early Thursday morning and was expected to be taken to Manhattan
Central Booking to spend the night in jail, the detective said. All
the charges are misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ms. Boone, 48, a flamboyant, sharply dressed
art-world celebrity who came to prominence in the 1980s, comes in
the midst of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's battle with the Brooklyn
Museum of Art over a painting of the Virgin Mary partly obscured by
pieces of elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's chief spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, said
that the two events were unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is irresponsible, at the very least, to be distributing
live ammunition to the public,'' Ms. Mode said. ``This has nothing
to do with the Brooklyn Museum.'' Joseph J. Lhota, a deputy mayor,
declined to comment on Ms. Boone's arrest, saying he did not know
enough about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, whose work deals with consumer culture, packaging and
violence, placed the cartridges in an Alvar Aalto glass vase on the
reception desk of the gallery at 745 Fifth Avenue, just north of
58th Street. Visitors were invited to take the cartridges home in
orange air-sickness bags that were decorated to look like bags from
Hermes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode said the police had received a complaint about the
show, which opened on Sept. 10, on Wednesdayy and had gone to the
fourth-floor gallery around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that this ammunition was available for anyone to
pick up at this art gallery and we just looked into it,'' she said.
``We wanted to see if it was bullets or foil-wrapped chocolates,
and they're definitely not chocolate bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   While detectives were waiting to speak to Ms. Boone, they
wandered into the main part of the gallery and noticed a cabinet on
the wall holding homemade guns _ Sachs's signature object _ and
what appeared to be more live cartridges, Ms. Mode said.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to take all the suspect objects, as well as an
unwilling Ms. Boone, into custody until they could determine which
things were potentially explosive and which were works of art, Ms.
Mode said.
</P>
<P>
   After technicians from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms determined that the bullets were live, Ms. Boone was
charged with unlawful possession and disposal of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, when Sachs's homemade guns were deemed
functional, the police added charges of criminal possession of a
weapon and criminal possession of a shotgun, Pentangelo said. The
stolen-property charge was added because the container that the
guns were in was made of stolen materials, the detective said, but
would not give details.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone's lawyer, Ted Poretz, who was at the station house
with her, declined to comment for the record.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said that Ms. Boone had a potential claim under
the free-speech clause of the First Amendment if the exhibit was
reasonably understood as artistic expression. Unlike a bank
robbery, which the bank robber cannot retroactively define as
performance art, the exhibit in Ms. Boone's gallery would probably
meet this standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Siegel added: ``There is a second legal standard, known as
a countervailing interest, that would appear to be a problem. The
argument would be that people shouldn't be handing out live
bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode said that claims to artistic expression were
meaningless in the face of actions that posed a threat to public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were simply someone handing bullets out on the street,
you would criticize us greatly for not doing something about it,''
she said. ``This is an unsupervised exhibit with a glass vase
filled with bullets, live ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, who was called the ``Queen of the Art World'' on the
cover of New York magazine in the 1980s, made her name putting on
the first one-man shows by the Neo-Expressionist painters Julian
Schnabel and David Salle. Her artists today include Barbara Kruger,
Brice Marden and Eric Fischl.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After she moved the gallery uptown from SoHo in the early 90s,
she seemed to move from center stage, but in the last year or so
has started to put on shows by more provocative artists, like
Sachs, whose ``Hello Kitty Nativity Scene'' was removed from
display in the store window at Barney's after complaints from
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs's show at Ms. Boone's gallery also features a working
airplane lavatory made of foamcore.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the show in The Village Voice this week praised
Sachs for his clever constructions, but added, ``None of this,
however, saves Sachs' work from shallowness.''

VALLEY NEAR BEATING OZONE RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The Phoenix area is on the verge of completing its
third straight summer without any violations of federal ozone
standards.
</P>
<P>
   It's a feat that is a boon for public health and business alike.
</P>
<P>
   The summer ozone season ends today. The three-year clean sweep
gives more breathing room both to people with respiratory problems
and to manufacturers, who risked severe limits on expansion if air
quality did not meet federal health standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, an air pollutant caused mostly by auto exhaust, stayed
low, state environmental officials said, because of several
factors: favorable weather, cleaner fuels, emissions tests and a
concerted effort to reduce driving on days when officials feared
ozone levels could rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the community should congratulate itself
for,'' said Nancy Wrona, director of the air quality division of
the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. ``Many of these
(smog-reducing efforts) were voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, employees of PSI Group Inc., a round-the-clock,
south-central Phoenix mail sorting business, cut their driving
between 10 and 15 percent on each of six ozone alert days, said
Tina Esparza, the firm's project manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make this small effort, we might all feel better in the
long run,'' Esparza said of the company's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley had risked having its air quality downgraded to
``severe'' from ``serious'' if it couldn't meet U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency standards.
</P>
<P>
   By completing three straight summers without a violation, the
Valley can move to have the EPA determine that it now meets ozone
standards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; While that is encouraging news, a more-stringent standard that
measures ozone over an eight-hour period will be impossible for the
Valley to meet, local officials have determined. That standard
currently is tied up in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   If next summer produces ozone violations, the Valley could be
back in the same jam it faced this year, said Colleen McKaughn, the
EPA's Arizona-based representative.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the steps that air quality officials credit for the
clean showing the last three summers must remain in place, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the controversial vehicle emissions test gets a lot
of credit for helping reduce ozone-forming pollutants from cars'
tailpipes, McKaughn said. And the cleaner fuels used in the Valley
since 1997, as well as the trip reduction efforts, also will
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a good-air record is like following a diet, McKaughn
said. After losing weight, there must be a maintenance plan, or
things revert to their former state.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona said local air quality officials will begin work soon on a
maintenance plan. Gov. Jane Hull, who spearheaded a clean-air
challenge this summer to local businesses, is expected soon to
petition the EPA for a reclassification.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has not had ozone problems during each of the three
summers since the clean-fuel program was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the cleaner fuel, which relies on MTBE to make it burn
cleaner, is controversial because the additive has been detected in
groundwater supplies at various spots throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to precisely measure the effect of such voluntary
activities as the don't-drive campaign championed by the governor
on high-pollution days, Wrona said. But that program had to help
keep ozone levels at bay on those days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the DEQ, employees far exceeded the governor's goal of
reducing driving by at least 10 percent. In late May, 55 percent of
DEQ's 700-plus employees cut their driving, according to agency
records.
</P>
<P>
   Their lowest compliance level was 37 percent, recorded on a
high-pollution day in August.
</P>
<P>
   Even while ozone woes subside, air quality officials are
wrestling with ways to curb particulate pollution. The tiny bits of
soot and grime, which give the Valley's ``brown cloud'' its
distinctive color, is a vexing problem that is still begging for a
solution. &QL;

BEING SAME RX FOR DEATH IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Doctors at the Arizona State Hospi tal must deal
every day with the criminally insane, so they know the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A patient first loses touch with reality. Simple logic
disappears from conversation and is replaced by ranting about
justice, conspiracies and the need to eradicate evil de mons.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious cases, like the one facing doctors here, a
deranged subject makes meticulous plans to kill the perceived
guilty party.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is available, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Advancements in psychiatry and pharmaceuticals now make it possi
ble to better care for the mentally ill, often restoring them to a
function ally rational condition through use of newly developed
wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the problem facing local shrinks is:
</P>
<P>
   How do you medicate an entire crazy state?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult time for us, to have the government
taking this position,'' said Dr. Jerry Dennis, the State Hospital's
chief medical officer. ``I'm trying to let others sort out the
political stuff. Mental health has always been one of these areas
that are highly political. But I'm going to abide by what I need to
do as a physician. That's what I am. I'll let the political chips
fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   What the good doctor means but can't come right out and say is _
Arizona has gone nuts. &QL; 
CASE IN POINT
</P>
<P>
   Residing currently at the State Hos pital in Phoenix is
convicted murderer Claude Maturana.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, Maturana and a man named Stephen Ballard convinced
16-year-old Glenn Estes that there was a party in the desert to
which they were all invited.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the men drove Estes to a remote location west of
Tucson, where Maturana shot him a dozen or so times and Ballard
slit his throat with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard got life.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana got the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   What state officials found out over Maturana's time on death
row, how ever, is that he's completely off his rocker. He's been
certified a schizo phrenic by a couple of different doctors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arizona law, the state cannot execute someone who
isn't competent enough to know what's about to happen to him.
However, if a condemned lunatic were to receive enough medical
treatment to make him reasonably lucid, he then could be killed.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Maturana was shipped off to Phoenix, where
doc tors at the local laughing academy were told to tighten up a
few of his loose screws then graduate him magna cum dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis wouldn't do it. FIRST, DO NO HARM
</P>
<P>
   For months, physicians at the State Hospital have given Maturana
enough medication to keep him relatively stable, but not enough to
restore him to legal competency.
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, he can't be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ethical requirements we must meet as doctors,''
Dennis said. ``One of them tells us that anything contributing to a
patient's ultimate execution is unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the state is trying to hire an outside health
professional who'd be willing to give Maturana enough drugs to make
him legally compe tent, something I'd go along with if officials
here agreed to have them selves chemically elevated to the same
level.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then they'd see the insanity of a law that says we must
make a killer well before we kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Pardons and Paroles could recommend that the
governor commute Maturana's sen tence to life without parole, after
which he'd get treatment. But that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't going away,'' Dr. Dennis said. ``I'm aware
of at least one other death-row inmate who may be coming here after
being declared incompetent. We must deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But how? It now may be possible for doctors to stabilize the
criminally insane, but not in a state suffering from an incurable
lack of common sense. E.J. Montini can be reached at (602) 444-8978

STICKING WITH STARS GRATIFYING TO MODANO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When the Stars raise the Stanley Cup banner at
their season opener tomorrow night, center Mike Modano says he will
probably experience a wide range of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Modano has spent his entire career playing for the Stars,
starting when they were the Minnesota North Stars and surviving
through the lean years in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I feel very fortunate to still be here after 11 years,''
Modano said. ``The changeover, the personnel that have come and
gone in this organization. The different faces year in and year
out. We've had some major face lifts over the years, but it is
really gratifying to still be here and to win and to accomplish
what the team set out to do when they drafted me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what hit me the hardest last year when we won
it, to still be here, to still be alive in this organization.''
Enforcer, not fighter Stars defenseman Jamie Pushor said he isn't a
fighter. He can be an enforcer. There is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   His job isn't to start fights, but to defend his players. His
weapon isn't his fists. It's his body. A big check sends the same
message, and it doesn't get a player to the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that's his role with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in Detroit when they didn't have a real enforcer,''
Pushor said. ``The role was played by their big defensemen.''
Chambers returns Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers is expected to
return to practice today after missing the past two.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to worry about, coach Ken Hitchcock said. rest was
designed to prevent any problems with a lingering knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to get behind the eight-ball with him,''
Hitchcock said. ``When he was playing 12 minutes, it wasn't as
crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers will be playing about 25-30 minutes a game with Derian
Hatcher as the Stars' No. 1 defensive pair. Hatcher's usual
partner, Richard Matvichuk, remains unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk's agent Art Breeze said yesterday that he didn't see
an end in sight to the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never in all the years I've known Rich seen his resolve
so steely,'' Breeze said.

THE GALL OF PEOPLE, LINKING BUSH TO FATHERLY FAVORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - The gall of people, linking Bush to fatherly favors 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The influence of famous political fathers has often helped their
kids.
</P>
<P>
   John Quincy Adams, the country's sixth president, was the son of
the second. John F. Kennedy wouldn't have made it to the White
House without his father's clout. Vice President Al Gore's career
got a boost from Al Gore Sr., a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of privileged sons whose dads have given them a
leg up, it's predictable that some malcontents would grumble about
Texas Gov. George W. Bush owing much of his success to special
treatment as the son of a president.
</P>
<P>
   From keeping out of active military duty during the Vietnam War
to getting rich in the oil business to becoming lead owner of the
Texas Rangers baseball team, George W. has used his father's
political influence to cut in line, they squawk.
</P>
<P>
   The gall of these people.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with how he got into the Texas Air National Guard in
1968 after his graduation from Yale. The war was at its height, and
the draft was at full throttle. But George W. was able to secure a
spot in the Guard, also known then as ``Air Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his father was then a Texas congressman, some people
wondered if strings were pulled. What cynics! As George W. has
assured us repeatedly, he received no special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Ben Barnes, who was speaker of the Texas House of
Representatives, now says he called the head of the Texas Air
National Guard in 1968 and recommended George W. for a Guard slot.
Barnes said he did so at the request of the late Sidney Adger, a
Houston oilman and friend of the elder Bush. Soon after, George W.
got the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubting Thomases have deduced that George W.'s dad,
wanting to stay in the background, probably asked his pal Adger to
urge Barnes to grease the skids. Any fair-minded person, of course,
couldn't believe such a far-fetched scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In business, too, skeptics say George W. had all the breaks. I
can't imagine why.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he started an oil company called Arbusto Energy with
money from his trust fund and wealthy friends of his father. The
company struggled through years of low oil prices, and he merged
twice, the second time in 1986 with Harken Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Harken didn't give George W. a management position, but aware of
his father's connections, made him a director and gave him 212,000
shares of stock worth $500,000, or about $2.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he sold that stock for $4 a share, or $848,560. Eight
days later, Harken finished the second quarter with a stunning loss
of $23 million. Its stock ended the year barely above $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Critics howled that he must have illegally used inside
information to sell before the loss was reported, but what do they
know? Regulators found no evidence that he had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Before the stock was sold, it was collateral for a $500,000 bank
loan he obtained to invest in the Texas Rangers in 1989. Getting
the franchise proved to be his most lucrative business deal and a
launching pad for his campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Though several people wanted to buy the team, George W. was
given preference because owner Eddie Chiles was a longtime friend
of his father, who was then president. But George W. was unable to
line up enough money until Peter Ueberroth, then baseball
commissioner, persuaded Fort Worth billionaire Richard Rainwater to
come into the deal. Ueberroth asked Rainwater to join George W.
partly ``out of respect for his father,'' the New York Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise, bought for $86 million, soared in value with the
construction of a new stadium, funded mostly by a half-cent sales
tax increase that some sourpusses complained was corporate welfare.
Last year, the team was sold for $250 million, and George W. got
$14.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he was born on third base. They say he's led a charmed
life filled with political favors. They say if his name were George
W. Bosh, he'd be a political nobody.
</P>
<P>
   They're jealous. Asked about his paternal advantages, George W.
said all he can do is ``play the hand I've been dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   It just happens to be aces. &QL;

CONNORS STILL FEISTY AFTER ALL THIS YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The hair has no signs of graying.
</P>
<P>
   The face, maybe a few wrinkles here and there, is still one of
the most noticeable in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The body is still average-looking _ slim, nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   But the attitude of 47-year-old Jimmy Connors, no matter what
the age, will never change.
</P>
<P>
   Connors, a winner of eight Grand Slam tennis titles before
retiring for the senior tennis tour, met the media yesterday before
the first round of the PricewaterhouseCoopers Champions Senior
tennis event at the Four Seasons Resort and Club in Las Colinas.
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who defeated archrival John McEnroe in last year's
final, said he's surprised to be playing in the Worldwide Senior
Tennis Circuit at his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would be playing in my mid to late 20s, let
alone my later 40s,'' Connors said. ``I don't do it like I used to,
and I don't play a lot of tennis. The amount of time I do play, I
do enjoy it and it keeps me in shape and I enjoy that. I'm used to
feeling a certain way and looking a certain way, and I enjoy
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors also enjoys throwing his opinion around. Especially when
it comes to the ATP Tour's No. 1 player in Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with British reporters last week, Connors
bristled when asked if Agassi deserved to be linked with Pete
Sampras and retired greats like himself, McEnroe and Bjorn Borg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mention his name in the same breath,'' Connors was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Connors tried to defuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about it,'' Connors said. ``I do a
one-hour and 15-minute interview and they pull \Rstuff\S like that.
I mean that's why I got away from tennis. I couldn't stand being
scrutinize and having them write what they want to. But how do you
know what context it was taken in? You don't know if it was a
different part of a sentence or if they just pulled that into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons why I don't talk anymore. I know
what it's like over there. The first question they asked me is `Why
haven't I been over there the last few years?' Well, now you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors is here now and is best remembered for a spirited match
with McEnroe, in which both players nearly yelled at each other. At
one point during the match, Connors walked off the court and
McEnroe exchanged harsh words with fans.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's tournament, there is no McEnroe, Connor's fierce
rival from the 70s, but that didn't stop Connors from talking about
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't swap spit,'' said Connors, who has won two senior
events this year. ``He hangs with his buddies and I hang with mine.
It's an all-right relationship. But as far as \Rlast year's match\S
goes, I forgot about it two seconds after it was over. I think it
still bothers him. But like I said, he has his friends on the tour
and I have mine. But I would say we are friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Connors is on the senior tour, a tour which he helped
start in 1993, he is still a marquee name for fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, this tour is for the fans,'' said Mel Purcell, who
opened first-round play last night against Jimmy Arias. ``It's
built around the fans and it needs great players like Jimmy on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors said he was burned out on the ATP Tour and feels that
way on this tour sometimes, but he still loves the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been over for eight years and this is an
extension of something I like to do,'' said Connors, who received a
first-round bye and is expected to play today at 7 p.m. ``If I'm
trying to add to my career, then I didn't do it right in the first
place.''

PUPILS JUMP AT CHANCE TO REPAY DISASTER KINDNESS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's payback time for Danube Avenue Elementary School in Granada
Hills. Time to repay an old debt to a tiny elementary school in
Tarboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Two schools 2,300 miles apart, both hit hard by natural
disasters, leaning on each other again for support _ five years
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, it was the kids and teachers at Stocks Elementary
School in Tarboro who rallied to help Danube, where people were
reeling from the Northridge Earthquake, which caused nearly
$1million in damage at the small school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Danube rallying to help the kids at Stocks, whose
whole town, Tarboro, has been virtually under water more than a
week from 30 inches of torrential rain brought by Hurricane Floyd
and other storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have ever thought?'' Danube principal Rosemary Enzer
said Wednesday, answering her own question.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   It was Enzer who took the call more than five years ago from Ed
Scarborough, a teacher at Stocks. He told her the kids at his North
Carolina school were moved by the scenes of earthquake devastation
they saw on TV and wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was Scarborough who took the call from Enzer,
saying it was time to pay them back.
</P>
<P>
   His kids were already talking about the earthquake in California
when Ed Scarborough walked into his second-grade classroom at
Stocks Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to do something to help the kids at Danube they
had seen on TV,'' Scarborough said Wednesday by phone from the Red
Cross emergency headquarters in the gym at Tarboro High School.
</P>
<P>
   Things are still far from normal in his small, eastern North
Carolina hometown ravaged by floods. But the end of the nightmare
is in sight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was helping and comforting 3,000 people who had no
other place to go but this gym. On Wednesday, there were 300. A
good sign, he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids and I did some brainstorming after the Northridge
Earthquake, and we came up with the idea of collecting pennies to
help the kids at Danube. We raised over $3,800 in pennies from
people in town, plus boxes of books, crayons and games for the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, each of our kids picked out one child from Danube and
sent them a card telling them to be brave,'' the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't enough, in March 1994, Scarborough and a
couple of his students flew to California to present Danube with a
friendship quilt from all the kids of Stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Enzer walked by that quilt hanging on the school's
library wall last week, anxious to tell her staff what she had just
heard on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   People were being plucked off roof tops and out of trees in
Tarboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to tell them; they already knew,'' Enzer said.
``We all agreed we had to do something fast.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the kids at Danube in 1994 is there now, so the parents
of the current pupils didn't know of the generosity and concern
Tarboro had shown for their school after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Enzer immediately had a letter explaining the special friendship
sent out to every parent. Then, she got on the phone trying to
track down Ed Scarborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was horrible, worse than anyone could imagine,''
Enzer said. ``Caskets were floating down the streets, and the
stench from dead animals was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough said two schools were destroyed, and a lot of the
high school was gone. His school, Stocks, was damaged, but should
be OK. With some luck, maybe even the friendship quilt the kids
from Danube had made for them to say thanks had survived.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather doesn't get any worse, they were hoping to have
the kids back in school next Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a blessing in all this, it's that the community
will be stronger for it,'' Scarborough said. ``Blacks, whites and
Hispanics havebeen pulling together, and we're all a lot closer
now for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enzer told her friend to hang in there, that Danube would be
sending Stocks as much money as her school could raise _ so far a
little more than $1,000 _ along with a care package of school and
coloring books.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Danube was doing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Enzer was meeting with parents to coordinate the fund
raising, students like Michelle Pearson, 10, and David Bentley, 9,
were talking to their classmates about how the Stocks kids had
helped their school after the earthquake, and now it was their
turn.
</P>
<P>
   He was only 4 in 1994, David said, but he remembers how scared
he was when the ground shook and all the adults were running around
with fear in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the kids in Tarboro are scared now, too, and maybe the
cards his classmates are sending _ telling them to be brave _ will
help.
</P>
<P>
   But, it's money more than anything the adults in Tarboro need
now, Scarborough said. ``Over 2,000 families who didn't have much
to begin with have had their homes destroyed by the floods just in
our county,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in donating should send it to Danube Avenue
Elementary School, 11220 Danube Ave., Granada Hills, CA 91344.
Checks should be made out to the Danube Ave. Student Body
Fund-Tarboro.

DID CANDLESTICK GET A BUM RAP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Candlestick Park is the victim of some kind of
double standard, if you really think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The world is full of forbidding landscapes, extreme weather and
natural disasters. But among them, only the San Francisco Giants'
ballpark on Candlestick Point is ridiculed the way it has been for
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fair?
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park is approximately as cold as the South Pole. Yet
while travelers are advised to stay away from Candlestick, the
South Pole gets written up in National Geographic as a worthy
destination for adventurers. Any bright schoolchild can tell you
that Roald Amundsen was the first man to reach the South Pole, but
can anybody name the first baseball fan to brave Candlestick?
</P>
<P>
   Is this justice?
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park is just as windy as the typical East Coast
hurricane. Yet whereas anchormen routinely put on heavy-weather
gear and drag camera crews to Florida or a Carolina for
live-from-the-scene reports, they almost never show up on the
Candlestick pitching mound when the cyclones hit there. Candlestick
is tagged with an obscene epithet by ballplayers (it rhymes with
``the Stick''), so why is the hurricane awarded an attractive
moniker (Ann, Bobby, Charlene)?
</P>
<P>
   Is this equality?
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park is as inhospitable as Death Valley. Yet while
Candlestick is renamed 3Com Park under a sponsorship agreement,
nobody thinks to cheapen Death Valley by rechristening it
Bristol-Myers Squibb Valley.
</P>
<P>
   You're reading and hearing a lot about Candlestick this week as
the stadium winds down to its final baseball game this afternoon
between the Giants and Dodgers. Some people say it has been the
all-time worst place to play and the Giants should be thrilled to
open their new park next spring. Others say it wasn't that bad and
this is a sad day.
</P>
<P>
   I take a third position: Candlestick was special because it
provided major-leaguers with challenges they wouldn't otherwise
have faced. Do swimmers complain that the English Channel is too
wet?
</P>
<P>
   Players get used to fly balls making strange bounces off the
walls at Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. Candlestick simply took
that to the next level: Balls make strange bounces in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anybody share my sunny view of Candlestick?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to play here,'' said Barry Bonds, who has won an MVP
Award and four Gold Gloves in left field for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Barry has fond memories of hanging around the clubhouse when his
father Bobby was playing for the Giants. He played catch with
Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't change the ballpark, I'd still be proud to play
for the Giants,'' Barry said, looking out from the first-base
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the spirit I hoped to find at Candlestick
before an August night game against the Montreal Expos _ some fond
farewells among the general feeling of good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God they are (moving), though,'' Bonds added.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Javier, the ex-Dodger who played most of four seasons for
the Giants before a late-summer trade to Houston, was pulling up
his socks in the Candlestick clubhouse. In his locker hung a
jersey, a black long-sleeve undershirt and a thermal undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   Javier is not one of those players who wore thermal leggings at
Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   He said that unlike some Giants who plainly hated Candlestick,
he had mixed feelings about the upcoming move.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is one of the best places to hit,'' Javier said
</P>
<P>
   Why? Good lighting? A solid background for viewing pitches?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place you can hit four fly balls and get two
hits,'' Javier said with a grin. ``I thought right field was tough.
Then I played left field. Barry Bonds should win the Gold Glove
every year for playing in left field here.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier summed up his attitude about the demise of Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed playing here,'' he said. ``Of course, I'd enjoy
playing anywhere. I'd play in a parking lot. ''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Giants marketing department began to poke fun
at its own ballpark in ads, and devised a perversely successful
promotion that awarded a pin called ``the Croix de Candlestick'' to
fans who stayed to the end of extra-inning night games. At the same
time, Giants general manager Al Rosen urged players to turn the
Candlestick conditions into ``the ultimate home-field advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It united everybody,'' said Mike Krukow, a Giants pitcher of
that era and now a Giants broadcaster. ``It gave everybody
something to (complain) about.''
</P>
<P>
   Krukow stood near the dugout one afternoon in August, watching
the center-field flags swirling in the wind and Charlie Hayes
taking batting practice wearing a wool hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys' initial reaction is, `What a miserable place to
play baseball,' '' Krukow said.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Mike, put those critics in their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the best place in the world to pitch,'' Krukow said.
``Simply because it's the worst place in the world to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Krukow referred to the wind in the hitter's face (some think
Mays could have hit 800 home runs playing elsewhere), the dust in
his contact lenses, his stinging hands.
</P>
<P>
   Krukow was asked if, in the fullness of time, players who curse
the old park might come to think more fondly off it, to cherish the
obstacles it presented, to even laugh about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   He thought for one tenth of a second and then neatly capsulized
the prevailing attitude about Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''

MAVS TRADE ANSTEY TO BULLS FOR 2000 2ND-ROUND PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Once dubbed ``the best running big man in the NBA'' by
Mavericks coach Don Nelson, Chris Anstey will now be running with
the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson traded Anstey to the Bulls yesterday for Chicago's
second-round draft choice in 2000. Because the Mavericks are
crowded at center with Shawn Bradley, Sean Rooks and John ``Hot
Rod'' Williams, and at power forward with Gary Trent, Dirk Nowitzki
and possibly rookie Leon Smith, Nelson said playing time was not
available for Anstey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Anstey will be a free agent after this season, and
Nelson already said he wasn't going to offer the 7-footer from
Australia a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for Chris to get some much-needed
consistent playing time,'' Nelson said. ``We like Chris very much
and think he can be in this league for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, at the present time we have no playing time for him.
With the acquisition of Sean Rooks and having Hot Rod Williams as
backup centers, we don't anticipate any time available for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Anstey averaged a mere 3.3 points, 2.4 rebounds and
11.5 minutes per game. As a rookie, he averaged 5.9 points, 3.8
rebounds and 16.6 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   Anstey plans on putting his past struggles behind him as he goes
to a Bulls team that is a mere shell of their former selves. He
talked to fellow Australian and former Bulls center Luc Longley _
he now plays for the Phoenix Suns _ about his days in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for me to come and be part of a team
that's rebuilding,'' Anstey said. ``I spoke to Luc, and just from
talking with people involved with the program, it's really a
professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to developing my game in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey's departure means the Mavericks only have a second-round
pick to show for two recent first-round draft picks. Samaki Walker,
the team's first-round pick in 1996, signed a free-agent contract
last month with the world champion San Antonio Spurs, and the
Mavericks got nothing in return. Anstey was obtained in a swap of
first-round picks at the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Anstey's departure also means the Mavericks are searching for a
power forward. Either Ben Davis, Kebu Stewart or Zendon Hamilton _
all free agents _ could wind up making the final roster.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Anstey will be competing against Will Perdue, rookie
Lari Ketner and journeyman Brett Robisch for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Chris as a young player with size and speed,'' Bulls
general manager Jerry Krause said. ``He's a good shooter, and
someone who likes to compete. Those qualities will put him in the
mix to earn a roster spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey is slated to make $1.1 million this season.
\Nsubheds:Briefly The three-year contract rookie Leon Smith plans
to sign next week shapes up like this: Smith will be paid $450,000
this season, $480,000 next season and $517,000 during the 2001-2002
season.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash returned to the court yesterday after
suffering a sprained right ankle in a pickup game last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sasser, a Dallas Kimball High School and Texas Tech
product, decided yesterday to add his name to the Mavericks'
training camp roster.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadening its legal case to try to take over the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the administration of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani on Wednesday accused the museum of violating its lease and
state law by conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value
of the private art collection featured in a controversial
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation was the latest effort by the city to show that
the museum's board was misusing a public building and public funds.
Senior City Hall officials vowed on Wednesday to use the charge as
part of a lawsuit to be filed in State Supreme Court in which they
will seek to foreclose on the museum and take control of its board.
</P>
<P>
   The new allegation accuses the museum of conspiring with
Christie's auction house, a sponsor of the show, to inflate the
value of the artworks to be displayed, which are all privately
owned by Charles Saatchi, the British advertising executive. The
city officials said they would not try to stop the opening of the
exhibition on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said they were preparing for a tough legal battle
on two fronts. On Tuesday, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal
court accusing Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to cut off the museum's city financing, which is about
$7.2 million this year, about one-third of its total budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Joseph
J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, accused the museum of ``hucksterism'' and
of perpetrating a ``scam'' by conspiring with Christie's to enrich
Saatchi by inflating the value of his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota accused Christie's of planning to profit from the
controversy surrounding the show. ``I guarantee you,'' he said,
``immediately following this exhibition, Christie's will have an
auction wherein the artwork that is being proposed to be shown at
the Brooklyn Museum will be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's swiftly rebutted the allegations. ``We are aware of
these bewildering accusations,'' the auction house said in a
statement. ``They have absolutely no substance, are not true.
Christie's has a long history of sponsorships of exhibitions in the
United States and internationally. Nothing in this exhibition is
for sale, nor is their any expectation for any of the works from
the exhibition to be sold by Christie's.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, too, rejected the allegations and characterized them
as a bizarre attempt by the administration to quash the museum
show, called ``Sensation,'' which Giuliani has denounced as
``disgusting'' and offensive to Catholics because it includes a
painting of the Virgin Mary surrounded by elephant dung and
pornographic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Wednesday night
to raise money for his prospective campaign for U.S. Senate, called
the allegations against the museum ``an important issue to
examine.'' But he told reporters that his main objection was the
use of taxpayer money for the show and that the museum had not
sought his permission for it under the terms of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani away, officials at City Hall were clearly seeking
to retake the offensive in the museum dispute. The administration
had been on the defensive since late Tuesday, when the museum
abandoned its efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations
with City Hall and announced that the show would go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that every day, the city comes up with a new
pretextual claim,'' said Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer
who is representing the museum in its federal suit against the
city. ``Now they have come up with another argument. Each and every
one of them is nothing more or less than further pretext in an
effort to punish the museum for the exercise of its First Amendment
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has also argued that under the terms of the museum's
lease, which dates back to 1893, it should have sought the mayor's
permission to deny access to the show to children without an adult
companion. The museum has since agreed to admit children but the
mayor has maintained that the exhibition is improper.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, through a spokesman, issued a statement calling the
city's accusations ``preposterous and misleading.'' It said, ``The
mayor's latest charge simply reflects the depths to which he will
go to undermine the First Amendment.'' The spokesman, Fred
Schroeder, said Christie's financial contribution to the show
represented a small fraction of its total cost.
</P>
<P>
   In making the allegations of conspiracy, city officials
capitalized on news reports that noted the dual role of Christie's,
which is a promoter and financial supporter of the exhibition as
well as a purveyor of artwork belonging to Saatchi, who is a major
collector and an important client. Christie's also supported an
installation of the exhibition at the Royal Academy in London.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts of interest, some museums do not exhibit
private collections unless they have been promised to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scam, and taxpayers' dollars should not be used to
support that,'' Hess, the corporation counsel, said at Wednesday's
news conference. ``Taxpayers' dollars should be used for educating
children, for building roads, for supporting the homeless, not for
pushing up the value of a private art collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said the city would pursue ``a variety of goals'' in its
lawsuit, which will be filed in either Brooklyn or Manhattan. ``We
will be asking for numerous remedies, including their funding will
be cut off and they should vacate the premises because their lease
has been breached and their lease is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual courtroom wrangling is expected to begin sometime
after Friday when the museum is supposed to receive its city
stipend for October _ a check for $497,554 that the mayor's office
has said will most certainly not be in the mail. While the mayor
can hold up the check, by law the City Council has final authority
over spending and the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Once the check is withheld, the museum is expected to ask Judge
Nina Gershon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who has been
assigned the case, to order the city to make the payment. The
speaker of the City Council, Peter Vallone, said on Wednesday that
legislators would support the museum's effort to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy reached as far as Capitol Hill yesterday, when
the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution sponsored by a
conservative senator, Bob Smith from New Hampshire, who recently
left the Republican Party. The resolution calls for an end to
federal financing for the Brooklyn Museum unless the exhibit is
immediately canceled. The measure, which passed on a voice vote,
has no bearing on federal spending.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the museum yesterday, workers were racing to finish
preparations for the exhibition, about 90 pieces of contemporary
art from a crop of young British artists. Silk-screen artists were
completing labels for the pieces while electricians put the final
touches on the lighting and senior museum officials were
considering adding more security officers and surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was out of their concern over possible attempts to
vandalize some of the artwork, as happened when the exhibition was
first shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what is possible,'' Arnold Lehman, director
of the museum, said. ``Our phones are ringing off the hook, and
everyone is saying, `We'll be there, we'll be there.'''

STARS NOT SURE THEY WANT A MR. NICE GUY IN BELFOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Two words from Stars jester/forward Brian
Skrudland brought goalie Ed Belfour to a halt after a recent
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Eddie,'' he bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour paused, cautiously turning to face Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you aren't practicing like you play?'' Skrudland
asked. ``There were guys in the crease and you didn't hit them over
the melon like you usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   A second, maybe less, of awkward silence followed before being
shattered by a long, deep laugh. Belfour, chuckling like a child,
then turned and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses swore he had a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing? Joking? Smiling? OK, who is this guy and what has he
done with Belfour?
</P>
<P>
   He's Belfour all right, post-Stanley Cup Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just normal,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, sounding a
bit concerned. Normal and Belfour were long thought to be
contradictory terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he still stop the puck and be a normal guy? I don't
know,'' Hitchcock continued. ``What do they call that? A young
Frankenstein? Does he have to go back to being abnormal again to be
good?''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   His answer to Hitchcock's theory, like most answers on this day,
begins and ends with a single word: ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I supposed to know how I am going to be? I've never won
a Stanley Cup before,'' Belfour said. ``We'll have to see, won't
we?''
</P>
<P>
   Preseason results were affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   His usual I-have-on-my-game-face-four-days-in-advance demeanor
has changed. His just-try-and-slip-a-puck-past-me Stanley Cup
performances haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he smiles a little more,'' Skrudland said when asked to
compare Belfour '98 to Belfour '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Belfour conceded, evidence bursting onto his face in
the form of another smile. He can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   As last season ended, so this season begins.
</P>
<P>
   When we last saw Belfour, he was a happy-go-lucky goalie running
around Reunion Arena, bowing to the crowd and just being an
all-around emotional guy. He had that long elusive Stanley Cup in
his grasp, and he wasn't looking to let go. He had finally achieved
a goal many critics said would always elude him and reveling was in
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he got here, he had a lot of pressure on his back and
that weighed a lot on his shoulders. He had a lot of pressure to
win a Cup,'' Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez said. ``So, I
think he's a lot more relaxed since he proved everybody wrong and
that he fits in that No. 1 category.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over Dominik Hasek, Martin Brodeur and Patrick Roy, you
have company.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour proved he's not just a good regular-season goalie (a
35-15-9 record, a 1.99 goals-against average and a .915 save
percentage last season); he proved he's also a good postseason
goalie, (a 16-7 record, a 1.67 goals-against average and .930 save
percentage last season.)
</P>
<P>
   Heck, if it wouldn't have been for Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk
doing that Wayne Gretzky impersonation through the Stars' Stanley
Cup run, Belfour might have won the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to
the playoff MVP.
</P>
<P>
   So, deal with it. Belfour's happy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Stars aren't happy for him. They just aren't
sure what to make of the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you have success, you get so happy, happy, you
forget to perform and that's the challenge Eddie has,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He's reached a goal that he's set for himself. Now, some
people reach that and they just say, `That's it,' and they can't
focus for the rest of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that a lot, but I've also seen people get into a
zone and never leave it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is talking about the Haseks and the Brodeurs and the
Roys of the world. He considers Belfour in that category or, at
least, capable of getting into that zone. Hitchcock still isn't
used to the Belfour who is capable of having a conversation at 9:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' Hitchcock said, ``at 9:30 in the
morning having a conversation with Ed is not normal. He was already
in the routine, in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said he's just not a morning person.
</P>
<P>
   And since Hitchcock brought it up, Belfour said he'd like to
suggest evening practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 4 p.m.,'' Belfour said. ``Yeah, suggest that to Hitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's chuckling again, a big, fat smile creasing his face
despite his best efforts to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the new, improved Ed Belfour here to stay?
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland, who sees a punch line in everything, has his own
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the first guy rolls along and parks in his crease,
Ed Belfour No. 20 will be back in his Eagle-has-landed mask,''
Skrudland said. ``You've always heard these goaltenders are a
little cuckoo. Well, Ed Belfour is.''

DODGERS SEEK GRAZIANO SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The firing of Dodgers president and CEO Bob
Graziano is expected to signal a beginning rather than an end to
the changes in the nonbaseball front office of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   According to team officials, who asked to remain anonymous, the
finance, accounting, marketing and community-affairs departments
will be scrutinized as Fox Sports Enterprises president Rick Welts
searches for and names Graziano's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Welts said leadership was one of the reasons Graziano was
terminated. Among the reasons Welts listed for Graziano's dismissal
were the club's desires to become more immersed in the community
and its wanting to find more creative ways to produce revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Welts, who said he would not be the Dodgers' next president and
CEO, said he would use his contacts from his NBA days in his
search. He was the public-relations director for the Seattle
SuperSonics before joining David Stern's team in taking the NBA
from relative weakness to global supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nut on this idea of community service,'' Welts said.
``Also, it's got to be someone who has to be a sports fan. Sports
is like that. It's not like selling pasta or automobiles.''

   Welts said he had a list of six candidates, though the interview
process is yet to begin. He a~f\wtU|

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If the Astros are fortunate enough to reach the playoffs for the
third year in a row, they should remember the elements of
Wednesday's game and do their best to duplicate them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Hampton delivered one of the biggest pitching performances
of his career and Daryle Ward chimed in with what undoubtedly is
the highlight of his brief career in the Astros' 4-1 victory over
the Cincinnati Reds before a playoff-caliber crowd of 52,242 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros avoided a sweep in the two-game series and moved back
into a tie with the Reds atop the National League Central Division.
The victory cut the Astros' magic number to clinch the division
title to four, and to clinch a playoff berth to three.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was a playoff atmosphere at the Dome, the Astros
were everything they usually are not in games of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a big game from their starting pitcher, and Hampton
answered the call. They needed to simply put the ball in play in
crucial situations, and Ken Caminiti was there, driving in two runs
without a hit.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to drive a dagger into the hearts of their
opponents, and Ward all but did it himself with a two-run homer
that gave the Astros a lead they never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another game that could have gone either way, the Reds
didn't make many mistakes. But when they did misfire, the Astros
seized the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A critical throwing error by Reds shortstop Barry Larkin paved
the way for the Astros to score three unearned runs in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the other team makes a mistake, you have to take
advantage of it,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``That's
what we haven't done when we've been in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also avoided losing ground in the wild-card race to
the Mets, who snapped a seven-game losing streak by beating the
Atlanta Braves 9-2. The Mets remain 1{ games behind the Astros and
Reds in the wild-card sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker's team is off today and will host Los
Angeles over the weekend, while the Reds travel to Milwaukee for a
weekend series against the Brewers. The Mets host Atlanta tonight
and Pittsburgh over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds would seem to have an easier weekend draw than the
Astros, but it won't matter if the Mets don't finish strong. Then
again, most of the Astros don't seem to be interested in
scoreboard-watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about the Mets,'' said Astros center fielder
Carl Everett, a former Met. ``I hate the Mets. I hope they lose
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros aren't likely to lose many games when Hampton pitches
the way he did Wednesday. After one mediocre outing and another
that was downright bad, Hampton rediscovered the form that has
earned him a spot in the upper echelon of major-league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (21-4) held the Reds to seven hits in eight innings to
earn his 21st victory, tying Joe Niekro's franchise record. He
punctuated his outing with a rare outburst of emotion after
striking out pinch hitter Dmitri Young to end the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big one,'' said Hampton, who also was 2-for-3 to
raise his batting average to .310. ``I'm not going to downplay how
big it was. We needed this one. I don't usually show a lot of
emotion out there, but it was late in the game, and I needed to
shut the door and not let any cheap runs in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's teammates got a kick out of his Jose Lima-type
reaction, and at least one wondered if there was another reason for
Hampton's joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was really excited because Pappasitos had, `Go get
'em, Bulldog!' on the marquee,'' Bagwell kidded.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched a scoreless ninth inning to earn his 38th
save of the season and the 100th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better than this,'' Wagner said of
Wednesday's atmosphere. ``This is just the type of environment we
need to get prepared for the playoffs. This was a great game for
the fans and a great win for us. We needed this win to give us some
motivation and let us know that we can get back in it and still win
the Central Division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 80-0 when leading after eight innings, the only
undefeated team in the majors in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   For three innings, it appeared the Reds would use good pitching
and solid defense to foil every opportunity the Astros had for the
second day in a row. But suddenly, the Reds' airtight defense
sprung a leak in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell reached on a rare error by Larkin, whose glove saved at
least two runs in the series. Larkin's .979 fielding percentage is
third-best among starting NL shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball didn't slip, I didn't trip, and the turf didn't bite
me,'' Larkin said. ``I just threw it high. I'm human.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti drove home Bagwell with a ground ball that would have
been the third out if not for Larkin's error. And Ward, the next
batter, smashed a two-run homer off Reds starter Steve Parris
(11-3) into the Coca-Cola Club just beyond the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was so pumped up, he didn't remember hearing the roar of
the crowd as he rounded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask someone what it was like,'' the rookie left
fielder said. ``To be honest with you, I don't even know what kind
of pitch I hit. I just know that it was something straight and that
I was trying to shorten my swing and try to make contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for someone to do something big. Anyone in
our lineup could have done it. I was just fortunate to be in that
position. Hopefully, we can keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokey Reese's RBI single in the sixth provided the only Reds
run. The Astros reclaimed a three-run lead on Caminiti's sacrifice
fly in the bottom of the inning.

UCLA GOES WITH SCRIPTED PERFORMANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On second-and-9, UCLA quarterback Cory Paus
retreated from center and saw Fresno State's blitzers charging
toward him. Paus looked left, to receiver Freddie Mitchell, and saw
no opening. Then he looked to receiver Brad Melsby over the middle
_ and wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby had started on the right side, ran toward the middle,
then cut back to the right, almost parallel to the line of
scrimmage. Paus threw a strike, and Melsby raced 24 yards for a
touchdown to give UCLA a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect play for the situation. A play specifically
designed to counteract Fresno State's blitz. A play that Paus
executes well. And a play that, through a process known as
scripting, was called long before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Scripting is the art of selecting plays (and their order)
several days before the game. It was popularized by former San
Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh in the early 1980s; it's used
throughout the NCAA and NFL and in some high schools. Because
scripting enables teams to rehearse in the comfort of practice, it
makes offenses more effective during games. There's far less chaos
after kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   `It's made it easier for coaches to call plays early in the
game, because you take the emotion out of it,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``I've seen coaches start games and say, `OK, what
play are we going to run?'
</P>
<P>
   ``As a signal caller, it gets you into the flow of the game. You
know what you want to do. Your coaches know what you want to do,
and the players know.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Texas A&AMP;M (where Toledo was the offensive coordinator for
five years), one year we scored on our first drive of the game in
nine games, and a lot of that was because we scripted what we
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scripting is remarkably complex. Each Wednesday evening or
Thursday morning, Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges select
the first 10 or 20 plays, in specific order, for the upcoming game.
The selections are based upon consultations with the offensive
staff, evaluation of the opponent and UCLA's personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Once an agreement is reached, Borges returns to his office and
creates two lists. One details the scripted first- and second-down
plays. The other includes plays to run on third-and-short,
third-and-long, red zone (inside the opponent's 20 yard line) and
goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins follow the master script until they come to
third-and-long, for instance. Then they jump to the secondary list
and call the first scripted play for third-and-long. Borges has one
deadline: He must have the script ready for Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that every play the Bruins run early in the game
has been carefully rehearsed _ and, if necessary, tweaked _ several
days before the game. Substitution patterns are also rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think scripting has made it a better game,'' Borges said.
``Walsh was a big believer in beating the other team to the punch.
If you have a nice opening series and use plays that are
attack-oriented, you've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outscored opponents 125-71 in the first quarter last
year. Using scripted plays, they hammered Texas for 21 points in
the first quarter of the season opener. This year, scripted plays
resulted in the impressive first-quarter scoring drives at Ohio
State, when the Bruins took a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Borges and Toledo often use plays to set up other plays, and
scripting establishes a foundation on which to build later in the
game. For instance, the biggest play of the 1998 season _ a 64-yard
touchdown pass from Cade McNown to Danny Farmer that broke open the
crucial victory at Arizona _ was an offshoot of two similar plays
run earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   There are other benefits to scripting:
</P>
<P>
   _It increases the quarterback's comfort level. Paus, a freshman,
must deal with the crowd and the pressure and the defense. Why add
to his load? Rehearsing plays is like studying for an exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a lot easier,'' Paus said. ``Coach Borges tries to
script the worst-case scenarios. Most of the time it's not that
hard in the game, so it seems easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, you know the first 10 plays before the game starts, so
you can think about them and be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   _Scripting guarantees specific plays will be called and certain
players will get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way,'' Borges said, ``you don't sit down Sunday and say,
`We never ran that play,' or, `We never go this guy the ball
against that defense.'''
</P>
<P>
   _Scripting lets coaches test defenses and evaluate their
responses. Many teams, including UCLA, keep a running chart of what
works and doesn't work. Often, they'll return to successful plays
in the second quarter or second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a play comes up, you just dial it up,'' Arizona State
coach Bruce Snyder said. ``When you script, it frees everybody up
to really look at the defenses and not worry about the play.''
</P>
<P>
   _Scripting eliminates capricious playcalling and forces teams to
implement its gameplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Boise State, we planned to run (tailback) DeShaun
(Foster),'' Borges said. ``It wasn't working as well as we wanted
it to, but because it was scripted into the gameplan, we were
locked into it. We didn't run him once and decide it wasn't
working.''
</P>
<P>
   _It's one of the few offensive innovations that defenses cannot
counteract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you scripted the eighth play to be a nickel defense, and
all of a sudden it's third-and-1 and there are three tight ends in
the game, the defense is in trouble,'' defensive coordinator Bob
Field said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scripting really makes a defense be on its toes, because the
offense can throw everything at you. It's amazing on those early
drives how many teams gain chunks of yards. It's really made it
harder to play good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the way Walsh scripted it.

LAKERS GET SALLEY, BENJAMIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Typecast as young and brash, the Los Angeles
Lakers are aging rapidly with their latest offseason acquisitions.
On Wednesday, they reached into the past to grab 35-year-old John
Salley and 34-year-old Benoit Benjamin _ a reflection of their
desperate need for big men.
</P>
<P>
   Salley hasn't played since 1996. Benjamin, a Clippers draftee in
1985 and a bust with the Lakers in 1993, has played with eight
teams in a spotty career and played just six games for the
Philadelphia 76ers last season.
</P>
<P>
   That both will be in training camp next week is attributable
more to the Lakers' thin frontcourt than anything else. But the
team is hopeful the pair can contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told both these guys, there's an incredible chance for a
big man to make this team,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak said.
``If they can't, we'll figure something out.... Right now, this is
the best we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both received one-year contracts requiring them to make the team
to earn the bulk of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also signed rookie Melvin Levett, acquired in the
Derek Harper trade, and they continue to pursue a veteran point
guard, with Ron Harper and Brian Shaw among the targets.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson wants to bring 18 players to camp. Sixteen
are now under contract, not counting first-round pick Devean
George.
</P>
<P>
   With only four big men guaranteed roster spots, the 6-11 Salley
and 7-0 Benjamin have a legitimate opportunity to win a job. The
Lakers have been scouting them for weeks and saw enough to roll the
dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if one of them (made the team),''
Kupchak said. ``Short and simple, Benoit looks good. We've had
Benoit before, we know him, he knows what he has to do. We're
talking about a one-year deal and he's certainly going to have to

John Salley is the same way. He desperately wants to play. He came
to us and really encouraged us to come watch him play.''

EDITORIAL: THE NEW POLITICS OF HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has proposed a bold and expansive plan to make
health insurance available to all Americans. Its details and
sizable cost _ roughly $65 billion a year to be financed by the
non-Social Security surplus _ will certainly provoke debate from
all quarters, and that is a splendid development for the 45 million
Americans who lack health insurance. Bradley and Vice President Al
Gore, who proposed a more modest health plan earlier this month,
have now made access to health care a central issue of their fight
for the Democratic nomination. By elevating the issue in their
party, these two Democrats make it harder for the Republican
presidential candidates to avoid engaging the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says his voluntary plan would be able to cover 95
percent of all uninsured people, making it the most ambitious
program since President Clinton's 1993 health initiative. But at
least in outline, the Bradley plan is politically smarter. It would
not set up a new bureaucracy to manage the medical marketplace, and
it would let consumers rely on existing private or government
insurance plans. The chairman of the Republican National Committee,
Jim Nicholson, said the Bradley plan would lead to ``higher
taxes,'' and the burden is on Bradley to show that his subsidies
for insuring the poor are fiscally manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Many details have yet to be worked out. It is unclear, for
example, whether the proposed amount of premium subsidies for the
uninsured would be sufficient to provide adequate health benefit
packages or how medical costs would be contained. But in its
architecture, the Bradley plan would reach many more people than
the plan offered by Gore, and the impact on the contest between
them was instantaneous. After months of ignoring Bradley, the vice
president yesterday called for a series of debates. We suggest that
they make health care the subject of their first meeting. The
challenge to Gore would be to go beyond his worthy, but narrow
proposal to cover low-income children. The challenge to Bradley
would be to defend both the cost and practicality of his approach.
The challenge for the Republicans, of course, is to get into the
discussion that with Bradley's embracing proposal bids once again
to be a dominating issue in another national election.

IRL'S FINALE AT TMS IS WORTH PRICE OF ADMISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The identity of its 1999 driving champion will not be the only
thing we learn about the Pep Boys Indy Racing League at Texas Motor
Speedway next month.
</P>
<P>
   The season finale in Fort Worth on Oct. 17 also will tell us if
anybody really cares about founder Tony George's go-it-alone IRL.
</P>
<P>
   An honest, any-one-of-six-drivers-can-win-this-thing
championship will unfold here in a couple of weekends. For a real
racing fan, that is worth the price of a ticket to the recently
renamed Mall.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the points pack is Texan Greg Ray, who, if not the
official poster boy of the IRL, at least qualifies for that tag at
TMS. The chance to see a driver from Plano win the title of a major
racing series also is worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the driver closest to Ray, reigning series champion
Kenny Brack, is attempting to nail down a second consecutive title
for legendary car owner A.J. Foyt of Houston. And if you believe
the rumor mill, the title would be Brack's going-away gift before
he heads to Bobby Rahal's Championship Auto Racing Teams franchise
for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   So, there are plenty of legitimate story lines to peddle here.
Certainly more than even Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice
president and general manager, envisioned when he pleaded with
George and IRL executive director Leo Mehl to move the season
finale from Las Vegas Motor Speedway to North Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage promised that TMS would promote the IRL finale in a
manner similar to the way the management of its sister track,
Atlanta Motor Speedway, annually hypes the NASCAR Winston Cup
season-ender in November. That may have been especially necessary
had Ray locked up the title at LVMS on Sunday. But Ray's 21st-place
finish after a bumping incident with Mark Dismore reduced the
Texan's lead from 44 points to 13 over Brack, who replaced Scott
Goodyear in the runner-up spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a Sunday morning where Alan Kulwicki started out in
third place, and at the end of the day he was first,'' said
Gossage, referring to Kulwicki's magical path past Davey Allison
and Bill Elliott to the 1992 Cup title. ``That was a great story.
That's what you want, great stories. I have my own selfish reasons
for wanting Greg to win the championship. But for us, just the fact
that the big confrontation comes down here, that's what we've been
wanting since we tried to convince the IRL it should be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's results reshuffled the standings and set up a finale in
which each point available from qualifying through checkered flag
looms as precious to Ray, Brack, Sam Schmidt, Scott Sharp, Goodyear
and Buddy Lazier.
</P>
<P>
   This event should be self-promoting, as it most certainly would
if a similar points chase existed in the Cup series heading into
Atlanta on Nov. 21. Beginning with the 120,000 who attended the
inaugural IRL night race at TMS in June 1997, Texas Motor Speedway
consistently has produced the series' best attended events outside
of the famed Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for the Longhorn 500 on June 12 was announced at
85,000. But even with all that this event would seem to have going
for it, Gossage is taking a conservative approach to the turnstile
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the \RIRL\S attendance has sorted itself out,''
Gossage said. ``I think we're going to have 65,000 on the low side
to 85,000 on the high side for this race. Is that a number to be
ashamed of? Absolutely not. I'm not worried about our attendance or
ashamed of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, neither is George, who on Sunday announced that the
IRL had put to rest the notion of any sort of reconciliation or
merger with the rival CART FedEx Series through the 2004 season.
George said the four-year-old IRL plans to soldier on under its
rules and regulations, and with the drivers it has been
cultivating.
</P>
<P>
   One of six of them will win the IRL championship in Fort Worth
on Oct. 17, in a race that also will tell us if anybody really
cares.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON... Teen girl could create IRL history next month
It's late September and 18-year-old Sarah Fisher really should be
back in school.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, at Ohio State University, where Fisher has been
accepted and plans to study mechanical engineering one of these
semesters. But the chance to compete at Texas Motor Speedway has
prompted the recent high school graduate to delay her formal
education in favor of a cram course in Indy Racing League 101.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is scheduled to attempt to qualify for her first Pep Boys
IRL race, the Mall.com 500, at TMS next month. If Fisher earns a
spot in the 26-car field, she will be the youngest driver to make a
start in the four-year-old series _ and possibly any Indy-car
event.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher turns 19 on Oct. 4. The youngest driver to start an
Indy-car event was Michel Jourdain Jr., who was 99 days short of
his 20th birthday (Sept. 20) when he started the 1996 Indianapolis
500 in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this since I was 5,'' Fisher said before a
scheduled practice session Tuesday evening with teammate Robby
Unser at TMS. ``That's a good 13 years of practice. And being a
girl _ even though I don't like to highlight that _ I've gotten a
lot of attention. That's given me practice to keep my cool. And
just stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was all of that during her IRL rookie test at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway on Sept. 1. Driving for team owner Dale Pelfrey,
Fisher aced the session in 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only stalled the car once, and it wasn't when I took off for
the first time,'' said Fisher, a resident of the farm community of
Commercial Point, Ohio. ``It just seemed to all click.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's background sounds similar to those of reigning NASCAR
Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon and former IRL champion and
current Cup rookie sensation Tony Stewart. She started in Quarter
Midgets at age 5, moved to Karts at 8, and made the huge jump to
410 Sprint Cars. She competed in selected Pennzoil World of Outlaws
and All-Star Circuit of Champions events before graduating into
U.S. Auto Club Midgets this season.
</P>
<P>
   After 21 races, including a Midget feature victory at the
lightning-fast Winchester (Ind.) Speedway, Pelfrey approached her
about an IRL ride. And student life as a Buckeye was put on hold
until January.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher would not be the first woman to compete in the IRL, a
distinction that belongs to savvy Lyn St. James.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is not to be a `girl driver,' it's to be another
competitor,'' said Fisher, whose father, Dave, campaigned Sprint
Cars throughout the Midwest. ``That is the attitude I've taken my
entire racing life. I think all the competitors and all the teams
respect me for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tend to blend in. At least I try to. I feel that I
should only be there on my talent _ as well as the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said her test at TMS was designed to familiarize her with
the No. 48 Mead Carbonless Paper Dallara/Aurora she plans to drive
on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about running here,'' Fisher said. ``I pulled
into the track \RMonday\S to see if my transporter was here and
went, `Yes! This is awesome!' ''
</P>

   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Evernham released NASCAR crew chief Ray
Evernham, who has guided Jeff Gordon to three Winston Cup
championships since 1995, was released from his contract with
Hendrick Motorsports yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham was contracted to Hendrick through the 2006 season, but
in recent weeks had decided he wanted to leave the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray let us know he had reached a point where he didn't want to
be a crew chief anymore,'' team owner Rick Hendrick told The
Associated Press. ``In response to that, we were planning to move
him up in the organization, but he decided he wanted to pursue
having a team of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Evernham won 47 races together during five-plus
seasons in the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   The team's new leader is Brian Whitesell, an engineer at
Hendrick Motorsports. Whitesell, 35, joined the team in 1992 and
became its engineer in 1994. He worked beside Evernham on race
days.
\Nsubheds:NHRA rings up `No sale' Rumors of Bruton Smith's desire
to purchase the National Hot Rod Association first surfaced during
the Winston Invitational all-star event at Smith's revamped Bristol
(Tenn.) Dragway in early July.
</P>
<P>
   John Force, the eight-time and reigning NHRA Funny Car champion,
said Smith's recent formal overtures _ and the NHRA's refusal to
sell _ are not an indication that Smith is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bruton does anything crazy. He's a powerful
guy,'' Force said yesterday. ``I know he wants to build a racetrack
\Rat Texas Motor Speedway\S. I made a statement \Rin July\S that
I'd follow Bruton Smith anywhere and got beat up by the NHRA on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Meyer, who owns exclusivity rights to NHRA national events
in this market, is looking to finalize a project that will relocate
his Texas Motorplex from Ennis to Grand Prairie for the 2001 drag
racing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Meyer has put a lot of time into Grand Prairie and I
want to see that thing go for him,'' Force said. ``I'm a drag
racer. I just want to see the sport grow in general.''
\Nsubheds:Kinser's lead dwindles When Mark Kinser embarked on the
Pennzoil World of Outlaws' recent West Coast swing, he had a
117-point lead and his second Knoxville Nationals title in his
pocket. Approximately two months later, Kinser's lead has dwindled
to 21 points and challenger Danny Lasoski is not giving him much
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Kinser recorded two ninth-place finishes in the Channellock Fall
Classic last weekend at Greenwood, Neb., while Lasoski finished
second both nights. That has been the case for the past 1 1/2
months, with Lasoski posting an average finish of 4.3. He has not
finished outside the top 10 in 17 races. Meanwhile, Kinser has put
up an average finish of 7.3.

</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht took over the Hylton-Blaney No. 93 Amoco Sprint Car in

BEATTY MAKES NO DECLARATION ON PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ In a discursive, sometimes impassioned
half-hour speech to the Hollywood A-list and liberal advocates,
Warren Beatty on Wednesday denounced the conservative drift of the
Democratic Party, the rise of corporate greed, the influence of
big-money campaign contributions, lingering poverty and social
injustice. And he suggested that he would ``keep talking'' about
them loud and long.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty did not come close to declaring his own candidacy for
president, as some of his supporters among the disaffected of both
major parties had hoped he might do.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself ``an old-time, unrepentent, bleeding-heart,
tax-and-spend'' liberal, Beatty said, ``We don't need a third
party, we need a second party.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty made his speech in accepting the annual Eleanor Roosevelt
Award of the Southern California chapter of Americans for
Democratic Action. Sometimes speaking off the cuff, with humorous
asides to his celebrity friends in the audience, and sometimes
rattling off reams of statistics about economic inequality, he
seemed by turns confident and fidgety.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty described both contenders for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, as
worthy men of high character. But he demanded, ``What is this
insurgency of a centrist against a centrist all about?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``What we're in danger of experiencing is a
slow-motion coup d'etat of big money's interest over the public
interest.''

EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR PATAKI'S ETHICS PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's two trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996 drew
criticism because they were underwritten by a private group, the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce, raising at least the
appearance of a conflict of interest. Now, according to two stories
by The Times' Clifford Levy, the potential conflicts were even
greater than originally thought. Much of the money that the chamber
lavished on the governor's travels apparently derived from big
donations it received from two major corporations, Philip Morris,
the world's largest cigarette maker, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the
pharmaceuticals conglomerate. The timing and size of their
donations suggest they may have been using the chamber as a conduit
to make gifts to the governor that would be illegal under state law
if made directly.
</P>
<P>
   The two trips, which spotlighted Pataki's Hungarian heritage,
were part trade mission, part family vacation. Pataki justified the
chamber's involvement by saying that the group had no business
before the state. Based on that premise, the State Ethics
Commission approved the trips. But because Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Philip Morris both have significant issues pending in Albany, the
ethics commission is mulling a new inquiry into whether the trips
violated the state's prohibition on gifts to public officials. The
commission's chairman, Paul Shechtman, was once Pataki's criminal
justice adviser. But political and personal loyalty should take a
back seat to the public's need for a thorough investigation. The
Temporary State Commission on Lobbying is also thought to be
interested in exploring the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Through spokesmen, Pataki has said he was unaware of Philip
Morris' involvement and declined to discuss Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Yet these companies have never been bashful about their lobbying.
Moreover, Philip Morris sent a senior lobbyist to attend a dinner
in Pataki's honor in Budapest in 1995, and Bristol-Myers Squibb
sent its chief Albany lobbyist on the 1996 trip.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pataki has routinely stonewalled questions about
his financing. In this case, he has refused to say how much the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce paid for the trips, nor has
he asked the chamber to disclose its finances. But the chamber
makes no secret of the fact that Philip Morris and Bristol-Myers
Squibb are two of its biggest donors. Now that it seems certain
that some of these donations helped underwrite the governor's
travels, the only honorable course is for Pataki to return the
chamber's money _ dipping into his own funds to cover at least the
vacation portion of the trips. The portion allocable to state
business can be paid by the government. Had Pataki financed his
trip this way in the first place, he could have avoided the charge
that he accepted backdoor gifts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The so-called victims' rights amendment slated for a vote today
in the Senate Judiciary Committee trifles with the Constitution. It
is also unnecessary. Just about everyone agrees that victims of
crime deserve sympathy and respectful treatment in the criminal
process, and most states and the attorney general are already
experimenting with various approaches to making the justice system
more sensitive to victims. But adding a wordy and complex amendment
to the Constitution could actually harm victims by interfering with
what is undeniably their foremost right _ the right to the fair
prosecution and conviction of the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Wilkinson, a leading member of the prosecution team in the
Oklahoma City bombing cases, made this point compellingly when she
testified last March before the committee. She noted that the
amendment alters the delicate balance between the accuser and
accused in ways inadequately explored by the committee. As a
result, it could well end up subverting just convictions by
watering down defendants' rights, fostering lengthy litigation that
delays trials, and torpedoing legitimate plea deals devised by
prosecutors to obtain testimony necessary to prove other, more
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   These are risks that lawmakers should not take lightly.
Respecting victims does not require disrespecting defendants'
rights or the Constitution.

GIANTS BEAT DODGERS, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers had this plan to start
Kevin Brown on three days rest to give him a shot at 20 wins, but
there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Brown needed three wins in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   It goes like this: The Dodgers had a plan. They thought it was a
good plan. But even with a handful of games left, they continue to
remind everyone they are the Dodgers, and thus, the plan won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for the first and only time in his career, Brown left
Candlestick Park with a loss. The Giants scored early and beat the
Dodgers 5-1 in their next-to-last game at the 40-year-old ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Stick's 40-year era ends today with the Dodgers and Giants
closing it out with an afternoon tilt followed by a two-hour
celebration, though it's open for debate whether they're
celebrating the past 40 years or knowing they'll never have to play
here again.
</P>
<P>
   The wind and cold of the ballpark played some eerie roles in the
Candlestick, making pop flies an adventure and adding the
unexpected almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the two hated rivals close out one of former
President Richard Nixon's favorite ballparks, the weather was
wondrous. It was merely the result that was unforeseen.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (18-9) dominated in his previous starts at
Candlestick/3Com Park. He was 5-0 with a 0.63 ERA in his first five
starts at the `Stick.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Brown dominated in the Bay Area, he owned the
Giants. In eight career starts he was 7-0 with a 0.78 ERA. It
included five complete games, three shutouts and a 1997 no-hitter
while he pitched with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He also came into the game 8-2 with a 1.69 ERA in his last 13
starts, and pitching better than anyone in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first inning against the Giants, Brown trailed
2-0. Bill Mueller reached first on a wild-pitch strike out and
Barry Bonds, two days away from arthroscopic surgery on his right
knee, homered to right .
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later the Giants eclipsed their number of runs they
scored off Brown in his five previous starts here. Mueller singled
with two outs, Bonds walked and Jeff Kent singled deep in the hole
to shortstop to load the bases. J.T. Snow then singled to right to
drive in a pair of runs and give the Giants a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' $105 million man allowed four runs on six hits in
his shortest outing since a no-decision Aug. 25 at Milwaukee. Brown
also struck out nine, his highest total since fanning 12 Cincinnati
Reds on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Brown could pitch in Houston, but after logging more than 250
innings for the second straight year, manager Davey Johnson said he
wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' loss could be Houston's win. Johnson said prior to
the game that if Brown lost, right-hander Robinson Checo would
start Sunday's game. The Astros may need that win to reach the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown's had a great year,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not going to
ruin that by bringing him back on three days rest when it doesn't
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's won 18 games in each of the last two seasons, but this
one is nothing like the 18-7 campaign he experienced in helping
rejuvenate baseball in San Diego last season. The Dodgers have been
out of the playoff race for three months.
</P>
<P>
   His only 20-win season came in 1992 when he went 21-11 with the
Texas Rangers.

PEDROZA, NEW VIEW IMPRESS AT SULTRY SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Alex Solis was hot on opening day of the Oak
Tree thoroughbred racing season at Santa Anita, riding a surprise
stakes winner and an impressive maiden-breaker. Martin Pedroza was
hotter, riding winners returning $40.40 and $80.40 to blow out the
pick-six bettors.
</P>
<P>
   But hottest of all was Santa Anita, and not only because the
late-summer heat registered 100 sweaty degrees Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita's controversial new management had a strong
afternoon as a smallish on-site crowd voiced overwhelming approval
for the landmark racetrack's $20 million facelift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact they didn't change everything, meaning the paddock
and the hillside (turf course), makes me happy,'' said Helen
Gardner, 77, of El Monte, in a typical fan response. ``So far I
like what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is Santa Anita chairman Frank Stronach, whose Magna
International bought the track in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of positive response all the way around,'' said
Stronach, who spent the day walking the grounds, altered with the
installation of elevator towers in the paddock-gardens area,
terraces in the trackside standing area and a drive-in
theater-style video screen in the infield. ``People can see we're
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach assumed the weather forecasts held down the attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some calls so we'd have no smog. I forgot to ask about
the temperature,'' the Austrian-born auto-components magnate joked.
``I do have good connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans watched an interesting if not high-quality program that
included jockey Pat Valenzuela's comeback from a nearly two-year
suspension; a seven-length maiden victory by the 2-year-old filly
Classic Olympio; and 14-1 Hula Queen's sweeping rally in the
$112,900 Sen. Ken Maddy Handicap for fillies and mares on that
popular hillside grass course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be back,'' said Solis, the 1998 Oak Tree
riding champion, who spent the past two weeks traveling with his
family in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Hula Queen's win and the huge upsets by recent Fairplex Park
riding champion Pedroza aboard 19-1 Fit for a King (coming off a
40-length defeat at Del Mar) and 39-1 Disguys Dalimit (back from a
10-month layoff) produced a $107,230 pick-six carryover for today.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, thinning hair and a long suspension rap sheet
proving his boy-wonder days are long gone, was cheered by the
paddock crowd when he mounted Enabru before a sixth-place finish in
the third race.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela went winless in four races in his first competition
since an October 1997 ban for an unexcused absence assumed to be
drug-related. But he was in his customary position on the lead in
the early furlongs in the first two efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the (fans') response,'' Valenzuela said.
``Just riding, it felt like I won. I felt strong. I surprised
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional day all around for the Santa Anita jockeys,
who stood shoulder to shoulder in the winner's circle following the
third race to lead the fans in a moment of silence for J.C.
Gonzalez, the 23-year-old rider trampled to death when the horse he
was aboard broke down and fell Sept. 9 at Fairplex. Gonzalez's
parents, brother and sister were present for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Gonzalez had ridden Hula Queen in 1997, when he
was an apprentice and she was a maiden.
</P>
<P>
   Hula Queen was winless in two starts at the stakes level before
her 3{-length victory over favored Desert Lady in Wednesday's turf
sprint. Trainer Luis Seglin, a native of Argentina, hadn't trained
a stakes winner since moving to California four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Did Seglin worry about how Hula Queen would handle the heat?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``She sweats well.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita and Oak Tree executives sweated out the past few
days as construction and maintenance crews worked 24 hours to get
the facility ready. The major work in progress, the new restaurant
and bar scheduled to open in December, was hidden behind a tasteful
green tarpaulin that stretched the length of the clubhouse box
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here at 7 o'clock (Tuesday) night, and I'd have given
you 1-to-5 we wouldn't have been open today,'' said Sherwood
Chillingworth, executive vice president of the Oak Tree Racing
Association, whose season runs to Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Chillingworth hopes the attendance dip _ from 14,641 on-site in
1998 _ will be offset by a big Saturday as female turf champion
Fiji returns in the Yellow Ribbon Stakes, Oak Tree guarantees a $1
million pick-six pool and the popular collectible steins giveaway
is held.

EDITORIAL: BEFORE BELL ATLANTIC WINS APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic deserves eventually to become the country's first
regional phone company to enter long-distance service, with the
potential to provide customers a combination of local and
long-distance services at lower prices than its competitors. But
Bell Atlantic's application yesterday to the Federal Communications
Commission is premature. Bell Atlantic has not yet satisfied the
precise performance standards required by the New York State Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   True, Bell Atlantic has cleaned up most of the flaws in its
systems for switching customers to other carriers, thanks to its
hard work and close monitoring by state authorities. But if only
one system fails, a customer who wants to switch local service from
Bell Atlantic to, say, MCI Worldcom could wind up with no dial tone
or no directory assistance or with aggravating delays.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 invited the Baby Bells to
provide long-distance service and invited long-distance carriers to
go after the Bells' local customers. But the Bells control the only
phone wire serving most homes and businesses _ a wire that AT&AMP;T,
MCI Worldcom and Sprint must lease to provide local service. That
poses the danger that once the Bells enter long distance, they will
exploit their local choke hold by overcharging rivals for the use
of wire and other equipment or providing them degraded service,
making it impossible for AT&AMP;T, MCI and others to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Congress wisely put the FCC in charge of administering the new
law. It turned over some of the task to state authorities. The New
York Public Service Commission tackled the task with tough-minded
innovation. For example, it had a consulting company create a fake
telephone company and seek access to Bell Atlantic's wires to see
if Bell Atlantic could switch customers without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell Atlantic's systems have improved dramatically,
seeming deficiencies remain. MCI Worldcom and others offer local
service to households by renting nearly all of Bell Atlantic's
network. Switching customers is supposed to be done electronically
to cut out mistakes, but manual interventions are needed about half
the time.
</P>
<P>
   To switch business customers, Bell Atlantic needs to disconnect
a wire from its network and reconnect it to, say, AT&AMP;T's. Bell
Atlantic says it performs this task correctly over 90 percent of
the time. AT&AMP;T says the rate falls below 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? The FCC, under heavy pressure from Congress
to prove that the 1996 act works, could approve the application,
but that could undermine years of diligent work by the New York
commission to upgrade Bell Atlantic. Or the FCC could reject the
application, but that would be shabby treatment for a company that
has worked hard to qualify. An artful middle ground would award
approval conditional on fixing up however many flaws the FCC
identifies. Then the company could be given an expedited review
limited to those problems. That way Bell Atlantic would get into
long distance promptly, as it deserves, and phone customers would
get the competition they deserve. More important, the FCC would set
a high standard for other Bell applicants.

USC'S VAN RAAPHORST NEEDS ONLY STAMINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst already has the
experience to be the Trojans' starter. Now he just needs the
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst's only adjustment this week in practice is getting
in better shape, because he is not used to taking the majority of
the snaps that previously went to Carson Palmer, who is sidelined
with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to get my stamina back,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I
get tired. When that happens, my feet aren't in the right spot and
the ball doesn't go where you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst got a vote of confidence Wednesday from coach Paul
Hackett, who continues to marvel at Van Raaphorst's performance in
the second half of the Oregon game, when he threw for 227 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had the sense this guy was in a panic or unsure,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Soward speaks:!off! After trying unsuccessfully to avoid
public comments this week, wide receiver R. Jay Soward said there
is no added scrutiny on the Trojans' wide receivers because Palmer
is probably out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure,'' Soward said. ``We know we just have to
step it up. And I think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearless attitude: Cornerback Kris Richard was flagged for three
penalties last week and is expected to share time with freshman
Darrell Rideaux against Oregon State, but that hasn't changed his
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said he won't try to ease up to avoid any more
pass-interference or holding penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play tentative. That's why I earned the
position,'' Richard said. ``When you're tentative, bad things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After three interceptions in the first two games, Richard said
he expected things would get tougher against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody told me there would be a game where they would pick
on me,'' Richard said. ``As far as the penalties, whether I thought
they were real or not, I have to accept the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired team: Hackett said he will ease up today, because the
Trojans are fatigued from the three-overtime game in Oregon.
Linebacker Zeke Moreno was in for more than 90 plays; Soward played
85.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired. That's a long trip up to Oregon and we didn't get
back until 4 a.m. We're going to back off,'' Hackett said. ``But
this team has a great resilience.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmon rests: Center Eric Denmon did not practice and will sit
out today to rest his nagging knee injury. He is expected to play,
but a decision will be made Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another starter, left guard Donta Kendrick, is hobbling with a
sprained ankle and will not practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Vandermade to play?: If Denmon is unable to suit up, Hackett
said he will be forced to use freshman Lenny Vandermade, who is
slated to redshirt, but USC would need someone to alternate with
Matt McShane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to. I don't intend to,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Can McShane play the whole game? ``I hope so,'' Hackett added.
</P>
<P>
   Bumps and bruises: Defensive lineman Aaron Williams missed
practice with a sore Achilles' tendon and safety DeShaun Hill was
out with a sore foot. Cornerback Eric Reese suffered a mild ankle
sprain.

Pippen's ripping Barkley? Talk about your small forward
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly not the first time Scottie Pippen has quit on
his team, just the latest.
</P>
<P>
   You remember, of course, the 1994 playoff series against the New
York Knicks when with 1.8 seconds left in the game and the score
tied, Pippen refused to go back onto the floor because his beloved
guru/coach Phil Jackson had called on Toni Kukoc to take the last
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The moments that define character come from ambush. Suddenly,
they are there. And nothing is the same again.
</P>
<P>
   In one foolish, inconsiderate choice, Pippen stamped his career
as a petulant, selfish egotist, no matter how many championship
rings are in his collection. But everyone deserves a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   So Pippen waited until just before the start of the 1997-1998
training camp to say he would undergo foot surgery that could have
been performed at any time during the offseason, including the
month or so he was jetting about on a promotional tour for his shoe
company. There was also the small matter of his feeling underpaid
in the last year of a seven-year, $22 million contract, especially
when young Kevin Garnett had just raked in a deal worth $126
million.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen returned to the sidelines in his fancy street clothes,
looked straight into the cameras and said, ``I don't think I could
ever wear a Chicago uniform again.'' Of course, seven months later,
he was back riding Michael Jordan's coattails to another NBA title.
But everyone deserves a third chance.
</P>
<P>
   So Pippen came to Houston to prove he could stand on his own two
feet without the crutch of His Airness. And now he's slithering out
like a 6-7 worm, pointing fingers at Charles Barkley, the only
member of the Rockets organization who consistently rushed to his
defense during an unfulfilling season that saw him become the most
overpriced commodity since somebody at the Pentagon paid millions
of dollars for some hammers.
</P>
<P>
   For $14 million last season, the Rockets got themselves a player
who averaged 14.5 points, shot 43.2 percent from the field and led
the NBA in pouts. He pouted about the way the Rockets played
offense, and he pouted about the way they played defense. He pouted
about not getting a chance to handle the ball, and he pouted about
having to handle the ball too much.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of the abbreviated training camp and the
shortened, post-lockout season, Pippen was more high-maintenance
than a roomful of table dancers during a silicone shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The hard thing to do, the professional thing to do, would have
been to show up when camp opens next week and try to put the pieces
back together. There was no public mea culpa necessary, just a
rededication to the game and a renewed commitment to a team that
has done its part during the offseason by maneuvering to make the
trade for Steve Francis and courting Shandon Anderson all the way
from summer into autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to do is what Pippen did. He just quit.
</P>
<P>
   He did it by firing away personal comments at Barkley, intending
to make the rift so wide that the Rockets have no other choice but
to trade Pippen. Which is what he has wanted all along. This was
the Bridge on the River Kwai, blown up intentionally to achieve his
end.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley went on ESPN the other day and reiterated the
comments he made in the Chronicle last month, he was merely saying
out loud the words everybody in the organization was thinking. That
Pippen had owed all of the Rockets an apology for hiding behind the
skirts of his agent, Jimmy Sexton, and asking for a trade to the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen returned fire Wednesday, it was all directed
personally at Barkley, who admittedly is an easy target. The camp
on Charles is sharply split _ either you like him or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Now before the anti-Barkley faction picks up the crayons to send
me more angry letters, remember this: None other than Hakeem
Olajuwon, his serene and royal highness of Rocketdom, also said
publicly that Pippen owed the team and the fans an apology.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of his Jordan-bestowed jewelry, Pippen does not have
the stature as a basketball player or citizen to go one-on-one,
man-to-man with Olajuwon. Thus, the easy exit.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about Pippen and Barkley and never has been. It was
Barkley who defended Pippen every time he had a horrible game last
season. It was Barkley who stood firmly in Pippen's corner
following his DWI arrest last season. It was Barkley who turned the
other cheek when Pippen tried to lay all the blame for the Rockets'
Game 1 playoff loss in LA at his feet, even though Scottie made the
critical turnover.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been about Pippen. The one who has had virtually
no communication with the Rockets organization all summer. The one
who has not once tried to bridge the gap with head coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. The one who was ready to long-jump to Hollywood to be
reunited with Big Chief Triangle on the Lakers but never had the
nerve to say it to anyone with the Rockets face-to-face. The one
who was finally given superstar money to come to Houston and act
like a headliner but showed quickly he is only a lounge act who now
wishes to tap-dance in front of Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Remember these month-old words from Barkley: ``This is a
challenge for him. This will tell you a lot about who Scottie
Pippen is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it involves 1.8 seconds or $67.2 million, the answer, it
seems, is the same: a quitter.

PRIMARY PROBLEM IS THE SECONDARY FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last year, when opponents riddled UCLA's
secondary, the problem was strategic. This year, it's personnel.
Injuries, attrition and poor performance have left the secondary in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have enough guys,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995-97 the Bruins signed nine defensive backs. These
players _ seniors, juniors and redshirt sophomores _ should be the
heart of an experienced secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, only one is contributing:
</P>
<P>
   _The 1995 recruiting class (Terry Donahue's last) produced Ali
Abdul Azziz, Ryan Roques and Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Azziz is a reserve linebacker. Roques, who started six games
last year, was moved from safety to cornerback this week. Whitfield
is a longtime reserve whose play has never matched his talent.
</P>
<P>
   _The 1996 class, Toledo's first, was compiled in one month. It
produced Damian Allen, Jason Bell and Jason Zdenek.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is running track. Bell is injured (heel) and might not
play this season. Zdenek is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   _The 1997 class produced Marques Anderson, Ryan Nece and Jason
Stephens. Anderson has been suspended from school for the fall
quarter. Nece is a linebacker and Stephens has been benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephens and Whitfield aren't playing like we thought they'd
play,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: three years, nine recruits, and only one
healthy, full-time starter for the secondary (Roques).
</P>
<P>
   That's a .111 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Man in white: Injured quarterback Drew Bennett shed his red (no
contact) jersey Wednesday and practiced with the receivers in a
white uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett can't throw deep passes because of a strained throwing
elbow suffered at Stanford. But he's one of UCLA's best athletes _
big, fast, great hands _ and might play receiver in certain
situations at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the bottom of the depth chart for quarterbacks (because
of the injury), so I thought I might as well work at receiver to
see how it feels and if I'm any good,'' Bennett said. ``I think I
could do it and I'd love for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   News from Tempe: Arizona State quarterback Ryan Kealy (bruised
ribs) did not participate in contact drills Wednesday and is
questionable for the game. Tailback J.R. Redmond, one of the best
players in the Pacific-10, is also questionable because of a
separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan's chances are probably better than J.R.'s,'' ASU coach
Bruce Snyder told reporters. ``But neither is guaranteed to play or
start.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: One current player (Whitfield) and five former
Bruins, Cade McNown, Craig Walendy, Skip Hicks, Larry Atkins and
Brendon Ayanbadejo, will be arraigned today at L.A. municipal court
for their participation in the handicapped-parking scandal.

REPEAT IS SWEET FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The party didn't begin and end with Pedro Martinez's
attempt at a cartwheel near the mound. It only seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to celebrate winning a playoff spot when there's
still the second game of a doubleheader to be played.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it goes beyond that. Perhaps it's because the Red Sox,
qualifying for the postseason in back-to-back years for the first
time in 83 years, felt the same way as their shortstop, Nomar
Garciaparra, who doubled, homered, and had a hand in the final five
outs of the Red Sox' 6-2 win over the White Sox at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely happy,'' Garciaparra said. ``We're definitely
not content.''
</P>
<P>
   A season that began with a winter of discontent fostered by the
subtraction of Mo Vaughn, continued with a spring of uncertainty
created by the elbow injury to closer Tom Gordon, and survived a
summer of skepticism that this team would return to earth like so
many of its underachieving predecessors. Now, an autumn of greater
expectations remains. How far can the Red Sox go?
</P>
<P>
   ``How far?'' Garciaparra repeated. ``We've got to believe we can
go all the way. That's the attitude you have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumped from the first round in all three of its previous trips
to the postseason in the 1990s (1990, 1995, 1998), the Sox still
don't know the identity of their first-round opponent this
go-round, although Boston's 4-2 loss in the second game of
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's doubleheader assured the Yankees of no worse
than a tie for the division title. The Yankees, rained out
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night in Baltimore, will win the AL East outright with
one more win or Sox loss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cleveland, which eliminated the Sox in both '95 and
'98, still hadn't locked up the best record in the league, which
would assure a rematch against the Sox that would begin next
Wednesday in Jacobs Field. The Indians are two games ahead of the
Rangers with four games left for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those teams enjoy a higher profile than the Sox,
their lineups rippling with an abundance of All-Stars. But the Sox
are conceding nothing. Maybe that's why you didn't see Dan Duquette
pumping up the volume like he did last season. This time, he stood
up in the press box when Garciaparra caught Mike Caruso's liner and
stepped on second base for a game-ending double play, quietly
clapped his hands, and said, almost to himself: ``There it is. All
right. Way to go, men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys understand they're not going to be on the back of
Wheaties boxes if they do good,'' said lefthander Kent Mercker, who
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night started what Rod Beck, another late-season
Duquette acquisition, finished. ``But they don't care. They just go
out and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you looked, there was a sense of unfinished business.
And while Mercker didn't see too many of his teammates making an
appearance on the breakfast table, the Sox do have this: a pitcher
whose name may be inscribed on both the Cy Young Award trophy and
MVP trophy, and Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro probably will pitch Game 1,'' said Mercker, when asked
about his own playoff pitching chances. ``After that, who knows? If
he keeps his pitch count down, maybe he can pitch Game 2, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was with the Cardinals during the summer of Mark
McGwire, when the St. Louis strongman hit his record 70 home runs
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is a great player,'' Mercker said, ``and he's not
one-dimensional, but Nomar can help you do a lot more things to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing against Mark, but Nomar is a great defensive
player, too, with great range, and he can steal a base, too. I'm
glad he's on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubleheader began with a crowd better suited for a Newton
North field hockey game. There were no more than 200 spectators in
the stands, and most of them were Red Sox fans, clustered behind
the visitors' dugout. ``They weren't mine,'' said Brian Daubach,
the basher from Belleville, a four-hour drive away. ``I didn't
leave any tickets tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like Legion ball in a tournament game,'' Mercker said.
``I heard a guy whisper who was making fun of me. I actually heard
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who had missed the last Sox game with a sore right
wrist, would have sat out Tuesday, too, if the Sox hadn't been
washed out. He made his presence felt immediately in
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's clincher. In the first inning, one out after
Jose Offerman blooped a single to right, Garciaparra doubled to
left. Offerman scored on Mike Stanley's sacrifice fly, and Butch
Huskey's double down the third-base line made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   After the White Sox tied the score in the fourth on three
singles against Mercker, Garciaparra quickly restored the lead in
the fifth with a 400-foot, two-run home run that followed a single
by John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford's two-run double in the eighth eliminated the
remaining suspense, as Beck, almost a year to the day he clinched
the Cubs' playoff spot on the north side of this town, followed 2
1/3 scoreless innings by Rich Garces and Derek Lowe with a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a special year so far, it really has,'' Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams said. ``We know what lies ahead of us, but we
relish the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the hell we are (wild-card team or division
winner), but we're in the playoffs. It's a very good feeling, a
very special feeling. It could be an emotional feeling.''

MERCKER HAPPY TO BE BACK IN POSTSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MERCKER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It had become such a staple of his existence that Kent
Mercker could mark it on his calendar at the start of every year,
like the Fourth of July, Christmas, or the tax deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``OCTOBER: Baseball playoffs. Probably World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young Atlanta Braves lefthander, he found the extended
schedule, the national spotlight, the premium stakes numbingly
routine, as if they were a guaranteed contract clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got a little spoiled over there early,'' he said.
``It was almost just assumed that the playoffs were going to be
part of the season. It's not that we took it for granted, but when
you're expected to win, it's not as exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's reached the same destination, but there is more
appreciation attached to this journey. With 5 2/3 yeoman innings in
the opener of a doubleheader Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Mercker beat the
White Sox, 6-2, and put Boston back in the playoffs as, most
likely, the American League wild card for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year drought, marked by ineffective pitching that
cost him jobs with playoff clubs Baltimore and Cleveland in 1996
and then a sentence to also-ran purgatory with Cincinnati and St.
Louis, Mercker realizes that the postseason is a privilege, not a
birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' he said of the clincher. ``Any time you can go
out and contribute to a game with so much meaning, it's special.''
</P>
<P>
   With Atlanta, it was a given. During his first six full seasons,
Mercker, 31, was on four playoff teams, three World Series clubs,
and one world champion. In fact, his biggest challenge was
surviving the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 when the Braves won the National League pennant, Mercker
was wounded in the aftermath. ``Somebody hugged me,'' he said.
``Then Lonnie Smith tackled us. I pulled some cartilage away from a
rib.''
</P>
<P>
   That cost him a spot on Atlanta's World Series roster, but what
the heck, there were plenty more where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   But after he was traded to the Orioles in 1996, he discovered he
had plenty of free time in October. His most notable moment during
the next three years came as a spectator. ``I got to see Mark
McGwire hit 70 homers last year,'' he said. ``That was something.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had come to realize that nothing matched the exhilaration
of the postseason. So when Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette
acquired him from the Cardinals Aug. 24, he felt rejuvenated. ``Any
time you go from fourth place to a contender,'' he said, ``it's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mercker, it was a reprieve. For Duquette, it was a
necessity. ``We needed a lefthander for our rotation,'' said the
GM, who had gone the season without such a commodity. ``Playoff
experience was a key factor in getting Mercker, because at this
point of the year, you need players who have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker got the Red Sox there Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, allowing six
hits and two runs before giving way to Rich Garces, and it was
almost as if he were destined for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   He had just come off the disabled list last week, having been
sidelined by a rib injury since Sept. 6. The opportunity to pitch
the clincher had been scheduled to go to Pat Rapp Tuesday. But when
that game was rained out, necessitating the doubleheader, manager
Jimy Williams flip-flopped his starters. ``We decided (Tuesday) he
was going to be the guy,'' said Williams. ``We could just as easily
have gone with Rapp.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rapp became the postscript and Mercker became a part of
Boston baseball lore. As a bonus, the Red Sox had to be out on the
field at Comiskey Park 20 minutes later for Game 2, so Mercker
didn't have time to get hurt celebrating. Instead, he spent the
interlude reflecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for me because I haven't been here that long,'' he
said. ``When those guys want to celebrate, I'm going to stand off
in a corner. These are the guys who have been here all year.
They're the guys who gave me a chance to pitch the wild-card
clincher.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, a wiser and battle-scarred Mercker will tell you, is
no everyday treat.

RED SOX FOUND A WAY TO GRIND IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Remember when the Celtics dragged Red Auerbach into
the showers after they won their eighth consecutive championship?
Red's cigar, like the Celtic fire, was never extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when beer flowed on Causeway Street after Bobby Orr
flew through the air on that Sunday afternoon in May, delivering
the Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   Remember when a dying Tom Yawkey drank champagne from a Dixie
cup in the Oakland Coliseum after the Sox swept the three-time
champion A's from the American League playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing like any of those moments. At 6:56 p.m. Central
Standard Time Wednesday, Nomar Garciaparra gloved a line drive off
the bat of Mike Caruso, stepped on second base to complete a double
play . . . and then Pedro Martinez bounded out of the dugout and
did a cartwheel on the Comiskey Park infield. ``I enjoyed that,''
said Pedro. There was hardly anyone in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Red Sox _ the grinders and muckers of Yawkey Way _ are
going to the postseason. Their 6-2 victory over the moribund White
Sox in the first game of a doubleheader Wednesday put Boston in the
American League playoffs with the Yankees, Indians, and Rangers. A
Sox edition that was ridiculed (by me, among many others) in the
offseason is going back to the tournament for the second straight
year. The Sox have not made it to postseason play in consecutive
seasons since 1915-16 when they had a crafty lefthander named Babe
Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a weird clinch night, and Boston's wild-card celebration
was postponed for nine innings. The Sox had already taken the field
for Game 2 by the time equipment czar Joe Cochran unloaded a case
of Le Domaine California champagne. They celebrated the playoff
clinching after the 4-2 second-game defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the press box, oft-maligned Dan Duquette (three
playoff teams in five years) resisted the urge to tweak his
critics. Asked if this was sweeter than the others, he deadpanned,
``It's a good accomplishment for the organization, a good
reflection on the depth of the organization. A lot of people did
good things to get us into the playoffs . . . Even though we lost
one of our most recognizable players (we think he means Mo Vaughn),
we were still able to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought Jimy Williams should be Manager of the Year,
but when asked if he should be Executive of the Year, answered,
``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a little gloating, Dan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderboy Garciaparra was happy to fire back at the preseason
wiseguys. The shortstop hit a double and game-breaking two-run
homer in the clinch game, then said, ``We're good, and people who
said (otherwise) don't know anything. If we listened to them, we
wouldn't have gone out there. But we believed what we had. We don't
listen, we just go out and play hard . . . Tell people not to read
or listen. It's not them (reporters) that know. It's us that
know.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that these Sox would clinch in such unremarkable
fashion. It's a team with little star power, excluding Nomar and
Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck called his new teammates ``a bunch of grinders who
don't take anything for granted. A bunch of guys who hit .270.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was heartened by the show of team solidarity
Tuesday night when 28 of the fellas gathered at the ESPNZone saloon
to watch the midnight special between Oakland and Anaheim _ a game
that could have clinched for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing that makes me feel good,'' said Williams. ``To me,
that's just another indication that this is, in fact, a team. We're
together eight months and you've got to get on each other's nerves
once in a while. But certainly at this juncture, it's nice to hear
that . . . That's a pretty good meeting especially not even being
in the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no more than 200 fans in the Comiskey stands when Jim
Parque pitched to Jose Offerman to start clinch night at 4:07 p.m.
It had the feel of a mid-March simulated game at the Sox' minor
league complex in Fort Myers, Fla. All we needed was Johnny Pesky
hitting fungoes between innings.
</P>
<P>
   A small, but loud band of Sox fans cheered the wild-card winners
after Nomar's game-ending double play, and it was then that Jimy
finally let the air out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accomplished something that we set out to do,'' he said.
``It's been a special year for us. I don't know what the hell we
are but we're in the playoffs. We're one of four. We have attained
something that's special.''
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely happy, but we're not content,'' said Nomar.
``We've got to believe we can go all the way to the World Series
and win it all. We're not going to let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck added, ``I know the history of baseball on the North Side
(Cubs), and this doesn't seem much different. They've waited a long
time for a championship. There's nothing better than winning in
those cities. They deserve a championship. And I'm a firm believer
that things happen for a reason.''

DAFOE'S PITCH TO BRUINS: TRADE ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ Byron Dafoe said he's going to sell his North Shore
home since he figures his playing days in Boston are over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' holdout goalie attended a three-hour meeting
Wednesday with his agent, Ron Salcer, president/general manager
Harry Sinden, and assistant general manager Mike O'Connell in an
effort to end his contract impasse. Dafoe left the meeting angry,
disillusioned, and determined to leave town, saying he has asked to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I go from there?'' he said. ``I said, `Well, then
trade me,' if they're not willing to try to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said management's response was vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their response was, `OK, but we'll do what's in the best
interest of the Boston Bruins.' Well, I think what's in the best
interest of the Boston Bruins is to sign me. I'm serious on this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sinden) really pissed me off at the end and I got up and
left. I couldn't take it anymore. For him to be crying poverty and
to say I'm going to bankrupt the team with what I'm asking for, I
think that's ridiculous. I came home, called the real estate agent,
and the sign is going up (Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only push a person so far. This started four months
ago. (Sinden) indicated I might have to sit. Well, if that's the
best for the Boston Bruins, I'll be glad to go somewhere else. How
can that benefit a hockey team?''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said Sinden told him that paying him what he was asking
for, or even less, would cause financial hardship for the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quote Harry, he said, `If I were to pay you what you were
asking for, the Boston Bruins go bankrupt,' '' said Dafoe. ``It
went on from there. He agreed (on Dafoe's worth). He said I was in
the top three or four goalies in the league and they said they
can't afford it. This is the way the Boston Bruins are run, and he
said, `I'm not going to be like these other teams and run my team
into the ground.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he feels his case is simply a harbinger of things to
come with Joe Thornton, Sergei Samsonov, and other Bruins up for
new contracts next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, after seeing what I've gone through, looking
into the future of the Boston Bruins, what about Joe and Sergei?
You've got me holding out this year; next year you're going to have
six or seven. I'm not happy about being on an adequate team or a
team that's just good enough. I play this sport to win and if
there's no intention of going for a Cup, then trade me.''
</P>
<P>
   The goalie said Sinden offered him $2 million for a one-year
contract, but Dafoe turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to recall (Los Angeles Kings goalie) Stephane Fiset was
awarded $2.1 million (in arbitration),'' said Dafoe. ``No offense
to the other goaltenders, I'm not saying I'm a better goaltender
but going by the numbers, which most arbitrators do, it doesn't
make sense. That's what put the final straw on it and I got up and
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was just the latest in a string of
negotiations begun when the 28-year-old Dafoe, a restricted free
agent, turned down arbitration after last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when Harry and I met before, he said, `Byron, you show me
why you're worth what you're asking for and I'll pay it,' '' said
Dafoe. ``We went over for quite a period of time different numbers,
and Ronnie had everything prepared. We showed them why we're asking
for what we are. Harry said, `Byron, you're right, you should
probably be asking for more money. But the Boston Bruins can't
afford that. You're not in the Boston Bruins' marketplace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to give our new proposal. We came down considerably. I
took myself out of the marketplace and they made absolutely no
effort, no movement, they had nothing to come back with. They just
did not accept it. They said they were staying right where they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said the entire experience has left a sour taste in his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it is, is lip service,'' he said. ``He had absolutely no
intentions of getting it done. Their original offer was their final
offer, going back four months. I've moved considerably. I've
compromised. I've gone beyond what I feel (I'm worth) because I'd
love to stay in Boston. The fans are unbelievable. The city is
unbelievable. My teammates are great and Pat Burns is the best
coach I've had. It's a superb situation but the bottom line is you
can only go so far.''

ACTOR BEATTY FALLS SHORT OF AN ANNOUNCED RUN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ In a moment of high drama worthy of the silver
screen, movie star Warren Beatty brought his film character
Bulworth to life Wednesday night, telling a crowd of Hollywood
glitterati that he intends to ``speak up for the people that nobody
speaks for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty's reprise of his plain-spoken movie politician took a
twist when he failed to address the question on everybody's mind:
Will he challenge Vice President Al Gore and former U.S. Senator
Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Beatty delivered a passionate, often entertaining and
sometimes rambling speech that left many of the 200 reporters from
around the world scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Hollywood stars and political insiders held their
collective breath as Beatty took the stage at the Beverly Hilton to
receive the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for political activism from the
Southern California chapter of Americans for Democratic Action, a
Democratic liberal organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the star of such movies as ``Splendor in the Grass,''
``Reds'' and ``Shampoo'' made no mention of any presidential
aspirations, and he even told his celebrity-studded audience at one
point, ``I like making movies, and I'm going to keep making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's political tease about a possible 2000 presidential run
_ preceded by weeks of printed foreplay _ began weeks ago, after
columnist Arianna Huffington ruminated in print on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz about a possible Beatty run soon swelled to
bigger-than-life Hollywood proportions, making the actor's
appearance in the International Ballroom here last night the
hottest ticket in town _ maybe in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Limos pulled up at the Hilton, dislodging stars and political
luminaries as a herd of paparazzi vied for their attention. Young
women in the liberal Democratic crowd wore shirts saying, ``I ain't
voting for that S.O.B. (son of Bush).''
</P>
<P>
   Among the stars who showed up were Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway,
Courtney Love, Morgan Fairchild, Dustin Hoffman, director Penny
Marshall and TV stars Lara Flynn Boyle and Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Guests paid $175 each to sit in the packed ballroom _ the site
of the annual Golden Globe Awards _ to hear the words from Beatty's
own mouth about his political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that he's shaking up the system,'' said
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, who entered the dinner as ``Beatty
2000'' stickers were being handed out. ``With Bradley and Gore,
it's dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty entered the hotel accompanied by his wife, actress
Annette Bening, amid an explosion of flash bulbs. The actor
blinked, appearing stunned at the crush of reporters and
photographers. ``This,'' he said in awe, ``is a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But once on stage, he forcefully delivered an entreaty for the
Democratic Party to return to its roots,saying it has become
``more interested in profits than people, investments but not
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for campaign finance reform and universal health care,
and he wasted no time lambasting both  &LR; Gore and Bradley, saying
that the Democratic centrists have struck ``political bargains''
while 100 million Americans have been left behind during economic
boom times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is drifting,'' he said. ``It's enslaved by big
money; it's lost its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty was met with a standing ovation when he closed his
address with a quote from ``Bulworth'': ``Keep the spirit alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends like State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, who had
a table for eight, said that the actor-director was well aware of
his celebrity spotlight and wanted to use it to push Democratic
issues he felt were being ignored. The huge turnout to hear Beatty,
Burton said, ``means there is a craving for excitement in the
campaign, a craving for someone to talk like a real Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has been shut
out, and the air in that shut room of conservative Democrats
becomes stale,'` said Lila Garrett, president of ADA. ``Warren
Beatty has opened that door slightly, and the rancid air is moving
out and the fresh air is moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the Beatty buzz was simply a moment of relief from
the deadly serious _ and often deadly dull _ rivalries of the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Warren since I've been a waitress in this town,''
laughed actress Sally Kellerman, ``and he's always created a buzz
in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that if Beatty ran for president as a Democrat he
would draw support, but he wouldn't dramatically alter the race. In
an ABC poll of 452 Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters in
mid-August, Gore was supported by 61 percent, while 24 percent
backed Bradley and 9 percent endorsed Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, even the actor himself didn't seem to have
a clue to where all the hoopla will lead. Asked by a reporter if he
was leaving the door open for a future run at the White House,
Beatty threw up his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that,'' he shrugged. `I'm not saying no.''
</P>

GALAXY BEATS RAPIDS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's hard to figure how Steve Jolley worked
his way to the Los Angeles Galaxy bench _ going from a regular
mainstay at central defense to the back of Sigi Schmid's dog house.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted his demotion with mixed feelings _ believing he had
earned his role with the best defense Major League Soccer has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   So with a rare start Wednesday, replacing struggling defender
Paul Caligiuri, Jolley came out flying, added a back-flip as an
exclamation point and gave Schmid something to think about with the
playoffs around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   In just his third start in the past 12 matches, Jolley used his
30-something-inch vertical leap to finish a beautiful header in the
fifth minute against Colorado. The quick start fueled a rare 4-0
rout over the defensive-minded Rapids in front of 10,098 at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifted Los Angeles (19-11, 51 points) to a
four-point cushion over the second-place Rapids (19-10, 47 points)
_ and it guaranteed the Galaxy would finish no worse than second
with two road games remaining in the Western Conference title race.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jolley, it meant he might actually be around for these
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sitting on the bench for the last month,'' said
Jolley, who missed the previous three games. ``For the first time
in my career I was questioning myself, and that's not always good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was an opportunity before the playoffs to at least
have a chance to show what I'm made of. If anything, it creates
more questions in his (Schmid's) mind who he wants to play there.
It's not a matter of me or Cal, but more than anything I wanted to
show I can perform in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to get that goal becomes sometimes you can
play a great game and they can overlook you. But when you score a
goal, especially one like that, it leaves a lasting impression.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly left an impression with Schmid, who started Jolley
and midfielder Clint Mathis because he felt the team had gone stale
after its 2-0 loss to D.C. United on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the decisions I came to after D.C. was that I felt we
had a very good run in August but that maybe some guys were feeling
too comfortable in the starting lineup,'' said Schmid. ``We needed
fresh legs, came with Clint and Jolley and it worked for us. As for
Jolley, I was very pleased, it was a great goal and a great header.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me something to think about. This team is 15 or 16
players deep. For a while we hesitated doing it (changing the
lineup), but I think for us to win the title we need to keep fresh
legs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Schmid was looking for a genuine playoff effort after two
consecutive shutout losses, he certainly got it against a Colorado
team coming off three straight shutouts. And the four goals was a
nice reward because the Rapids came to spectate, hoping to steal a
point in the shootout. In the second half, they basically shut down
and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they felt they had a game in hand on us, and just said
let's bag this one, this is not the one we're going to go get,''
said Schmid. ``Certainly I don't think they played with as much
intensity as normal, but part of that was our defending.''
</P>
<P>
   Up 2-0 at the half, Jones added his eighth goal of the season in
the 56th minute and UCLA's Seth George finished it with his goal in
the 89th minute.

GIANTS BEAT DODGERS, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The plan was to start Kevin Brown on three days
rest in Houston to give him a shot at 20 wins, but to do it, the
right-hander needed three wins in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Dodgers 101: They have a plan, think it's a good plan,
but then it crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for the first and only time in his career, Brown left
Candlestick Park with a loss. The Giants scored early and beat the
Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 Wednesday in their next-to-last game at the
40-year-old ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   Even Brown conceded it was his last start in the first of a
seven-year, $105 million deal. He finishes 18-9 with a 3.00 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great season,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``There's no reason for him to come back. When he came out, I shook
his hand and said, `Great year.' It really was.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second straight season Brown won 18 games, but this one
ends much differently than his run to the World Series while
helping rejuvenate baseball in San Diego last season. His lone
20-win season came in 1992 as a member of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' Brown said in summing up his season. ``It
could have been better. I felt like I could have thrown the ball
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The 'Stick's 40-year era ends today with the Dodgers and Giants
closing it out with an afternoon game followed by a two-hour
celebration, though it's open for debate whether they're
celebrating the past 40 years or the fact that they'll never have
to play here again.
</P>
<P>
   The wind and cold of the ballpark played some eerie roles in the
Candlestick saga, making pop flies an adventure and adding the
unexpected almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the two hated rivals battled at one of former
President Richard Nixon's favorite ballparks, the weather was
wondrous. It was merely the result that was unforeseen.
</P>
<P>
   Brown dominated in his previous starts at Candlestick/3Com Park.
He was 5-0 with a 0.63 ERA in his first five starts at the `Stick.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Brown dominated in the Bay Area, he owned the
Giants. In eight career starts he was 7-0 with a 0.78 ERA. It
included five complete games, three shutouts and a 1997 no-hitter
while he pitched with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He also came into the game 8-2 with a 1.69 ERA in his past 13
starts, and pitching better than anyone in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) was good (this season), but he wasn't dominating like
I've seen him dominate,'' said Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield,
who played in Florida with Brown. ``If you have an off year and
shell out 18 wins, that says something about you. I can say that
because I've seen it. You wouldn't believe what he can do. He can
take over a game.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first inning against the Giants, Brown trailed
2-0 because Barry Bonds, two days away from arthroscopic surgery on
his right knee, homered to right. Two innings later, the Giants, on
J.T. Snow's two-run single, eclipsed the number of runs they scored
off Brown in his five previous starts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made two bad pitches,'' Brown said. ``I made a lot of good
ones, but I made two bad ones and it cost me four runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' loss could be Houston's win. Johnson said prior to
the game that if Brown lost, right-hander Robinson Checo would
start Sunday's game. The Astros might need that win to reach the
playoffs.

SPEAKING OF BAD SPORTS ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those wild and crazy Ryder Cuppers sure knew how
to party. They made the 18th green at the venerable course look
like the back yard of a frat house, what with the team's leader
fizzing up a huge bottle of champagne, then hosing down his mates.
Then there was the table-top tap-dance routine featuring the team
captain and one of its young stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   I'm referring to the European team's high jinks after their
first win on American soil at Murifield Village in 1991. The
Europeans took special glee in rubbing salt into the American
psyche then because the U.S. team was led by Jack Nicklaus, the
game's best player ever; the match was held at a course he designed
and the home team had bragged before hand how great it was.
</P>
<P>
   So the postmatch festivities featured Champagne Seve Ballesteros
and Dancin' Captain Tony Jacklin and his partner Jose-Maria
Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, that was the Ryder Cup victory party for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Europeans, led by their captain Mark James, have
shown the world that they are just as lousy at losing as they are
at winning.
</P>
<P>
   So is the British press, which presented a unified front this
week in bashing America. They did the same thing back in 1991 after
Team Europe won the cup and of course they are the same jokes, er
blokes, that have referred to the wives of American players as
bimbos.
</P>
<P>
   To all their self-righteous blathering I say, too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   You lost the cup, and not because of the American dog pile on
the 17th green after Justin Leonard sank a put that was longer than
Paul Revere's ride.
</P>
<P>
   You lost because your team performed one of the greatest
collective chokes in the history of golf. They should nickname
these guys the Billy Joe Pattons.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are also lucky the American team did not get in
their faces about the pace of play. In what was obviously Mark
James' strategy to rattle the Americans, the European team
routinely took its time conferring over shots and reading putts.
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad there was a real possibility the whole thing might
not get finished until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If a flag were thrown for unsportsmanlike conduct it should have
been directed at the behind of Padraig Harrington, who was playing
Mark O'Meara one hole ahead of Leonard and Olazabal. With his ball
in the middle of the fairway and O'Meara in trouble, Harrington
paced off the yardage to the green and took a look at the pin
position. It took him almost 10 minutes to make a swing. Do that on
a public course and someone will be calling 911.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara stewed, but said zip. He should have throttled
Harrington. And team leader Colin Montgomerie should have given
Harrington a stern lecture on the the difference between
sportsmanship and gamesmanship, not carp about the American crowds.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was sportsmanship on both sides Sunday, with
the grandest gesture coming from U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart,
who took his cue from Nicklaus. In the 1969 matches Nicklaus
conceded a putt to Jacklin, giving Britain a rare tie at the time,
much to the dismay of the American team. Nicklaus later lobbied to
include all of Europe in the matches.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, with the outcome decided, Stewart conceded his
match to Montgomerie at the 18th hole, keeping the Scotsman's
winning streak in singles intact and apologizing for any bad
behavior on America's part.
</P>
<P>
   But Monty fumed. This is the same Montgomerie who dissed some
U.S. players before the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, noting that
Brad Faxon might not play well because he was going through a
divorce and Scott Hoch had missed a short putt to blow the 1989
Masters so he probably could not deal with Ryder Cup pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Monty later apologized and the American team accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says any apology from America is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   And the sulking and ranting from from across the Atlantic
continued into the week, with James offering up the possibility of
a future boycott.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday some American players had heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval fired back on ESPN's ``Up Close,'' noting he
believes much of the European team's anger is focused at American
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (James) was making reference to the U.S. team, then he
is a very sore loser, is what he is,'' Duval said. ``This is my
first Ryder Cup, but I have watched it on television and nothing
different happened this time than has happened in the past Ryder
Cups.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we lost two in a row, David, including an embarrassing
defeat at Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y. after starting play Sunday
with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   So if Europe is ticked off about excessive celebrating, James
and his team should remember they started it.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, we ended it on Sunday.

FINLEY'S FINAL ANGELS START TONIGHT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tonight could be Chuck Finley's final start in
an Anaheim Angels uniform -- or it could be just another in long
career by the lanky left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is a free agent at the end of the season and, along with
general manager Bill Bavasi, has agreed to hold off any contract
talks until after the season. Finley, who was nearly traded to the
Indians just before the July 31 trading deadline, had been seeking
a two-year deal worth $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   If tonight's start is his last as an Angel, Finley hasn't gotten
sentimental about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't allowed myself to go down that road,'' said Finley,
who leads the team with 12 victories. ''I don't want to get caught
up in the emotion of something that might not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Angels interim manager Joe Maddon said he hasn't
contemplated the possibility of the team. He has no plans to save
the lineup card as a keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't collect autographs or memorabilia or newspaper
articles,'' Maddon said. ''The only thing I've saved along those
lines is a St. Louis Cardinals program from 1964 with a bunch of
autographs in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddon said he grew up as a Cardinals fan.
</P>
<P>
   Percival's status: There has been no decision yet on the status
of closer Troy Percival, who has an inflammed right shoulder.
However, team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum is expected to make
a decision today.
</P>
<P>
   Percival has said he wants to continue to pitch through the end
of the season, but Maddon said: ''If there is any risk we won't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Maddon is a touchy-feely kind of guy. When
he makes a trip to the mound to visit his pitcher, he'll put his
hand on the pitcher's arm or shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to go out there and look them in the face and put my
hand on them,'' Maddon said. ''I can tell how fast his heart might
be pumping and I can tell if he's under control. It's the way I've
always been, it's just a natural reaction. I love working with
pitchers because I was a catcher. It was something I did as a
catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedule: The Angels and A's will play the final game of their
three-game series tonight at 7:05. Finley (12-11, 4.41 ERA) will
start for Anaheim against Oakland's Gil Heredia (13-8, 4.78).

KARIYA IMPROVING, PLANS TO PRACTICE TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Paul Kariya skated on his own and took part in
one non-contact drill on Wednesday, but once again the Aanheim
winger didn't participate in a full practice. Kariya hasn't
practiced with the team since reaggravating a left quad injury 1
1/2 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Ladislav Kohn, acquired from Atlanta for eighth-round
draft choice on Monday, skated with the first line in Wednesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, however, said he is improving, plans to practice today,
and still has hope he can play in the regular season opener
Saturday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the mindset that I'm going to play until I'm proven
wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya said he hasn't had much pain ``the last 3-4 days, but
admitted he doesn't want to ``take one step forward and then 10
back, by pushing things too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to listen to my body, Kariya said. ``I know it pretty
well. If I had listened before I wouldn't be in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Kevin Haller practiced for the first time in training
camp and like Kariya is hoping he can play in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not 100 percent, but it felt pretty good, said Haller,
who had arthroscopic knee surgery on Sept. 8. ``I'm almost a week
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Haller said his lack of timing, not reinjuring the knee is his
main concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play gritty and aggressive, he said. ``I might
favor it (his knee), but I'm not going to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   Haller was paired with his partner of last seson, Jason
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Other defensive pairings included Oleg Tverdovsky playing with
Ruslan Salei and the Swedish duo of Fredrik Olausson and Niclas
Havelid.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   As expected the Ducks sent Russian prospects defenseman Vitaly
Vishnevski and winger Maxim Balmochnykh to Cincinnati of the AHL.
Anaheim also sent forwards Bob Wren and Pete LeBoutillier and
defenseman Dan Trebil to Cincinnati. Goalie Tom Askey was sent
Kansas City of the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen scored three goals in the Ducks' final two
exhibition games, but it wasn't scoring that pleased the Anaheim
center the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to score goals, but I also thought I played a lot
better all-round game, he explained. ``I didn't think I had being
playing that well. I wasn't comfortable on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg was also pleased to see his No. 1
line center pick up his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have had good games even if hadn't scored, said
Hartsburg. ``The goals were the result of his effort. He's going in
the right direction.

EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES FOR 3-0 BEAVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Erickson is doing his best to make sure his Oregon State
football team maintains proper perspective concerning the Beavers
3-0 beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that an Oregon State football team hasn't captured
the first three games in a season since 1967. Never mind that this
week's opponent USC has chiseled out a 7-52-4 lifetime record
against Oregon State and the Beavers don't own a winning record
against any Pac-10 member.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the last bowl appearance was the 1965 Rose Bowl
and the postseason resume consists of two trips to the Pineapple
Bowl, one to the Liberty Bowl and three journeys to Pasadena. Never
mind that, according to Erickson, the hunger to win in Corvallis
has turned to starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement needs to be tempered by that fact that the three
wins have come against Big West member Nevada, WAC member Fresno
State and I-AA participant Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, nothing against our opponents, but we haven't
played anybody as close to the caliber of a USC or anyone else in
the Pac-10,'' Erickson said. ``We really don't know where we're at
right now. I'm happy with the three wins. That's important to us.
But we'll find out a lot more about our team and where we are in
the Pac-10 after we play USC on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, what does Oregon State's best player
sophomore running back Ken Simonton think when he hears that there
could be a journalist out there somewhere who already has the
Beavers pegged for New Year's Day in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would shake that man's hand and tell him he has vision,''
said Simonton, a 5-foot-7, 175-pound flash, who played at Pittsburg
High for former Poly co-coach Thomas Whiting. ``We are capable of
doing that. You don't have to be the most dominant team. It's a
matter of week in and week out going out there and executing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers in the Rose Bowl? Sounds about as farfetched as a
slightly-recruited player like Simonton leading the nation in
rushing. Yet, after four weeks, it is indeed Simonton, with 185.67
yards per game, leading Iowa State's Darren Davis (185.00), and
Wisconsin's Ron Dayne (174.67) in the national rushing rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is helping us win,'' said Simonton, whose 18
points per game ties him for the second in the country with
Alabama's Shaun Alexander and behind San Jose State's Deonce
Whittaker (18.67). ``But my main concern is to help us win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring a lot of points the Beavers average 40 points per
contest is how Oregon State has won its first three.
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw the ball well,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``(Quarterback) Jonathan Smith is playing well. He's got
confidence. They've improved the receiver corps. But let's face it.
Ken Simonton is the guy. He's going to run the ball and run the
ball and you better be able to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonton is averaging nearly 33 carries per game. That's a lot
of pounding for a player like Dayne, who weighs nearly 260 pounds,
much less for a guy with the slight frame of Simonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me a big guy can take 30 carries,'' said Simonton,
who has 557 yards and nine touchdowns rushing and four catches for
64 yards. ``A guy like Dayne has great feet, but he doesn't make
people miss. I have to make people miss. I don't take a lot of
(solid) hits. Even in 30 carries, I haven't taken a pounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonton would have done his pounding on the baseball field if
he would have followed family tradition. His father, brother and
cousin have all played professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my family loves different sports,'' Simonton said. ``My
favorite is football.''
</P>
<P>
   A shoulder injury during his senior season at Pittsburg cost
Simonton an opportunity to pursue football in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a box full of letters from all over the country,''
Simonton said. ``It was a stack three feet high from Tennessee to
USC to Washington. But when I hurt my shoulder, most of them (took)
me off their list.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State was the only school which offered a scholarship and
Simonton gladly joined Mike Riley's program.
</P>
<P>
   After a redshirt season, Simonton stepped into the starting
lineup and became only the fifth player in school history to rush
for 1,000 yards when he eclipsed that mark by 79 yards. He was part
of a team that finished 5-6, but had narrow losses to UCLA (41-34),
Washington (35-34) and California (20-19). However, soon after
beating Oregon to end the year, Riley bolted to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard Riley was going to leave, I was like `Man, what
our we gonna do?','' Simonton said.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped Erickson, who directed Miami to national
championships in 1989 and 1991 and was the Seattle Seahawk head
coach for the previous four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Riley was a great coach, but bringing in Erickson brings
us to another level,'' Simonton said.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll see just what level that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing our players know is, to be competitive in
the Pac-10, we've got to play well the next eight weeks,'' Erickson
said. ``I don't look at it as much as the USC game as our next
eight football games.''

 BAUER AGAIN DENIES AFFAIR WITH STAFFER  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surrounded by his wife and three children,
Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer vehemently denied
Wednesday having an affair with a young campaign aide, obliquely
accusing a rival campaign of spreading ``vicious allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trash-can politics. It's evil,'' Bauer said at a hastily
called Washington news conference, insisting, ``I have not violated
my wedding vows made 27 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is a dark-horse candidate who has based his campaign on
courting the Christian right. He is battling millionaire Steve
Forbes to be the conservative challenger to front-runner George W.
Bush, and he implied that the Forbes campaign was spreading the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations first surfaced in an interview published Tuesday
in The Chronicle. Bauer was asked if he was the target of gossip
column items alleging a GOP presidential candidate was having an
affair with a ``twentysomething'' woman.
</P>
<P>
   The former adviser to President Ronald Reagan told The Chronicle
that he believed the item was written about him _ and that he had
been the victim of a smear campaign by a rival candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer Wednesday charged that reporters ``were getting this spun
to them frequently, continually, by the operatives of one
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign fiercely denied the charge. ``That's
absolutely untrue,'' said Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller. ``We don't
engage in that kind of political game. If there's one thing our
campaign engages in, it's issues and substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's former campaign chairman, Charles Jarvis, left Bauer two
weeks ago to join the Forbes campaign as an unpaid adviser. He said
in a telephone interview that he had warned Bauer several times
privately that the candidate's behavior toward a young aide was
creating a bad appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a post Clinton-Lewinsky world, pro-family leaders cannot be
spending hour after hour after hour behind closed doors with a
young staff person,'' Jarvis said. But he stopped short of accusing
Bauer of having an affair and said that before Wednesday, he had
not talked publicly about his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said nine members of Bauer's staff have left in the last
month, ``primarily'' because they ``could not agree with a lower
standard for a leader of pro-family causes in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer denied being confronted by any aide about any questionable
personal behavior. ``No, I cannot imagine that anybody in a
campaign would object to me having a meeting behind closed doors
with a professional woman,'' he said. ``Such meetings take place
all over Washington, D.C., every day. ... Is somebody suggesting
that it's 1899? It's 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis called Bauer's denial ``absolutely untrue.'' Jarvis said
he urged Bauer to avoid ``even the appearance of impropriety ...
especially by someone claiming the mantle of moral leadership and
the pro-family movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer aide Frank Cannon seized on Jarvis' statements, saying
they were significant because ``finally, someone in the Forbes camp
(is) willing to go on the record with these baseless allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon said Jarvis' allegations of improper conduct illustrated
that the Forbes campaign is now engaged in ``desperate tactics,''
because ``they've spent $50 million in five years, to end up in the
margin of error (in the polls) with us.''

HOUSING ADVOCATES FEAR HOMELESS FACE THE WORST WINTER YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The number of people who sought emergency shelter this
summer in urban communities, most of them driven by the high cost
of housing in Massachusetts, signals what housing advocates fear
may be the worst winter yet for the state's homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating an onslaught as cold weather sets in, housing
advocates are requesting 700 more beds from the state's Department
of Health and Human Services. The number of people seeking
emergency shelter during the summer jumped 5 percent over to last
year's figures, according to the advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It indicates that it's going to be worse than last year and
last year was the worse year ever,'' said John O'Brien, director of
the Shattuck Shelter in Boston. ``When you overflow in the summer,
when people can be outside, the anticipation is there is going to
be a greater need for additional beds in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous increase in the number of people looking for
emergency shelter during the warmest months of the year caught
shelter providers off guard and sent them scrambling in July,
August, and September to convert offices and hallways into
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in the summer have the shelters overflowed,''
said Philip Mangano, executive director of Massachusetts Housing
and Shelter Alliance. ``That was always the time for respite for
shelter providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, homeless shelters have experienced high demand
during the winter, but the situation has usually eased as the
weather warmed.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, many homeless people prefer to live in parks
or under bridges rather than in cramped shelters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, so many people needed shelter due to the
lack of affordable housing that shelters experienced the sort of
overflows usually seen only in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer people able to move out of shelters because rents are
so high, and more moving in because they're priced out of the
rental market, ``there were more people in the system and the
shelters overflowed,'' said Mangano.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless community was hit hard last winter when seven
alcoholic street people in Boston died from the cold weather. At
the same time, the federal government slashed funding for the
homeless in Massachusetts by 40 percent. Homelessness in Boston
alone increased by 5 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter workers from across the state are planning to meet with
state officials next week to discuss what can be done to prepare
for the expected crunch this winter.
</P>
<P>
   According to housing statistics, 22,000 people across the state
will experience homelessness this year, with 4,000 sleeping in an
emergency shelter on any given night.
</P>
<P>
   During past winters, shelters needed 500 additional beds a night
to handle increasing demand, but officials don't think that will be
enough this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need will be much greater,'' said Mangano.
</P>
<P>
   The United Homes for Children Boston, Dorchester, for instance,
which normally accepts the overflow from other shelters, often
reached its capacity of 88 men throughout the summer, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, during the summers we have a lull, but this August
about 20 of the nights we were full by 9 p.m.,'' said Philip
Wright, director of adult services for the shelter. ``That's very
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say one reason for the increase could be the number of
young adults hanging out in public city areas during the day who
have nowhere to sleep at night. Others say the state is also seeing
an increasing number of elderly people seeking housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more elderly and more young people who are using
heroin,'' said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Others blame the increase on a housing market where rents are so
high that families are doubling up in some places.
</P>
<P>
   The increased demand for emergency shelter is also seen in
Springfield and Worcester, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, shelter workers saw more people in July than
they normally do in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing for us out West is that our numbers
rarely deviate from month to month, '' said Frank Keough, director
of the Worthington Shelter in Springfield. ``But the number of
people seen this summer was staggering.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SUV sighted; up periscope!
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 3, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lease on my automobile soon running out, I am in the market
for a car. As I prowl between intensive salesmen who want my name,
address and phone number before they'll allow me to open the
driver's side door of a showroom car, I have come to the
realization that the auto industry _ both foreign and domestic _
does not meet my needs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the cars drive well, and they're quieter than they used to
be, and you can play CDs in them, but there's more to a car than
torque, looks and sound.
</P>
<P>
   When I say a ``car,'' I mean a traditional car; a sedan, four
doors, seats five or six.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with these cars are those monster sport utility
vehicles and their elongated cousin, the van. This has been written
before. SUVs are an intimidating factor to anyone who drives just a
car. Everything from blinding lights in the rear-view mirror to
zero visibility in parking lots make coexistence between just cars
and SUVs as difficult to achieve as a lunch date between Bill
Clinton and Monica's mom.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry has not sought my advice on how to deal with
this, but I will offer it anyway. Were I designing a sedan-sized
car, either compact, mid-sized or the Cadillac and Town Car types,
I would include these in the factory-installed features:
</P>
<P>
   _ A periscope somewhere near the rear of the exterior that could
be raised and lowered, when trying to back out of a parking space
when you're pinned between two SUVs and hardly can see the
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ An LED functioning proclamation facing out from the rear
window that, when activated by a steering-wheel based button,
reads: ``Please turn off your brights.'' After a 10-second wait,
the LED would read: ``Dammit, turn off those brights!''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, however, the problem is not solved as most often the
lights on an SUV are not on bright; the vehicle itself sits too
high and its lights burn into the rear-view mirror and your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If drivers of SUVs can appreciate our problem, then we can
proceed with pressuring the auto builders to meet those needs.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of studies that show the physical dangers of
SUVs to sedans, and studies that show that some SUVs can't even
withstand a punch in the nose themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the world in which I travel, so many of those SUVs are being
driven by mothers, either taking their children to school or dance
class. In some stretch vans, entire teams can be transported. The
drivers rightfully argue that they feel very safe in those
behemoths. I'm sure they are, but I feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Back more than 30 years ago, when my wife was hauling four small
children around, she didn't have an SUV. They all were stuffed into
a Volkswagen Beetle and lived to tell exaggerated stories about it.
This clearly was unsafe but nobody knew it then.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has delivered the SUV to the public. While its
original intent may have been to haul cattlemen through rocky and
hilly terrain, it has evolved into an urban chariot.
</P>
<P>
   I am not unsophisticated about large vehicles. For several
years, I owned a small motor home. Thus, I already have experienced
the thrill of a strong crosswind, that sucking sound from the gas
tank and the humiliation of emptying potty cisterns. I also did my
share of tailgating guys in little cars, oblivious to their
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   But now I'm a sedan-only man. For a while, I fought the
unsuccessful (and unrealistic) argument that SUVs should be banned.
But I've grown up. I understand the needs of some for those. So
rather than call for their expulsion, I want some features added to
my sedan that will better allow me to coexist with those beasts.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry constantly strains to create new features for
its vehicles. By this writing, I am propositioning them to do
something for the beleaguered sedan. If this is too impractical for
their minds, then how about an optional rear-mounted, air-cooled
machine gun?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP rides roughshod over its environmental legacy
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Earth and the current Republican Party just can't seem to
get along. The GOP has its long knives out again for the
environment, loading 13 appropriations bills with 58 riders that,
like a street gang on a tear, would vandalize the national
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the party keep doing this stuff? Republicans virtually
invented conservation under President Theodore Roosevelt and threw
in with modern environmental protection under President Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   This is an honorable tradition _ and an admired one. There are
few settled matters in America's volatile politics, but
environmental protection, in general if not in every detail, is
one. We like it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans paid a penalty in the polls when President Ronald
Reagan's impatience with trees and indulgence for sundry toxins
began to unnerve voters. And Newt Gingrich's big Contract With
America started losing steam when the public caught on that, in
part, it was cover for renewed attacks on ecological health.
</P>
<P>
   Today's GOP keeps bruising the environment because, first _
well, first, because it is paid to. Many of the riders are goods
delivered to generous special interests: ranchers, the oil
industry, timber.
</P>
<P>
   But the party keeps at it as well because many Republicans have
talked themselves into an ideological conviction that humankind's
stewardship of the planet has little or no proper business taking
political form. Let the market decide what lives or dies, prospers
or wanes. The destruction of species and the degradation of the
biosphere pale as evils compared to any government intrusion on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   So here are proposals to extend destructive grazing on public
land, kill the creation of a wildlife refuge on the Grand Kankakee
River in Illinois, limit the U.S. ability to study and prepare for
global climate changes, prevent restoration of Glen Canyon in Utah,
boost subsidies for timbering in Alaska's Tongass National Forest,
undermine wetlands protection with developer-friendly appeals,
block funding for energy conservation. And more. And still more.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not innocent of environmental hooliganism,
especially when some home-district fat cat puts out a contract on
nature, but Republicans have become specialists at this sort of
marauding in recent years, successfully daring President Clinton to
veto crucial government funding just to unhorse usually obscure
riders.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs the president, with only a so-so environmental
record himself, may be less accommodating this time. The GOP
sponsors are being even more piggy than usual, and their
over-reaching gives the administration a chance to pick a fight
that would help Vice President Al Gore renew his environmentalist
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   There were arguments over particulars, but a broad bipartisan
consensus for environmental activism held for 20 years, until the
GOP began suspecting that any environmentalism was environmental
extremism. The party's riders these days look more like Cossacks
than cowboys.

KACZYNSKI EXPLAINS MOTIVES IN TAPED INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A road, newly cut through a Montana paradise, may have turned
Theodore Kaczynski onto a one-way path of revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the Unabomber's first published
interview since he was arrested in 1996, Kaczynski, the man who
used package bombs to kill and maim for nearly two decades, said
his discovery of a road in a wilderness sanctuary set him on a
mission to topple modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on,'' Kaczynski said, ``I decided that . . . I
would work on getting back at the system. Revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, now imprisoned on a life sentence in Colorado, made
the comments in an interview published this week in the
London-based journal Green Anarchist.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1995, three people were killed and 23 injured by
elaborate bombs credited to the Unabomber, who targeted workers at
universities, airlines, biotechnology companies, and advertising
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski was interviewed by Theresa Kintz, a former writer for
the Earth First! journal in Eugene, Ore. Kintz, who had been
corresponding with Kaczynski, said she had spoken with him over
four days in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Unabomber's explosions have been traced to a 1978
blast at Northwestern University, Kintz said Kaczynski had told her
he did not fully commit himself to violent revolution until 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In that summer, Kaczynski said, he struck out for one of his
favorite places: a rugged, lonely plateau about two days from his
cabin in Lincoln, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many people around my cabin, so I decided I
needed some peace. I went back to the plateau, and when I got there
I found they had put a road right through the middle of it,''
Kaczynski said. ``You just can't imagine how upset I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski said he ahd been driven to action he would have
preferred to avoid. ``The honest truth is that I am not really
politically oriented. I would have really rather just be living out
in the woods,'' he told Kintz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody had started cutting roads through there and cutting
the trees down and come buzzing around in helicopters and
snowmobiles, I would still just be living there, and the rest of
the world could just take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Kaczynski did not confess to any crimes of
violence, but said that a successful revolution against modern
society, which he advocates, would result in massive loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who realize the need to do away with the
techno-industrial system, if you work for its collapse, in effect
you are killing a lot of people,'' Kaczynski said from federal
prison in Florence, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't ask for any special treatment or to be treated in
any certain way,'' Kintz said of Kaczynski. ``There was no limit on
what I could ask him, but he reserved the right to decline to
answer questions on specifics in the Unabomber case.''
</P>
<P>
   Kintz said she resigned from Earth First!, which opposes
violence, when the journal's editors declined to publish the
interview because of its content. John Connor, the editor of Green
Anarchist, said he had heard Kintz's tapes of the interview. ``The
range of details, political beliefs, and personal information on
the tape could only have come from Kaczynski,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski told Kintz his disillusionment with society began in
1962, his senior year at Harvard University.

   1. DESPERATE TO SEEM 16 For the entertainment industry, the
money is in teenagers. Never has there been so much opportunity for
the young and the hungry. There are huge numbers of viewers,
spearheaded by teenage girls, who will pretty much see or watch
anything as long as the actors and actresses look like teenagers
too. Networks are convinced that the teenage audience is a highly
desirable niche, mostly because advertisers think so -- boys and
girls are making many of their own consumer choices before they are
out of puberty and advertisers want to reach them. For aspiring
actresses and actors, making it in Hollywood means making it right
now - before you look 20. By Lynn Hirschberg. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (8,200 words) + edited article
available.

GEORGE CLOONEY GOES FOR GOLD ON THE SILVER SCREEN George Clooney
thinks he's a good actor. Sometimes, anyway. One of the failures
that he frankly admits is ``Batman and Robin'' (1997.) ``I saw part
of it the other day on cable and cringed through it.'' Clooney, the
handsome and charismatic former star of the television series
``ER,'' has yet to score on the big screen. He's trying again with
``Three Kings,'' an ambitious mix of black comedy, action and drama
set amid the chaos of the Gulf War. Clooney believes that Hollywood
is mistaken in assuming that moviegoers want only bland, easily
digested fare. By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.

MOLLY SHANNON : FINDING LAUGHTER IN TEARS A hospital waiting room
doesn't seem like the place to get your start in stand-up comedy,
but 4-year-old Molly Shannon didn't choose it. That choice was made
by the driver who killed her mother. She spent her time in the
hospital waiting room trying to make the other kids laugh. ``I
thought they had it worse than me,'' she recalls. ``I come from a
sad place and the only way I could make peace with it was by making
others laugh. She has achieved success on ``Saturday Night Live''
and is currently riding a hot streak with a role in the Dr. Seuss
classic, ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.'' By Cindy Pearlman.

HOG HELL : A LIVE-ACTION 'ANIMAL FARM' HITS A TIMELY NOTE During
more than 25 years of covering Hollywood, Ivor Davis has
interviewed hundreds of personalities, but this summer he found
himself in an ornate ballroom at Pasadena's Ritz-Carlton hotel
putting questions to a 300-pound pig. This state-of-the-art
animatronic pig called Napoleon is the star of the formidable
``Animal Farm,'' a remarkable film version of George Orwell's
classic 1945 satiric novel in which an animal revolution gradually
devolves into a ruthlessly repressive system worse than that of the
humans they have overthrown. (The London-based Creature Shop has
used sheer technological magic to create an entire barnyard of
talking pigs, donkeys, horses, geese, dogs and sheep for the film.)
Napoleon even answered reporters' questions - slightly better and
more articulately than the average television starlet. By Ivor
Davis. 1,500 words + photo.

HOLLYWOOD DISH ``I love food,'' says Matt Damon. ``Everything bad -
I love pizza, beer, chocolate and spaghetti.'' Sounds like a case
for Carrie Latt Wiatt, nutritionist to the stars. She is the
founder of Diet Designs, Hollywood's most high-profile calorie
counter. Her custom-made meals have been delivered to many
Hollywood types who need help staying svelte between movies. When
Alicia Silverstone couldn't get into her catsuit for the last
``Batman'' film, director Joel Schumacher called on Wiatt for help.
Aside from her skill at preparing restaurant-quality, nutritionally
balanced food in moderate but satisfying portions, Wiatt's secret
lies in tailoring her daily menus to suit the celebrity's
individual tastes and she takes into account the dieter's sweet
tooth. By Louise Farr. From W magazine. 1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
CHRIS CARTER GETS VIRTUAL ``Harsh Realm'' is virtually here. This
is ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter's latest excursion into the
dark and bizarre, following the relative failure of ``Millennium''
and just as ``X-Files'' enters its final season. Carter found
inspiration for his new saga in James Hudnall's comic book ``Harsh
Realm,'' the 1982 sci-fi classic ``Blade Runner'' and such war
epics as ``Stalag 17'' (1953) and ``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998.)
``Harsh Realm'' is a parallel world that provides allegorical
potential. It's a world without God, without codes, standards and
morals and a man who is trying to change this world. By Ian
Spelling. 1,000 words + photo.

 &HT;    TAKING THE LONG VIEW INTO THE FUTURE

   WASHINGTON _ Ancient Egyptians buried their dead inside massive
pyramids built to last forever. Medieval architects designed
churches that took centuries to construct. The Founding Fathers
drew up a constitution to guide this nation for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   For these visionaries, the future stretched far into the
distance. But today, accepting an invitation to a Super Bowl party
would amount to long-term planning for most Americans. With cell
phones, microwave ovens, electronic mail, jet planes and other
technologies speeding up daily life, our time horizons seem to be
getting shorter.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nowhere does the future seem nearer than in the
nation's capital where lawmakers' internal clocks are set by the
nightly newscast and the next election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, before this millennium ends, Congress must make decisions
that could affect the people who will be wearing party hats and
blowing horns on Dec. 31, 9999. (CQ) The issue involves the safe
storage of nuclear fuels, which remain lethal for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear waste storage legislation, to be taken up this week in
the Senate, will set radiation-exposure standards for Yucca
Mountain, a 6,000-foot-high mountain ridge northwest of Las Vegas.
The Energy Department wants to use the interior of the mountain to
store 70,000 metric tons of high-level waste from nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The waste would be put into steel containers designed to last
10,000 years. That seems like very long-range planning, until
scientists point out that the peak dose of radiation may not occur
for another 300,000 years, after the nuclear waste has had time to
cook the surrounding walls of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   How can Congress set standards for a storage facility that will
have to work well for hundreds of thousands of years?
Environmentalists point out that earthquakes frequently rumble the
earth not far from Yucca Mountain, which is ringed by volcanoes.
Will earthquakes, eruptions, global warming or other factors allow
water to enter the storage area and carry radioactive materials
into the water table?
</P>
<P>
   The irony of our age is that while we are making more products
for short-term use, from electricity to Styrofoam cups, we are
generating wastes that will last longer and longer.
</P>
<P>
   To help people think about the long-term impact of their
choices, a group of ``futurists'' in northern California is raising
money to build a clock to last 10,000 years. The Clock of the Long
Now, as the non-profit foundation calls the contraption
(www.longnow.org), would be built somewhere in a high desert and
would tick just once a day to remind fast-living Americans to think
about future generations. To be built on a scale similar to the
stone pillars at Stonehenge, the giant clock would have chimes that
ring once each millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of Americans who have yet to make plans for
this year's New Year's Eve, the Long Now planners may seem to have
a few cuckoos already in their clocks.

 &HT;    Capturing memories of Latinos, World War II
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They weren't old men back in the 1950s. They
were still young and sometimes boisterous and occasionally somber
when they recalled the mutual experience that had shaped them.
</P>
<P>
   They would sit, drinking, smoking and remembering _ remembering
being taken a long way from home to learn to perform unfamiliar
tasks. They remembered then and still what their little piece of
history looked like in what Studs Terkel called the ``Last Good
War.'' When I was a kid, I soaked up the stories my father and his
friends would spin about those days. Their stories centered on
their training, tough sergeants, buddies, memorable pay-day antics,
winning and losing poker hands. No one talked about combat much.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget my father's paradoxical comment about how
World War II saved his life. Before the war, his view of the future
was one of long rows of cotton that needed picking. The war had
given him a glimpse of an alternate destiny and a shot at the
education to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   World War II was a turning point for many people, many groups,
but the changes the war forged for Mexican Americans in the
Southwest were profound.
</P>
<P>
   The war had given my parents' generation of Mexican Americans
the confidence to challenge the old ways of the old Texas, where
signs that read ``No dogs or Mexicans allowed'' and the attitude
behind them were a constant. The GI Generation changed that.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who grew up with them know the story. Unfortunately,
as the men and women who reshaped Texas after the war leave us, the
story leaves with them.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez, a journalism professor at the
University of Texas at Austin. She has mounted an ambitious effort
_ to put together a symposium on the Latino experience in World War
II complete with a photo exhibit, oral histories, expert panels,
the works and pull it off by May 26.
</P>
<P>
   It's a daunting task and one in which students will be mobilized
to become the infantry, seeking out the pictures and the stories of
those who participated in the war against fascism that ended and
mounted the attack on bigotry that endures.
</P>
<P>
   To be candid, she was reluctant to talk much about the two-day
project because she doesn't have the staff she needs to handle the
response. The concept got some ink in the San Antonio Express-News
this summer, she recalled, and she was overwhelmed by the volume of
calls and letters she got.
</P>
<P>
   People couldn't wait to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why she can't wait much longer. A brochure has been
put together calling for academic papers for the symposium to be
called ``U.S. Latinos &AMP; World War II: Changes Seen, Changes
Wrought.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivas-Rodriguez, 44, like many of her contemporaries, grew up
with the story and is surprised to find that interest in World War
II is as strong as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that 500,000 Latinos served in World War II, and
it's said that Latinos were the highest decorated ethnic group to
serve. They served in all theaters and in all capacities and as
officers and enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   There were aviators, there were infantrymen, they were Marines,
sailors, medics, military police. You name the job, Latinos helped
do it.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know that from the movies (one notable exception:
Ricardo Montalban's character in 1949's ``Battleground.'' He was
killed about 30 minutes into the film.). You wouldn't know it from
television, and you wouldn't know it from much of the mainstream
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the stories of these men and women have been virtually
untold, either in the mass media or in scholarly writings. The main
problem has been the small numbers of U.S. Latino journalists,
scholars and other writers who would document the lives of this
generation. This project seeks to capture the words of these men
and women,'' the brochure reads.
</P>
<P>
   The professor wants to help tell those stories before they are
lost for good. I want to help, too. The e-mail address for
Rivas-Rodriguez is latinoarchives(at)www.utexas.edu.

 &HT;    Hair today, gone tomorrow; will it grow back?
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My mother is going to kill me. I know, I'm
too old to worry about what my mother thinks, but we all do as long
as they're alive. And when she sees what has happened to my head,
she will not be happy. As it happens, she'll be down this weekend
for a visit. Great timing, considering my parents come down this
way maybe twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   To explain, the past few years I've taken to wearing what's left
of my hair fairly short. Low maintenance, cooler outside, and I'm
not one to care much about appearance anyway. My mother hates it,
wants my hair back to combable length all around and not buzzed on
the sides. This, understand, is the same woman who used to force me
to get hair cuts in high school when I was bent on growing it down
to my shoulders. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. In a weak moment, I made a pledge to
volunteers with the Nacogdoches County Chamber of Commerce, which
held a membership drive last week. I'm about to take over as
chairman next month, so I promised that if we got more than 200 new
members _ a 33 percent increase _ I would allow someone to buzz my
hair down to the scalp on stage at the finale party. The paid
chamber executive also agreed to do so, but he has hardly any hair
and gets paid to do this stuff, so don't waste pity on him.
</P>
<P>
   Waste it on me. I look like a short, bespectacled version of
Woody Harrelson in ``Natural Born Killers.'' We signed up 208 new
members, nine more than I was hoping for. Do the math. I did and
started looking for an exit, but I was caught like a rabbit in a
briarpatch. I was escorted on stage by two women, one of whom works
for me, and they proceeded to take off the safety guard on the
clippers and buzz my noggin down to the kind of stubble a man feels
if he quits shaving for a day, two at the most.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who works for me took far too much delight in turning
me into Elmer Fudd in front of about 75 wildly cheering
ne'er-do-wells. First thing I said to her the next day was, ``So,
how's the job search going?'' She didn't take me seriously, as well
she shouldn't _ good help being hard to find, and my hair fairly
likely to grow back.
</P>
<P>
   I say fairly likely. Remember what happens if you cut your lawn
_ which is already barely hanging on because of the heat and
drought _ too short in the dog days of August. You can kill that
sucker quicker than you can say Yul Brynner. What if that happens
to me? I'll be joining the Hair Club.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, I've either been out of the office or on
vacation, so I've taken to wearing a floppy fisherman's hat I
bought at Wally-World. It's khaki and has a Dallas Cowboys star in
the center. I love this hat, though my affection is apparently not
shared with anyone who has opted to comment on it. Most remarks are
along the line of, ``What's up with that weird hat?'' I lift it,
show my skull and elicit some type of strong reaction _ gasps,
shrieks of laughter, looks of horror. It's great to provide some
small measure of amusement to others.
</P>
<P>
   One of my golfing buddies took a look at me, sans hat, and said,
``You know, I never realized you had such a peculiar looking
skull.'' With friends like that ...
</P>
<P>
   There are some fringe benefits. Women love to rub my head. I
don't know why. Maybe they think a genie will pop out of my ear and
grant them three wishes. Old women, good-looking women, little
girls, nearly every female I've run across that knew me before the
Great Buzz, has immediately reached out (or in most cases down) and
rubbed my head. I'm starting to worry that all that rubbing is
going to impede hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   The other benefit is obvious, though I still can't quit the
habit. I jump out of the shower each morning and immediately reach
for a brush to comb my hair. Never have used a hair dryer, or hair
spray or any other foo-foo stuff, but I always attempted to get as
much of my hair going in the same direction as possible. Without
exception, each morning since this happened, I've reached for the
brush and then realized there was no need. Another 12 seconds saved
in the morning rush to get out the door and to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is growing back, though slowly. My forehead with stubble is
now even with my ears, something that was slightly less obvious
with a half-inch or so of hair up top. I'm thinking about growing
it long enough where you can't see my scalp from 50 yards away and
then keeping it at that length, so I still don't have to mess with
combing it.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell my mother. I plan on selling her on that scalped
lawn theory I mentioned a while back.

 &HT;    Is gun control a defining issue?
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the wake of mass murders in a Fort Worth
church and a Littleton, Colo., school, gun violence and gun control
are politically hot.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats' leading presidential
candidate, hopes to use gun control as a club against the GOP
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who does not want to
strengthen existing gun laws but thinks enforcement must be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   While allowing licensed people to carry handguns is still
popular in Texas _ 62 percent favored it, according to The Texas
Poll in April _ gun control wins more backers, particularly among
women and minorities, in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats obviously hope public opinion has shifted enough
to turn Bush's position from a political advantage in Texas, the
South and parts of the West to a larger disadvantage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's position on guns resemble those of his father, former
President Bush. In the elder Bush's race for president in 1988
against Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush got enormous support from
the National Rifle Association and other anti-gun control
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's October 1988 magazine featured a purported quote by
then-Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, saying that he wanted to
``disarm'' gun owners. The quote was actually from a Republican
supposedly quoting Dukakis in 1986. Dukakis said he was for
cracking down on cheap handguns, but not rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   But that issue alone was enough for Dukakis to lose the votes of
a lot of Democrats in places like East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, George W. was running against incumbent Democratic Gov.
Ann Richards. He and the gun groups made much of Richards' veto the
year before of a bill to allow a nonbinding referendum on licensing
people to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Texas Police Chiefs Association he'd not only have
signed the right-to-carry bill, but also would have voted ``yes''
in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   It helped Bush that his effort to unseat Richards coincided with
two other political forces:
</P>
<P>
   _ A big anti-Clinton effort nationally by Republicans in the
1994 congressional elections that won them control of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ An assault by the Gun Owners of America on incumbent
congressmen they considered even mildly anti-gun _ such as House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Beaumont), who, even
though he opposed gun control, had compromised on the Clinton
administration's crime bill, which included a waiting period for
handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after his victory, Bush honored his pledge, signing a
bill to allow people to carry concealed weapons with a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bush's dad quit his life membership in the NRA after
the group's spokesman called members of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms ``jackbooted thugs'' who harass gun owners.
Gov. Bush didn't have that option or problem, since he ``is not and
never has been a member of the NRA,'' his office says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he signed a bill amending the right-to-carry law to
remove a ban on carrying concealed weapons into places like
churches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he signed a bill limiting the ability of Texas
municipalities to file lawsuits against gun manufacturers for
injuries caused by their products.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to help revive a stalled bill that would have
required instant background checks at gun shows. Bush said he
supports such checks, but maintained that the federal government,
not the states, should take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush had a joint press conference with Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn and federal U.S. attorneys from around Texas to
announce a program to coordinate federal and state prosecution of
criminals who use guns, to maximize their punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his support for the effort began weeks before the Fort
Worth church massacre _ a statement echoed by U.S. Attorney Paul
Coggins of Dallas, a Democrat and Clinton appointee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats may be able to excite voters against Bush on guns.
Yet while national polls show a majority would favor more gun
control, only a handful of pro-control voters consider it a
defining issue. Meanwhile, the pro-gun forces take gun ownership
rights very, very seriously.

 &HT;    Want to read a dirty, silly book you can't put down?
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new novel by Austin, Texas, writer Neal Barrett Jr., titled
``Bad Eye Blues'' (Kensington Books) is outrageous, downright silly
in places, has an impossible plot and often unbelievable
characters, but I couldn't put the darn thing down until I'd
finished it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all the above, this book is filled with vulgar,
bad taste situations, language and episodes that made me want to
throw the darn thing into the fireplace and burn it. But not until
I'd finished reading the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   What caused me to pick it up and start reading it? That's always
a good question unless a book is by an author one has previously
read and enjoyed or been severely provoked by, neither of which was
the case here. I think what piqued my curiosity, besides the title,
was the book's dedication, that read: ``With love and respect, this
one's for Joe R. Lansdale, my evil twin.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lansdale, as you may or may not know, is a writer of really
funny mysteries who lives in Nacogdoches. I've read a couple of his
books and think they are unusual and worth spending time on,
although for some unknown reason I have yet to review one in this
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Eye Blues'' is one of a series by Barrett starring bug
artist Wiley Moss. That's right, bug artist. He draws bugs for such
publications as National Geographic and other magazines that
glorify insects. He draws them anatomically correct, you see, if
anatomical is the right word for bug parts.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it is this talent and job that gets Wiley Moss in
trouble at the outset of this particular Wiley Moss adventure. He
is just beginning what promises to be a wonderful evening with the
wonderful and lovely aeronautical engineer Claire de Mer when he is
kidnapped by two dangerous looking mugs who transport him all the
way across country to Idaho, by plane, limo and bus.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in this small out-of-the way Idaho resort, or what
purports to be a resort although there doesn't seem to be anyone
there but a group of prostitutes and a couple of gangster types who
seem to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The chief gangster explains that he has kidnapped Wiley and had
him brought there so he can draw portraits of the whores, who love
to frolic in the resort's pool. Naked.
</P>
<P>
   Being kidnapped for this purpose is, of course, not all bad, but
Wiley soon begins planning to escape, perhaps with Laurel, his
favorite naked prostitute. But escape is not easy. A raging forest
fire breaks out as Wiley and his new friends begin their complex
escape plan which is complicated by the fire and several mysterious
shoot-outs that kill several strangers and some people who are
known to Wiley and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of their temporary hiding places is a topless domino parlor.
Another is Bob's Marmot City &AMP; Rattlesnake Farm.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. As I said above _ outrageous, downright
silly/often unbelievable characters and lots of vulgar, bad taste
dialogue and action.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like your cup of tea, rush right to the nearest
book store and get a copy of ``Bad Eye Blues.'' You'll love it.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I was disgusted, all the way to the last outrageous
page.

maybe twice a year. To explain, the past few years I've taken to
wearing what's left of my hair fairly short. Low maintenance,
cooler outside, and I'm not one to care much about appearance
anyway. My mother hates it, wants my hair back to comb-able length

   COXNET TRAVEL 0928 -- Old San Juan, Puerto Rico _ a
20-square-block district of cozy streets, shady plazas and Spanish
colonial architectural gems _ beckons with Caribbean lore and
legend, a window into the fascinating early years of European
discovery and conquest. (Williams, Cox Washington Bureau) Art
includes a 3-column color photo of a man walking a street, a

   TRAVEL-YURTS _ NANTAHALA GORGE, N.C. _ Yurts _ canvas huts
modeled after the living quarters of ancient nomadic Mongolian
tribes _ are to tents what the Ritz-Carlton is to Motel 6. Each of
the eight fat, round, rust-colored dwellings at the Falling Waters'
Adventure Resort yurt village, near North Carolina's Nantahala
National Forest, boasts amenities that would make your average
flannel-clad woodsman spit in disgust: A polished Douglas fir
floor. A comfy canopy bed flanked by Pottery Barn-style side tables
and lamps. A refrigerator, coffee maker, ceiling fan, space heater,
chest-of drawers. If one must be camped in the woodsy recesses of
Western North Carolina, fending off Blair Witch-type sounds at
night, one could do far worse.(Hamilton, Atlanta

Greece. And onward by air _ to Cairo, Bangkok, and Hong Kong. Chad
found an online travel agency called Ticket Planet

rivalries, new classes, possible Halloween costumes _ they're

include a country music show from Nashville, a TV edition of

   BOOKS-EYMAN-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Booksellers and
publishers struggling to stay alive have a new study that explains
why they're struggling to stay alive. The study informs us that
people ages 55 to 64 read for 53 minutes a day compared to those in
the 25 to 29 bracket, who read for only 24 minutes a day. While it
might be logical to focus on that portion of the market that reads
more, that would also mean having to constantly replenish said
market, which is in the process of dying off. (Eyman. Palm Beach

the eight fat, round, rust-colored dwellings at the Falling Waters'
Adventure Resort yurt village, near North Carolina's Nantahala
National Forest, boasts amenities that would make your average
flannel-clad woodsman spit in disgust: A polished Douglas fir
floor. A comfy canopy bed flanked by Pottery Barn-style side tables
and lamps. A refrigerator, coffee maker, ceiling fan, space heater,
chest-of drawers. If one must be camped in the woodsy recesses of
Western North Carolina, fending off Blair Witch-type sounds at
night, one could do far worse.(Hamilton, Atlanta

   VASILIYEVKA, Russia _ The killer was a neighborly grandmother
driven to carnage to protect her precious and meager livelihood, a
small plot of potatoes.
</P>

   The victim, unemployed since the town's only factory shut its
doors seven years ago, had turned to plundering local vegetable
fields in the dark of night to survive and stoke his addiction to
vodka.

<P>
   On a cool summer evening 64-year-old Valentina Dolgopyatova
caught her neighbor, Nikolai Sidorenko, 47, digging up her crops.
They wrestled over the burlap sack of potatoes in his hands. The
big man swung a spade. She lunged with a five-inch boning knife.

   It took only minutes for him to die face down in a pool of his
own blood at the edge of the potato patch.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a difficult decade of Russia's economic collapse to
reach this desperate condition in a country that has failed to
complete its transition from Communist rule to free-market
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This story of dust, sweat and bloodshed in the southern Russia
village of Vasiliyevka, three hours by car north of Rostov-on-Don,
is not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of Russians depend on their small garden plots
for survival. Across Russia, almost daily, police in cities and
hamlets receive reports of thefts and, in some cases, violence in
the struggle for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very difficult,'' explained Dolgopyatova, whose eyes
welled with tears as she recounted the story of killing Sidorenko.
The authorities recently announced they would not prosecute her for
the homicide in late June, ruling that she acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we grow is all we have,'' she added, standing at the spot
where her victim collapsed and died from the knife wound to his
abdomen, still gripping the bag of freshly unearthed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Vast numbers of Russians have been left behind in Russia's
troubled transformation since the Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991. Wages have fallen, industries and jobs have disappeared and
corruption has soared.
</P>
<P>
   In Belaya Kalitva (pop. 42,000), the regional center and nearest
city to Vasiliyevka, the average monthly salary is about US$25;
Pensioners get even less, about US$16 each month, said Alexander
Krug, deputy editor of the local newspaper. ``People are at the end
of their rope to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a vicious cycle of poverty, alcohol abuse among
men and a corresponding leap in the crime rate. Russia's swelling
ranks of poor _ four of every 10 Russians live below the poverty
line _ has turned pensioners and the under-employed into
subsistence farmers, growing vegetables, raising chickens and goats
on small plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Vasiliyevka (pop. 700), the cycle became a lethal
formula, resulting in a killing that resembles a barbaric tale of
medieval survival, not life at the edge of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, Dolgopyatova, plows and sows her small field by
hand with her 72-year-old husband Andrei. He spent a lifetime in
the coal mines. She also worked the mines, before being trained to
do piecework in the local fabric factory.
</P>
<P>
   Together, their pensions total about US$32 a month. They depend
on what they grow in a field next to their clapboard house to get
them through the bitter winter. Still, she is filled with remorse
about the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do differently? I would run home right away. I'd
say to hell with it. If he wants to take them, let him take them.
I'll be able to plant again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, while the economy was austere, people were fed
and cases of common theft was rare.
</P>
<P>
   But today police cannot keep up with similar food feuds across
the country. Police in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk said that
at least eight potato thieves were killed there over the summer,
including two men savagely beaten to death by watchmen hired to
patrol the plots.
</P>
<P>
   In July in the Siberian city if Tomsk, a 75-year-old grandfather
shot to death his beloved 21-year-old grandson late one night after
he mistook the young man for a thief out to steal from his onion
patch.
</P>
<P>
   Near Ivanovo, a city northwest of Moscow, a 42-year-old woman
was spared her life, but endured a Scarlet Letter style punishment.
Several plot-owners caught her digging in their fields. They took
her to a nearby bus stop where they tied her to a post, stripped
her to her underwear and hung a sign around her neck reading: ``She
was stealing potatoes.'' Police discovered her the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Such pilfering of crops took place in Soviet times, too. But
then it was sporadic, not widespread and violent as today, said
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Rostov region is abundant with fertile farmland
that is laced with veins of coal deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But in Belaya Kalitva, eight of 10 coal mines have closed, as
have two out of three of the city's major factories. A
once-productive collective farm in Vasiliyevka is now overgrown
with weeds and the rusting hulks of machine equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely everything is dying here. There is no work to be
had anywhere,'' said Alexander Yemelin, the chief investigator who
worked the potato-killer case. Driving through the outskirts of
Belaya Kalitva and surveying the depressed landscape, Yemelin
added: ``NATO hasn't bombed us, even though it looks like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old investigator is overworked and underpaid. There
have been a record 20 murders in Belaya Kalitva so far this year.
Unless the economy improves and authorities can get crime under
control, there will be more, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The no-nonsense investigator has two pictures on his office wall
_ former Soviet leader and hard-line KGB chief Yuri Andropov and
actor Arnold Shwarzeneggar, wielding a high-caliber weapon in a
scene from the film ``The Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But the system he works for cannot protect the people, he
conceded. After a two-month investigation, the grandmother known as
``Babushka Valya'' was not prosecuted because ``we decided she
needed to protect herself,'' said Yemelin.
</P>
<P>
   The gray-haired lady, her face bronzed and deeply lined, had
been sitting at the edge of her small field watching on the lookout
for thieves after a next-door neighbor's patch had been pilfered
the night before. The knife she carried was to slice small bits of
lard and bread, which she chewed on while on guard at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she spotted in the distance a white figure bent down
in her field. She yelled to Sidorenko, but he kept on digging. As
she approached the man, she recognized him. They had both worked in
the nearby fabric factory and only recently she had given him some
food when he came by begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kolya, how can you do this?'' she asked, now standing
face-to-face with him in the small field of potatoes, corn and
pumpkin vines. ``I help you, and now you have come to steal my
potatoes?''
</P>
<P>
   He told her to get lost and when she didn't, he reached for the
spade. She brought the knife up to her chest. He raised the spade
to swing. She lunged towards him, piercing his side and severing an
artery.
</P>
<P>
   It was over before she knew it, and he staggered away,
disappearing into the darkness. She wasn't even certain if she had
stabbed him. Most importantly, she thought, he was gone, though he
had taken the sack of potatoes with him.
</P>
<P>
   When morning broke, Dolgopyatova went to the police with the
neighborhood friend who also had been robbed of her crops. The
authorities went to Sidorenko's house, but he wasn't home.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, they found him face down, about 40 yards from where
he and Dolgopyatova had struggled, hidden from view from the potato
plot by a rocky knoll.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother stares at the spot where his body was discovered
and shakes her head, her eyes once again going wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to give him bread and food and helped him. I don't know
what would make a man do something like that,'' she said. ``A man
loses his work, maybe that's it.''

 &HT;    IOC BOARD TO MEET, QUESTIONS LOOM OVER BIDDING FOR 1996 ATLANTA
GAMES
 &HT;    725&AMP;ADD

<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ At least one of Atlanta's competitors for the
1996 Games is expressing surprise and disappointment at the extent
to which Atlanta bidders flaunted International Olympic Committee
gift giving rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Bob Scott, the former head of the Manchester 1996 bidding
team, also rejected the assertion that Atlanta lobbyists were only
responding to the culture of the Olympic bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was that you didn't go out and buy a gift worth more
than $200, and that was the rule we adhered to,'' said Scott in an
interview from his home in Greenwich, England. ``To say that it was
a rule that was generally disregarded by everyone is simply
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who befriended many members of the Atlanta bidding team,
was disheartened to learn that his old rivals apparently played by
a different set of rules. ``We - the guys from Atlanta, Manchester,
Toronto and Melbourne - used to get together and complain bitterly
about the excesses of the group from Athens,'' Scott said. ``If it
now turns out that Atlanta was playing the same game, then I'm
rather sad.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report on Atlanta's bid details lavish gifts, personal
favors and travel offered to IOC members in the two years leading
up to Atlanta's surprise selection in 1990. The report, prepared by
former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, also includes accounts
of Atlanta bidders' offering college scholarships, job assistance
and other perks to IOC members and their families. The report,
which was prepared as testimony for Congress, is being reviewed by
the IOC's new ethics commission. The report could also be discussed
by the IOC executive board, which begins meetings Friday here, the
site of the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch gave the ethics commission
a copy of the report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Vice President Keba Mbaye is making a preliminary reviewing
of the report and will pass it on to the full ethics commission if
he finds substantial matters for the panel to pursue. ``If the
review of the report is completed, then that will be communicated
to the executive board, which will decide what to do next,'' said
Theo Chapman, an IOC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the IOC would do if it finds evidence of
wrongdoing in the Atlanta bid. However, many of the members
implicated in the Bell report have been ejected by the IOC
following an investigation of the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002
Winter Olympics. Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in
the Salt Lake City vote buying scandal. IOC members and their
relatives were paid $1.2 million in cash, college scholarships and
other inducements.
</P>
<P>
   While Scott expressed disappointment with the Atlanta
revelations, another competitor said he was not bothered by the
report. ``Look, there was one city in North America that got
through the really terrible economic times of the early 1990s _ and
that was Atlanta,'' said Paul Henderson, the former head of the
Toronto 1996 bid. ``Why was that? Because Atlanta had the Olympic
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, often a harsh critic of the 1996 Games and their
chief organizer, Billy Payne, said he was amazed at the complaints
over what Atlanta did to win the Olympics. ``It's kind of like
getting a tape of a hockey game and seeing a penalty and then
demanding to change the outcome of the game and investigate the
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the wining and dining to what civic leaders do
routinely to lure business to their cities. ``This is a $6 billion
prize, and you wanted to win it. When people came to Atlanta, Billy
took them to play golf at Augusta,'' he said. ``When they came
here, I took them sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put them in the best hotels and feed them at the best
restaurants. You don't take people like this to McDonald's,'' he
said. ``We flew Samaranch and his party on a private jet, too. So
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fan of Billy Payne, everybody knows that,'' Henderson
said. ``But he ought to be considered Atlanta's greatest hero
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also said that Atlanta's win had little to do with the
special treatment afforded IOC members. The competition for the
1996 Games was held in uncertain political and economic times of
the late 1980s as the Soviet Union was breaking up and the world
was undergoing a dramatic transformation. ``At the time, the IOC
saw the USA as the only safe haven,'' Henderson said. ``That's why
Atlanta won.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Congress's interest in Atlanta's bid as being
politically motivated to grab attention during an election year.
``And it's a very cynical kind of politics,'' said Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he has been approached by representatives of the
U.S. House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and
investigations but he has not been asked to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm defending Atlanta, then everyone oughtta know that they
didn't do anything wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Athens was among the five cities Atlanta defeated for the 1996
Games. During the campaign, bidders from the other cities
frequently accused Athens of excessive gift giving, entertaining
and violating IOC policies meant to keep the campaign above board.
Athens bidders denied they did anything wrong at the time, but
abuses in the campaign for the 1996 Games prompted the IOC in 1991
to review the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   No allegations have been made to the IOC about the conduct of
Athens during its campaign for the 2004 Games, which were awarded
in 1997. This is the IOC's first visit to Athens since the Games
were awarded. Organizers are eager to dispel reports of delays and
disorganization.

COMMENTARY: MANICHAEAN MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's assume the curator of the National Gallery in Washington
came up with a show called ``Outrage.'' It featured a statue of
Moses wearing a Nazi swastika on his chest, a painting of a violent
Martin Luther King Jr. forcing Elizabeth Cady Stanton into
submission, and an avant-garde collage of the cutest puppy you ever
saw being tortured to death by a sadistic homosexual. As Mort Sahl
used to say, ``Is there anybody I haven't offended?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes; Christians. In a real-life abuse of public responsibility,
good taste and artistic license, the curator of the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is presenting ``Sensation,'' featuring a portrait of the
Virgin Mary with her breast decorated by a piece of what is
described delicately as elephant dung. (As they say with a smirk at
the Brooklyn Museum, ``dung happens.'')
</P>
<P>
   The museum's serenely elitist board members are either
incredibly stupid or knew _ and did not care _ that this would (a)
offend the religious, (b) anger and divide the city, (c) make a ton
of money for the exhibition's owners, and (d) make the museum's
staff the heroes of free expression with their own set.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew, or should have, that their publicly financed
thumb in the eye of the faithful was a supremely political act.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani had to respond to reflect his values, and did;
the artist's press agent in London had to denounce the mayor's
withdrawal of funds as ``totalitarian and fascist,'' as he
delightedly did; and the mayor's senatorial opponent, Hillary
Clinton, had to march in liberal lock step with the rest of the
city's embarrassed, unhappy but principled cultural establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the hubristic Brooklyn Museum plunged the city into a
lose-lose battle. It's now the ``right to free artistic
expression'' versus ``the accountability of the spending of public
funds.'' Everybody to the ramparts and to hell with comity.
Absolutists of the world, unite: Go to court over the issue of free
hate speech and grind the losers' faces in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever wins, everybody loses. When basic principles are in
conflict, democracies work out compromises that reflect the
majority and protect the minority. A civil libertarian believes not
only in liberty but in civility.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as a big First Amendment type. I was
all for the Nazis' right to parade through Skokie and think the
flag-burning amendment is a travesty and sedition must be defended.
I'm for a private gallery's right to display outrage and sensation
and an offended public's right to picket peaceably.
</P>
<P>
   But limits exist: you can't steal this essay, protected by
copyright, and put it on your Web site. Nor can a museum defiantly
spend money raised by taxation for causes opposed by the majority
or disgust a significant minority. Sooner or later, the public's
elected representatives direct that spending or are replaced.
Freedom of expression is a right, but public payment for it is not
an entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Free-speech lawyers I know and respect say the mayor will lose
because the Supreme Court frowns on any ``penalty on disfavored
viewpoints.'' Maybe so; maybe the court's decision last year that
governments could impose a decency standard on taxpayer-paid
expression will not apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But believers in unfettered expression looking for an exciting
``Kulturkampf'' to drive the Yahoos from the temple should stop
before they win a Pyrrhic victory. If public museums win in federal
court the right to offend egregiously without being punished by
losing their subsidies, they will lose their subsidies beforehand.
The art world is thoughtlessly flirting with a democratic public's
pre-emptive censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Surely artists would be freer to shock if unworried by the loss
of taxpayer support. Privately financed institutions and commercial
galleries have that constitutionally protected advantage. But is
heavier reliance on private philanthropy what our cultural
Houyhnhnms really want?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the authors of this Manichaean madness _ museum
curator, chairman and the benefactors of ``Sensation'' _ send their
contributions directly to the Buchanan campaign? Nothing is helping
bigots more in dividing religions and races.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs mediators, not gladiators. This is not the Good
Fight; this is the wrong fight. Settle it before everybody loses.  &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    UNITED NATIONS _ Blue helmets decorated with U.N. flags, the
gleaming horizontal General Assembly building, feverish midnight
debates in the Security Council: These are well-known public images
of the United Nations at work. Behind the scenes, however, is an
equally far-reaching site of intense activity: the press room,
known as Room 226.
 &HT;    At the moment, Room 226 is under threat by a move that could
muzzle reporters.
 &HT;    In December, the General Assembly adopted a resolution, ``United
Nations Public Information Policies and Activities,'' which
contains a paragraph _ specifically, number 12 _ allowing diplomats
into the news briefings. A new resolution is calling on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enforce the December vote.
 &HT;    ``It's absolutely ridiculous,'' one Western diplomat said about
the measure, which was initiated by Algeria, and strongly supported
by Syria and Cuba.
 &HT;    I'm told that so far, no diplomats have tried to enter Room 226,
and that if they do, they'll be turned away.
 &HT;    To be perfectly clear, the press room is the site of conferences
on any number of hot issues of the day: Iraq, Kosovo, East Timor,
the World Bank, global crime, humanitarian relief, the threat of
landmines, famines and epidemics. The noon briefings are given by
Fred Eckhard, the chief U.N. spokesman, or a deputy. Other
sessions, which must be cleared through his office, are often
conducted by presidents and prime ministers, other top government
officials or U.N. experts on subjects ranging from nuclear weapons
to global infant mortality.
 &HT;    Within the U.N. press corps _ about 150 resident correspondents
and thousands of others accredited from international media
organizations _ there's the free press (major U.S. networks, the
BBC, The Times of India, etc.) as well as official government news
agencies (from China, Indonesia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, etc.).
 &HT;    I spoke to one Third World journalist who said she believes the
diplomats want to be in Room 226 to spy. She feels it would be like
Big Brother taking notes. She says that some reporters already feel
they're at personal risk for not always portraying their political
leaders in a glowing light.
 &HT;    Other colleagues, particularly from authoritarian regimes, fear
being isolated or tagged as traitors or troublemakers. They don't
want to be seen asking ``hostile'' questions whose answers might
put their states in a bad light. They say they fear that such
behavior might prompt a call to return home for reprisal or
dismissal.
 &HT;    In any country, government officials make their displeasure
known. For example, I got a call from a Western European diplomat
complaining about my characterizing his country as an ``ally'' of
Iraq. Instead, he said, it was merely a ``supporter.'' Other
correspondents have more frightening stories of harassment to tell.
 &HT;    The new measure is all the more ironic because the U.N.
briefings are not secret proceedings. A camera is posted in back of
the rows of chairs to broadcast events live over the U.N.-TV
system, on the Internet and on local cable television. Monitors are
scattered around the headquarters _ at the delegates' entrance, in
the main lobby near the newsstand. A live audio feed runs to the
diplomatic missions. Transcripts are on the Net at www.un.org.
Every afternoon Eckhard, or his deputy, repeats the sessions for
diplomats, including the questions asked by reporters and the
responses.
 &HT;    True, the live broadcasts do not show the journalists' faces as
they ask questions. Only their voices are heard. But isn't that
enough?
 &HT;    Even now, without a camera in their faces, the more vulnerable
reporters will pass a tough question to a Western colleague to ask.
They fear voice recognition or the chance that a diplomat will
check around later to find out who asked what.
 &HT;    If the doors to Room 226 were open to all, the news briefings
might well turn into battles between advocates of clashing points
of view on the most politically sensitive, life-and-death issues
facing the world's people, rather than a forum in which you can
gather facts, figure out what's news and try to find the truth.
 &HT;    At times, bureaucrats or lobbyists or people from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) try to slip into the room,
but a U.N. staffer at the door rejects anyone without proper press
credentials. For security problems, a uniformed officer is shouting
distance away in the nearby diplomatic corridor.
 &HT;    The week of Sept. 20, when the General Assembly opened, there
were sessions on such issues as the death of a Western journalist
in East Timor, the rescue of Taipei earthquake victims, combatting
drug trafficking in Colombia, and Pakistan's case against India in
the International Court of Justice over the shoot-down of an
unarmed Pakistani aircraft. In a Sept. 22 meeting, journalists
questioned President Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria about Costa
Rica's stance against the Cuban embargo.
 &HT;    Clearly these aren't lunch-time chats.
 &HT;    Should diplomats from Indonesia be at a news briefing on East
Timor, ready to challenge whatever the press spokesman is saying?
Should those from Pakistan be able to try to advance their own
national agenda at a briefing about India?
 &HT;    I asked one member of the Information Committee, the key U.N.
group that introduced the resolution, why his colleagues who
support a free press didn't refuse to go along with paragraph 12 or
try to negotiate it out of the whole package.
 &HT;    At the time, he told me, there was concern, but there were
``bigger fish to fry'' _ by which he meant, at least in part, that
it was more important to avoid a power struggle and keep the
committee on track and running smoothly by consensus than to stand
up and fight for press rights.
 &HT;    Historically, this committee has been a site of contentious
debate. The members from East and West, and First and Third Worlds,
who have been reared in traditions that range from censorship to
freedom of speech, hold widely divergent views on what sort of
information should be made public _ all of it, part of it, none of
it or an official version of it.
 &HT;    A few members of the U.N. Correspondents Association are trying
to raise a red flag because buried as paragraph 12 is in the
original resolution, the demand to open the press-room doors hasn't
even been read yet by the majority of people it would most directly
affect.
 &HT;    If the new resolution passes _ it's on track for adoption by
November or December _ it could well provoke a major confrontation.
High-level U.N. officials say that Annan _ who dearly respects
freedom of speech and has called press freedom ``a cornerstone of
human rights'' _ will never allow diplomats the press-room access
they seek.
 &HT;    If the secretary-general rides in on a white horse to save the
day, he should do it. The problem is, nobody knows what the next
secretary-general will be inclined to do.

THOMAS AWAITS HIS TURN AT UNLV

<P>
   Jason Thomas clicked on the television set to see how some old
friends were doing when he got home to his Las Vegas apartment on
Saturday night. It didn't take long for him to realize that one of
his old buddies, namely USC quarterback Carson Palmer, wasn't doing
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Mike (Van Raaphorst) in there,'' said Thomas, who
is sitting out a year after transferring to UNLV from USC, ``I knew
there was something wrong. And I knew it must be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. Palmer is out for at least six weeks and possibly the
entire season after suffering a broken right collarbone while being
tackled by Oregon safety Michael Fletcher two plays before halftime
of USC's overtime loss to the Ducks. So, into the starting lineup
steps former starter Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas knows very well that it could have been him stepping in
for Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature to think about coulda or woulda,'' Thomas
said shortly after the Rebels finished a Tuesday night practice.
``Sure I thought about it for a minute. But you can't live your
life like that. I made a decision and I've moved on. I was worried
more about Carson being OK than what it meant to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Palmer were each recruited to USC by current UNLV
coach John Robinson. However by the February signing date, Paul
Hackett was the Trojans head coach. Although Thomas and Palmer were
the cornerstones of the recruiting class, they had distinctly
differ.niS3

`THREE KINGS' CAN TAKE A BOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David O. Russell's ``Three Kings'' weaves elements
from a wide range of war movies into a pattern that's unique, fresh
and quite marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out as a jaunty, irreverent treasure hunt in the Iraqi
desert, the film grows into an authoritative moral comedy.
Ingenious specifics gather profound metaphoric resonance as
director Russell, who wrote the ``Kings'' screenplay from an idea
by John Ridley, wrestles with the complications of Operation Desert
Storm _ a war that was fought against complex interpretation as
fastidiously as it was against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The movie strikes a surreal note immediately. Its first spoken
words _ ``Are we shooting?'' _ both express soldiers' confusion
about the state of their mission and call into question any way we
might have looked at the conflict. We're in a vast, arid landscape,
among a handful of American troops who've just won the Persian Gulf
War without, most of them, firing a shot. An Iraqi emerges from a
bunker, clearly to surrender; but with a gun still in hand, he's a
chance for the bored victors to squeeze off a little action before
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity for more rewarding action soon arises. In a
hilariously vulgar manner typical of the film's absurd and cutting
humor, three reservists _ recent father Troy Barlow (Mark
Wahlberg), religious baggage handler Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and
dumb country boy Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) _ find a map on a captive
enemy. A cynical Green Beret veteran, George Clooney's Capt. Archie
Gates, swoops down on the green trio, decides the map leads to a
horde of looted Kuwaiti gold, illegally commandeers a Humvee and is
soon leading our heroes deep into Saddam-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the loot, along with great stashes of consumer goods
ranging from cell phones to luxury cars, is easy. Getting away with
it proves much more difficult, but not for reasons Gates' raiders
could have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's soldiers are much less concerned about keeping the
dictator's booty than suppressing the Shiite uprising President
Bush has called for. Confronted with an army massacre of underarmed
civilians, our boys must decide whether they're going to act like
Americans or act like Americans _ get away with the fortune they've
won fair and square, or make a humanitarian stand that their own
command will not.
</P>
<P>
   In the cinematic equivalent of turning a whole army on its
flank, Russell deftly maneuvers the attitude of ``Three Kings''
from ``Kelly's Heroes'' high jinks through ``MASH''-like critical
satire and its thematic opposite, ``Casablanca''-style sacrifice
and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough of an accomplishment for any director, especially
one whose previous experience has been with insightful but
small-scale romantic comedies (``Flirting With Disaster,''
``Spanking the Monkey''). But Russell does much more here as he
unleashes a bombardment of original, loaded images in a
disorienting variety of film styles and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the meaning of an Arab work brigade
loading satchels of gold onto American military transports. Or what
it says about the high-tech, modern war we won so cleanly when, in
its immediate aftermath, a tanker truck of milk for the starving
becomes a high priority target.
</P>
<P>
   The real price of this supposedly low-cost victory is best
depicted by the U.S. soldiers' forced interactions with the Iraqi
people _ and not just those victims of Saddam's wrath. ``Three
Kings''' most audacious scenes occur between Wahlberg's captured
Barlow and Said Taghmaoui's Republican Guard interrogator. The
latter is a devout sadist and skillful (thanks to CIA training)
torturer _ and a grieving father with an incisive geopolitical
viewpoint. The bond that develops between these two is astounding,
totally unexpected and ever so oddly but palpably humane.
</P>
<P>
   It's emblematic of everything that makes ``Three Kings'' the war
movie of, and for, a terribly complicated decade. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Entertainment cottage industry David E. Kelley
deserves some serious time in the penalty box for his latest
misstep, ``Mystery, Alaska.'' Frighteningly similar in tone to
Kevin Costner's godawful baseball yawner, ``For Love of the Game,''
``Mystery'' will do nothing to curb Americans' apathy toward
hockey. It's as slow-moving as a Zamboni machine, wooden as a
hockey stick and as predictable as a goal scored on an open net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery'' is hampered most severely by its obviousness. After
the film introduces its numerous characters and superficial
subplots in the opening half-hour, there is absolutely no intrigue
as to how the subsequent events will unfold. The only question is:
How long will it take? The movie's excruciating two-hour length
somehow feels an hour longer, compounding the boredom it inflicts
on its audience by veering off in so many uninteresting directions.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the fictional titular town (but filmed in the Alberta
Rockies), ``Mystery, Alaska'' recounts the hopes and dreams of an
amateur pond hockey team that aspires to greatness. After a Sports
Illustrated article chronicles their hard-skating exploits,
opportunity comes knocking in the form of an exhibition game
against the NHL's New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Can these big-hearted skaters _ who regard hockey as more of a
religion than a sport _ measure up to the professional big boys?
Will the locals be seduced by the sudden media attention? Will a
Wal-Mart-like superstore be allowed to open in the town? Will the
mayor forgive his adulterous wife? Will the Rangers win a grievance
filed on their behalf by the NHL Players Union and avoid the trip
to Mystery altogether? Will a man named Tree finally learn to stand
tall?
</P>
<P>
   Answers to these and a dozen other tedious questions will be
revealed. But you must be patient, because the script (written by
Kelley and Sean O'Byrne) discards plot developments almost as
quickly as it establishes them, taking an almost perverse pleasure
in sabotaging dramatic momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The vast ensemble (Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds and Hank Azaria
are among the victims) fares horribly under the constraints of the
story and the pedestrian direction from Jay Roach (``Austin
Powers''). The filmmakers telegraph every moment, leaving no
dramatic ploy unturned. Characters don't talk as much as deliver
speeches filled with sports-movie platitudes that would make the
Gipper blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery'' fails so spectacularly on a dramatic level that it
seems an afterthought to find fault with its premise. But purists
will cringe at the implausibility of the idea that a team of pond
players could somehow learn NHL-style hockey in 32 days and skate
competitively against a professional team _ even if that squad is
the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The game action itself is OK. But by the time the puck drops,
this formulaic dud has committed so many major penalties that the
audience's rooting interest lies squarely with the Rangers. (If
this movie was made a decade earlier, the Mystery boys would be
playing the Russians.)
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that writer-producer Kelley will learn a
lesson from the failure of ``Mystery'' and this summer's
underwhelming ``Lake Placid'' and invest a little more time in his
next feature. Audiences can have long memories when they don't have
the option of switching the channel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Mystery, Alaska'' (R; strong language, sexual
situations). &UR;  &QL;

Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Maury Chaykin. &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   Willfully anachronistic and geared toward an audience whose
knowledge of highwaymen extends all the way back to ``The Road
Warrior,'' the swashbuckler ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' has visual
flair to spare. Unfortunately, that's about all it has. The movie
makes for pleasing enough eye candy, but it needed a little more
imagination and substance to avoid receding _ like its historical
subjects _ into the mists of memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett'' marks the directorial debut of Jake Scott, son of
famed helmer Ridley Scott, and it's proof positive that the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree. The senior Scott certainly has made
his mark on modern moviemaking (``Blade Runner,'' ``Alien,''
``Thelma &AMP; Louise''), but, for the most part, his career has been
characterized by films that look great but play stupid (``G.I.
Jane,'' ``Black Rain,'' among many others).
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely the problem with ``Plunkett,'' a period
buddy movie about an odd couple of thieves whose ambitions are as
different as their personalities. Will Plunkett (Robert Carlyle)
comes from the lower classes of 18th-century London and simply
wants to steal enough money to fund a boat ticket to America. His
unlikely partner, James Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), is a society
aspirant looking to finance his taste for the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Their method of operation is simple: Macleane, using his good
manners, infiltrates society events to find promising holdup
targets. After the gatherings, the two bandits make good on the
information, with Plunkett doing most of the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott, working from a slapdash screenplay credited to
four different writers (and it shows), stages much of the action in
the dark, which is just as well, given the number of unlikely
escapes the film's highwaymen make. Some of the robbery sequences
do have an undeniable visceral excitement, sustained by the
combative antagonism established between the two leads.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's key distinction is its blending of 18th-century
costumes and settings with modern-day attitudes. Examples: The
characters swear like Tarantino lowlifes. Revelers at a costume
ball dance to the strains of techno music. Video poster child Liv
Tyler attempts an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it works, some of it doesn't. The meshing of periods
isn't a bad idea, but the filmmakers shouldn't have confined their
ambitions merely to such optical flourishes. The story simply
doesn't go to many interesting places, and the mind begins to pay
more attention to Alan Cumming's purple suit than to superficial
events unfolding on the screen. (Cumming, playing a foppish lord,
is one of the best things about the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   So while it doesn't feel like highway robbery, ``Plunkett &AMP;
Macleane'' nevertheless comes off as a bit of a cheat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' (R; strong violence, sexuality
and language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Jake Scott. Screenplay by Robert
Wade, Neal Purvis, Charles McKeown (based on an original screenplay
by Selwyn Roberts). Released by Gramercy Pictures. &UR;  &QL;

KITCHEN CAN DOUBLE AS CLASSROOM FOR KIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Johnny doesn't get it when it comes to fractions
and Susie needs to practice reading. Don't send them to their
rooms, send them to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking uses many of the skills children struggle to learn and
it can be a fun way to reinforce those lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Susie to read instructions off a box or read the recipe for
pizza aloud. As she does, ask her to gather the ingredients from
the cupboards. (She'll need to read the labels carefully to select
the correct ingredients).
</P>
<P>
   Let Johnny learn fractions by making a pizza and cutting it in
half, thirds, quarters, eighths, whatever. Take pieces away to
subtract fractions, put them back to add fractions _ all the while
having Johnny write the corresponding math problems. Eat the pizza.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember not to make cooking as big a struggle
as schoolwork. Keep the activities fun by remembering:
</P>
<P>
   _ To start early. Cooking with children always takes at least
twice as long as if you made the meal by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to fret over spills and drips. Children are trying very
much to please you; don't ruin the lesson by being a clean freak
and trying to make them clean and cook at the same time. Everyone
can help clean up after the meal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Failure is learning, too. If a recipe flops, it may be because
they didn't follow the directions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   From a safety standpoint, make sure children aren't wearing
long, loose sleeves or dangling jewelry while cooking. Teach them
to wash their hands properly and handle food safely while cooking.
Keep knives sharp (dull knives are more likely to slip and cause
injuries) and resist the urge to use towels instead of pot holders,
as the towels can be cumbersome and catch on fire.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how the dish turns out, try to eat it with a
smile.

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ That ``Happy, Texas'' was a sensation at this year's
Sundance Film Festival says more about the dearth of quality at
that independent showcase than it does regarding the small
pleasures of this uneven little movie.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the screwball ``Happy'' certainly has an appealing
innocence and a fair share of laughs, it is handicapped by a
one-note premise and tedious last act that strains for madcap
zaniness. Lone Star state residents won't be bragging about this
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could have been worse. Take the setup: Two
convicts escape from prison, steal a beat-up Winnebago and wind up
forced to assume the identities of the vehicle's owners _ two gay
beauty pageant producers. But what could have been precious instead
becomes fairly inventive in the hands of first-time director Mark
Illsley, who also wrote ``Happy'' with Ed Stone and Phil Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the movie works pretty well for its first hour, serving
up some solid homespun hilarity that showcases the comic abilities
of its cast. Brit Jeremy Northam (seen this year in ``The Winslow
Boy'' and ``An Ideal Husband'') plays Harry Sawyer, a charming con
man who sets his sights on Happy's vulnerable bank and its lovely
manager, Josephine (Ally Walker).
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Harry's greasy-haired partner Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr.
(Steve Zahn) in charge of turning the town's little girls into
finalists for the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant, something that
hasn't been done for more than 25 years. Wayne isn't exactly suited
for the job _ he offers one little girl a cigarette as a reward _
but he soon warms to the challenge of doing something nice for once
in his life. A sweet schoolteacher (Illeana Douglas) lends her help
to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The film has its fun with small-town mores, but never in a
mean-spirited way. Northam displays a nice comic touch, and the
always amusing Zahn expands on the dim-bulb mannerisms he showed
off so well last year in ``Out of Sight.'' (His bushy moustache
alone is worth a few chuckles.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's William H. Macy who steals the movie, playing the town
sheriff who is determined to uncover various hidden identities,
including his own. Macy invests the character with the same winning
combination of humor and pathos that he used so memorably in
``Fargo'' and ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   It's disappointing that the film itself can't maintain that same
satisfying balance. By its last half-hour, ``Happy, Texas'' has
overstayed its welcome, dissolving into dippy chase theatrics
wholly lacking in originality and, more crucially, fun. What it
feels like is somebody telling a bad joke _ repeatedly _ and then
nudging you in the ribs, making sure you know how funny it is.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because director Illsley shows some promise
here. A graduate of USC's film school, Illsley worked with Kevin
Reynolds as second-unit director three times before getting his
chance with ``Happy.'' On the strength of the movie's freshness and
sometimes silly fun, he deserves a second try. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``Happy, Texas'' (R; language, sexual content and some
violence). &QL; 
The stars: Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, Ally Walker, Illeana Douglas
and William H. Macy. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Mark Illsley. Screenplay by Illsley,
Ed Stone and Phil Reeves. Released by Miramax. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _The world is full of Everymen who have a script in
their back pocket. Nearly all are destined never to see their dream
become a reality ... in most cases, for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   So it's remarkable that ``The Taxman,'' co-written by an actual
New York State tax investigator, got made in the first place. Even
more surprisingly, it's a very good mystery yarn: fast-paced,
exciting and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for the New York State Tax Department. Which is the
single worst job you could possibly have,'' says Al Benjamin (Joe
Pantaliano) in a gravelly, New York-accented voice at the opening
of ``The Taxman.'' He adds, ``I mean, let's face it: Everybody
hates the taxman. It's biblical.''
</P>
<P>
   The script moves deftly between irreverence and gripping drama,
never falling back on glib comments or stereotypes. Benjamin is a
burned-out tax investigator looking for a ``big break'' to give him
something to make him ``get out of bed every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The character surely speaks for Roger Berger, the
taxman-turned-screenwriter behind the film (he was actually a
struggling actor before becoming a civil servant in the 1970s). The
script is apparently based partly on an investigation of Berger's,
which, according to his biographical information, ``exposed a
conspiracy between Getty Oil and members of the Russian Mafia in
Brighton Beach (a heavily Russian enclave of Brooklyn).''
</P>
<P>
   No one encourages Benjamin in his quixotic quest to take on
organized crime and a Fortune 500 company at the same time. His
supervisors reprimand him. The police tell him to get lost: When
the high-strung investigator shows up at the scene of a murder he
thinks may be linked to the conspiracy, he's unceremoniously shown
the door by NYPD officers who scoff at his credentials as an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But out of that encounter comes Benjamin's unlikely sidekick, a
stuttering Puerto Rican officer named Joseph Romero (Wade
Dominguez). Romero, like Benjamin, feels he has little to lose by
pursuing this case: Since he's bad at shooting a gun and driving a
car, he's not exactly tagged for glory with the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a typical ``buddy movie,'' but these two misfits do
learn some important lessons together while working on the case. A
Russian named Andre Rubakov (Michael Chiklis, who played the title
role in ABC's ``The Commish'') becomes their key contact. Rubakov,
a hard-partying family man with a heart of gold, invites the pair
into his inner sanctum. Benjamin develops a crush on Rubakov's
daughter, played by ``Showgirl's'' Elizabeth Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   The strong ensemble cast is completed by Robert Townsend as
Peyton Cody, the crack prosecutor who is finally persuaded to take
the case to trial. The ending isn't typical Hollywood: Not all the
bad guys get jail time, and Benjamin doesn't get the girl. But
Benjamin, Romero and Cody all have a little bit more to live for
and celebrate in life, and the viewer is happy for that. &UR;
</P>
<P>

language). &QL;

TEXAS STADIUM OFFERS FANS AN INSIDE GLIMPSE OF THE COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Are you ready for some football? Nope, but it
happens every year without my participation. It invades my house
where a hardcore, Dallas Cowboy Football fan lives and breathes
football from September through January.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived in Texas for 20 years and have learned a little about
them Pokes, even if I can't quote statistics. Texas Stadium gleams
white and blue between state routes 183 and 114. On a recent
Saturday the parking lot wasn't overflowing, just a few cars were
parked near the Pro Shop. That's where shoppers check out the
latest in Cowboy goods and where the tours start.
</P>
<P>
   Every day but game day, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., tours leave from
the Pro Shop and troop through the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Shirlee Waller is a rookie this year and one of six Texas
Stadium tour guides. She led our group of about a dozen through the
stadium as workers were scurrying to prepare it for the first
pre-season home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been working for months to get ready for it,'' Waller
said. Earlier this year an Oliver Stone movie was filmed here.
Filmgoers may not recognize Texas Stadium in ``On Any Sunday,'' the
working title of a film about the fictional red-and-white Knights
coached by Al Pacino. Waller pointed to the field, with it's new
covering of Cowboy turf, the stands, the names of famous Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Want a piece of the old turf? It is $24.95 on a plaque in
Plexiglas at the store. This is the third covering of turf since
the stadium opened in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 2 1/4-acre hole in the dome ``so the players can play
in natural elements,'' Waller explained, ``and the fans are
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But the myths are better than the official explanation. There's
a hole in the top so coach Tom Landry could wear his hat, or (every
fan's favorite) ``so God can watch his favorite team.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Stadium opened in 1971 at a cost of $35 million, the same
cost as defensive back Dion Sanders' contract.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is immense. Waller pointed out the Diamond Vision
Screens high above and explained that they are three stories high
and weigh 20 tons each.
</P>
<P>
   Amy McGargill and her mother, Anne Benedict, two Troy Aikman
fans from Iowa, joined the tour. Both nurses, they joked about
getting jobs with the team. On the field, Benedict pointed to the
section where the two would watch the game the next afternoon. They
kidded around about holding signs saying ``Don't Do It Troy'' _
referring to his upcoming nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the tour took in a suite, this one belonging to the
City of Irving and comfortable for about 16 people. Waller
explained that suites go for between $250,000 to a $2 million and
owners pay property taxes and decorate them to suit their own
tastes. That cost does not include catering or game tickets. A
suite package for a game runs about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford that there is always a tailgate party, back
in the stadium parking lot after an absence of about 20 years. You
can buy the official Dallas Cowboys tailgate grill ($149) in the
Pro Shop and set the table with official Cowboy plastic cutlery
($4.99).
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive item in the Cowboys Pro Shop is a $3,700
bronze statue and the least expensive is a 75-cent helmet eraser.
Renate Kaa, the store manager, expects this year's big seller to be
the Troy Aikman cap, which at $19.99 is exclusive to the store.
</P>
<P>
   I'm partial to the Cowboy Cheerleader Dolls, a deal at $79.95,
because they stand out so smiling and girlie among the hats,
helmets, T-shirts and imitation Beanies with the names of Aikman
and Sanders emblazoned on them.
</P>
<P>
   The practice uniforms, at $99, are heaped in a bin with names
and numbers. ``Nope,'' Kaa said, ``you won't find anything with
Aikman's name on it in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the fanatics in _ they go for a pair,'' Kaa said.
</P>
<P>
   The uniforms of the players and cheerleaders are very popular at
Halloween. What you won't find hanging about the Pro Shop are the
players, but you might encounter one along ``autograph alley,''
along the side entrances of the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Marriott.
For about 10 years it has been the home game hotel for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Fairchild, the hotel's director of marketing, sounds like a
big team booster. Three days before game day, autograph alley is
cordoned off with a fence along Royal Lane. Parking is plentiful
and fans stand outside the fence along a shady tree line.
</P>
<P>
   Most team members ``will make an effort for kids,'' Fairchild
said. Breakfast for the players is in a private dining room, not
where guests eat. But you might hear the sound of blenders as a
number of players mix up their own energy drinks. While you won't
find Michael Irvin or Richie Cunningham lounging by the pool on
Sunday morning, you might spot Emmitt Smith heading through the
lobby bound for church with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The 490-room hotel sets aside one floor, about 30 rooms, for the
Cowboys. Hotel security is stationed on the stairwells. Some fans
have made some odd requests. Fairchild laughed a little and
admitted that someone offered to buy Aikman's used sheets, and
occasionally a guest wants to move into a player's room before
housekeeping has cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Cowboys have special requests for the hotel? Nothing
stranger than fried turkey legs or a midnight sweet snack and that
player will ``talk room service into bringing him stuff,''
Fairchild said. Then there is the player who has to have flip
charts in his room so he can do plays ``over and over.''

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The most important thing to know about ``Drive Me
Crazy'' before buying a ticket is that the title has absolutely
nothing to do with the story.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's borrowed from a soundtrack cut, Britney Spears'
``(You Drive Me) Crazy.'' That's a sure sign that the filmmakers
are paying too much attention to music and not enough to the script
_ and that the CD probably will do better than the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Drive Me Crazy'' suggests passion, desire, torment,
frenzy _ anything but the predictable scenario and rather flat
characters drawn by director John Schultz and screenwriter Rob
Thomas (``Dawson's Creek'').
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Joan Hart (TV's ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'') plays
Nicole Maris, a perky 17-year-old completely wrapped up in the
school social scene and her romantic pursuit of a certain
basketball jock (Gabriel Carpenter).
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Grenier (``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole'') is Chase
Hammond, Nicole's neighbor and childhood friend who's a social
dropout by choice. Nicole is consumed with accessorizing, planning
the school's big centennial dance and admiring the fair-haired Brad
(more accurately, the bleached weave Brad). Meanwhile, Chase is
plotting school pranks, shunning the popular crowd and hanging with
the pierced, tattooed and politically conscious at an over-amped,
underlit nightclub. He's a handsome guy, but he hides it behind all
that 'tude.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the movie, Nicole believes she has Brad on the hook and
is ready to reel him in, but he bypasses her for a cheerleader,
leaving Nicole publicly embarrassed and _ gasp! _ dateless for the
dance she's organizing.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Chase is dumped by his lusty,
raspberry-haired girlfriend, Dulcie (Ali Larter), over his
half-hearted opposition to animal experimentation, one of her
favorite causes.
</P>
<P>
   Let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Although they've barely spoken to each other since junior high,
Nicole persuades Chase to start dating her to make Brad and Dulcie
jealous and win them back.
</P>
<P>
   Chase agrees, even allowing Nicole to remake his image a la Gap
and drag him along with her crowd so often that he has no time left
for his real friends, the uncool Dave and Ray (Mark Webber and Kris
Park). That's one big flaw in Thomas' screenplay, or perhaps Todd
Strasser's novel, ``How I Created My Perfect Prom Date'' _ it's
hard to believe Chase would play such games and burn his best
buddies in order to win back Dulcie.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there is more manipulation and backstabbing than
in an episode of ``Melrose Place,'' more drinking than on a Mardi
Gras bender, and less meaningful conversation between parents and
kids than, one hopes, in most American families.
</P>
<P>
   The story culminates at the dance, a formal affair for students
and alumni that seems to have the budget of an Olympics opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Hart and Grenier do their best to find the reality in their
poorly drawn roles. One of Hart's most convincing moments is when
Nicole becomes staggering drunk on sloe gin fizzes or some other
fruity concoction.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of several times this movie depicts drinking among high
school students, not as an important element of character or plot,
but as a ho-hum part of life like choosing an outfit or deciding
whether you want fries with that burger. It may be the writers'
attempt to make the characters seem average, possibly more
acceptable to the teen audience, but it doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive side of the drinking issue is that the smashed
kids have enough sense to page Chase's friend Designated Dave, who
has taken it upon himself to get hearty partiers home safely. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Drive Me Crazy'' (PG-13; teen drinking). &UR;  &QL;

SMOKING DOCUMENTARY GIVES FOES ANOTHER REASON TO FUME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 2 stars

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If it's true that, as Joseph de Maistre said,
every country has the government it deserves, we're one sorry lot.
That is the overwhelming impression ones gets from the documentary
``Smoke and Mirrors: A History of Denial.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette manufacturers as obfuscating corporations that are
interested mainly in profits? Old news. But the fact that Congress
apparently forestalled any action against the tobacco companies for
decades _ in the face of clear evidence that smoking caused cancer
_ is appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke'' was funded by the American Lung Association, a fact
which is rightfully made clear at the outset of the film. The
tobacco industry would otherwise no doubt accuse the film of having
a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, virtually everyone has an agenda of some sort. The
agenda of a good documentary film is generally to expose a truth.
By that measure, ``Smoke'' is a success. It makes a case that both
independent research and research funded by the tobacco companies
themselves has for decades linked smoking to cancer and premature
death: Documents kept secret by the cigarette firms for decades are
discussed, and we see footage of mice experiments done 40 years ago
that linked smoking with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The film's downfall, however, is its dry earnestness and its
curious lack of more material that is entertaining, dramatic or
fresh. Aside from some interesting historical discussion of how the
cigarette companies overcame the social stigma against smoking in
the teens (they wrapped themselves in the flag, by supplying smokes
to American soldiers fighting World War I) and the aforementioned
history of inaction on the part of our government, there's not much
here that catches the viewer by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few old TV ads for cigarettes, along with a few
anti-smoking spots _ though not even the most dramatic ones, such
as the haunting spot where a cancer victim with a tracheotomy still
puffs on a cigarette through the hole in her neck. The fact is,
this movie preaches to the converted: It will surely stir those who
are fervent anti-smokers already.
</P>
<P>
   But for jaded, rebellious young people, those who are now being
targeted by tobacco companies, this documentary probably won't cut
it. Yul Brynner talking about cancer means nothing to them, and
they've never known a time when anyone trusted the government. How
do we reach them? Maybe MTV is a better venue for that. For that
matter, maybe television would have been a better venue for this
respectably done but slight movie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Smoke and Mirrors: A History of Denial'' (not rated). &QL; 
bold! &UR; The stars: &LR;  Narrated by Sharon Gless. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Torrie Rosenzweig. Produced and
written by Rosenzweig and Elise Pearlstein for the American Lung
Association. &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like a sophomore Introduction to Philosophy class
taught by porn stars, ``Romance'' is one of those unconscious
parodies of French cinema that takes itself too seriously to be in
on the joke. It's funny for a while _ and with the extra added
attraction of hard-core sex footage _ but the dreariness factor
here swamps whatever little entertainment value inadvertently
wiggles its way through.
</P>
<P>
   As for intellectual content, well, despite the high risibility
factor, there is some. Writer-director Catherine Breillat wanted to
make a sex film from a woman's point of view, and she has succeeded
in presenting explicit footage that no male on Earth is likely to
find arousing. Amid all the accompanying mumbo jumbo about gender
politics and the impossibility of love, a few choice observations
on the feminine libido manage to get tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   But Breillat has unfortunately developed a heroine of such
irritating self-absorption and stupidity that we can't come to care
about her dubious epiphanies or carnal frustrations. The answers we
want to shout at the screen in response to every overly analytical
argument boil down to ``Straighten up!'' or ``Get a life!'' Or a
combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Marie (Caroline Ducey) is a skinny elementary school teacher who
can't spell (and you thought the LAUSD had problems). She's living
with a pretentious model, Paul (Sagamore Stevenin), who says he
loves her but doesn't want to make love to her anymore. Perhaps due
to her dyslexia, Marie interprets this to mean that she should find
all the alternative sex partners she can and it won't really be
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   But then, duh, it isn't exactly fulfilling, either. She picks up
a real machine of a guy in a bar, but despite his efficiency, Paolo
(real-life Italian porn actor Rocco Siffredi) unfortunately flunks
the soul-mate test. Maybe she'll have better luck with the school
principal, Robert (Francois Berleand), a balding, middle-age schlub
who likes to boast about the thousands of women he's seduced (and
you thought the LAUSD had problems).
</P>
<P>
   Back at Robert's pitifully unimpressive makeout pad, he
introduces Marie to bondage. She bursts into tears at one point
during the tedious tying-up process, perhaps because she's finally
realized that she may be something of a masochist. Or maybe it's
just because, like us viewers, she's disappointed to discover that
S&AMP;M really requires a lot more work than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Marie grows increasingly obnoxious, except
for one moment of transient joy when she thinks of Robert, in one
of many unfortunately formed inner-voice monologues, ``He ties me
up without tying me down!''
</P>
<P>
   A slight but key variation on that line gives you the title of a
good Pedro Almodovar movie about sexual obsession as the path to
true romance. The difference between Almodovar and Breillat is that
he knows how to mix genuine, fully formed emotional intelligence
with outrageous erotic provocations, while she just tries to form a
connection between theory and smut. &QL;

WARM, FUZZY FEELINGS ABOUT CANDLESTICK PARK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The honored guest missed the start of its own
farewell party. For the last night of baseball at Candlestick, an
impostor stepped in to play the role of the old ballyard. Everyone
spotted the fake right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so disappointed that it's not windy and cold,'' said
Eileen Regan, who came down with a group from the Napa Valley. She
wore a spaghetti-strap sundress tucked into a pair of blue sweat
pants. A sweat shirt was tied around her waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fashion statement,'' Regan said. At any moment, she was
expecting the real 'Stick to show up. It never did. Tank tops ruled
on Wednesday night. Parkas stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   The flags over the stadium remained perfectly still, as if
finally worn out by 37 years of dancing a wind-driven Funky
Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dust swirling in the outfield. There were no
plastic bags skipping along the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Near the left-field foul line, Tom Leathers of Lafayette sat
quite comfortably without his hollow binoculars, filled with
contraband brandy to ward off the chill. Instead, he ate a cup of
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever done it,'' Leathers said,
glancing at the melting Ben and Jerry's. ``Oh wait, I take it back.
My son and I eat Drumsticks to start rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they think consuming pre-fabbed ice-cream cones
increases run production for their team. In other words, they are
the perfect Giants fans, well-suited to the goofiness that is, and
always has been, Candlestick baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ornery pile of concrete had to turn up one more
quirk before its demise. On its way to baseball obsolescence, it
decided to act like a stranger. It decided to act like a baseball
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans weren't completely surprised. After all, the last
night game was bound to come in late September, when summer finally
blooms in San Francisco. But Wednesday's warmth couldn't be
explained as an ordinary change of seasons. The 'Stick was in rare
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the weather gods' way of saying, `Sorry for
punishing you all these years,''' Giants manager Dusty Baker said.

   The Giants handed out their final batch of Croix de Candlestick
pins to the crowd of 47,343 on Wednesday night. The pins, decorated
with the snow-capped letters SF, have traditionally saluted the
fans who stayed through extra-inning night games. On the final
night at the 'Stick, the Giants finished off the Dodgers in nine,
and J.T. Snow capped the evening with a brilliant point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every night was like this,'' the first baseman said,
``there would have been no need to build a new stadium, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He was smiling when he said it, but the last laugh belonged to
the 'Stick. It didn't give 100 percent. It didn't come to play.
</P>
<P>
   A night game at the 'Stick has always been the best antidote to
San Francisco's sublime beauty, its finesse football, cutting-edge
restaurants, darling coffee shops and general proximity to the
idyllic life. In a place smothering in its own charm, a night game
at the 'Stick breathed a different kind of life into San
Franciscans.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sometimes, it blew us over, too. But it was fresh,
different, a testament to grit. Naturally, the park had to pull off
some mischief at its going-away party.
</P>
<P>
   Leathers, eating his ice cream, brought a sweater with him in
case the Bay Area's warmth turned cold during the game. He knows
the 'Stick too well to count on anything. He remembered how proudly
he had detailed the rigors of Candlestick night games to a pair of
out-of-towners attending the 1989 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son came from Milwaukee, and Leathers told them
they don't know what real cold was. ``I was explaining to them how
windy and miserable it can get,'' he said, ``and then the
earthquake hit.''

BLEDSOE, PALMER IN RITE OF PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bill Parcells may have got into his head,
but Chris Palmer got into his socks.
</P>
<P>
   Back when the Cleveland Browns head coach was quarterbacks coach
on Parcells's Patriots staff, he once was the target of a practical
joke played by Drew Bledsoe and backup Scott Zolak in which the
quarterbacks poked fun at Palmer's height _ or lack thereof _ by
placing a milk cart near a men's room urinal with a sign that read,
``Reserved For Chris Palmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant coach got back at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the FBI dye they use on ransom money that you can't see
until it gets wet, and he put it in our socks,'' recalled Bledsoe.
``So I ended up where my feet were blue for about a month. That was
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, there was and continues to be a lot of respect
between Palmer and Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having an MVP season,'' said Palmer. ``He's got the
highest QB rating in the AFC. I'm happy for him because he's
accomplished so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Their working relationship began following the 1995 season, a
tough one for Bledsoe, who suffered a separated shoulder and had
trouble with passing accuracy. After the season, Palmer was moved
from receivers coach to quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My accuracy had fallen off to a certain degree, and he took me
back to basics,'' recalled Bledsoe, who enters Sunday's game
against Palmer's Browns with a 104.5 rating and a 66 percent
completion rate. ``He got my videotape from the scouting combines
and he looked at my fundamentals and compared them to my '95
season. It was obvious I let a lot of things slide. No matter how
long I play in this league, I always have to be mindful of my
mechanics if I want to be accurate and be consistent from year to
year.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the tutelage, Palmer took Bledsoe aside and
told him he needed to enjoy playing football more. It was a
significant moment. From that point, Bledsoe has never taken
anything for granted and has consistently commented on how much
football means to him.
</P>
<P>
   It was those little things that convinced Bledsoe that Palmer
was someday going to be a head coach. ``I had a good feeling he'd
be a head coach,'' said the quarterback. ``The biggest thing is he
had the trust of the players _ offensive and defensive players.
They knew they could come to Chris and get a very straightforward
answer about what their role was and what their performance had
been like. He wasn't going to sugarcoat anything, and he was smart.
If someone had a question about something, he wouldn't answer it if
he didn't know it, but he'd come back to you the next day with an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe especially appreciated Palmer's sense of timing. ``He
knew what I needed to hear and when to leave me alone and when he
needed to get on me a little bit,'' he said. ``There weren't too
many times he wanted to get after me, but they were the right
things at the right time. I also benefited greatly from Ray Perkins
(one of Palmer's offensive assistants), who taught me the game of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   So if ever Bledsoe wanted to perform at the height of his game,
it would be Sunday, to show his old coaches what he's become.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a high quarterback rating and completion percentage,
Bledsoe hasn't been completely pleased with his play so far. ``I
have to find a way to start more quickly,'' said Bledsoe. ``In the
Jets game I was sharp at the beginning, but in the last two I
haven't been as sharp. In both games, I could have made it easier
for our offense and our defense. On the second play of (last Sunday
night's) game, I took a three-step drop instead of a five-step drop
and I missed Terry (Glenn, running a post). If we can get on top
early, we could change the complexion of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, the Patriots have managed only 3
first-quarter points, while their opponents have scored 28.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll is well aware of this, and in meetings and practice
this week his focus has been start strong and end strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come out better than we have,'' said the coach.
``(Opponents have) been able to make first downs, and we haven't
been able to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bledsoe, he said, ``He's playing at a high clip, but he
hasn't had his best game yet. There will be a game when he'll hit
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's game plans have been conducive to winning football.
Sure, Bledsoe likes throwing the ball, but history suggests that's
not the best way for the Patriots to go. In games in which Bledsoe
has thrown fewer than 30 times, the Patriots are 16-3 (.842); when
he's thrown more than 30 times, they are 40-40 (.500). Obviously, a
running game helps tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   Although the running game has struggled, averaging only 3 yards
per carry, the Patriots have run the ball 83 times in three games
and passed it only 103 times. That's not a bad ratio, and the
Patriots would like to even it out even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a goal of gaining 4 yards or more on at least
50 percent of their running plays. So far, they're done it only
around 31 percent of the time (on 26 of their 83 running plays),
while 17 plays have gone for no gain or a loss.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Cleveland defense trying to rush Bledsoe to slow
the explosive Patriots passing game, New England would appear to
have a chance to spring some big runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, however, is not counting on that. ``They're
improving,'' he said of the Browns defense. ``They're not extremely
complicated, but they have experienced players over there. They're
making more and more plays. We look for a tough game from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The important thing for Bledsoe is to not beat himself with
turnovers. In his last 78 pass attempts, he's not thrown an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be perfect in my decision making,'' he said. ``I
don't expect to be perfect on every throw, but when I watch the
film again, I'd like to be able to say I made the right decision
every time. And it's been close. There were a couple of times I
could have gone to a different place with the ball. In this last
game, the second and third throws they gave me a (defensive) look I
hadn't seen all week. I got into too much of a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case when he's prepared for the Colts and Peyton
Manning's name would come up, everyone now wants to know what
Bledsoe thinks of Cleveland rookie Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is going through something all young quarterbacks have to
go through,'' he said. ``It's a very difficult thing. He has to
have patience and continue to learn and maintain his confidence as
they go through the struggles. He has a great advantage in that he
has Chris Palmer, who puts him into a position to succeed. (Palmer
will) do a very good job to solidify his pass protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Couch has heard Bledsoe's name mentioned ad nauseum
by Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I've seen Drew go through these stages and this
is how Drew handled it,' '' said Couch. ``(Him) helping develop
Drew has helped me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   While Couch considers Palmer a calming influence, he hasn't
tried any practical jokes on his head coach and he probably won't.
He doesn't want to end up feeling blue.

<P>
   TAUNTON, Mass. _ Reed &AMP; Barton Silversmiths is 175 years old.
Appropriate noises have been made by the Massachusetts Legislature.
Men have just repainted the big front door its customary silver.
Although it did not make the original tennis trophy, the firm
recently reconfigured the Davis Cup in time for the United States
to play Australia at Boston's Longwood Cricket Club in July. The
silver plaques that Reed &AMP; Barton added will record the winners for
45 more years. The company made the medals for the 1996 summer
Olympics and will bid for the 2002 winter games. Designers are
working on silver tree ornaments for Christmas 2000. A glitzy
Manhattan hotel phoned on a Tuesday, in need of 5,200 pieces of
plated silverware for Friday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Table silver is what Reed &AMP; Barton is really all about. They've
always done it in sterling, and in silverplate, and increasingly
they're doing it in stainless steel. Most of the stainless is made
in Korea. ``We taught them how,'' says Anthony D. LaChapelle. As
the firm's senior vice president for marketing and business
development, he's one of the people seeing to it that Reed &AMP; Barton
keeps competitive with the likes of Oneida, Towle, Gorham, and
Wallace. Once upon a time, the august names of those companies
would alone close the sale, with many a bride doting on Reed &AMP;
Barton place settings to be stored in a Reed &AMP; Barton silver chest.
Other brand names, however, are muscling in, names from fashion and
home decor. Reed &AMP; Barton makes flatware for Waterford, and, as
you'd expect, the patterns are heavy on the Celtic. One design
developed for Ralph Lauren Home is based on the great man's braided
leather belt. Clark L. Lofgren, Reed &AMP; Barton's director of design,
quite likes the effect. The less said the better about Lauren's
personal favorite, tableware with handles of chain links. If you're
in a nautical mood, you'll think anchor chain; in a mean mood,
chain-gang manacles. This is heavy stuff, so heavy, in fact, each
handle must be hand-cast. A five-piece place setting is $2,000. No
pablum spoons.
</P>
<P>
   Reed &AMP; Barton continues to do its own designing. These days,
much drafting is computer-assisted, such as the Christmas ornament
that Mark Tung was contriving the other day from gothic elements.
David Felix was at the modeling stage, building his ornament in
clay. Mal Baker was taking an eye break: Detailing on the knife
handle he'd drafted wasn't springing to life in 3-D. Lofgren's own
favorite modeling tool is a lemonwood stick, smooth and cool to the
touch. After so many years, it ``has become a Zen extension of my
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   For a visitor, Lofgren had pulled out five old Reed &AMP; Barton
spoons to show how tastes had changed since ``Francis I.'' A
bestseller since 1900, its elaborate spill of fruits and vegetables
simply spells sterling silver. But there were also spare modern
designs in the late '50s by the Italian architect Gio Ponti that
were so difficult to hold as to seem anti-food. And then there was
``Love Disarmed.'' That's a cupid on her shoulder, and she looks in
danger of losing her nightie. Soon to be reissued as large serving
pieces, she should be the life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Large, by the way, is what people want in tableware today.
``More like the European scale,'' says Lofgren. And, an observer
thinks, more like restaurant cutlery, big and bold.
</P>
<P>
   The display shelves attesting to gracious living aside, Reed &AMP;
Barton is mostly a giant machine shop housed in century-old brick
buildings along the Mill River. The address is 144 W. Britannia
St., for a good and historic reason. ``Britannia'' was a pewterlike
English metal with the sheen of silver; it was compounded mostly of
tin, with bits of antimony and copper. In 1824, Taunton gadgetmaker
Isaac Babbitt and his fellow artisan William Porter succeeded in
making American Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after metalsmith Henry Gooding Reed (1810-1901)
and solderer Charles E. Barton (1812-1867) founded their company in
1840, America was prosperous enough to move on to silverplate and
sterling silver, and Renee Garrelick's company history, ``Sterling
Seasons: The Reed &AMP; Barton Story,'' is a lively chronicle of the
good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   It helped business that a Taunton newsboy named Ben Swig had
sold papers outside Reed &AMP; Barton. He founded San Francisco's
Fairmount Hotel in 1907, and ever since, it has used Reed &AMP; Barton
silverplate. (Boston's Ritz-Carlton is another hotel customer.)
During World War II, Reed &AMP; Barton did its part, making flatware
for the Navy as well as surgical instruments. Company president
John Wingate Weeks was secretary of war for Presidents Harding and
Coolidge, and another company president, Sinclair Weeks, was
Eisenhower's secretary of commerce; the Weeks family still owns
Reed &AMP; Barton.
</P>
<P>
   For all the glamour of the finished product, sterling starts
life as a dull metal blank. As metals go, silver is not expensive,
between $5.20 and $5.50 an ounce these days. Sterling, the highest
grade, is an alloy, requiring a bit of copper for strength. To most
people, silversmithing must be delicate, finicky work, judging by
the end product. Certainly, what the moldmakers do qualifies as
artisanal. What with silversmithing at Taunton and costume
jewelry-making at Attleboro, the area provides prime employment,
and Reed &AMP; Barton's LaChapelle says moldmakers ``who can do one can
generally do the other.''
</P>
<P>
   What comes as a surprise is the punishment silver must take on
its way to glory. No pain, no gain, as the saying goes, and silver
actually strengthens when subjected to high-pressure machines. The
air may be soft with oil and metal motes, but it's a noisy place,
too, with the hiss and whine and whirr of machines for cutting and
stamping and molding and shaping and buffing (with pumice and
grease). No wonder the whole place shuts down for lunch and an
ear-break.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparently a good place to work, one factor that keeps
employees loyal. There are so many members in the Quarter Century
Club, ``it's no big deal,'' says Raymond A. Gwozdz, new product
coordinator and second-generation employee. The other day, Jackie
Robino, whose current job is inspecting the finished product for
flaws, was vetting a sterling weapon called an ice cream slice.
With a red pen she drew a circle where the silver edge seemed thin.
(But not to a visitor's eye.) While the defective blade can still
cut the Haagen-Dazs, it didn't cut the mustard, and instead of
wooing brides at a jewelry or specialty shop, it may end up as a
second at the Reed &AMP; Barton Company Store. How long had Robino
worked for the company? asked a visitor. She sighed. ``That long?''
teased Gwozdz, her much-junior colleague. ``Forty years,'' Robino
admitted.

FILM DOWNLOADS NOTHING TO STAY HOME FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's billed as ``the world's first virtual video store,'' a new
concept in home entertainment. The sales pitch goes something like
this: Rent a movie on your personal computer without ever having to
leave home. No more staring at empty shelves on a Saturday night.
No more late fees. No more scoldings for failing to rewind.
</P>
<P>
   This is the future, say the founders of Sightsound.com, an
Internet company located near Pittsburgh that recently began
renting films for digital download on its Web site. Wave bye-bye to
your VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've been to the future, and frankly, I'm keeping the old
VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the virtual video store is great _ if you have a few
hours, or a few days, to spare. A recent visit to
www.sightsound.com turned out to be an exercise in frustration.
First, it took forever trying to decide which movie to rent out of
the library of 68 films. Hmm. Should we go for ``Cannibal! The
Musical'' or ``Killer Condom?'' Or what about ``The Chosen One,''
starring Carmen Electra and a few of her playmates?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the company that says it wants to be the
Blockbuster of the Internet isn't exactly offering blockbusters --
at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for ``Cyberdorm,'' a film described as ``The Real
World'' meets ``Wayne's World'' _ on the Web. We paid $4.95 for a
five-day rental; most one-day rentals cost $2 to $4 on the site.
</P>
<P>
   On a high-speed modem at the Globe, the film took about 45
minutes to download, which isn't really that bad considering the
size of the file. But remember, it would take hours or days over a
56K or slower modem, in which time you could crawl to your local
video store and back. Oh well, what's a little inconvenience when
you're an Internet pioneer? When the movie was finally ready to
play on the Windows Media Player, there was a slight problem: The
audio and video were out of synch. As one woebegone character
lamented, ``I used to have a main squeeze but she dribbled away
with my hoop dreams,'' another completely different character was
shown on the screen. (Given dialogue like that, maybe the film was
supposed to be off kilter.)
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the only glitch. About 20 minutes into the film,
the player just stopped cold, forcing me to close the file. I
restarted the film, but the Windows Media player didn't allow me to
fast-forward to where I left off. Nobody in their right mind would
willingly watch ``Cyberdorm'' more than once, so it was time to
come back from the future and give up watching movies on the
computer at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are early days, and there are going to be problems,''
admits Scott Sander, Sightsound's CEO and president. ``It's not
perfect, but we are scaling up with a site that shows the promise
of Internet distribution of films.''
</P>
<P>
   Sander and his partner, Sightsound's chief technology officer
Arthur Hair, foresaw the dawn of the digital age nearly a decade
ago. In the late '80s, Hair applied for a US patent on the idea of
distributing video and music digitally, and in 1993, he received
the patent, which covers the concept, not the actual technology
that makes it work. In January, the firm took action against two
Internet startups that distribute music on line; CDNow is fighting
back in court, while MP3.com simply mocked the complaint by posting
Sightsound's letters on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The patent is a bone of contention in Hollywood these days,
where all the major studios are trying to figure out how to
distribute their films on line without leaving themselves open to
piracy. Industry analyst Mark Hardie of the Cambridge-based
Forrester Research predicts that the patent won't hold up in court.
``It's like saying I'm going to patent levitation,'' Hardie notes.
``My theory is that that some day everyone is going to be able to
levitate, and even though I don't know how to do it yet, I'm going
to patent the idea of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the world's first virtual video store aren't
exactly levitating or walking on water yet, but they are, in fact,
proving that Internet film distribution is inevitable. This summer,
such films as ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' and ``The Blair Witch Project'' began appearing
illegally on line, available for download by those with the
patience to try. ``That was our clue that we'd better build our
business now or they will steal the movies anyway,'' says Sander.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Sightsound created quite a stir when it
announced an agreement to distribute a film made exclusively for
the Internet by Metafilmics, the production company that released
the Academy Award-winning ``What Dreams May Come.'' That film will
only be about 40 minutes long to make it easier to download,
although it may be expanded for a theatrical version after it
premieres on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet movie, called ``The Quantum Project,'' will be
released on line in May. But for now, Sightsound is trying to build
the library of its virtual video store, which is now limited to
cult films, B movies, sports videos, and a few oldies. ``We want to
get to the point where we literally have every movie ever made in
every language,'' says Sander. ``Our job is to bring the
convenience of the Web to the movie rental experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But nonvirtual video stores give refunds. At Sander's
suggestion, we requested a refund from the virtual video store's
customer service department; we haven't heard back yet. The check
is in the e-mail, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This summer's runaway success of ``The Blair Witch Project'' has
left all the marketing honchos in Hollywood scrambling to think of
innovative ways to promote their products on line. Warner Bros.
Records has come up with a scheme for Adam Sandler's new CD, ``Stan
and Judy's Kid.'' For the past two weeks, a six-minute animated
short based on a skit from the record has been viewed 2 million
times, making it the most-watched film on the Web. The film, called
``The Peeper,'' is proceeded by a warning for viewers under 17: It
``is the story of a sick, sick man who says and does things that
would get your arrested or at least grounded for months.'' In other
words, don't try this at home. The film is available at
www.adamsandler.com or www.warnerbros.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Newsweek breathlessly announced the dawn of the
Internet in a special section, declaring that we all need to get an
``e-life.'' Well, one interesting little venture is trying to
convince us we need to celebrate e-death, as well. The company,
with a site at www.obitdetails.com, distributes information about
wakes and funerals on line. For a fee, family members can also
publish ``lasting memorials'' on the site. There is already a site
for proud parents to crow about the birth of their babies
(www.estork.com), so it was only a matter of time before we began
bookending our e-lives on line, from e-birth to e-death. Sounds
like an e-movie to me.

   ``What if somebody overheard something scary at school,'' your
eighth-grader begins. ``What if he overheard a kid say he hated the
math teacher so much, he wanted to kill him?''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, you could have dismissed the overheard
conversation as boys' bravado and your son's reporting of it as
preteen hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Not today. Schools take statements like these seriously and so
should we. Even if there's nothing to the alleged conversation,
</P>
<P>
   there's still your child's anxiety to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is there were weapons in schools long before
Littleton. In a 1997 Centers for Disease Control national survey,
13 percent of boys age 13 to 18 said they carried a weapon to
school _ a gun, knife, or club. Since Littleton, schools around the
country, suburban as well as urban, have initiated a range of
precautions, from requiring transparent backpacks and locking
school doors to beefing up conflict-resolution policies.
</P>
<P>
   As necessary as these measures may be, their very existence
affects our children. They need our help to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a raging epidemic of anxiety, but kids are aware.
Safety is on their minds,'' says psychologist Leon Rosenberg,
director of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Just because your preteen or teen doesn't talk about it doesn't
mean she doesn't think about it. ``Most of the time,'' says
Rosenberg, ``they practice denial: `What happens bad in the world
won't affect me.' '' But every now and then, something overwhelms
the denial. It could be overhearing a comment like the one above,
but it could also be something far more benign:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day she passes locked doors and doesn't think anything
of it, but today, she looks at one and thinks, `The people who run
my school must be really worried to lock all the doors,' and she
comes home anxious and full of questions about safety,'' says
Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Vacillating between feeling invincible and threatened is
developmentally what being 10 to 15 years old is all about, says
middle-school researcher Margaret Sagarese. ``I tell parents it's
as if these kids have split personalities,'' she says. Indeed, they
are such a wealth of contradictions that the child who is
frightened by an overheard remark about wanting to kill a teacher
could easily say such a thing himself sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the power of peer influence. Even though they know
better, that's how vulnerable they are to wanting to impress each
other,'' says Sagarese. She is a coauthor of ``Parenting 911: How
to Safeguard and Rescue Your 10- to 15-Year-Old'' (Broadway Books).
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that your child mentions something to you about
someone who might be violent is a clue she's worried.
</P>
<P>
   Most typically, she'll talk about it in the third person or
pretend it happened to a friend. That's self-protective behavior, a
way to distance herself not only from your potential anger but also
from her own fear. That she makes it hypothetical _ ``What if?'' _
is another clue: She's waiting to gauge how you react in order to
determine how scared she should be.
</P>
<P>
   Pooh-poohing it _ ``Kids always say things like that'' _ or
pretending it doesn't bother us leaves her open to thinking the
problem is worse than she thought: ``Dad can't even talk about it,
it's so bad.'' If we respond with an ``Oh-my-God-we're-next''
hysteria, she'll panic: ```Even my parents think this is really
scary!''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist James Garbarino, an international authority on how
children respond to violence, suggests a response that soothes and
validates _ ``You're right to tell me'' _ but he wouldn't go so far
as to say, ``You're right, this is scary,'' until he knew more. Ask
some questions: What do you know about this kid? Has he ever said
things like this before? Does he have a reputation for angering
easily?
</P>
<P>
   A child with this information is also grappling with a swirl of
feelings other than fear, says Sagarese. Name them for him, she
suggests: ``Do you feel upset to know this, or guilty because you
do? Do you feel responsible for this person, for his anger?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect him to admit to anything, but don't let that stop
you from continuing. ``Be explicit,'' says Rosenberg: `` `I want
you to know this boy's anger is not your responsibility. It is your
responsibility to tell an adult. You did. That's good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This gets to the crux of the biggest issue facing us, says
Garbarino. ``We need to resocialize children with a new message:
`Good friends share information when good friends say troubling
things.' '' Garbarino is the author of ``Lost Boys: Why Our Sons
Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a code of silence,'' agrees school
psychologist Terry Davis of Natick (Mass.) High School. ``They
don't want to squeal on a classmate. They're afraid of
retaliation.'' She promises anonymity to any student who shares
information.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, but to really change the culture we need to
start with preschoolers, says child safety authority Jan Wagner.
She urges parents to teach the difference between a secret and a
surprise: ``A secret is something that when you know it, it makes
you feel unsafe or uncomfortable. A surprise is something that when
you know it, makes you feel good.'' Wagner is the author of
``Raising Safe Kids in an Unsafe World'' (Nest Entertainment).
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends initiating conversations even with
fifth-graders: ``Is there anyone in your class you are concerned
about? Anyone who gets picked on a whole lot? Anyone who brags
about knowing how to make a bomb or having a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   To parents who are uncomfortable with that, she points out that
the typical 16-year-old classroom avenger began as a fifth-grader
who was picked on and never got professional help. To parents who
worry that such a conversation would unduly frighten their child,
she argues that it is in fact comforting, as long as we accompany
it with honest reassurances. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Your mother and I are doing everything we can to make sure
you are safe, including making sure the school does everything
possible to identify and prevent problems. We wouldn't send you to
a school we didn't think was safe. If there's a child in your class
who needs help, it's a good thing to help him get it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a message worth repeating, especially in the
middle-school years when a child is most likely to overhear a
threat against a teacher, see a weapon in someone's locker, or
simply be anxious about security. Don't put it on him to be the one
to decide whether to tell, however; it's your job as a parent to
evaluate the information. If it involves weapons or the threat of
violence, Garbarino and others say you must report it. But
brainstorm together who to tell and how, so that your child's sense
of control remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've told authorities, children typically feel relieved
at first. But then anxiety can reappear or get worse. ``We often
see residual or secondary anxiety, either from the child who first
spotted the problem or from other children who hear about it via
the grapevine,'' says Davis. ``There's a period where kids may
temporarily feel less safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The more concrete you can be, the better: ``I talked to the
principal about security. Did you know there are hall monitors to
make sure there aren't any fights? And if there is a fight, did you
know there's peer mediation? That's when kids help each other work
out conflicts peaceably so they don't harbor resentments. Now
that's a good way to keep a school safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McAfee, principal of Edwards Middle School in Charlestown,
Mass., says children are so anxious about safety in the
middle-school years partly because their own self-control is often
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fights erupt over a blemish, over the score of a game,'' he
says. He places a strong emphasis on conflict-mediation skills for
students and on faculty-student interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let them know we care,'' says McAfee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ARM YOURSELF WITH KNOWLEDGE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Keep a frightened child home from school only if you have serious
reservations about safety; it reinforces fearfulness. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Make sure your child knows that statements about guns, bombs, and
killing people can get anyone in trouble, even him, even if it's
just a joke. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--If your child talks or writes about violence and/or has a problem
with anger, talk to the school psychologist. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Find out what security measures your school has in place so you
know what your child is exposed to every day. Learning there are
random searches for weapons might explain heightened anxiety you
couldn't account for in your ninth-grader. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--It's not unreasonable to ask the principal to talk privately with
your child to reassure her if she's worried about safety. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--There is not necessarily a gender difference when it comes to
being worried about violence and safety at school, but girls are
more likely to talk about it than boys. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--If your child divulges information at midnight, don't wait until
morning to reach the school. Call the police. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Research shows that minimizing a young child's exposure to media
violence can reduce violent behavior later on. &QL;

NEW PICKER-UPPERS HELP IN THE WAR AGAINST DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember those days in early spring, many years ago, when
everyone rolled up their sleeves and cleaned everything in sight in
their annual cleaning orgy?
</P>
<P>
   It was called spring cleaning. Pop washed the walls and
ceilings; they really needed it, they were a sight from a winter's
accumulation of coal dust.
</P>
<P>
   Mom did the floors and took the rugs outdoors, hung them on the
solar dryer (clothesline, that is) and beat them to a pulp with
that big old steel carpet whip.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody pitched in, turning mattresses, airing blankets,
cleaning out the basement and vacuuming everywhere. And, washing
anything that didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone do that anymore? I suppose they do, but the
activities are not quite so intense and concentrated. With all of
today's cleaning materials and supplies, the work is easier. And,
with soot-free fuels, at more efficient heating systems, things
aren't getting as dirty.
</P>
<P>
   But a house still has to be cleaned, or kept clean, and autumn
might be a good time to continue the battle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New super cloth
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are some new weapons in this battle. One is 3M Company's
Scotch Bright High Performance Cleaning Cloth, a special cloth that
picks up dust and dirt, not rearranging it as so often happens.
</P>
<P>
   The cloth acts as a magnet to hold dirt as you dust, reducing
the need for cleaning solvents and polishes. In fact, polishes
should be used as little as possible or not at all. Once a year,
maybe, and sparingly, is a good guideline.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer claims the cloth is gentle and can be used on
antiques, collectibles, and computer screens. The manufacturer also
says the cloth can be machine washed many times. In fact, it should
be washed frequently, 3M says.
</P>
<P>
   The cloth comes in four colors and sells for $5.99 at
supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Super cloth on a swivel stick
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another super cleaning cloth is Procter &AMP; Gamble's Swiffer, a
cloth that picks up and holds dirt and dust with electrostatic
action. Such cloths can be used by themselves, but Swiffer also
comes with a lightweight, long-handled sweeper that the cloth can
be attached to. A swivel handle allows the sweeper to get under
beds and other hard-to-reach places.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiffer is an international product: The sweeper is made in
China, the cloths in the Netherlands. Procter &AMP; Gamble is the
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about your imprimatur! The handyman talked to a PR
person who brought the Swiffer to the Globe to show how it works
and how wonderful it is.
</P>
<P>
   When the interview ended, the PR person left, and as the
handyman returned to his desk, Swiffer in hand, not one but two
colleagues stopped him and said, ``Oh, I have one of those. I think
it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   As a product, you can't get much better support than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiffer costs $15 at supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and
home centers. It is recommended that the cloths not be washed, but
discarded when they get dirty. Refill cloths are available in lots
of 10, 16, and 32.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiffer, with its long handle, is particularly useful on
floors.
</P>
<P>
   So, armed with one or more of these cloths, you can clean
practically everything in sight. The big, dirty jobs still may need
detergents and water, solvents, and other cleaners, but the dry
cloths should help a lot in general cleaning _ and maintaining.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whoever does windows . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it's a good time to tackle one job that
everyone has a love-hate relationship with: window cleaning. Now is
a good time because it will soon be time to put the storm windows
up or down and button up the house. And, clean windows will let in
more of the fading light and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't do windows, but if you do, you can make it
easier on yourself and do a good job with the right window cleaner
and the right technique.
</P>
<P>
   The right cleaner is a large dash of ammonia (half a cup) in a
bucket of warm water, or a spray bottle of Windex or other
commercial cleaner, which often contains ammonia and/or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The right technique is to spray or sponge on the cleaner, wash
with a sponge, and dry with a squeegee. If you are any good at
this, and with practice you will get better, it's the only
technique that eliminates streaking.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to wipe the squeegee dry before making your second
sweep. A wet squeegee edge is a guarantee for streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fall cleaning is important because we will be spending more time
in the house from now on, so it is best to have a clean place to
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   You can make it even nicer after cleaning with these freshening
techniques: Cut up a lemon and put it through the disposal; it will
leave a light citrus scent. Sprinkle baking soda on carpets before
vacuuming to reduce musty odors. Light a few scented candles to
give rooms a warm glow and seasonal aroma.
</P>
<P>
   But go easy with candles; even the smokeless candles can produce
soot, and the cleaning chores start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   One more chore at fall cleaning time: Inspect and clean all
smoke detectors. A vacuum attachment will release dust; so will
feather dusting a bit. Dust can cause a detector to go off when
there is no smoke.
</P>
<P>
   And, while you're at it, change the batteries in your detectors,
and get in the habit of changing them each fall when you turn back
the clocks to standard time, on the last Sunday in October.

USE GREENBOARD FOR TILED WALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am redoing my bathroom with a shower stall, but no tub,
from the bare walls in. I know I should use WonderBoard for the
shower walls, then apply tile. What can I use for the rest of the
walls? Also, the plumber put in the shower pan, but what can I use
to fill it to the proper level so it will slope down toward the
center drain?
</P>
<P>
   DAVE CUNNINGHAM, Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For the walls of the bathroom, use Blueboard and a skimcoat
or ordinary plasterboard if you are going to paint the walls. For
walls you plan to tile, use Greenboard, which is more water
resistant than plasterboard or Blueboard. But other than the shower
stall, there will no moisture to contend with except condensation,
and that can be handled by an exhaust fan. And since you have
gutted the bathroom, this is a good time to put in that exhaust
fan, exhausting to the outdoors either through the ceiling or
through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the Wonderboard is a brand name for concrete
board; there are other brand names, all virtually the same, and
they are a wonderful base for tile applied with a thin-set mortar.
</P>
<P>
   For the shower pan, if it is not already finished and sloping
toward the drain, fill it with mortar, which you can buy as
Sakrete's Mortar Mix. Fill enough to accommodate a top layer of
ceramic tile installed with thin-set mortar. Since the pan will
slope down from four sides to the center drain, I suggest you
install small mosaic tiles because they will follow the slanting
surface of the mortar fill better than larger tiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that you are supposed to put down deck boards with the
cup side down; that is, when you look at the end grain of the
boards you will see the grain forming a rainbow. I did that, but
now the edges are curling. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   DAVE CUNNINGHAM, Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You did right, although there is dissension in the ranks;
some wood people feel that it makes no difference whether the
boards are put rainbow side down or up. So, the boards could curl
no matter how they are laid. For the curling of your boards, if
they are curling up from the joists, I suggest you pull the
fasteners and drive deck screws closer to the edge (half an inch)
and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the years of cyclical expanding and contracting with
intake and loss of moisture, they might just settle down to a
minimum of curling, possibly none at all.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, turn the boards over to reverse the
curling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My double-glazed windows are only 10 years old and are
already fogging. The manufacturer has gone out of business. I heard
of a way of putting in new glass. It is called the BiGlass system.
Would that work? Otherwise, what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   D.P., Pembroke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, BiGlass will work. It is a system that takes out the
glass of old windows, and puts in a double-glazed glass insert. The
system usually works with single-glazed windows, but it should be a
cinch to do it with your double-glazed windows. Alternatives? Yes,
there is at least one that does not require replacing the entire
window, which is not necessary anyway. And that is to have a
company replace just the sash, the movable part of the window, the
frame that holds the faulty glass. This will cost about $150 to
$200, give or take a few bucks. Still a bargain, compared to
replacing whole windows, casing, frame, and all, for much more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The galvanized nails in my deck are turning black. My brother
suggested setting the nails and filling the holes with wood filler.
What do you say?
</P>
<P>
   G.N., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I say let 'em turn black. That is what galvanized nails do.
On a deck it probably isn't too bad, and may even add to the deck's
character. but if the nails start rusting, then you have to do
something. But setting the nails and filling the holes with filler
is not the thing to do. The filler may not last long, and will not
take a stain if you decide to stain the deck.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to get rid of the galvanized nails, the only
recourse is to pull them and substitute stainless steel screws or
nails. Or pull the nails and refasten the boards with the new
no-show fasteners that hold the boards from below.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The toilet in my townhouse condo fails to flush properly
every other time. It has happened only in the past few weeks, but
it is a nuisance. How can I fix it? It's a Briggs brand.
</P>
<P>
   ANGRY, in Ashland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That certainly is not a widely known brand, but its
construction is probably not the culprit anyway. I think it's a
partially blocked drain, either in the toilet itself or in the
drain under the toilet. You could try running an auger snake (long
wire with a little hook at one end) down the toilet, if you can get
to it. If that doesn't work, you might have to lift the toilet and
clear out the drain under it. This is best done by a plumber unless
you know a lot about toilets and plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   But before you do anything, bite the bullet, hang on to your
hat, and reach into the toilet to see if you can find that
blockage. Wear rubber gloves and wash thoroughly after doing this.
It sounds gross, it is gross, but the handyman did it (with his
bare hands, shudder shudder!) in an apartment many eons ago when
his toilet failed to work every time. And, sure enough, he came up
with a comb, which is just the thing that could cause a partial
blockage, rather than a complete one. You might find a comb, a
rubber ducky, or similar partial blocker.
</P>

WHY WE LIVE SO LONG? THERE'S GROWING UP TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there any reason for old age?
</P>
<P>
   We know that all living creatures have a simple biological
purpose _ to reproduce _ and that many species, like salmon, for
example, begin dying the minute they've fulfilled that requirement.
Why are most human beings forced to spend such a long stretch of
time at what might be considered the useless end of their lives?
Could there be something we're actually supposed to accomplish
here?
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about this subject since I began reading
James Hillman's ``The Force of Character and the Lasting Life.''
Hillman rejects the idea that old age is no more than a time of
losses, marked by a succession of senior moments, gray hairs, and
wrinkles. He prefers, he says, to entertain the idea that the
development of character requires additional years beyond those in
which we have spent striving and sacrificing. He believes that
older men and women, finally free from the yoke of conformity that
prevented their fullest development, require this time to grow into
their own unique selves.
</P>
<P>
   As the founder of the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project, I
know I am a different person from the young woman who was once at a
total loss about how to become a leader. As a teenager, I failed to
figure out that there is a difference between popularity and
leadership ability. When I looked at the girls who seemed to be in
charge of everything, I thought it was looks or clothes or wealth
that elevated them above the rest of us. I envied the mysterious
confidence they seemed to possess and I clearly lacked. I hadn't a
clue that what it really takes is the ability to motivate others,
to keep one's word, to take on a project and complete it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I entered my 20s, it had dawned on me that hard work
pays off, as mundane as that sounds. If you take on a task and do
it well, people turn to you when they need something else done.
They elect you to positions of responsibility. They respect you and
trust you. I learned how to enter an organization and play an
important role. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was still
seriously defective in the art of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   In my 30s, as my husband puts it, I was a troublemaker rather
than a peacemaker. I had strong opinions and an uncompromising
stance on every issue. I was fierce in opposition. When confronted,
I tended to escalate my demands. I see now that I put more energy
into being angry than into getting results. I allowed the play of
my emotions to distract me from my goals. It hadn't occurred to me
that thinking I was always right was keeping me from being
effective.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was my ego to rein in. I had to stop thinking of
the work I was doing as a way of gaining recognition. I had to
realize that being organized wasn't one of my skills and become
willing to allow others to make up for my deficiencies. I had to
get over my impatience with people who dawdled, or couldn't get to
the point, or said they'd do something and then didn't deliver. I
had to give up judging other people and learn to appreciate the
interplay of personalities. I had to understand that I could
benefit from criticism. I had to recognize that assigning blame was
a total waste of my time.
</P>
<P>
   That took another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that time etches itself into the lines of our faces,
but we don't often think of how it can improve our characters,
broaden our perspectives, or teach us the value of perseverance. I
like to think the members of the cancer prevention project, after
so many years of passionate advocacy, are by now ``well seasoned,''
or as the dictionary puts it, ``toughened by experience or by
exposure to difficult conditions.'' We have learned how to pace
ourselves, how to support one another, and how important it is to
keep from posing enemies. We are working on not taking ourselves so
seriously that we forget to have fun. Strangely, we find growing
older both humbling and empowering. At this point in our lives, we
know the burden of change does not rest only on our few frail
shoulders. We recognize that this fight spans many more years than
our lifetimes allow. We are dedicating ourselves to a cause whose
beneficiaries are not yet born.
</P>
<P>
   Years of experience have taught us that although we cannot
finish, we must continue. For if we do not, who will?

RECUPERATING FROM DROUGHT TO FLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a week makes! We were worrying about the
long-term damage to trees, shrubs, and mottled brown lawns from
this year's prolonged drought. Then the heavens opened up. Now
flooding from not so friendly Floyd is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad old Ma Nature can't get her act together using judicious
restraint and moderation. After Hurricane Floyd's drenching, the
grass is green anew so you may have forgotten all about the
drought, but let's talk about it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of drought are interesting. All this past season
trees and plants have been so parched that they instinctively
thought they were going to die. This triggers a hormonal response
that tells them to make lots of flower buds to produce lots of
seeds and thus keep their genes going. So next spring, maybe, we
will have lots and lots of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the plants were so, so dry that they didn't have enough
strength (technically a carbohydrate energy source) to make very
many buds at all. Because Ma Nature doesn't do things in
moderation, trying to predict her whims next year involves lots of
plant science, some guesswork, and a bit of plain dumb luck.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that this drenching came just at the best time
for plant recovery. Good roots are the key to good plant health,
and during periods of drought, many roots shrivel and die.
</P>
<P>
   The best new root growth takes place from September until the
ground freezes, when there is no competition from leaf expansion or
bud production. All of the energy source is marshalled into
expanding new roots.
</P>
<P>
   A good deep soaking wets the ground all the way down. As the
topsoil dries out, the roots continue growing downward as they
follow their underground water source. The result, especially with
grass, is deep roots, which will be less vulnerable to drought next
summer. Sprinkler systems, on the other hand, encourage shallow
surface roots, which are very vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean in practical terms for the backyard
gardener? There is enough water in the soil for several weeks,
which will carry you into October, after which the plants should be
left alone to harden off for winter.
</P>
<P>
   So, turn off your sprinkler system right now. Use the manual
control shutoff until your sprinkler company can schedule your
winter turnoff appointment. You will, however, have to continue to
watch and maybe water some annuals and vegetables if their soil
dries out down to about an inch or two.
</P>
<P>
   While drought is one problem, too much water causes other
problems, the main one being fungi. (You just can't win.) When the
soil, leaves, and everything are damp and cool, various molds and
diseases appear on leaves, some flowers, and even on lawn grasses.
The worst hit are those that were heavily fertilized with high
nitrogen fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Pull off the leaves that have gray, white, or black
coatings and blotches. Also ones with lots of brown. Pick up any
from the ground and throw the whole bunch away. Obviously, don't
put them in the mulch pile.
</P>
<P>
   When I do the fall cleanup, I generally throw out (in the
rubbish) my tomato plants, beans, phlox, peonies, plus rose and
lilac leaves. If you get asthma from mold wear a mask and take
something for allergy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the soil, do nothing until it dries out, especially if
you had any flooding. Working soil that is too wet ruins its
texture (called tilth). The classic test is to put soil in your
hand and squeeze it. If it makes a mudball, it's too wet. If it
crumbles and falls apart, it's OK to work.
</P>
<P>
   If topsoil runoff and flood waters buried any of your yard, wait
until it's quite dry before attempting repairs. Then rake or shovel
off the silt to the previous ground level. Two inches of soil
buildup in shrub beds isn't harmful if you remove the soil from
around the stems and trunks. Anything over 5-6 inches should be
removed. Rake the lawn and leave the little brown bits that remain.
Put the removed silt in the vegetable or flower garden because it's
good, rich topsoil.
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater damage is another matter. There are two kinds. One is
windborne salt spray, which can travel 10 and even 20 miles from
the ocean. The damage is mainly superficial leaf browning. Ignore
it. Those leaves were going to fall soon enough, and next spring
things will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater flooding is another matter. If the salt content of the
soil gets too high, permanent root damage and death will happen to
vulnerable species, most of which are the common ornamentals we use
in our gardens. Instead, salt-resistant, low-maintenance plants can
be planted.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of them don't compare to roses, althea,
hydrangeas, our favorite perennials, and the flowers of summer we
love. As a matter of common sense, I think it's better to replant
what we love and consider this our tithe to Ma Nature's
irascibility.

LUXURIOUS MERCEDES SL500 WANTS TO DRIVE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This car's got a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   I am coming into Boston from the north on a wet day, up on the
bridge just before the Fleet Center. Traffic's not bad, but there
are vast puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell my last driving instructor this, but I do not have my
hands at the 10- and 2-o'clock positions on the wheel. I've got one
hand draped over the wheel, trying to gently coax the car through
the slop, feeling what it wants to do. But something else is
driving the car. I hit a puddle, and the car slows and corrects
itself to keep going straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   I hit a steel expansion joint on the bridge, and whatever slight
traces of spin that wet steel imparts to the rear-drive wheels is
picked up and the car goes into electronic stability mode. I notice
the same thing later on a loose gravel road. The Mercedes SL500
wants to drive itself. Even with electronic stability off, it does
its own braking when a rear wheel starts to slip.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe when you buy a Mercedes, this is what you are looking
for: straight-ahead power and the virtual certainty that you will
not get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This 8-cylinder (12 cylinders available in the SL600),
two-seater is the sports car for those who want hunkered-down
reliability, solid weight (more than 2 tons) that does not get
skittish on corners, and cruising almost like a luxury sedan's.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long, gorgeous wedge of car, made more eye-opening
because of the luxury of its special interior.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the 10 special-edition models in a new
European-inspired factory program called Designo. It is aimed at
solid Mercedes buyers who are ready to stretch their limits just a
bit and put together their own package of designer amenities _
those amenities coming in the forms of paint, leather, and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Special paint colors include black diamond, silver, green,
copper, and slate blue. The leather combinations for seats and
paneling include light brown, blue and charcoal, green and
charcoal, copper and charcoal, charcoal, shell, black and red, dark
blue and black. Wood trims are also optional in some models.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant in the right hands, customer choice can sometimes lead
to garish combos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Elvis's bedroom,'' a friend said as he gazed upon
the red and black leather interior of my black diamond SL500. But
to each their own, though the possibilities for elegance or
gaudiness will be limited since Mercedes plans to produce only
250-500 of each (itals)Designo(unitals) model annually.
</P>
<P>
   So forget color and hop inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, soft leather seats. Firm sides from hips to shoulders.
Long, broad and firm base with myriad levels of adjustment behind
and below. Move the seat back and the seat belts adjust and the
headrests rise, assuming if you are moving back, you are likely
taller than the seat's last occupant.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leather-wrapped wheel and look around.
</P>
<P>
   Light controls in a pod to the left. Straight ahead, a package
of gauges _ gas gauge alone, a grouping that includes oil and water
readouts and one for miles per gallon at current operation, then
the speedomoter and tachometer in separate rims, and, off to the
right, the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Simple controls at center dash: climate up top, audio below, and
just below that a hodgepodge including controls for the trunk lid,
towing protection, central locking, hazard lights, stability
control, adaptive dampening, and the roll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Controls for windows, mirror, heated seats, and the convertible
roof are clustered around the stick for the five-speed,
electronically-controlled, automatic (with driver-adaptive option)
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   You're surrounded by front and side airbags as you gaze out over
the long hood. On rainy days, a single, broad wiper blade cleans
the windshield with remarkable sweep.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day, drop the roof _ a remarkable mechanical event in
itself. Push a single button and hold it until all is done and the
windows go down. The rear quarter of the roof unlatches itself and
folds up against the main roof. Now the main roof unlatches with a
loud snap from the frame at the top of the windshield and lifts
itself. In the rear, a leather panel rises and the roof drops into
its storage compartment. The panel drops to cover the roof as the
roll bar, which had moved to get out of the way, comes back up, as
do the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Cool fall day, maybe too cool for a ragtop? No problem. Crank
the automatic climate control to 92 degrees and you are bathed in
warmth even as crisp fall air swirls about the car.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find much storage space inside _ narrow, covered slots
in the doors (deep and hard-to-reach bottom in them), and two small
storage areas between the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the engine and a restrained rumble bubbles from the
exhaust. Notice that the brake and gas pedal seem to have extra,
unnecessary travel in them.
</P>
<P>
   Notice just how long that hood is, and you'll understand why
this car ``drives long,'' unlike smaller sports cars. It is quiet
on the road, cruises at 75 at just over 2,000 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not remarkable off the line and has a strange acceleration
lag (almost like a turbo lag). But punch it at speed, while turning
2,000-5,000 rpms, and it jumps to the job, sending the car surging
ahead (autobahn-like).
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Stability Program helps avoid slides and spins by
correcting for over- and understeer. It uses torque and brake
controls to accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   It stops fast and straight even from high speeds, ABS aided by a
brake assist system that boosts maximum power to the brakes when
the pedal is stomped, as in an emergency, and held there.
</P>
<P>
   A solid cruiser. Fast as you wanna be. Reliable. A Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The fabric covering at the lower-front portion of the doors
will get rubbed to tatters by the leading foot of emerging
occupants.
</P>
<P>
   --The lids on both between-the-seat storage bins jammed
repeatedly.
</P>

   HUDSON, Mass. _ Hot Rod. Slang. An automobile rebuilt or
remodeled for increased speed and acceleration. _ The American
Heritage Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom. Noun. A valued possession passed down in a family

</P>
<P>
   Heirloom Hot Rod. Nascent slang. A lovingly cared for, souped-up
automobile, the result of thousands of hours of toil, which may get
passed down in a family through succeeding generations, or may be
fought over or found in pieces in a barn or garage, or may find its
way into the hands of a wealthy, private collector. _ Ford's Whacky
Auto Terms.
</P>
<P>
   I am crossing a field on as sparkling and clear and warm a late
summer Monday as you will ever get. The sounds of the fading '90s
echo to either side of me: teams of girls and boys playing soccer
behind the high school. Parents shouting. Whistles wailing. It is
wonderful and perfect and monochromatic. ``Pleasantville,'' the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of me, the sounds of the lingering '50s fill the air: Rock
'n' roll music blares from speakers mounted on poles and the rumble
of hot rods reverberates and stirs the smell of fried food _
burgers, fries, hot dogs. With each step I take, the world becomes
more colorful: candy apple reds, Bombays, pinks, blacks,
turquoises, inky deep blacks, gleaming metallics. The world is
filling in with color. ``Pleasantville,'' the movie.
</P>
<P>
   I am here to see hot rods and custom cars, all 1959 and earlier
vintage automobiles, and I am far from alone. Thousands join me to
view the 1,100 cars whose owners were lucky enough to sign up in
time to be admitted to the 27th Annual Ty-Rods Old Timers Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Monday and with so many people skipping work, you'd
think it was opening day for the Carmine Hose. But, no. These are
car people and they are playing Hot Rod Hooky.
</P>
<P>
   I am working. Tough job. Somebody's gotta do it.
</P>
<P>
   So I stroll amidst the paint jobs, the highboys and low cars,
the chrome, the carefully painted flames, the pleats and rolls, the
chops and channels.
</P>
<P>
   Cars rumble in through the day. Peter Raffi of Derry, N.H.,
owner of a classic 1955 Chevy pickup truck popularly known as a
Cameo, says that for car owners, ``driving in and driving out are
the best parts.'' That's because it's a parade of pride _ pride in
your car, its sound, its look.
</P>
<P>
   But something troubles me. Have these gems, these wonderfully
built and maintained autos become, maybe, too valuable? What is to
come of cars that may have been turned into hot rods 40 and 50
years ago for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, which now
are worth $20,000 and $30,000, and in rare cases $100,000? Do they
become so valuable they end up in climate-controlled warehouses,
accessible to only the wealthiest of collectors? In museums?
</P>
<P>
   Some will, but here's hoping most get passed on, generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the Ty-Rods for this day. Founded in Concord in 1952,
they've been holding this show ever since they decided nearly three
decades ago that they needed a way to get old members back
together. First show, at the VFW in Littleton, drew 38 people and,
says Bob Parker, a Ty-Rod since 1956, 26 or 27 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the old image of hot rodders as rowdies, the Ty-Rods
have always been a relatively peaceful bunch (excepting, Parker
says, the night pizza ended up all over the walls at a veterans'
establishment and they were asked to move the whole show outdoors).
</P>
<P>
   The Ty-Rods club was formed by members who felt their original
group, the Piston Pushers, danced too close to the Hollywood
stereotype of hot rodders. The latter club appellation being an
explosive piece of equipment and the former being an implement of
control, you can see where the names came from.
</P>
<P>
   The Ty-Rods lived down the pizza-fling and their show just grew.
Lately, they've had to drop the high end on the vintage of cars
from 1967 to 1959, and even with that, the 1,100 slots handed out
first-come, first-served go rapidly. Many are turned away.
</P>
<P>
   It's so big that the hot rods (Parker says hot rods are cars up
to 1939 and everything after that is a custom) at this show
represent a triangle with its points at Maine, Florida, and the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a New England show and the New England contingent is
beautiful and strong: the 1950 Mercury sedan of Jack Carr of
Billerica; the mustard and white 1957 Ford Fairlane of Richard
Perkins of Nashua, N.H.; Richard Sabotka's pink and black 1956 Ford
Victoria, home port, Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hamel of North Hampton, N.H., is here in a 1956 Chevrolet
Cameo pickup, tropical turquoise and Bombay in color, with its
unique from-the-factory fiberglass bed and 2 1/2 years of
restoration in it.
</P>
<P>
   For many young car buffs today, turning their ride into a hot
rod means fancy wheels and a new computer chip to boost engine
performance; that and tinted windows. Not like the days when
Parker, the longtime Ty-Rod, built a '32 Ford coupe, added a big
Caddy motor, and didn't have what you'd spend on wheels, tires, and
computer chips today in the whole rig.
</P>
<P>
   That was back when airport runways were where you got to test
your efforts and the cars often reflected, in crude fashion, what
GIs had spotted in European sports cars and brought back from World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But time is often warped.
</P>
<P>
   Walk up to Howard Poulin Jr., of Manchester, N.H., and ask him
if his brilliant yellow 1931 Ford five-window coupe is based on the
car in the movie ``American Graffiti'' and you get a rolling
belly-laugh. This car was built in 1959, way before the movie,
before, even, the movie's setting. A whole year before Poulin was
racing on the straights in Fremont, Calif. Way before high-tech,
expensive drag racing got to be more than he could afford and
brought him back to where he is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right back to where I started,'' he says, sitting happily
beside the coupe that on any given day, in its time, could
challenge anything else out there that was street legal.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to schisms. You've got them among race fans:
Indy vs. NASCAR; among bikers: Harley vs. Asian-made bikes and old
Harley riders vs. new Harley riders (never mind that without new
Evo Harley guys and women, Harley would be dead as the Henry J),
and, in hot rod and custom: steel vs. technology.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Poulin can say he's not the owner of some
``Tupperware, yuppie, kit-car,'' and William Horn of East Freetown
can stand proudly beside his 1939 Chevy Master Deluxe gasser from
the '60s, straight axle, not lowered, big block Chevy 454 cranking
out 435 horsepower, and say proudly, ``It's all steel.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many hot rods, it's not finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all done when you run out of money,'' says Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes me wonder and worry.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when every aficiando pours every hard-won cent into
every car and then the car gets so valuable as Hot Rod Heirloom
that just maybe it's worth more to some collector than it is to
them?

MANHATTAN FOR $24? SALE DOESN'T ADD UP FOR HISTORIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The great gemstones of history have come in for some
hard knocks over the years. George Washington never chopped down a
cherry tree. Louis Armstrong wasn't born on the 4th of July or in
1900. Now, it turns out, the Indians didn't really sell Manhattan
Island for $24.
</P>
<P>
   Every schoolkid knows the story of how Pieter Minuit, director
of the Dutch West Indies Co., pulled off one of the great
real-estate bonanzas of all time in 1626, buying what would become
the wealthiest chunk of land in the world for a mere $24 worth of
trinkets and beads.
</P>
<P>
   The tale has endured in paintings, pageants, textbooks, ads, and
jokes because buying and selling are what Manhattan is, and always
has been, all about. In retrospect, then, the Dutch bargain with
the Lenape Indians defines the city's essential character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to an exhibition at the New York Historical
Society, which opened this week and continues until March, this
fateful event belongs as much to myth as to history.
</P>
<P>
   The story isn't entirely false. ``Some sort of transaction did
take place in 1626, there was a trade of goods for the use of
land,'' says Lisa Sita, the exhibition's co-curator. ``But it
wasn't what the legend says it was.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, nobody can say precisely what was exchanged. The
only surviving evidence that a deal took place at all, and the
centerpiece of the Society's exhibit, is a letter, dated Nov. 5,
1626, written to the governors of the Dutch West Indies Co. by one
of its emissaries, Pieter Schagen.
</P>
<P>
   Schagen reports on the health and well-being of the colonists,
how much grain they have harvested, how many mink skins they are
shipping back to headquarters in Amsterdam. Amid the data, he
drops, almost casually, the following: ``Our people . . . have
bought the island Manhattes from the wildmen for the value of sixty
guilders.''
</P>
<P>
   This letter, which remains in astonishingly mint condition, was
discovered in 1839 by John Broadhead, a secretary to the US
ambassador in the Netherlands, who was asked by then-President
Martin Van Buren to scour the Dutch Royal Archives for documents on
American Colonial history.
</P>
<P>
   Some bean counter of the day calculated that ``sixty guilders''
would have equaled $24 back in the early 17th century, hence the
figure passed down through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The deed of the sale has not survived, or has never been found
anyway (though, in 1920, a clever forgery was attempted _ it, too,
is part of the exhibition). Nor is there any solid evidence that
Pieter Minuit or any Indian chiefs personally took part.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the historical society sees it, two things are
certain:
</P>
<P>
   First, the Indians who agreed to this deal were not suckers, as
the mythical tale makes them out to be. If the transaction was
similar to two others around the same time, for which deeds have
been found (and are on display), the goods traded were not just
``gay clothing, beads, and brass ornaments,'' as one textbook
chuckles. They were copper pots, iron knives, wool blankets, and
various tools: the high-tech hardware of the era.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't trinkets,'' Sita emphasized. ``They were things
that were valuable to the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Indians did not think they were selling the
land. ``From the Native American point of view,'' Sita says, ``land
could not be owned _ any more than the sky could be owned _ so it
could not be bought or sold. In their eyes, they were receiving
gifts in exchange for letting the Dutch temporarily use the land.''
</P>
<P>
   This notion is supported by a letter written in 1659 by
Cornelius Melyn, explaining some strange aspects of the Staten
Island territory that the Dutch West Indies Co. had ``bought'' from
the Lenape several years earlier:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their custom,'' Melyn wrote, ``that when a new governor
came to such a place, that there should be a gratuity given them;
thereby to continue the friendship between the Indians and our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   This custom was tolerated for a while. But, as Sita noted, ``It
became a source of conflict later on. The Native Americans expected
ongoing gifts, and the Dutch said, `Hey, we already paid up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Dutch, who saw themselves as spreading empire and
civilization, thought they had purchased a gold mine for a song _
while the Lenape, who saw themselves as the guardians of God's
earth, thought they were hauling in a bundle from the white man's
rent.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that when the mutual illusions crumbled and
the equations of power came to bear, the question of ownership was
settled in the usual, less picturesque, manner.

<P>
   BOSTON _ What one specialist called Boston's most important
collection of historical artifacts ever excavated from the depths
of the earth comprises 500 boxes of trash.
</P>
<P>
   There's a quarter of a million seeds, mostly cherry pits; 160
fragments of cloth, seven shoes, myriad broken chamber pots and
another quarter-million random items, from wig curlers to preserved
intestinal parasites and grain weevils.
</P>
<P>
   This up-close-and-personal snapshot of colonial Boston is
available for public inspection thanks to an entity usually
associated with the city's future rather than its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeology of the Central Artery Project: Highway to the
Past,'' at the Massachusetts Historical Commission's Commonwealth
Museum, displays the treasures unearthed before the Big Dig began
to transform Boston's highway system.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with federal and state law, the Central Artery Project
commissioned a thorough archeological analysis of the areas the
road construction would disturb.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 through 1994, excavators carefully explored a small
handful of important sites in Charlestown and the North End, and on
Spectacle Island in Boston Harbor. They found such treasures as the
oldest bowling ball known in the New World, which dates to about
1670.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it throws Boston into turmoil, The Big Dig has proven a
boon to archaeology, said Dr. Ann-Eliza Lewis, archaeological
collections manager for the Massachusetts Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, she said, it is impossible for social scientists to
access artifacts hidden under a bustling city, locked beneath
asphalt, skyscrapers and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that this is the most significant excavation
Boston has ever seen,'' Lewis said. ``There are some other pockets
that could still be explored, but there aren't any more Big Digs,
and it's almost impossible for researchers to excavate in urban
situations because it's so disruptive to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The trash and ordinary household objects on display are
enlightening, archeologists say, because they provide tangible
evidence of everyday life in bygone times that are typically
documented only in dusty books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spectacular, because you don't normally find this kind of
material,'' said Central Artery Project archaeologist Robert J.
Hasenstab. ``The garbage people discard normally disintegrates, and
it's so valuable because it can tell you what people are eating,
what their sanitation and health is like.''
</P>
<P>
   A North End privy _ or 17th-century outhouse _ provided much of
the Central Artery Project's most impressive finds. Because it was
sealed off with clay, it preserved biodegradable items such as
lace, food items and bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The privy was owned by Katherine Nanny Naylor, a wealthy woman
who died in 1716 at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
   Naylor was one of four ``really strong colonial women,'' in
Lewis's words, whose lives are highlighted through their
belongings. Also featured are two colonial-era businesswomen and a
17th-century Native American political leader who used a
bow-and-arrow as her signature.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes artifacts from the Three Cranes Tavern in
Charlestown's City Square.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern _ which stood on the site of the former home of John
Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony _ did
140 years of brisk business before it was burned to cinders in the
Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Among its hidden riches was a large, two-handled jug, circa
1750, meant to hold posset _ warm milk mixed with spiced rum _ and
to be passed around the room for communal drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Historical Commission has designed a
curriculum for 5th and 6th graders around the collection, and
museum officials hope to welcome as many as 2,000 schoolchildren in
the next few months. The free exhibit is open until November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can really interact with history on a very personal
level,'' with archaeology, Lewis said. ``They see a marble, and
it's different, but they recognize it. It allows them to think like
an archaeologist.''

NET TUITION SERVICE IRKS SOME COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was bound to come to this.
</P>
<P>
   Just as thousands of people bid every day for cheaper airline
tickets on the Internet, now they can bid for cheaper college
tuition, too.
</P>
<P>
   A bidding service launched on the Web last week has college
admissions officers in a furor, saying it is preying on families'
anxiety about the cost of a college education, and is adding to
cynicism about colleges at a time when rising tuitions have public
suspicion at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   The service, eCollegebid.org, also exposes a little-known and
little-advertised fact about college pricing: At even the most
prestigious schools, less than half the students pay full ``sticker
price,'' which at many schools has surpassed $30,000 for tuition,
room, and board. And as on an airplane, hardly anyone pays the same
as the person in the next seat.
</P>
<P>
   What students do pay is determined not only by how much they can
afford, or how much their parents make, but also by how badly
colleges want them. So two students with equal incomes, similar SAT
scores and grades, and similar sports or outside interests will pay
different amounts if Student A can use an offer from another
college to bargain for more financial aid from one that really
wants him or her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the inevitable and logical and probably very useful
result of the chaos in college pricing,'' said Gordon Winston, a
professor of economics at Williams College and the director of the
Williams project on the economics of higher education. ``This will
clearly increase the customer's power to extract concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders of eCollegebid.org say they have identified up to
800 private colleges and universities that could participate in the
tuition bidding experiment, and that they have signed up a few
institutions, which they would not identify. Whether or not the
service succeeds, education specialists say it is merely the first
sign of how radically the Web will change enrollment and tuition
procedures at colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It underscores a change in the public mindset, that higher
education is a commodity to be purchased, it doesn't have that
holiness,'' said Richard Chait, a professor at Harvard's Graduate
School of Education. ``The question is not whether it's good or
bad, but that it was inevitable. We've socialized people to believe
that commerce of all manner of purchases is possible over the Net.
This is a private good, privately purchased, and it's governed by
rules that govern other private goods that are privately purchased.
I bid on a hotel, why not a freshman year?''
</P>
<P>
   The service seemingly is attempting to exploit a frenzied
financial aid system, where savvy parents haggle with schools over
price, and where students make decisions about where to get an
education based on how much they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The eCollegebid.org service asks would-be students to submit the
amount they are willing or able to pay to attend college, whether
they want to commute or live in a dorm, what sports or interests
they have, and to specify a region where they would like to attend
school, and an area of study. The bidding students would find the
identity of the school they might attend only if their bid is
accepted. The service is free and bidders would be under no
obligation to attend the university.
</P>
<P>
   The service is scheduled to begin as the next application cycle
begins in November. The founders promise to put the power of
pricing in the hands of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   College admissions officers say the value of an education should
not be reduced to a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been accused of being gatekeepers, used car salesmen,
and with things like this, you can understand why,'' said Joyce
Smith, executive director of the National Association of College
Admissions Counselors. ``This is an educational experience for a
child, not a car, not an airline ticket. This is really
disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   But admissions officers concede that the potential appeal of the
service is a direct result of the confusion over the cost of
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's confusion, partly because of the way we have behaved,
and there's also cynicism,'' said Michael McPherson, president of
Macalester College and the coauthor of an acclaimed book on student
aid. ``The temptation of having something that looks simple and
straightforward is considerable. I compare it to the success of
Saturn with cars. They've said, `There's no screwing around, we're
just going to tell you what it is.' People would like some analogy
with colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for tuition takes advantage of a fact often overlooked
in the arena of college applications: Whatever the anxiety over
increased competition, there are hundreds of less competitive
schools with empty seats at the end of the admissions cycle, and
they would love to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Tedd Kelly, eCollegebid.org founder, says it will appeal
especially to families who make too much money to qualify for
financial aid, but not enough to pay tuition in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is saying to students, they've still got places in mind,
and I have them in mind,'' said Kelly, a longtime college
enrollment consultant. ``And colleges have the choice of saying,
`Do we want to pursue someone who can only pay $8,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly would not name the colleges in his consortium. And he has
fewer than a dozen schools signed up, although he says he will have
many more by Nov. 1. About 800 of about 2,000 four-year colleges
nationwide fit into the profile he is targeting _ the schools with
leftover seats. The schools, he says, are likely to be liberal arts
schools in the Midwest, and to take students who have SAT scores
between 800 and 1,000, and grade-point averages of 2.5 to 2.9.
</P>
<P>
   The college admissions counselors raised concerns about the new
service at their national convention last week, and asked the
organization to do what Smith called ``an ethical review'' of the
new company, even though the founder is a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there are colleges that are so desperate to get a body
with some money is the wrong message to send about education,'' she
said. ``One would hope that a college is recruiting a student to
come because they have a good match, and academic environment,
something that suggests a student should be there other than `I can
afford to pay.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree that the bidding in its crudest form may be a bad
idea. But, they say, it is simply the first.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit College Board launched an online service last week
to help students identify colleges that match their interests, to
compete with other commercial groups doing the same thing.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kenneth T. Derr will retire at the end of the
year as chairman of the board and chief executive of the Chevron
Corp., turning over power to a highly regarded lieutenant, David
O'Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   A seamless transition is forecast when Derr, 63, retires Dec. 31
and O'Reilly, a chemical engineer born and reared in Dublin,
Ireland, succeeds him.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron made the announcements on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave O'Reilly is the right person to lead Chevron in the
future,'' Derr told a news conference at the corporation's
headquarters in San Francisco. ``He combines broad company
experience with a record of achieving superior business results,
and he has strong leadership skills.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst who tracks the oil industry said virtually the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron's stock is up fivefold during the decade of the 1990s
and Ken Derr is largely responsible for the policies that allow the
company to perform that well,'' said Douglas Terreson of the
Houston office of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a person has performed in that manner he will be
difficult to replace, but Dave O'Reilly is very well regarded on
Wall Street. He's very talented and he has had tremendous
successes,'' Terreson said.
</P>
<P>
   Derr joined Chevron in 1960 after his graduation with a master's
of business administration degree from Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1989, when he assumed the position of chief
executive officer, he served as one of the company's two vice
chairmen, responsible for Chevron's U.S. petroleum business,
chemicals, coal, land development, research and several other major
corporate divisions, such as human resources, public affairs and
environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Derr was responsible for merging Gulf Corp. into
Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, 52, began his career at Chevron in 1968. He later
became manager of Chevron's refinery in Salt Lake City, was
manufacturing manager for Chevron Chemical's Olefins Division and
was general manager of the refinery in El Segundo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, he has been responsible for worldwide
exploration and production operations. He was elected vice chairman
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Derr said that he told board members several years ago that he
did not want to work after he was 65 years old and that 10 years
was a sufficient time to serve as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife thought that maybe a little less than that would have
been OK, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, O'Reilly was made head of worldwide exploration
and production operations as a signal that he was the probable heir
apparent, Derr said.
</P>
<P>
   Derr said he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in late
1987, had successful surgery in June 1998 and is in excellent
health. He said the diagnosis had no effect on his decision to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my 63rd birthday a couple months ago and I think it is
time to spend a little bit more time with my grandkids, whom I
hardly see, and even play a little bit more golf,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said that during Derr's tenure, Chevron's market
capitalization grew from $15 billion to $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay dividends in this business, unlike some of the
`dot-com' companies, but $100 invested in Chevron in 1989 (when
Derr took charge) would be worth $700 today, and I think we owe Ken
a debt of gratitude for his leadership during the past decade,''
O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly described himself as ``focused on the business'' and
able to get results. He allowed, ``I tend to be impatient at times.
I get that feedback also.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his priority at the helm of the corporation would be to
achieve top shareholder return and to do that there would have to
be growth in earnings ``at a faster rate, while maintaining
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it requires an oil company merger for that to happen
``is questionable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merger talks between Chevron and Texaco Inc. ended earlier this
year due to disputes over who would lead the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said what Derr has long said, that Chevron would not
merge for the sake of size, but only if it made good business
sense. ``I don't see that we have to do something on a macro scale
to be a top performer in this business,'' O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chevron has been evaluating merger candidates,
said oil analyst Michael Young of Deutsche Bank Securities in
Boston. ``I would expect that the evaluation of merger and
acquisition opportunities by Chevron will continue under O'Reilly
as much as under Derr,'' Young said.

REVERSING THE ORDER OF THINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems I'm forever mail-ordering stuff from catalogs only to
send it back.
</P>
<P>
   The return forms list categories under Reason For Return. Check
one: Too big. Too small. Wrong color. Wrong size. Quality. Design.
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen one that says, ``Changed my mind'' or ``No
longer in the mood'' or ``My self image has shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   I've thought about writing ``Changed my mind'' in the section
that's sometimes provided for ``Comments,'' but I've never done it.
I imagine somebody in the Return department looking at my form and
saying, ``Changed her mind? Who does she think she is? Return
denied!''
</P>
<P>
   So usually I end up lying on the return forms. I feel guilty
about lying, but it seems to work. One of the many advantages of
buying things from mail order companies is that they'll take the
stuff back, no questions asked, within certain limits anyway. I'm
sure there are returners who try to put one over on the catalog
companies, just as they try to put one over on stores.
</P>
<P>
   In Filene's the other day I overheard a woman say, ``They don't
fit. You have to take them back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've been altered,'' the saleswoman protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I altered them, they'd fit. But they don't. You
have to take them back.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how this little drama resolved itself. I went on my
way wondering: Where do people get the nerve?
</P>
<P>
   But who am I, a woman who lies about her Reason For Return, to
criticize? I wish I didn't have to lie. I think mail order
companies should expand the list of categories.

 UNDATED: ... his bags.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Americans reached Kiev in June. For two days there was more
frustration. The archives were closed for renovation, the visitors
were told. The manuscripts themselves had not been processed and
therefore could not be examined. The archives director, a former
KGB agent, was about to retire and could not accommodate their
requests. Finally, Wolff and company were granted special
permission to visit the upstairs stacks. A single box was pulled
down, and the rest, as they say, was history.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's team celebrated that night by quaffing shots of
Ukrainian vodka on a riverboat restaurant. In the time they had
left, they examined only about 50 items, photographing what they
could. Ukrainian officials still did not realize what they were
sitting on, Wolff guesses. Despite warnings, they seemed startled
when news of the discovery brought German television crews
scampering to their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, there's nothing else out there like this
in terms of a closed collection,'' says Wolff. ``There are
individual items missing from libraries, even groups of
manuscripts. But at least in the field of music, a collection of
this size does not exist'' outside the scope of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a dollar value on the collection is hard to do, adds
Wolff, who is often asked by auction houses and private collectors
to appraise the authenticity _ but not the monetary value _ of
music memorabilia coming on the market. A JS Bach cantata has sold
for as much as $1 million, he says, but the CPE Bach collection
contains nothing of similar value. Not that Ukrainian officials
might be tempted to put the collection on the auction block anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would create major legal problems,'' avers Wolff. ``But
there's no question it's of immense value.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, which hopes to acquire a microfilm facsimile of the
Bach collection, will not bid for the original items either, say
Wolff. Most likely the manuscripts will remain in Kiev for
documentation, says Wolff, then be permanently housed in Berlin. A
bill passed by the Ukrainian Parliament just last week should help
codify an existing agreement between Germany and Ukraine on the
return of such treasures, according to Grimsted. She and Wolff were
to meet this week in Cambridge with Rulan Pyrih, chief of the
Ukrainian archival administration. Their discussions will focus on
the future cataloging and microfilming of the Sing-Akademie
collection. Wolff heads back to Kiev next month to resume work on
site.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kiev discovery thrusts Wolff into a spotlight he has been in
before. In 1984, Wolf ``discovered'' 33 chorale preludes by JS Bach
_ in Yale University's music library, no less, where they were not
so much missing as unattributed. That finding, announced not long
before Bach's 300th birthday, prompted a series of ``world
premiere'' concerts. (It also stirred up controversy when West
German organist Wilhelm Krumbach claimed that he had performed the
Bach chorales first.) Travelling to Lodz, Poland, in 1989, Wolff
authenticated what was basically the entire missing collection of
Philipp Spitta, a 19th-century musicologist who wrote the first
major Bach biography. The Spitta archives too had disappeared from
scholarly sight during the war years. In 1975, Wolff played a
significant role in verifying a set of 14 Bach canons belonging to
a Strasbourg Conservatory professor. The manuscript turned out to
be Bach's personal copy of the Goldberg Variations.
</P>
<P>
   International politics aside, Wolff says this latest find will
almost certainly shed new light on JS Bach's development as a
composer. Bach was a meticulous archivist, says Wolff, who not only
drew upon the work of his ancestors but also worked closely with
his sons, inspiring them as Bach in turn was inspired by them. His
notations on the Sing-Akademie manuscripts are thus potentially as
important to musicologists as the hieroglyphs in the tombs of the
pharoahs are to Egyptologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his early compositions were questioned by earlier
generations of scholars because it didn't sound like Bach,'' says
Wolff. ``But Bach was essentially self-taught, and he exposed
himself to a broad range of music circa 1700. Relating his early
works to his eclectic study habits gives us insight into the mind
one of the great composers of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   In her forthcoming book ``Trophies of War and Empire,'' Grimsted
compares the manuscripts to liberated prisoners of war. At last,
she writes, the scores can be ``described, studied, performed, and
appreciated _ and at last be restored to their rightful place as a
major component of the common European cultural heritage.''

BEING GOOD AT GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest computer at my house isn't the homemade box I
usually work on, or the old Pentium 90 Linux server, or even the
blazing Athlon tower I borrowed from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it's this little beige box, roughly the size of a
package of software, that sits on the floor next to my TV set. It's
the new Sega Dreamcast _ a limited and in some ways rather crude
machine, which nevertheless could teach any PC a thing or two about
serving up realistic, razor-sharp electronic entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast illustrates our inevitable march toward a post-PC
world. Of course, some of us will always want all-purpose computers
that do many things reasonably well. But as processors get cheaper
and more powerful, it makes sense to build specialized devices that
do one or two things very well.
</P>
<P>
   This became obvious years ago to the makers of ``console
games,'' the electronic games that connect to your home TV.
Nintendo, Sony, and Sega have built this sub-species of computer
into a multibillion-dollar market. Along the way they've spawned an
arms race every bit as exciting as the Pentium III-PowerPC-Athlon
wars being waged on the desktop. Each firm keeps rolling out ever
more advanced game machines, based on ever more muscular
processors. Sony says its Playstation 2, due next year, will make
Dreamcast look like a pocket calculator. But for now, Sega holds
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamcast employs a processor made by the Japanese electronics
firm Hitachi using a technique called RISC _ Reduced Instruction
Set Computing. RISC chips use a stripped-down design that let them
run much faster than non-RISC designs like the Pentium. The G4 chip
that drives Apple Computer's ferocious new workstations is a RISC
chip; so is the Dreamcast processor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dreamcast chip is designed to do one thing
especially well _ multiplying numbers with decimal points in them.
This kind of ``floating-point math'' is what computers use to draw
graphics. John Byrd, Sega's senior manager of developer technical
support, said the Dreamcast processor bangs out 1.4 billion
floating-point calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a stream of wire-frame images, like a skyscraper
with the skin removed. This data is sent at 100 million cycles per
second _ much faster than in standard PCs _ to another chip that
draws the skin on each object, adds color, texture, and lighting
effects, and then flings it all onto your TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dreamcast games that Sega sent me were rather
disappointing. There's little to recommend Blue Stinger, a
par-for-the-course first-person action saga: Kill bad guy, turn
left, walk down corridor, kill bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's hallmark animated character, is back
with Sonic Adventure, a lively game with excellent
three-dimensional animations. Still, Sonic is a cartoon character
in a cartoon world. To me, the most impressive computer effects are
the ones that succeed in emulating the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the game that should send Dreamcasts flying off
store shelves is Sega Sports' NFL 2K. Here you have a game that
simulates football, a sport millions of us watch on TV every week.
And if you stand about 10 feet away from a TV running the new
Dreamcast game, you'll think it's Sunday afternoon. It's not just
the astonishing detail _ the snowflakes drifting across the
gridiron at Mile High Stadium, the gusts of mist from gasping
players. What really amazes is the reproduction of the way athletes
move. Linebackers cheat up to the line of scrimmage, leaning and
lurching, as they threaten a blitz. Receivers stagger forward with
safeties draped around their ankles. The illusion isn't perfect,
but closer than any computer game has managed up to now.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast experience comes crashing back to earth when you
hook up the built-in modem and optional keyboard and log onto the
Internet. The Dreamcast browser is primitive by PC standards, and
Web pages generally look awful on a TV set. But an Internet
capability is vital _ it'll let users play against each other on
line.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing costs $200. That's the cost of a high-end PC
graphics processor card, and the PC images still won't look as good
as the ones produced by a Dreamcast. The Dreamcast is no substitute
for a ``real'' computer. But if you're chiefly interested in games,
it's as real as it gets.

TAKING A CALL FROM ET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My desktop computer has a hobby. When it's not busy being my
word processor, or balancing my checkbook, or being my portal to
the Internet, it casts its eyes skywards and searches for
extraterrestrial life. It's listening for an ET _ not an ET that is
phoning home, but one that is calling to us.
</P>
<P>
   My computer isn't doing this alone, of course. Searching for ET
requires a lot of things I don't have, the first one being a
multi-million dollar radio telescope. Even if I had my own
telescope, my computer lacks the power to analyze all of the radio
signals coming in from space, filter out the background noise, and
scan for the sounds that might be characteristic of intelligence.
In fact, there is no computer on the earth today that is powerful
enough to accomplish this task.
</P>
<P>
   That's why my computer has joined the ranks of more than a
million other machines in the international Search For
Extraterrestrial Life At Home (SETI(at symbol)Home) project, which
is being coordinated by the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(at symbol)Home is one of several projects underway right
now that is harnessing the power of multiple computers for a single
purpose. Another is Distributed.NET, which is using spare CPU time
on several thousand computers to crack encryption keys. Both these
projects distribute a special-purpose screen saver that runs on
Windows and Macintosh-based PCs. When you aren't using your desktop
computer, the screen saver comes on and starts crunching
mathematical problems. When you start using your computer again,
the program politely saves its work and gets out of your way.
(Versions of the SETI(at symbol)Home program are also available for
more than a dozen versions of UNIX.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the key to coordinating these distributed
projects. The first time you start up the SETI(at symbol)Home
program, the software makes a connection over the Internet to a
computer in California and downloads a ``work unit'' _ that is, a
set of measurements from a particular part of the sky. The work
unit is about 350 kilobytes of data, so it downloads in less than
three minutes over a dial-up telephone line. That's not a lot of
data, but it takes about 40 hours of CPU time on a 550 Mhz Pentium
III computer to crunch it. When my computer is done with the data
processing it makes another call on the Internet to Berkeley,
uploads its results, and downloads a new work unit. So far my
desktop has completed 10 work units.
</P>
<P>
   I run a second copy of SETI(at symbol)Home on my laptop
computer. Now, between my trips, the laptop spends its days
searching the stars. It's about a third as fast as my desktop, but
it has still completed more than 10 work units all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it costs money for me to leave my computers on all
the time. My laptop's power supply draws 82 watts, which translates
to between 5 and 10 cents per day in higher electricity costs. But
that's money that I'm happy to pay to support this scientific
project. Indeed, this nickel-a-day donation is key to the success
of the Berkeley project. Even if Intel or Compaq had donated a
million desktop computers to the SETI project (an unlikely
proposition at best), it is hard to imagine that the Berkeley team
could have risen to money to pay for the electricity, cooling, and
laboratory space those machines would have needed.
</P>
<P>
   To further mobilize the community, the SETI(at symbol)Home
researchers have put together a comprehensive Web site that allows
participants like me to see how their contributions to the effort
stack up against the project as a whole. The Web site reports the
number of work units you have completed, the total time you have
spent crunching data for the project, and the average amount of
time spent per work unit. The Web site further appeals to the
competitive streak that most humans have by allowing individuals to
join together in teams. Schools, clubs, and companies all have
fielded SETI teams. Not surprisingly, the top-ranked teams are at
Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics, where engineers run the
software on some of the world's fastest workstations. Not only is
this great for science, but it's also a not-so-subtle form of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have said SETI(at symbol)Home is a model for
how many science projects requiring massive amounts of computation
will work in the future. Others have taken the idea further, saying
we'll be able to make a few extra dollars by renting out our
computers to corporations, electronically selling cycles to the
highest bidders. I don't think this is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The first barrier is security. Everyone who runs SETI(at
symbol)Home on their computers has put a tremendous amount of trust
in the program's authors. We trust that the astronomical screen
saver isn't doing anything nefarious, like searching for
credit-card numbers or spinning calculations for nuclear weapons.
Likewise, the SETI(at symbol)Home coordinators trust that misguided
pranksters won't modify their programs and make them report false
sightings of ET. It might only take a few such cases to poison the
community spirit that has led more than a million people all over
the world to download and run the SETI software.
</P>
<P>
   A second potential threat is competition. As more of these
parallel computation projects spring up, there will be more and
more competition between them. Clearly, if there are hundreds of
projects like this on the Internet, they all won't be able to get a
million participants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these fears of mine, SETI(at symbol)Home is off to a
wonderful start. And it would be auspicious indeed if the only way
that we could hear ET's call is by working together as a human
race, without national or language barriers separating us.
</P>

download the software, by visiting

`SECOND SIGHT' IS NEARLY FIRST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SECOND SIGHT 
Produced by: David Lascelles 
Directed by: Charles Beeson 
Screeplay by: Paul Milne 
Date: Thursdays at 9 p.m., PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``Second Sight,'' the crime thriller initiating the 20th
season of PBS's ``Mystery,'' isn't the best production the British
series has produced, it's still superior to most of what you see on
televison. Falling short of ``Mystery'' masterpieces such as
``Inspector Morse'' or ``Prime Suspect'' simply means, like all
merely good things, to miss perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the two-part, three-hour British cop drama (airing
Thursday, Sept. 30 and the following Thursday at 9 p.m.) involves
the brutal killing of a university boy at his family's comfy
suburban home. A prominent subplot, or more accurately, the coplot,
concerns the descent toward blindness of Detective Chief Inspector
Ross Tanner (Clive Owen). Just as he begins leading the murder
investigation, a rare virus begins stealing his eyesight,
intermittently splintering and clouding his vision.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that the pretty blonde detective assisting him,
Catherine Tully (Claire Skinner), volunteers to furtively guide
Tanner about without giving away his disability. Unsurprisingly,
the distance between them is eventually reduced to nothing _ as in
warm skin-to-skin.
</P>
<P>
   If Paula Milne's teleplay sounds somewhat contrived, well, it
is. It's too literarily conscious of its double suspense vehicles:
the manhunt for the elusive killer, and the eye disease threatening
the chief investigator's sight as well as his career. But she
writes crisp, smart dialogue, and fills her murder story,
especially when it ripens in Episode 2, full of cleverly nasty
twists and turns, and an array of credible suspects. Suspicion is
cast on a devious nanny jilted by the murder victim. Inspector
Tully even intuits the dark possibility of incest between the boy
and his mother. And the murdered youth's stepfather turns out to
have a long-lost, jealous, and possibly evil, twin brother who may
have a hand in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The fine production has both luster and, again especially in
Part 2, a dynamic, riveting pace. The camera's shifting point of
view pumps up the tension. Some of ``Second Sight'' is filmed from
Tanner's perspective, revealing his blurred, fragmented vision
while also suggesting, more dramatically than Milne's script does,
a connection between dimming eyesight and heightened insight. At
other times, the camera is a long-distance voyeur, intensifying the
creepiness of events. It also moves in close on faces, mercilessly
plumbing the character of heroes and (potential) villains alike,
while showing off the excellent cast.
</P>
<P>
   This, like so many quality English TV productions, features
nearly flawless performances from stars to minor character players,
the result, probably, of a culture where actors tend to move so
easily and often between screen and stage work. Owen overdoes
Tanner's sullenless a bit, but he brings an intense duality to the
character, a hard, brooding exterior armoring his fears and
cloaking his tenderness. Like Owen, Skinner is too actorishly good
looking to be easily believed as a thick-skinned homicide
investigator, but she evokes a rough edge that gives her cop a
nice, tough reality. The romance between her character and Owen's
unfolds with a refreshing tartness that testifies to the cool
control of both these fine performers.
</P>
<P>
   The other distinction of ``Second Sight'' is the overall sense
it conveys of a real, full-blooded, lived-in world, with its
ambient sounds of traffic and chit chat and rain and busy,
eye-filling interiors and rich cityscapes. This is something
American television (and Hollywood) isn't good at and one reason
why a series like ``Homicide'' felt so different and special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Sight'' may not be perfect, but you won't get up the
morning after feeling guilty about spending part of the night with
it _ and that's a good test for good television.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. _ When Vicente Paratore, a successful artist for
many years, was blinded by a stroke, he plunged into an emotional
and spiritual darkness blacker than anything he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Five times, Paratore tried drown himself in his hot tub. But
each time, something pulled him up, he says. Was it an angel? the
ghost of his mother trying to save him? Or perhaps, he says with a
touch of black humor, ``it was my own blind ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   In a saga as compelling as it is improbable, the blind artist,
who lives in Cranston, R.I., found a way to paint again even though
he could no longer see his canvas.
</P>
<P>
   A show of his work is in progress through October 21 at The
Learning Center of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an amazing artist, absolutely amazing,'' said Sonia
Javier-Obinger manager of community benefits for Beth-Israel
Deaconess and the exhibit's organizer. ``It's the fact that he has
this perspective, despite his limitations. His intense, vibrant
colors speak to his passion. You can see that he loves what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch he cooked at his apartment in Cranston, Paratore
described his life in broad, inspiring strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Now 67, he was born in a town near the Andes in central
Argentina, he said. When he was 11, his father, a construction
worker, died. Vicente dropped out of school to help earn money for
his family, doing an array of department store jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He immigrated to the U.S. in 1959 when he was 27, working first
as a shoemaker and then as a window-dresser in downtown Boston. In
1969, he launched forth on his own as a self-employed artist.
</P>
<P>
   In what he calls his ``gypsy go-round,'' he made paintings and
sculptures and travelled around the country exhibiting them. He
also made clowns and masks from burlap sacks, which he sold from a
booth at Quincy Market.
</P>
<P>
   He felt successful and satisfied. He moved his wife and five
children into a dream home in North Scituate.
</P>
<P>
   But stresses were mounting. He was trying to expand commercial
operations by building a production factory in Argentina. His wife
became seriously ill, which worried him deeply.
</P>
<P>
   One warm evening in May, 1986, after mowing his lawn, ``I was
surprised to find my eyes full of water. When I woke up the next
morning and tried to read a newspaper, the letters were all
blurry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said he had a stroke, which damaged his optical nerves.
He was hospitalized for two weeks. To his horror, his eyesight
deteriorated day after day until he had no sight at all in one eye
and just four percent vision in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from light to dark like that, it was the most terrible
thing you can imagine,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As his family watched anxiously, he sat in a chair in his
kitchen for eight months, utterly depressed, afraid to move. ``I
thought, I can't paint, I can't see the colors I love, I can't
drive, I couldn't do anything,'' he said. ``If I left the chair, I
was afraid I'd stumble.''
</P>
<P>
   In complete dispair, he tried to commit suicide. But something
wouldn't let him slip away. He fervently prayed for some sort of
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he asked a phone operator for the closest
center for the blind. She put him in touch with IN-SIGHT, a
rehabilitation agency for the blind in Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a black hole, really desperate,'' recalled Judy
Smith, IN-SIGHT's president. ``But he was tremendously motivated to
pursue his artistic career.''
</P>
<P>
   He met other blind people with similar struggles. IN-SIGHT staff
taught him basic skills, such as how to read braille, walk with a
cane, cook, shave, arrange his clothes, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he began to regain his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest breakthrough came on Easter Sunday, 1989. His
grandchildren, playing with clay, urged him to make some big, funny
glasses for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working with the clay, something clicked in my
mind,'' he said. That was when he invented the ``paint by touch''
technique that brought him back to life again.
</P>
<P>
   He explained how he molds the clay into thin strands which he
applies to poster board, forming the outlines of the main subjects
for his composition. Then, using a razor, he cuts around the clay,
making a stencil.
</P>
<P>
   After applying background colors to his canvas, he paints within
each stencil window, using paint from tubes marked with raised clay
letters to identify the hues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see with my inside mind,'' he said. ``It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Executed primarily in oils, watercolors and acrylics, his
paintings feature simple images _ A-frame homes in a deserted
landscape, boats in a harbor, sea waves breaking over rocks, as
well as abstracts.
</P>
<P>
   If his work appears less detailed now, it also has a raw power
lacking in his earlier art.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you paint with your eyes, you get critical, you go back
and change a lot of things, you destroy your first impressions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I paint with my heart and my mind, and I don't go back and
fix my paintings because I don't really see them. I think my colors
are more clear, more vibrant, and more exciting than when I had my
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm more proud of myself,'' he added. ``I feel happy,
really happy.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gray cardboard box offered few clues to its actual contents.
Plucked at random from a shelf at the Ukrainian Central Archives in
Kiev last June, where it had sat, conceivably untouched, since
1973, the box was opened to make a point. Not to make news around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is precisely what happened. When Harvard
musicologist Christoph Wolff opened the lid, he saw several bound
volumes of old music scores. The director of the archives had
expected to hear murmurs of approval from his American visitors at
the fine condition of the materials. Instead, Wolff's movements
were greeted with awestruck silence.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, an associate with Harvard's Ukrainian
Research Institute in Cambridge, Mass., spotted a red
``Sing-Akademie Zu Berlin'' stamp on one of the manuscripts. None
of the Americans had seen such a stamp before, yet its import was
unmistakable. Grimsted turned to Wolff, a renowned Bach scholar.
``OK, Christoph, this is it,'' she said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wolff, a Harvard music librarian, pinched her husband.
Wolff's eyes were locked on the name written on one of the
manuscripts: ``Rungenhagen,'' a k a Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen, a
German composer and former director of the Sing-Akademie.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt in Wolff's mind that he was staring at
the Holy Grail that had eluded him for more than 30 years: the
``lost'' musical estate of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788),
second son of Johann Sebastian Bach and in his own lifetime the
best-known member of the musical Bach family.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a treasure trove of 17th- and 18th-century music,
especially German music, the collection was known to include some
500 scores composed by the multibranched Bachs _ along with CPE
Bach's own compositions (including 20 Passions and 50 keyboard
concertos), letters from Johann Goethe to former Akademie director
Carl Friedrich Zelter, and unpublished works by Carl Henrich,
Johann Gottleib Graun, Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Adolph Hasse,
and other important composers of the time, which have never been
available for performance.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, more than 5,100 items, presumed missing and lost to
posterity in the rubble of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' recalls Wolff, whose verification of the
Bach collection caused a worldwide sensation this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back upon the moment from his office in University Hall,
Wolff continues, ``A collection of mainstream music of this
significance has not surfaced in quite some time. I was not
prepared for seeing the whole thing there, intact. It was truly an
enormous surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the Kiev discovery _ set against a backdrop of
Allied bombs, fleeing Nazis, Soviet raiding parties, and KGB
stonewalling _ reads like an Indiana Jones filmscript penned by
John le Carre after hours at the Royal Berlin Conservatory library.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the tale are three figures: Wolff, the Bach
expert who was convinced the collection could be found despite
repeated denials from German and Russian authorities; Grimsted,
whose expertise in Ukrainian ``trophy'' art led her to pick up the
trail of the collection in Kiev; and a Ukrainian official named
Hennadii Boriak, who supported American efforts to solve a riddle
that had frustrated scholars since 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Among the saga's juicy plot elements are the breakup of the
former Soviet Union and the global campaign to return thousands of
cultural artifacts stolen or seized during World War II. While not
as startling as unearthing a missing cache of Rembrandts, say,
discovery of the CPE Bach collection has excited music scholars
worldwide _ and rekindled hope that other ``missing'' wartime
spoils will be found, documented, and returned to their rightful
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the old Soviet Union was about to open those
archives,'' says Grimsted, noting that for decades the KGB
controlled the Soviet archival system and that its influence is
still being felt, both by researchers like herself and by
bureaucrats who outlasted the Soviet regime. Russia has made it
illegal to return trophy materials to Germany. Ukrainian officials
have taken a softer stance, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official line now is that the archives were never a
secret,'' she says. ``I think local officials are embarrassed that
it took a foreign scholar like Wolff to come in and tell them what
they had.'' Grimsted calls the discovery ``the tip of the iceberg''
in terms of the number of trophy materials that may yet be located
within Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the headlines begins more than 200 years ago,
with the founding of the Sing-Akademie in Berlin, in 1791. While
primarly dedicated to musical performance _ in 1829, Felix
Mendelssohn directed Bach's ``St. Matthew's Passion'' at the
Akademie _ the choral society also became a major repository of
18th-century German music, largely due to its acquisition of the
CPE Bach estate under Zelter's aegis. Even so, according to Wolff,
the collection was poorly cataloged and inaccessible to most
scholars long before its disappearance behind Soviet lines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, as Allied bombs rained down upon Berlin, German
authorities shipped thousands of cultural treasures out of the
capital. They were taken to the countryside, remote hiding places
such as to salt mines and monasteries and castles like the one in
Silesia (now part of Poland) where the Sing-Akademie collection was
secreted.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the collection after the Nazis' defeat is still
being pieced together by Grimsted and others. Sing-Akademie
headquarters, located in what later became East Berlin, were
destroyed in the bombing. Soviet troops subsequently captured many
of the strongholds where the Nazis stashed their artifacts. Some
were taken home as war booty. Others were burned as a fuel during
the brutal winter of 1945. Grimsted's research revealed that the
Ukrainians had their own cultural trophy brigades ``in the field''
in 1945 and 1946, competing against other Soviet factions.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to care much about the Sing-Akademie collection
until the 1960s, when Wolff was doing graduate work in Berlin. For
his dissertation, Wolff hoped to reconstruct the music library of
JS Bach. One primary source was the printed estate catalog of CPE
Bach, published in 1790. In the shadow of the Berlin Wall, however,
scholarly exchanges between East and West were virtually
impossibly. Wolff was told that in all likelihood the Sing-Akademie
archives had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   It was over a decade later that Wolff, the author of an
acclaimed Bach biography, heard a rumor that part of the archives
had ended up in Ukraine. He tried to verify the rumor through
musicians he knew in Kiev and Odessa, but no hard evidence turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking, though, which was a good thing,'' says Wolff,
who since 1992 has also served as dean of Harvard's Graduate School
of Arts and Sciences. As recently as 1998, inquiries on his part
yielded nothing more hopeful. Then Grimsted told Wolff earlier this
year that while researching her forthcoming book on Ukrainian
trophy art, she had located a document _ translated from a 1957
Soviet Ministry of Culture report and published in a book by a
German library committee _ alluding to the Sing-Akademie archives
being in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   The initial response from Ukrainian officials was that the
document was probably a forgery. But at this point, the trail had
heated up again.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Boriak, whose chance encounter with a retired Kiev
librarian supplied a key piece to the puzzle. The librarian told
Boriak she had seen a report of a large collection of foreign music
being transferred from a Kiev conservatory to the more spacious
Ukrainian Central State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art, in
1973. The collection was not described further in the report, nor
was its existence confirmed by any archival records available to
Grimsted or other foreign researchers.
</P>
<P>
   However, it did not take a great leap of imagination, or faith,
to suppose this could be the Bach archives. Boriak all but
confirmed their existence through his own contacts at the state
archives. It remained for someone of Wolff's stature to examine the
collection and state whether he believed it was the real thing or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsted e-mailed Wolff to pack his bags.

LOTS OF CATEGORY KILLERS TAKING IT ON THE CHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Category killers were one of the great success stories of the
1980s. Almost overnight, they changed the retail landscape with a
simple concept _ that you could sell one thing in a great big store
and make a lot of money at it. Toys, office supplies, hardware,
electronics: If you picked the right one you could vanquish the
competition and dominate your field.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, some of the category killers have been bleeding
themselves. Toys ``R'' US just lost its chief executive and its
stock is down 65 percent from its all-time high. The office
superstores _ Staples, Office Depot, and OfficeMax _ have lost
anywhere from 40 percent to 50 percent of their market value since
the spring. The two big pet supply chains, Petsmart and Petco, have
been in Wall Street's doghouse for months.
</P>
<P>
   While there are different forces at work in each industry, there
is one unifying theme: intense competition. Like gunslingers in the
Old West, the category killers are being challenged by rivals who
want to prove they are faster, or cheaper, or better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is survival of the fittest,'' says Walter Salmon, an
emeritus professor of retailing at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us may be the most troubled store of the bunch. For
years it was the largest seller of toys in America. More recently
it has lost that title to Wal-Mart, who along with Target has
demonstrated that you don't have to be a toy specialist to sell
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts and money managers say Toys ``R'' Us's decline
is as much an example of corporate suicide as it case of being
mugged by rivals. The company's sins are many, says Steve Paspal, a
money manager with Sovereign Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their service has fallen apart, the merchandising has been
horrible, the stores are too cluttered. Why would you want to go?''
asks Paspal. On top of all that, Toys ``R'' Us has been slow to
respond to Internet challengers like eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Wal-Mart offers the same toys for less money and
the shopping experience is better.
</P>
<P>
   In the office-supply business, the competition comes mainly from
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become clear that three strong players in this market
is at least one too many,'' wrote a pair of analysts from Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in an August report that depressed the stock
prices of all three office superstores.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said the three big players were building too many
stores in a bid to win market share. The result has been weak
same-store sales at Office Depot and OfficeMax and a fear _ so far
unrealized _ that Staples will suffer the same fate. Wal-Mart has
been a minor factor in this market as well, because of its strong
back-to-school business.
</P>
<P>
   In the pet market, the news is no better. Petsmart's stock has
tumbled from 19 to less than 4 since April; rival Petco's stock is
trading at around 12, down from 18 in July. Both companies have had
trouble digesting acquisitions, both are expanding rapidly and, you
guessed it, both have had to contend with Wal-Mart, which sells $2
billion a year worth of pet supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's success cuts to the heart of the very concept of a
category killer. Do people want to go to a different store for each
specialty or would they prefer to go to one place and buy
everything on their shopping list?
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the superstores are hurting. Home Depot, the
home-improvement specialist, continues to do well and remains a
favorite among investors. Home Depot has eliminated all of its
regional competitors and only Lowe's remains as a serious national
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Home Depot like the fact that the chain hasn't been
content to rest on its laurels. It regularly comes up with new
concepts _ stores that offer decorative goods to upscale shoppers,
smaller stores for urban locations _ that contribute to rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are continually reinventing the business,'' says Margaret
Buescher, a portfolio manager with Vaughn Nelson in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In electronics, both Circuit City and Best Buy have managed to
prosper, in part because they are the only two big players still
standing.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting the demise of category killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retailing most formats survive,'' says Harvard's Walter
Salmon. But if there is a lesson in the woes of some of the
industry's best-known names it is this: Retailing is a brutally
competitive business. It's a place where you kill or you get
killed, even if you once were a category killer yourself.
</P>
<P>
   In consumer-driven America, we wouldn't have it any other way.

FEEDING EAST TIMOR REFUGEES A DAUNTING TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REMEXIO, East Timor _ This week, relief workers in the United
States and Taiwan are battling floodwaters and searching collapsed
buildings to get help to the victims of Hurricane Floyd and the
Taipei earthquake. The destruction is terrible and the need
tremendous, but at least aid workers there don't need troops with
submachine guns to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Here in East Timor, the violence and devastation of the last
month were inflicted by men and sponsored by authorities. Some of
the perpetrators are still here and most of the homeless have been
pushed over the border to West Timor. Fires set by foes of
independence still rage daily, and killers claimed nine more
victims just a few days ago, despite the presence in the territory
of more than 4,000 foreign peacekeepers. The rainy season, which
makes many roads impassable, is just a month away.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's hardly the ideal environment for providing
relief to the needy. The UN mission appealed Tuesday for $135
million over the next six months for humanitarian work.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days into the peacekeeping effort in East Timor, at a stage
when aid workers would like to be well along in the mission to
provide food, water, sanitation, medicine and shelter for tens of
thousands of people displaced within East Timor and 200,000 more
who fled or were forced over the western border, two basic
obstacles still stand between victims of the crisis and the relief
they need: a dangerous environment and a lack of transportation.
(Most vehicles were destroyed in the fires and looting).
</P>
<P>
   Other problems stem from those. Wednesday, air drops of food
were halted after a 3-year-old boy was hit by a falling box and had
to have his leg amputated. Indonesian troops are accused of
commandeering relief trucks and blocking a baby food delivery Both
troops and the desperate refugees have looted aid warehouses for
``a spontaneous distribution,'' in the euphemistic parlance of aid
workers. Practically the only hindrance that doesn't exist here is
a plague of locusts, one UN official said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying practical and political barriers are so numerous,
it is hard to count them. Those carrying on the revenge campaign
that followed a landslide vote for independence on Aug. 30 flushed
people out of their homes, and now want to starve them in the
hills. Indonesia, which has ruled East Timor since it annexed the
former Portuguese colony in 1976, at first put up barriers to
airdrops of aid, perhaps because allowing them would be a tacit
acknowledgement of Jakarta's inability or unwillingness to stop the
post-election violence that sparked a humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers say they will help anyone in need, on either side of
the dispute. But since most of the victims back independence and
their attackers included Indonesian military and police, providing
relief to survivors or helping them move back from West Timor is
almost a political act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the interesting position of having to deal with
aggressors to get food to the victims of the crisis,'' said Charles
Robin, commodities officer for World Vision, an organization that
is coordinating distributions for the United Nations' World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bigger job will be the long-term political and
economic reconstruction of East Timor. But for now, the effort to
build a humanitarian operation from ground zero that can distribute
emergency relief quickly and efficiently to hundreds of thousands
of survivors appears daunting.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Robin said, ``we don't know how many people there
are, where they are and what condition they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding out means driving up into the mountains where people
have fled and counting heads, or relying on estimates from
independence leaders who are running a government-in-exile in the
hills. But without trucks or gasoline to haul loads, or enough
peacekeepers to protect aid convoys, even basic reconnaisance
missions are not an easy feat. And when aid workers can't
distribute food in faraway locations themselves, there is always
the concern that a community leader designated to coordinate will
take a cut for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most mundane problems can delay or foul up a delivery.
After losing trucks one day to the Indonesian military and being
delayed the next because there were no peacekeepers available to
protect an aid convoy, Robin finally was on his way to deliver aid
in the hills above Dili. But halfway up the mountain, the driver of
the aid truck pulled over and refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, it turned out, had fled the violence to Dare, a hill
station at the turnoff in the road, and he thought the rice and
medical supplies were going there, to families including his own.
As a multivehicle military escort waited impatiently, the driver
angrily kicked his tires and claimed he didn't have enough gas to
get to Remexio, the place where leaders of the resistance had said
the humanitarian needs were greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about what the leaders say. We are the regular people,
and we are hungry,'' the driver said furiously.
</P>
<P>
   It took Gregorius Fernandez, UNICEF director for East Timor, 10
minutes to persuade the driver to push onwards. ``Yes, we are all
hungry, but we brought some rice to Dare Wednesday. What about our
brothers and sisters in Remexio?''
</P>
<P>
   Past miles of scrubby trees, dry soil and wild red poinsettias,
the convoy finally arrived in Remexio, where dozens of people who
had walked days barefoot from Dili to escape pumped their fists and
cheered in welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no food; for one week, we are just eating leaves,''
Maria Teresa Gusmao, a 30-year-old mother who trudged here over
nine days with her seven small children.
</P>
<P>
   Even as refugees began to flow back into Dili by the thousands
in the last few days, severe food shortages in the city remain and
hungry people have scuffled over food at distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Mountain, the UN humanitarian coordinator for East Timor,
has handled emergency relief in Sudan, Angola and Turkey. By no
means is Timor the most difficult operation he he has participated
in, he said, but it would certainly be easier if it were safe to
traverse the territory, something that most observers said cannot
happen until peacekeepers fan out to protect vast areas of deserted
wasteland and flush out militias _ or until the last Indonesian
troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that may take a while. Until then, people remain hungry and
need shelter, Mountain said. ``We can't sit still til all this is
sorted out.''

 UPN SHOW IS `McNASTY' TO THE CORE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless you're male, 21 or younger, wearing a baseball cap,
listening to hip-hop while simultaneously playing Sega Dreamcast
and _ here's the key _ fully, ragingly, perpetually aroused, then
there's no need for you to read any further.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you may get some joy out of an attempt to dissect
``Shasta McNasty,'' the new UPN offering that was the critical
odds-on favorite for worst show of the season and possibly ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shasta McNasty'' (Thursdays, 9:30 p.m. Eastern) is a neutron
bomb of immense proportions. You're stunned into stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it's too easy to just trounce ``Shasta McNasty.'' To
say that this is no ``ER'' is to master the obvious (though ``ER''
in its own way is formulaic and tedious and probably bores young
males witless). UPN couldn't dumb down ``Shasta McNasty'' to any
greater degree.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is going after young males. While The WB is going after
young women and has, successfully, used that strategy to gain a
niche in the competitive world of network television, UPN only this
season has attempted to get the guys. The network put two hours of
wrestling on Thursday night, has loaded up with a bunch of
action-adventure shows and some sci-fi material, and now enters the
comedy arena with a show so dumb, so low-brow that, if you compare
it to just about anything else, is shocking in its lameness.
</P>
<P>
   That's really the point of ``Shasta McNasty.'' It's a comedy for
young guys, the people who loved ``Dumb and Dumber'' and others
like it. Dean Valentine, the president and chief executive of UPN,
believes that there's a market for the kind of humor that runs
through ``There's Something About Mary'' _ and he's right. (But
this show has nowhere near the, uh, sophistication of that movie _
which was able to attract all kinds of viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shasta McNasty'' centers on three slackers _ two of them white
_ who are in a fledgling hip-hop group. They are Scott (Carmine
Giovinazzo), who at least tries to have a conscience; Dennis (Jake
Busey, son of Gary Busey); and Randy (Dale Godboldo).
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that these guys pal around, do dumb guy things
all the time, refuse to mature even an inch, and scramble to get
money so they can continue their lifestyle, which apparently
involves drinking, cruising for chicks and playing music (the dream
scenario for the target demographic, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, called ``Little Dude,'' featured Verne Troyer, best
known as ``Mini-Me'' in the ``Austin Powers'' movie sequel. As you
might well guess, the midget jokes go off like fireworks _ up to
and including an actual dwarf-bowling scene.
</P>
<P>
   Troyer seems more than game to be made fun of, but also embraced
by the goofy guys (after much slapstick comedy, some swearing and
an instance where he bites Scott's girlfriend on the butt).
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Gary Coleman make a cameo, to continue the short
jokes, but Heather Kozar, a former Playmate of the Year, also has a
few lines, right after the close-up of her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   You know where ``Shasta McNasty'' is setting the bar, right? But
the fact that it shows no embarrassment, no shame in this approach
(after dwarf-bashing, plus some racist and sexist jokes, the show
has a kind of fearless we'll-do-anything moxie), is oddly
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's network is becoming the best untold story of the new
season, as it rebounds from disastrous ratings and is beginning to
punch the shoulder of its rival, The WB, really hard. ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Felicity'' may have snagged the magazine covers and
hype not long ago, but wrestling, cheap action and stupidity may
ultimately be just as profitable.

SELLING COFFEE TO U.S. MAY GIVE HAITIAN FARMERS A CHANCE TO EASE

   CAP ROUGE, Haiti _ As some foreign-aid officials tell it, people
like Orguste Boniface may hold the key to solving Haiti's perpetual
poverty puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   A small-boned man with calloused hands and a deferential manner,
Boniface grows coffee and a few food crops on a couple of lush
acres atop the low mountains of southern Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Haitians, the fiftyish Boniface has been farming his
whole life. And, like most, he's never earned more than not nearly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to work hard and produce the coffee, but it's not
really a good business,'' Boniface says. ``There are more workers
than land. Nobody has a chance to get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, aid planners bankrolled by the U.S. government are betting
that helping Boniface and his neighbors sell their best coffee
directly to American buyers will put more cash in the farmers'
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money, the foreign planners say, will allow Haitian
farmers to hold on to their land. In doing so, the cash may give
this stricken country its best, perhaps last, shot at staying
afloat in an increasingly market-driven world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do nothing but charity, you aren't going to achieve
anything,'' says Zach Lea, an Auburn University agricultural
economist who is helping to develop the direct-selling program for
Haitian coffee. ``There has got to be some blending between pure
economic profit and some sort of charitable work.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems worth a try. Few other schemes in the past half-century
have pulled Haiti's countryside from its deep morass.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Haitians, appallingly poor, struggle with a shrinking
amount of available land, with severe erosion and with a government
that always has taken far more than it has given back.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to the cities,
overwhelming urban planners and swamping labor markets. Rural
Haiti's torment has fed its urban ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The peasants who stay clear the steep mountainsides and plant
beans, corn and other crops. Most of the food is eaten by the
farmers' families, the rest sold to Haiti's hungry cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the thin soil wears out. Crops start failing. And with much
of their natural brush scraped away, there's nothing left to brace
the slopes against the seasonal rains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity pulls at Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, foreign-aid agencies have tried to stop the erosion
by paying local farmers to plant millions of trees. But before the
trees grew very tall, cash-starved peasants cut them down,
rendering the timber into charcoal for sale in Port-au-Prince and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The more trees that were planted, the more that were chopped
away.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, foreign-funded agencies contracted local people to
dig irrigation canals, to terrace mountainsides and to plant
hedge-rows to stop the decay. But, unconvinced of the projects'
purposes, farmers worked only as long as they were paid. Things
fell apart when funding stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lea and other planners say markets can succeed where aid
long has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Better prices will encourage peasants to plant and maintain
coffee bushes and cacao trees, they say. More trees and bushes will
keep the topsoil on the mountains. Increasing income will allow
rural families to better educate their children. An educated
population can generate prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm betting is that if I change the price of coffee,
people will go out and try to produce more,'' Lea says. ``If we
change the price 20 or 30 percent, people start becoming more
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The local leaders of the peasant coffee associations that market
the product have sometimes simply replaced the Port-au-Prince
businessmen who brokered coffee exports, keeping the lion's share
of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee is a commodity, subject to wild swings in price.
International coffee prices have been sinking for years, and
profitable markets for even the best quality coffee can be
difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   There is still too little technical advice to farmers about how
to treat diseases that attack the coffee shrubs and how to improve
the quality of the coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lea and other proponents say, direct selling already has
significantly boosted the incomes of mango and cacao growers
elsewhere in Haiti. They say the model can work for the coffee
farmers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers have to change the way they harvest, and cooperatives
have to be set up differently,'' Lea says. ``Haitian coffee will be
a much larger success story in the future, a true success story.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that focusing on export markets, instead of
trying to provide enough food for Haiti to be self-sufficient, has
created more problems than it has solved.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Development GAP, a Washington think tank that studies
the negative effects of the global economy on developing countries,
found that dropping tariffs and other barriers has increased
Haiti's dependency on imported food.
</P>
<P>
   In only a decade, for example, Haiti has gone from growing
nearly all the rice it consumed to importing half of its needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development aid has been too focused on an export-led model of
development and that has never been appropriate for Haiti,'' says
Lisa McGowan, a Washington, D.C., economist who has worked on
Haitian economic development issues since 1983 and who wrote the
Development GAP report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't depend upon someone else to feed you,'' McGowan
says. ``It is a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Orguste Boniface and his neighbors in the village of Cap Rouge
were among the first Haitian farmers to participate in direct
export of coffee, and they acknowledge that the plan has brought
them a little extra income. Families have a little more food, the
farmers say. And a few more local children have been able to go to
high school in nearby towns. But the farmers say the extra money,
so far, has been far from their salvation.
</P>
<P>
   A miles-long string of small houses, well tended fields and
family graveyards, Cap Rouge hangs like a necklace on the ridgeline
above Jacmel, a picturesque town on Haiti's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with much of blighted Haiti, Cap Rouge seems blessed.
Rain-fed fields boast dark loam and verdant crops. Most houses are
well-kept and gaily painted. Residents travel part of the year to
jobs in Jacmel and elsewhere to boost their families' incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cap Rouge is crowded, with every house seemingly bursting
with children. Almost every piece of available land, even the
rockiest and steepest hillsides, has been planted with something,
attesting to the lack of fields.
</P>
<P>
   Like those across Haiti, many people from Cap Rouge still slip
illegally into the Dominican Republic to find work in the fields
and construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Dominican Republic we would be dead,'' says Lundi
Morila, 61, who served as the senior government authority in Cap
Rouge under past dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Other farmers have moved away to Jacmel or Port-au-Prince, where
work is scarce and finding food is a daunting expense.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers remain as suspicious of direct-selling schemes as
they are of most everything else. Long decades of being cheated _
or thinking they were cheated _ by better-educated and wealthier
people from the cities have made the farmers look askance at anyone
offering to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say all the money goes to the poor, but the poor never
see it,'' says Jean Baptist Lesciant, a member of one of the Cap
Rouge coffee growers associations. ``When they send money, the
people in the city keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cap Rouge so far has been spared the erosion that has destroyed
much of the Haitian countryside. But nearby valleys along the
highway that cuts north from Jacmel to Port-au-Prince already have
been denuded. Some Cap Rouge farmers say those valleys foretell
their village's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years from now this will be all desert,'' Morila says as
he glances at the fruit trees and bean plants that lick the edges
of Cap Rouge. ``To make Haiti better you have to make work for
people. We need some kind of industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Orguste Boniface shares three small houses in Cap Rouge with his
wife, many of their 10 children and several grandchildren _ 20
people in all. The family survives on what it can grow on the few
hilly acres surrounding their houses. And things get tighter with
each new mouth to feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no clinics, no stores, no help,'' says Boniface's
wife, Civilizae, as she surveys the reddish-brown sprinkle of
coffee beans drying on the concrete patio in front of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This life is miserable,'' she says.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ The crowd forms early each morning in
front of a small hospital along the road that climbs from the
simmering squalor of Haiti's capital to the cool heights where its
wealthy few live.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people come for free medicines they could never
afford, to treat the stomach ailments and lung diseases that plague
the poor everywhere. Others bring emaciated toddlers for emergency
care, the clinic's paid Haitian staff and foreign volunteers all
that stand between the babies and the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Run by the Roman Catholic Church, the hospital was founded more
than a dozen years ago to care for severely malnourished children
brought to an orphanage farther up the mountain. Soon, ragged
people from across Port-au-Prince were coming for free medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the hospital opened, Haiti has ricocheted
between heavy-handed dictatorship and half-hearted democracy.
Foreigners have spent enormous sums to relieve the country's raw
poverty. Roads have been built, free meals handed out, development
schemes launched.
</P>
<P>
   None of it has mattered to the hospital or to the people who
depend upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really hasn't been much of a difference at all in terms
of malnourishment and other health problems,'' says Rick Frechette,
a 46-year-old priest and physician from Connecticut who has worked
at the hospital since it opened. ``How do you have development when
most people don't work? People need jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, foreign governments, aid agencies and lenders like
the World Bank have poured billions of dollars into this country,
trying to fix what they think is broken. And for decades, those
efforts have come up pitifully short. Now, five years after a U.S.
invasion reinstalled elected civilian rule, Haiti still struggles
for its footing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than push this nation of 8 million toward prosperity,
many say, the aid has served merely to soothe foreign consciences.
While softening the social and political impact of Haiti's
destitution, it has converted many people into charity cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``International aid for the past 40 years has failed,'' says
economist Kesner Pharel, a former Haitian central bank official who
now owns a private consulting firm. ``People are living the same
way they always have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having someone in the hospital,'' Pharel says. ``You
try to make them comfortable until they die, but they will never
leave the ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragged and rancorous, Haiti points to the failure of
international aid to better the lives of the Earth's poorest in an
age driven by free trade and market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   With its economic policies engineered by foreign technocrats,
Haiti finds itself unable to compete in the global economy,
incapable of feeding and caring for itself. Aid, some critics say,
merely softens the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development schemes in Haiti have never responded to the needs
of the Haitian people,'' says Lisa McGowan, a Washington, D.C.,
labor economist and consultant who has 17 years' experience with
Haitian poverty. ``It's not that they are putting money into a
hopeless situation. It's that they are the ones calling the shots,
and the shots they are calling are not working.''
</P>
<P>
   International aid's failure in Haiti comes as budgets for
development and relief are being slashed in Washington and other
world capitals and as liberals and conservatives grow increasingly
critical of the aid industry.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1,000 foreign and Haitian aid agencies and
development groups work in the country, supported by foreign
governments, private foundations or Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has been spending about $100 million a year
in Haiti since 1994. Canada, France and other countries also send
tens of millions of dollars in help. The bulk of the U.S. aid comes
in the form of free food distributed as meals at schools or sold in
Haitian markets to fund other development projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're spending a lot of money, but things are getting
worse,'' says Michelle Carter, an official in Port-au-Prince with
CARE, the big U.S-funded aid agency that has been working in Haiti
since 1959. ``It seems like the needs have increased and people's
expectations have increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unstable situation,'' she says. ``To expect aid
agencies to generate a better standard of living is unfair. It goes
beyond aid agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, things would be even more dire without the foreign
help. Aid has helped rebuild some of the country's roads and
utilities. It has financed government administration and children's
educations, and it has helped keep the poorest Haitians alive.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has spawned corruption, enabled inept rulers to
maintain power and prevented Haitians from taking control of their
own destinies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the aid in Haiti, there is such a dependency
culture that efforts in development are thwarted by attitudes,''
says Leanne Geisterfer, who works in Haiti for the development
agency of the Christian Reformed Church, based in Grand Rapids,
Mich. ``There are little pockets of hope, but the overwhelming
attitude is, `What are you going to do for us?'
</P>
<P>
   ``From a development perspective,'' she says, ``that is a
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Haiti remains the poorest country in the hemisphere. Destitute
Honduras appears decidedly well off in comparison. Mexico, with its
millions of people in bitter need and its yawning gaps between rich
and poor, seems wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 80 percent of rural Haitians live in poverty,
defined by aid experts as having to spend more than three-fourths
of their income to eat each day.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, unemployment hovers near 70 percent, although many
Haitians make livings as street vendors or doing other such
``informal'' labor. A good job pays about $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income here stands at about $250, far below 30 years
ago, less than a tenth of that of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy is 55 years, about 20 years less than in the
United States and many Latin American countries. More than half of
Haiti's people cannot read or write.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti already ranks among the world's most crowded countries.
Its population is expected to double to 16 million in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at our worst. We cannot go lower than where we are,''
says Jean Claude Cerin, the 42-year-old Haitian director of the
Mennonite Economic Development Agency, a U.S. organization that
provides small loans to Haitian farmers and merchants. ``We have to
do something as a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We either will get our act together, or the country ends up
being a protectorate of the international community,'' says Cerin,
who earned a master's degree in the United States in developmental
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Like other experts here, Cerin blames Haiti's perpetual crisis
on the country's failed politics, on an economic system that favors
a minuscule elite and on ill-conceived foreign schemes that he says
have tended to create dependency rather than promote
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are shortcomings on both sides,'' Cerin says. ``They
come together and really create quite a chaotic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos rules Port-au-Prince, the once charming port city that has
become a teeming warren of the dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic chokes the crumbling streets. The luxury cars and sport
utility vehicles of foreign-aid workers and Haiti's rich navigate a
sea of jalopies.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity blacks out frequently, staying off for hours. Phone
service is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the capital spend their days buying and selling
whatever they can. Vendors line every thoroughfare, offering
everything from fruit to engine oil, from clothes and art work to
electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Beggars throng intersections and the entryways of office
buildings. Armed assailants sometime attack motorists snared by the
traffic. Shootings are common.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the poor dress in second-hand clothes donated to U.S.
charities, then sold to brokers and shipped here for resale.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone suffers. Haiti's old-money families thrive. And the
burgeoning narcotics trade pumps new wealth into the country, which
has become a way station on the cocaine trail. Haitians living in
the United States and elsewhere send as much as $800 million home,
economists say. Some of that money has financed new houses and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mansions rise in the wealthy mountainside neighborhoods above
the Haitian capital. Other new luxury homes go up near the airport
on the northern fringe of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked behind high walls, the offices of the more prominent
private-aid agencies pepper the well-to-do neighborhoods of the
capital. Suspicious guards keep out the uninvited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they send a lot of help to Haiti, but it stays in the
city,'' says Jean Bonnet, a coffee farmer near the Caribbean coast
south of Port-au-Prince. ``People just put it in Swiss banks.''
</P>
<P>
   With few large successes to brag about, foreign-aid officials
point to projects like a recently improved two-lane highway that
runs along the shore west of Port-au-Prince and over the mountains
to the Caribbean coast town of Jacmel, which planners hope will
become a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   But good roads have been built here before. Most have
deteriorated because of the region's torrential rains and a lack of
repair well before the loans to build them have been repaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem in Haiti is not a question of building roads but
of maintaining them,'' Pharel says.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's biggest hurdle remains political. The country grapples
with the legacy of the 28-year, U.S.-backed dictatorship of the
Duvalier family, which ended in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A series of inept and short-lived military rulers replaced the
Duvaliers. The generals yielded briefly in 1991 to the popularly
elected government of Jean Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic
priest, and then reclaimed power in a coup seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide had been elected president on the promise of bringing
sweeping change that would benefit Haiti's poor. Although restored
to office by the U.S. invasion, he never regained the political
momentum he needed to carry out his plans. The grass-roots movement
that supported Aristide disintegrated over the past five years.
Former allies became fierce rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his waning popularity and fractured political movement,
Aristide is expected to retake the presidency in elections late
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the funding promised by the World Bank and other lenders
following Aristide's return in October 1994 has been held up by
lack of approval from the Haitian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Long too combative to agree on the projects or much of anything
else, the Parliament was disbanded last January by President Rene
Preval, who succeeded Aristide in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New parliamentary elections, in which some 60 political parties
may field candidates, are scheduled for late November. But only 5
percent of those eligible cast ballots in the April 1997 vote. A
high-level Haitian commission later found those elections to be
riddled with fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many humanitarian aid organizations, both government
and private, devoted money to short-term projects and giveaways.
The various aid groups have not coordinated many projects,
according to a recent U.N. report, and have done little to plan
strategy with Haitian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups, critics say, often have focused more on meeting the
requirements set by donors than on worrying about the long-term
effects of their own projects.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians have been paid to make improvements in their own
communities without being convinced of the need for them. Some aid
workers say that when a project's funding runs out, villagers allow
the improvements to decay. This process, they say, has been
repeated year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is providing emergency assistance even
though the emergency is no longer on CNN,'' says Chris Hennemeyer,
the country's representative of Catholic Relief Services, whose aid
program in Haiti mostly consists of distributing U.S. government
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of foreign aid coming in here now is not going to
change things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say Haiti's future depends on urban industry
aimed at exporting goods. Low-wage labor is about all this country
has to offer, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a buyer's market in cheap labor these days. And
Haiti competes with countries throughout Latin America and Asia
where phones work, electricity stays turned on and politics remain
relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti needs nearly 2 million jobs, economists say. But the
country's assembly industry, which at its height employed just
60,000, was gutted by the U.S.-engineered economic embargo aimed at
ousting the military junta in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's factories, many of which assemble clothing and other
goods for sale in the United States, have recovered slightly in
recent years. Still, industrial employment remains barely half what
it was before the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   An industrial future for Haiti, if it happens at all, will be a
long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, something must be done about the rural poor,
aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger, overcrowding and a badly deteriorating environment
continue to drive many thousands from the land.
</P>
<P>
   Some have taken to open boats, trying to sail to better lives in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Others have slipped across the border into the Dominican
Republic in search of low-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have poured into Port-au-Prince and smaller cities,
scratching for work where little is to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Port-au-Prince, many find surviving from day to day as
difficult as raising a crop in the depleted soil.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most desperate of them eventually show up at the
front door of the small hospital that the Rev. Rick Frechette runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the root of the problem is that Haiti has never
been cut into the world economy,'' the priest says. ``People need
jobs.''

MONTY PYTHON BROKE ALL THE RULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty years ago, the Beatles _ who helped turn
Western culture inside out _ were breaking up, but another bunch of
British naughty boys were just getting a forum to thumb their
collective noses at, well, just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 5, 1969, ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' debuted on the
British Broadcasting Corp., and the world of comedy hasn't been the
same. Irreverent, innovative and intelligent, Monty Python's humor
was as surreal as it was broad. Sketches were often an unlikely
combination of ``Alice in Wonderland'' meets British music-hall
bawdiness, with the line ``and now for something completely
different'' meaning the lads repeating the same sketch over again.
</P>
<P>
   The series ran until 1973, and while it's been available on
video, A&AMP;E is beginning to release it on DVD, with some bonuses.
(Columbia recently put out ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' on
DVD for $24.99). The series comes in a two-disc packet ($24.99)
with three episodes on each disc, which have added material like
clips from their 1982 Hollywood Bowl appearance and bios of the
boys. There are four sets from the first season.
</P>
<P>
   Consisting of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry
Jones, Terry Gilliam and the late Graham Chapman, the boys didn't
even have a name when they were conceiving the show, but their
zaniness resulted in a BBC executive referring to them as a
``flying circus.'' No one seems to remember who came up with Monty
Python, but Palin had suggested Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus from a
name he found in the paper. Luckily it didn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the air, Monty Python quickly established, as one writer
put it, ``a state of mind.'' The absurd was normal, normal was
absurd. In a famous early sketch called ``The Funniest Joke in the
World,'' a comedy writer conceives the world's funniest joke and
dies laughing. The scene quickly segues to a breathless reporter
covering the action as a policeman tries to remove the deadly joke
from the writer's house as if it were a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The scene quickly shifts again as the joke somehow becomes part
of the Allied effort to defeat the Germans. Hitler is shown telling
a joke (not really, of course) as the Germans try to develop their
own deadly joke. Soon, Allied troops are running through woods,
shouting out the joke in German (so they are unaffected), as Nazi
troops fall like flies. All this in about four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pythons were afraid to poke fun at sacred cows, they
weren't afraid to put their Oxford educations (not all of them) to
use, either. Who else would have Cardinal Richelieu, chief adviser
to France's Louis XIII, as a character in a skit. Well, actually it
isn't the cardinal but a Richelieu impersonator, but you get the
idea of silliness. Then again they had Mozart hosting a program on
famous death scenes and Picasso painting during a bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Holy Grail,'' the lads skewer _ or is it lance? _ the
Arthurian legend as the knights pretend to ride through the kingdom
while their servants follow behind smacking two coconuts together
to simulate hoofbeats.
</P>
<P>
   If their lunacy wasn't always brilliant, it was always inspired,
and their influence on comedy is incalculable. What the Pythons did
was help rewrite the rules _ jokes didn't need punch lines,
sketches didn't need endings, and if the confines of traditional
humor boxed them in, they just destroyed the box.
</P>
<P>
   There is a blurb on the series cover that probably wasn't
written by one of the Pythons: ``Now in glorious digital DVD format
so that you, the digital aficionado, can enjoy the original
scratches, pops and hisses with crystal clarity.'' It's a bit of
irony that the boys would appreciate. Nevertheless, in another
irony, they do look great on DVD. &QL;

 &HT;    Protected area of Minnesota, Blue Mounds a beautiful reminder of
what used to be
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUVERNE, Minn. _ As the last bit of sunlight faded behind the
wooded hillock that hid our Blue Mounds State Park campsite, my
husband and I floated up to our necks in a little lake on the edge
of the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   The whir of the insects, the breeze rustling through the tall
grasses, even the roaring of bullfrogs, sounded only slightly
exotic to our Georgia ears. But the sudden howling and yipping of
nearby coyotes, followed by the bellow of a startled bison _ a
member of the park's herd _ left us with no doubt that we were a
long way from home.
</P>
<P>
   Sod busters who passed this way more than a hundred years ago
must have heard many of the same sounds. But at that time a sea of
grass stretched unbroken from Canada to Texas, sustaining vast
herds of bison and other wildlife. Today, pieces of the prairie
remain only in parks and preserves _ protected areas, like Blue
Mounds, in the extreme southwestern corner of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mounds' 1,500 acres offer visitors a pioneer vision of
natural beauty _ wildflowers, cliff swallows and dickcissels,
bison, head-high teasel and big bluestem. The park itself is well
above the level of the adjacent farmland. Open year-round for
camping, the property boasts miles of trails, lakes for swimming
and fishing, and quiet places for repose and daydreaming.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after our swim, we rose at dawn and hiked the Upper
Mound Trail, which leads out onto a gently rising tall-grass
prairie. All around us the grass and wildflowers were high, almost
impassable, undulating in the wind. The views of the surrounding
farmland were distant and wide.
</P>
<P>
   At one point an entire flock of larkspurs shot up from the
brush, right beside the path. A couple of miles from the trail
head, the path approached the sheer cliffs on the park's eastern
side. Standing atop them, with our backs to the scenery of a time
gone by, we gazed out across the beautiful geometry of a vast,
cultivated plain.
</P>
<P>
   The cliffs are composed of glossy pink Sioux quartzite and are a
popular destination for rock climbers. Viewed through the haze of
distance by early settlers, the 80-foot-high outcrops looked blue
on the horizon. Thus, pink cliffs were dubbed ``Blue Mounds,''
despite a glaring chromatic discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   This beautiful planar quartzite crops out, not only in the
vicinity of the cliffs, but also at unexpected places all over the
park. Metamorphosed from sandstone, it is ancient, about 1.5
billion years old. The presence of iron oxide tints the rocks pink
and purple.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along the trail we came to the Rock Alignment, a
mysterious, 1,250-foot-long line of rocks at the southern end of
the park. It was built by prehistoric peoples; its purpose remains
unknown. Observers have noticed, however, that on the first days of
spring and autumn, sunrise and sunset line up precisely with this
cryptic strip of stone.
</P>
<P>
   After our hike we packed up our camping equipment, hopped in the
car and drove to nearby downtown Luverne. There we sought out the
Koffee Haus on Main Street, a local hangout we heartily recommend
(507-283-8676). It has delicious pastries, breads and other light
fare, plus a variety of beverages in addition to coffee. The prices
are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street is the Brandenburg Gallery (507-283-1884), which
features the work of National Geographic photographer Jim
Brandenburg, a Luverne native. Wander in for a look at his nature
photos, many of them featuring the Great Plains. You can buy
prints, framed or not, right off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mounds State Park has 73 tent and RV sites, 40 with
electrical hookups, near bathrooms and showers. The 14 walk-in
campsites _ carts are provided for transporting your gear _ are
private and primitive, with no water or electricity nearby, and no
shower in the bathroom (showers are a long walk or a short drive
away). The park also has a swimming beach, a lake, a playground for
children, and 13 miles of hiking trails. Near the south end of the
park is an interpretive center; the entrance is farther north.
</P>
<P>
   Take I-90 to Luverne, Minn. Blue Mounds State Park is a few
miles north of town on U.S. 75.
</P>
<P>
   The park is open year-round for primitive camping, but park
staff turn off the showers when the temperature begins to drop. One
year, the shower cutoff date was in January; another year, it was
in October. The park entrance fee is $4 per car. It's $8 per day to
camp in a primitive site, while the developed ones cost $12 per
day, plus $2.50 for electricity. For more information: 508-283-1307
or www.dnr.state.mn.us/parksandrecreation/stateparks/.
</P>
<P>
   With 4,700 residents, the nearby town of Luverne offers some
pleasant amenities. The town has five motels, including the locally
owned Cozy Rest (1-800-839-1375) and the Comfort Inn
(1-800-228-5150). The Magnolia Steakhouse, near I-90 and U.S. 75,
offers steaks and seafood (507-283-9161), and the Blue Mound Inn
(507-283-2718), on U.S. 75 on the way to the park, features a
hearty smorgasbord. For more information, contact the Luverne
Chamber of Commerce: 1-888-283-4061 or www.luvernemn.com.

 &HT;    Tool around the South for a blazingly good fix of gorgeous fall
color
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temperatures are dipping. The days are shortening. And the
trees are getting ready for their closeup.
</P>
<P>
   Every fall, the leaves put on their colorful pageant, and
Atlantans flock to sites where the show is the most dramatic. Sure,
we can all watch the colors change in our own back yards, through a
film of local smog. But _ call us crazy _ many of us would rather
take in this annual spectacle at some place like North Carolina's
Grandfather Mountain, bundled up against a chilly October breeze,
surveying the brilliant, multihued patchwork for miles around.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an unusually dry summer, the trees in some Southern
states may experience earlier-than-normal color change, according
to the U.S. Forest Service. Last week, the poplars, sourwoods and
sumacs were just beginning to turn in North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   At least one leaf expert says the drought will cause greater
vividness in some areas. Western Carolina University biology
professor J. Dan Pittillo, who has observed color patterns in North
Carolina for years, predicts brilliant hues in the state's central
Piedmont area and good color in the mountains. (Last year, the leaf
season in western North Carolina peaked around Oct. 20.)
</P>
<P>
   Below are some places around the South where you can get your
fall color fix. For regular fall color updates, call the U.S.
Forest Service at 1-800-354-4595 or visit
www.fs.fed.us/news/fall.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY
</P>
<P>
   This 469-mile mountain thoroughfare, stretching from
Waynesville, N.C., to Waynesboro, Va., offers some of the best fall
foliage views in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf peepers will want to stop at the Cumberland Knob Recreation
Area, 18 miles south of Sparta, N.C. Pack a picnic lunch and head
for the 2,885-foot summit of Cumberland Knob, with open areas that
offer impressive vistas. Motor a few miles north to Doughton Park,
where, at the Wildcat Rocks overlook, you can gaze 1,500 feet
straight down to Basin Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot fall color spot is Grandfather Mountain, one mile
off the parkway on U.S. 221 near Linville, N.C. Take the mile-high
swinging bridge that leads to the summit (5,964 feet above sea
level) or hike along 12 miles of trails shrouded in clouds. Be on
the lookout for bears, panthers, deer and eagles amid the dazzling
quilt of reds, yellows and oranges.

Tellico Plains, Tenn., to Robbinsville, N.C. Great views can be
found at Turkey Creek Overlook, 15 miles east of Tellico Plains,
and Unicoi Crest Overlook near the Tennessee-North Carolina line.
</P>
<P>
   On the North Carolina side, the road begins a steep descent into
the Santeetlah Creek Valley, revealing a breathtaking view of the
heavily wooded Santeetlah Creek Gorge, with the Smoky Mountains
looming in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 1-800-245-5428 in Tennessee; 1-800-470-3790 in

<P>
   CHEROKEE FOOTHILLS
</P>
<P>
   SCENIC HIGHWAY
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous vistas and historic sites dot this 130-mile route
through the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the
northwestern corner of South Carolina. Avid hikers should schedule
a stop at Table Rock State Park north of Pickens. It's a difficult
five-mile trek to the summit of Table Rock Mountain, but the view
from atop the mountain's sheer cliffs always draws raves.
</P>
<P>
   Also visit Caesars Head State Park, where you can pick up the 4
1/2-mile trail to Raven Cliff Falls, the Southeast's second-highest
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 1-800-849-4766.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHEAST ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   A drive along the Lookout Mountain Parkway north of Gadsden
should give leaf lovers plenty to gawk at. Make your way to DeSoto
State Park, set on 5,067 wooded acres along Little River Canyon.
Forty miles of scenic roadway wind through the park; stop at DeSoto
Falls and drink in the majestic rush of a 100-foot waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   From the parkway, take the 22-mile scenic route along Canyon
River Drive. The road follows the edge of the Little River Canyon,
the deepest canyon east of the Mississippi, and offers views of
Little River Falls and stunning rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 205-845-3957.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHEAST GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Why go out of state? We have some excellent leaf-watching right
here in Georgia. Here are two routes that take you past some of the
state's most awe-inspiring natural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Travel north of Helen on Ga. 75, turn right on Ga. 365 to Anna
Ruby Falls and Unicoi State Park. (The trail to Anna Ruby Falls is
closed for repaving until next week. Call 1-800-532-2521 for
updates.)
</P>
<P>
   Backtrack to Ga. 75, then head north to Ga. 180, which leads to
the turnoff to Brasstown Bald, Georgia's highest peak at 4,784
feet. Return to Ga. 180 and proceed west to U.S. 129, then travel
south to Vogel State Park. Backtrack again: Go north on U.S. 129,
east on Ga. 180, then south on Ga. 348, which will take you past
Helton Creek Falls and connects with Ga. 75 Alternate via Richard
Russell Scenic Highway.
</P>
<P>
   While you're in the area, check out Oktoberfest in Helen,
continuing through Nov. 6. Northeast Georgia's alpine village
celebrates with German music and authentic food and beer in the
Festhalle. 706-878-2181.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Atlanta take I-85 to I-985 to Gainesville, then follow
Ga. 60 to Dahlonega. Then go east on Ga. 52, which will take you

 &HT;    Experience the great outdoors doesn't have to mean roughing it

   NANTAHALA GORGE, N.C. _ What was that?
</P>
<P>
   The brief, inhuman bellow seems to have come from a sodden copse
of pine trees standing between me and the Falling Waters Adventure
Resort's bathhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hurriedly deciding to forgo my usual bedtime ablutions, I creep
slowly backward on the footpath. I cock an ear to catch the next
unholy yelp, but there is only the plop of plump raindrops soaking
the campground from the leafy bows above.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was _ Bigfoot? Eric Robert Rudolph? The Blair Witch?
_ has apparently gone. But I swear I could make out definite
consonant and vowel sounds in that monstrous moan. I think my
hellish tormentor was crying ``yurt!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was envious of my lodgings. And rightly so. Modern
yurts _ canvas huts modeled after the living quarters of ancient
nomadic Mongolian tribes _ are to tents what the Ritz-Carlton is to
Motel 6. Each of the eight fat, round, rust-colored dwellings at
Falling Waters' yurt village boasts amenities that would make your
average flannel-clad woodsman spit in disgust: a polished Douglas
fir floor. A comfy canopy bed flanked by Pottery Barn-style side
tables and lamps. A refrigerator, coffee maker, ceiling fan, space
heater, chest of drawers _ and don't forget the basket of fresh
towels in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   If one must be camped in the woodsy recesses of Western North
Carolina, fending off demons during a rare summer rainstorm as I
did or watching the leaves change as fall sets in, one could do far
worse.
</P>
<P>
   As Falling Waters owner Jim Greiner notes, the yurts are for
people ``who like the idea of camping'' but not necessarily the
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our renters are big-city professionals,'' says
Greiner, who built the village in 1998 across the highway from his
11-year-old Wildwater Nantahala Rafting Center, five minutes from
the northern end of the Nantahala River. ``They want the option of
being outdoors in a beautiful area, but with some of the perks that
you don't get in a tent.'' Chief among them, heavy insulation and
airtight, double glass doors that keep out bugs, snakes and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the staples of camping remain _ the communal bathhouse,
for instance. True, its private restrooms and showers are
uncommonly clean, and there's usually hot water, but you still have
to shuffle across the campground in your flip-flops to get to it.
There are also several built-in outdoor grills, which look as if
they've cooked up some real tasty burgers ... on nicer days.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past 48 hours, the rain has made it difficult to
enjoy the outdoor pleasures that draw thousands of rafters, hikers
and mountain bikers to the area every year. The yurts stand vacant
(save mine), the muddy hiking trails that wind through the woods
around the village remain unmarked by boot prints. A few die-hard
rafters took to the churning river earlier in the day, but most
folks, like me, stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, what scintillating rainy-day diversions a yurt offers!
After scrapping a planned morning hike, I spent a half-hour or so
watching the spectacle ``When Rivulets Collide'' on the outside of
the glass doors. After that, I ate four Pop-Tarts. Then I tried to
guess which breed of lapdog the squeaking ceiling fan sounded most
like. (Pomeranian, I decided.) Finally, I settled in on the bed and
read, oh, about three pages of Bill Bryson's ``Notes From a Small
Island'' before curling up for a long nap.
</P>
<P>
   But even cabin fever can't take away from the resplendence of
the surrounding landscape. My yurt (8, ask for it) overlooks the
vast Nantahala Gorge; mist rises from the placid waters of Fontana
Lake at the bottom. Hemlock branches envelop the picnic areas like
the arms of evergreen mothers. A frisky waterfall splashes down the
side of the gorge through clumps of hardwoods sure to be wrapped in
multihued muumuus when autumn dresses this mountain idyll.
</P>
<P>
   One can stroll onto the yurt's deck and gaze for hours at the
lake, listen to the fecund hum of the forest and pontificate
Thoreau-like on the poetic beauty of nature. Just watch your back _
who knows when the Blair Witch might return?

THE LIMEY SIDE OF TERENCE STAMP

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Terence Stamp
in ``The Limey.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been almost 40 years since Terence Stamp, then a
20-year-old neophyte actor, was nominated for a
best-supporting-actor Oscar for ``Billy Budd'' (l962).
 &HT;    Stamp didn't win, but almost four decades later he's a contender
for the award again with a powerful performance in the title role
of a very different kind of movie _ ``The Limey,'' which opens on
Oct. 8.
 &HT;    Stamp was born in East London, which makes him a genuine limey _
referring to an Englishman, the label was first attached to British
sailors because of the lime juice served aboard ships of the Royal
Navy to prevent scurvy. He plays another limey, Dave Wilson, a
lean, mean, silver-haired senior citizen just released from a
British prison ... and bent on vengeance.
 &HT;    Wilson's daughter has died in a mysterious car crash in
California, it seems, and the ex-convict and renegade dad flies to
Los Angeles to discover the truth about her untimely demise. There
he encounters her lover (Peter Fonda), a sleazy, rich rock
entrepreneur, one of those languid, lounge-lizard leftovers from
the 1960s who are instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with
the culture of the Sunset Strip.
 &HT;    The movie is violent and intense _ director Steven Soderbergh
calls it ``a mystery thriller that has been put through a
Cuisinart.''
 &HT;    An intriguing footnote is that Dave Wilson is the same low-rent
criminal Stamp played in director Ken Loach's British film ``Poor
Cow'' (1967). In fact, Soderbergh even spliced scenes from that
movie into the new film as flashbacks, with the young, fresh-faced
Stamp helping to flesh out the history of his aging limey.
 &HT;    In a separate interview, Soderbergh says he never considered
anyone else for the role.
 &HT;    ``The last time I saw Terry in a lead role he had a dress on,''
he says, referring to Stamp's star turn as a drag queen decked out
in a glitzy wardrobe of evening clothes, trekking around the
Australian outback, in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert'' (1994).
 &HT;    ``But he has such a great cinema face,'' Soderbergh says, ``and
this film is about you staring at this guy for 90 minutes. If you
don't do that, the movie doesn't work. He's very idiosyncratic,
with lots of baggage.''
 &HT;    Buoyed by the enthusiastic early response to the picture from
the Toronto Film Festival, Stamp has been working hard to plug
``The Limey.'' At 59 he's still handsome, and enviably trim in a
lilac, double-breasted suit, a flower-painted tie and brown shoes,
with the dark hair of his youth now a distinguished silver.
 &HT;    He admits that his success in ``Billy Budd'' came to him while
he was still immature. He was only in his early 20s when he found
himself an icon of Britain's ``Swinging '60s.''
 &HT;    ``I remember the '60s fondly,'' he says. ``I had time for
everything in those days, because I became famous in l960. I
thought it was just happening to me _ I didn't realize it was
happening to everybody.
 &HT;    ``I can't think of a better time to be a young man than London
at the beginning of the '60s.''
 &HT;    By his own admission, Stamp cut a wide swath in those days.
 &HT;    ``Of course that era coincided with the pill, and girls suddenly
realized they enjoyed sex as much as guys,'' he says, and laughs.
``Before that, it had been very difficult to get laid.''
 &HT;    Stamp was suddenly hot stuff. He roomed with another
up-and-coming young actor, someone named Michael Caine. His
girlfriend was supermodel Jean Shrimpton, the Cindy Crawford of her
era. Life could not have been sweeter.
 &HT;    ``I know it's fashionable to put the '60s down,'' Stamp says,
``but you won't hear me do it. It was heaven on earth for a few
minutes.''
 &HT;    The success of ``Billy Budd'' brought him to Hollywood to work
with the legendary director William Wyler in ``The Collector''
(l965). At the time, however, the young Brit was more than a little
arrogant and, despite having only a single film under his belt,
spent much of his time battling the director.
 &HT;    ``If I have any regrets at all about that period, it was because
I really wasn't mature enough to appreciate Wyler,'' Stamp says in
retrospect. ``He was a director I would have liked to have worked
with later on. I loved him.
 &HT;    ``But I got on wonderfully well with him,'' he adds. ``Whenever
I came back to Hollywood I would go to Wyler's house and play pool
and chat him up.''
 &HT;    The actor says that the most highly charged experiences in his
long career onscreen have involved the top directors he's worked
for _ Wyler, Peter Ustinov, who directed ``Billy Budd,'' and
Italian film legend Federico Fellini, for whom Stamp starred in
``Spirits of the Dead'' (1968).
 &HT;    More recently, he popped up as Kryptonian supervillain General
Zod in ``Superman'' (l978) and ``Superman II'' (l981), as well as
appearing in ``Legal Eagles'' (l986) and Oliver Stone's ``Wall
Street'' (l987). He began his fourth decade as an actor by donning
those dazzling dresses in ``Priscilla.''
 &HT;    So far this year he has been seen in George Lucas' ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace'' and in Frank Oz's ``Bowfinger,'' playing the
leader of a California cult.
 &HT;    The ``Star Wars'' experience, he says, was disappointing.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a very interesting job,'' Stamp recalls. ``On my
first day I was looking forward to doing a scene with the beautiful
Natalie Portman. When I arrived, George Lucas told me he'd given
her the day off.
 &HT;    ```There's this post here with this bit of paper on it _ that's
Natalie,' he told me.''
 &HT;    Besides letting him revisit his Wilson character, the actor
says, part of the joy of making ``The Limey'' was getting to work
with Fonda for the first time.
 &HT;    ``Thirty years ago Peter and I had one riotous night on the town
after attending a film festival in Sicily,'' Stamp says, chuckling.
``We vowed to work together. Well, it's taken all this time to make
it happen.''
 &HT;    In October Stamp returns to the Australian outback to star
opposite Val Kilmer in ``Red Planet.'' This time, he insists, he's
not playing a villain.
 &HT;    ``I'm the voice of reason,'' he says, ``a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist who has turned to philosophy because science doesn't
answer any of the really interesting questions in life.''
 &HT;    After living in Italy for seven years, Stamp now calls New York
home _ ``London is my spiritual home,'' he adds _ and says that at
this point in his career he chooses pictures carefully.
 &HT;    ``My life is passing,'' he says, ``and it's not as if I were
Ewan McGregor and had another 50 films ahead of me. I'm not going
to be able to do this forever, so I'm wanting to have the most fun
I can.''

   I am crossing a field on as sparkling and clear and warm a late
summer Monday as you will ever get. The sounds of the fading '90s
echo to either side of me: teams of girls and boys playing soccer
behind the high school. Parents shouting. Whistles wailing. It is
wonderful and perfect and monochromatic. ``Pleasantville,'' the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of me, the sounds of the lingering '50s fill the air: Rock
'n' roll music blares from speakers mounted on poles and the rumble
of hot rods reverberates and stirs the smell of fried food _
burgers, fries, hot dogs. With each step I take, the world becomes
more colorful: candy apple reds, Bombays, pinks, blacks,
turquoises, inky deep blacks, gleaming metallics. The world is
filling in with color. ``Pleasantville,'' the movie.

think it was opening day for the Carmine Hose. But, no. These are
car people and they are playing Hot Rod Hooky.

   I am working. Tough job. Somebody's gotta do it.
</P>
<P>
   So I stroll amidst the paint jobs, the highboys and low cars,
the chrome, the carefully painted flames, the pleats and rolls, the
chops and channels.
</P>
<P>
   Cars rumble in through the day. Peter Raffi of Derry, N.H.,
owner of a classic 1955 Chevy pickup truck popularly known as a
Cameo, says that for car owners, ``driving in and driving out are
the best parts.'' That's because it's a parade of pride _ pride in
your car, its sound, its look.
</P>
<P>
   But something troubles me. Have these gems, these wonderfully
built and maintained autos become, maybe, too valuable? What is to
come of cars that may have been turned into hot rods 40 and 50
years ago for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, which now
are worth $20,000 and $30,000, and in rare cases $100,000? Do they
become so valuable they end up in climate-controlled warehouses,
accessible to only the wealthiest of collectors? In museums?
</P>
<P>
   Some will, but here's hoping most get passed on, generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the Ty-Rods for this day. Founded in Concord in 1952,
they've been holding this show ever since they decided nearly three
decades ago that they needed a way to get old members back
together. First show, at the VFW in Littleton, drew 38 people and,
says Bob Parker, a Ty-Rod since 1956, 26 or 27 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the old image of hot rodders as rowdies, the Ty-Rods
have always been a relatively peaceful bunch (excepting, Parker
says, the night pizza ended up all over the walls at a veterans'
establishment and they were asked to move the whole show outdoors).
</P>
<P>
   The Ty-Rods club was formed by members who felt their original
group, the Piston Pushers, danced too close to the Hollywood
stereotype of hot rodders. The latter club appellation being an
explosive piece of equipment and the former being an implement of
control, you can see where the names came from.
</P>
<P>
   The Ty-Rods lived down the pizza-fling and their show just grew.
Lately, they've had to drop the high end on the vintage of cars
from 1967 to 1959, and even with that, the 1,100 slots handed out
first-come, first-served go rapidly. Many are turned away.
</P>
<P>
   It's so big that the hot rods (Parker says hot rods are cars up
to 1939 and everything after that is a custom) at this show
represent a triangle with its points at Maine, Florida, and the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a New England show and the New England contingent is
beautiful and strong: the 1950 Mercury sedan of Jack Carr of
Billerica; the mustard and white 1957 Ford Fairlane of Richard
Perkins of Nashua, N.H.; Richard Sabotka's pink and black 1956 Ford
Victoria, home port, Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hamel of North Hampton, N.H., is here in a 1956 Chevrolet
Cameo pickup, tropical turquoise and Bombay in color, with its
unique from-the-factory fiberglass bed and 2 1/2 years of
restoration in it.
</P>
<P>
   For many young car buffs today, turning their ride into a hot
rod means fancy wheels and a new computer chip to boost engine
performance; that and tinted windows. Not like the days when
Parker, the longtime Ty-Rod, built a '32 Ford coupe, added a big
Caddy motor, and didn't have what you'd spend on wheels, tires, and
computer chips today in the whole rig.
</P>
<P>
   That was back when airport runways were where you got to test
your efforts and the cars often reflected, in crude fashion, what
GIs had spotted in European sports cars and brought back from World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But time is often warped.
</P>
<P>
   Walk up to Howard Poulin Jr., of Manchester, N.H., and ask him
if his brilliant yellow 1931 Ford five-window coupe is based on the
car in the movie ``American Graffiti'' and you get a rolling
belly-laugh. This car was built in 1959, way before the movie,
before, even, the movie's setting. A whole year before Poulin was
racing on the straights in Fremont, Calif. Way before high-tech,
expensive drag racing got to be more than he could afford and
brought him back to where he is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right back to where I started,'' he says, sitting happily
beside the coupe that on any given day, in its time, could
challenge anything else out there that was street legal.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to schisms. You've got them among race fans:
Indy vs. NASCAR; among bikers: Harley vs. Asian-made bikes and old
Harley riders vs. new Harley riders (never mind that without new
Evo Harley guys and women, Harley would be dead as the Henry J),
and, in hot rod and custom: steel vs. technology.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Poulin can say he's not the owner of some
``Tupperware, yuppie, kit-car,'' and William Horn of East Freetown
can stand proudly beside his 1939 Chevy Master Deluxe gasser from
the '60s, straight axle, not lowered, big block Chevy 454 cranking
out 435 horsepower, and say proudly, ``It's all steel.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many hot rods, it's not finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all done when you run out of money,'' says Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes me wonder and worry.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when every aficiando pours every hard-won cent into
every car and then the car gets so valuable as Hot Rod Heirloom
that just maybe it's worth more to some collector than it is to
them?

LUXURIOUS MERCEDES SL500 WANTS TO DRIVE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This car's got a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   I am coming into Boston from the north on a wet day, up on the
bridge just before the Fleet Center. Traffic's not bad, but there
are vast puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell my last driving instructor this, but I do not have my
hands at the 10- and 2-o'clock positions on the wheel. I've got one
hand draped over the wheel, trying to gently coax the car through
the slop, feeling what it wants to do. But something else is
driving the car. I hit a puddle, and the car slows and corrects
itself to keep going straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   I hit a steel expansion joint on the bridge, and whatever slight
traces of spin that wet steel imparts to the rear-drive wheels is
picked up and the car goes into electronic stability mode. I notice
the same thing later on a loose gravel road. The Mercedes SL500
wants to drive itself. Even with electronic stability off, it does
its own braking when a rear wheel starts to slip.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe when you buy a Mercedes, this is what you are looking
for: straight-ahead power and the virtual certainty that you will
not get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This 8-cylinder (12 cylinders available in the SL600),
two-seater is the sports car for those who want hunkered-down
reliability, solid weight (more than 2 tons) that does not get
skittish on corners, and cruising almost like a luxury sedan's.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long, gorgeous wedge of car, made more eye-opening
because of the luxury of its special interior.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the 10 special-edition models in a new
European-inspired factory program called Designo. It is aimed at
solid Mercedes buyers who are ready to stretch their limits just a
bit and put together their own package of designer amenities _
those amenities coming in the forms of paint, leather, and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Special paint colors include black diamond, silver, green,
copper, and slate blue. The leather combinations for seats and
paneling include light brown, blue and charcoal, green and
charcoal, copper and charcoal, charcoal, shell, black and red, dark
blue and black. Wood trims are also optional in some models.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant in the right hands, customer choice can sometimes lead
to garish combos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Elvis's bedroom,'' a friend said as he gazed upon
the red and black leather interior of my black diamond SL500. But
to each their own, though the possibilities for elegance or
gaudiness will be limited since Mercedes plans to produce only
250-500 of each (itals)Designo(unitals) model annually.
</P>
<P>
   So forget color and hop inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, soft leather seats. Firm sides from hips to shoulders.
Long, broad and firm base with myriad levels of adjustment behind
and below. Move the seat back and the seat belts adjust and the
headrests rise, assuming if you are moving back, you are likely
taller than the seat's last occupant.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leather-wrapped wheel and look around.
</P>
<P>
   Light controls in a pod to the left. Straight ahead, a package
of gauges _ gas gauge alone, a grouping that includes oil and water
readouts and one for miles per gallon at current operation, then
the speedomoter and tachometer in separate rims, and, off to the
right, the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Simple controls at center dash: climate up top, audio below, and
just below that a hodgepodge including controls for the trunk lid,
towing protection, central locking, hazard lights, stability
control, adaptive dampening, and the roll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Controls for windows, mirror, heated seats, and the convertible
roof are clustered around the stick for the five-speed,
electronically-controlled, automatic (with driver-e option)
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   You're surrounded by front and side airbags as you gaze out over
the long hood. On rainy days, a single, broad wiper blade cleans
the windshield with remarkable sweep.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day, drop the roof _ a remarkable mechanical event in
itself. Push a single button and hold it until all is done and the
windows go down. The rear quarter of the roof unlatches itself and
folds up against the main roof. Now the main roof unlatches with a
loud snap from the frame at the top of the windshield and lifts
itself. In the rear, a leather panel rises and the roof drops into
its storage compartment. The panel drops to cover the roof as the
roll bar, which had moved to get out of the way, comes back up, as
do the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Cool fall day, maybe too cool for a ragtop? No problem. Crank
the automatic climate control to 92 degrees and you are bathed in
warmth even as crisp fall air swirls about the car.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find much storage space inside _ narrow, covered slots
in the doors (deep and hard-to-reach bottom in them), and two small
storage areas between the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the engine and a restrained rumble bubbles from the
exhaust. Notice that the brake and gas pedal seem to have extra,
unnecessary travel in them.
</P>
<P>
   Notice just how long that hood is, and you'll understand why
this car ``drives long,'' unlike smaller sports cars. It is quiet
on the road, cruises at 75 at just over 2,000 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not remarkable off the line and has a strange acceleration
lag (almost like a turbo lag). But punch it at speed, while turning
2,000-5,000 rpms, and it jumps to the job, sending the car surging
ahead (autobahn-like).
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Stability Program helps avoid slides and spins by
correcting for over- and understeer. It uses torque and brake
controls to accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   It stops fast and straight even from high speeds, ABS aided by a
brake assist system that boosts maximum power to the brakes when
the pedal is stomped, as in an emergency, and held there.
</P>
<P>
   A solid cruiser. Fast as you wanna be. Reliable. A Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The fabric covering at the lower-front portion of the doors
will get rubbed to tatters by the leading foot of emerging
occupants.

repeatedly.

REBECCA'S GREEN THUMB MAKES GARDENING EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA RATHBONE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Rebecca Kolls is a guru for the garden set.
She's fun, energetic and especially practical. That combination is
like honey to fans of ``Rebecca's Garden,'' her show on the Home &AMP;
Garden cable television network.
</P>
<P>
   Though some might say the two look a bit alike, Rebecca Kolls is
no Martha Stewart; her advice is decidedly more user-friendly. Her
stated goal is to make viewers feel they can do it too.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident on the set of ``Rebecca's Garden'' last week,
when Kolls was in San Francisco to shoot several episodes at the
Filoli Gardens in Woodside. Her guest on the show was Don Dillon,
the 78-year-old former mayor of Fremont, whose family has owned
Four Winds Growers for nearly half a century. His subject? How to
grow dwarf citrus indoors, which is the only way it can be done
outside of California and Florida. (The show will air sometime in
the chilly middle of February.)
</P>
<P>
   Kolls didn't let Dillon get away with offering vague advice.
</P>
<P>
   When he answered a question about watering by saying, ``Let the
plant talk to you,'' she pressed him to be more specific until he
recommended twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   They stood behind an old wooden table at the side of the pool.
He was in a black shirt and magnificent straw hat, she in a white
tank top and pink blouse. According to the makeup and wardrobe
person, Denice Lacher, guests and hosts must be color-coordinated
in advance of a shoot: ``You can't have them both turning up in
red, or they look like bookends.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was an excellent guest, completely natural. Either he was
so accustomed to being on television that he no longer notices the
camera, or else, absorbed in his plants, he really did forget he
was being filmed. In this he was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Kolls appeared much more interested in finding out whether she
could safely push a stake through the roots of a Eureka lemon (yes
_ just ram it on through) than whether her nose was powdered just
so. When the producer, Darren Howelton, suggested skipping a
segment on foliage, Kolls demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Thus she and future viewers learned from Dillon that pale green
leaves with yellow veins indicate a lack of nitrogen, while yellow
leaves with green veins mean a lack of one of the trace elements.
</P>
<P>
   The show is designed for non-experts, and Howelton himself said
he started his first garden using tips from the program. ``It's
like always being in school,'' he said, his head emerging from the
blue rucksack where it had been stuck for most of the morning as he
monitored the action on a tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   He and Kolls carefully avoid anything too technical, emphasizing
the useful. For example, most dwarf citrus are grafted (which means
the bottom of the plant is not a Valencia orange at all but only
the orange's foster parent), but grafting was mentioned only for
practical purposes: Because branches below the graft are suckers,
they must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The same philosophy informs both her spin-off magazine
(Rebecca's Garden is published by Hearst Communications Inc., a
unit of the Hearst Corp.) and Rebeccasgarden.com., where the how-to
articles look like a recipe in ``The Joy of Cooking,'' even down to
a list of materials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plants shown were popular favorites, like the Dancy
tangerine (a hit at Chinese New Year) or Kaffir lime (the leaves
are used in Thai food), but the urge to impress the neighbors was
not ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon and Kolls discussed something called Buddha's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Totally inedible, all peel and no flesh, it looks like a yellow
fist with curly, gnarled claws _ a sure-fire conversation starter.
</P>
<P>
   Kolls got her start as a weather reporter. She majored in
atmospheric science at the University of Kansas because ``after
taking one course, I couldn't stand not to go on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was aiming for NASA until her professor found her a job as a
weather reporter for a small TV station, where she improvised by
including gardening tips. This led to a $200,000 rooftop garden at
a CBS affiliate in Salt Lake City, constructed specifically for her
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   After one of her segments appeared on ``Oprah,'' she was offered
her current program. In the end, she said, she chose gardening over
weather. ``It's what I love to do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To explain her success, Kolls conjured an image of shingling
roofs. ``One tile, by itself, is useless,'' she said. ``But get
enough of them, and not only is the house protected, but if one
shingle wears out, there are enough left to carry you through.
Build on what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to wonder, however, if just anyone could have
turned a love of petunias and tornadoes into such a solid
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Until her children were born, Kolls was terrified of going
on-camera. ``I spent five years shaking in my boots, trying to be
someone I wasn't,'' she said. ``After the kids, I didn't care
anymore. I could finally be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the set of her program had to be the least stressful in
history. When the table got messy with spilled earth and pruned
leaves, Kolls and Dillon scooped them up as casually as if they
were both at home.
</P>
<P>
   Just off set, an editor from the magazine was conducting an
informal dwarf-citrus tasting. The winner: Nazami kumquats. Tart,
small and delicious, they beg to be made into tea.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, each retake got tighter, the information a
little more concise. The makeup artist kept an eagle eye out for
fading lipstick and shiny foreheads, while the sound person stopped
the shooting each time a plane flew overhead. It took 2 1/2 hours
before Howelton was satisfied with his four minutes of program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time for the closing segment. Kolls smiled
encouragingly into the camera and, rather like Jane Fonda pushing
aerobics fans to go for the burn, she urged her viewers to ``Go out
there and do it, too. Just get your hands dirty!''

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  NINE INCH NAILS/``THE FRAGILE'' (Nothing/Interscope)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dig out the torn fishnets and black eye makeup. Ten years after
``Pretty Hate Machine'' took industrialized Goth mainstream, Trent
Reznor, rock's own little Nietzsche, has released Nine Inch Nails'
first album in five years. The dreadful two-disc result has all the
excitement and musical value of a faucet leaking in a moldy room at
the end of the hall. Actually, Reznor would probably get a kick out
of that image. It's just the thing to spark his next
one-dimensional concept album. With its uninspired one-note musical
interludes resembling machinery spinning out of control or anemic
pianos tinkling their last, ``The Fragile'' is relentlessly empty.
Lyrically, the continually overrated Reznor spouts senior-year Goth
platitudes of the ``life is bleak'' variety so cliche-ridden
they're too embarrassing to repeat here. Of mild interest is the
standout track ``We're in This Together,'' which boasts a spark of
energy and almost comes close to a genuine tune. 1 1/2 stars

JOSHUA BELL AND EDGAR MEYER/``SHORT TRIP HOME'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   Violin virtuoso Bell and bassist Meyer are joined by progressive
bluegrass instrumentalists Sam Bush and Mike Marshall on this
inspired melding of the classical world and traditional Americana.
Composed by Meyer, the music never veers far from its roots in
country, bluegrass and folk so that even at it most complicated or
experimental, it's eminently listenable. With enjoyable melodies
and wonderful interplay among these four superb musicians, this is
the type of project that helps keep the movement between genres
fluid while providing some terrific sounds. 4 stars

KATHRYN STOTT/``LA HABANERA: THE PIANO MUSIC OF ERNESTO LECUONA''
(EMI Classics)
</P>
<P>
   The composer and keyboard artist Ernesto Lecuona (1896-1963)
lives up to his epithet as ``the Cuban Gershwin'' with this lovely
and varied collection of short piano works. Performed by Stott with
great playfulness and ardency, these miniaturist pieces give
evidence of Lecuona's technical proficiency as well as his
unusually diverse (particularly for his time) musical parlance, a
fusion of Cuban, African, classical, Spanish and African-American
traditions. The yearning romanticism and powerful climax of
``Preludio en la Noche'' at first seems an ocean and perhaps 50
years removed from the jaunty ``...Y la Negra Bailaba!'' and the
vaguely ragtime-y ``Danza Negra.'' But Lecuona's synthesis of the
sentimental and the cosmopolitan, lush glissandos and capricious
dance rhythms, invests these 23 pieces with a vitality that spans
the decades as surely as it spans the northern and southern
hemispheres. 3 stars

BILLY BRAGG/``REACHING TO THE CONVERTED'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   British singer-songwriter Bragg made his biggest splash in the
States last year with ``Mermaid Avenue,'' an outstanding tribute to
Woody Guthrie cut with alt-country rockers Wilco. This interesting
batch of rarities and British A- and B-sides is likely to further
broaden his appeal both to the converted and new initiates. The
best songs among the 17 offerings combine Bragg's lethal wit with
his passion for social causes. Also included is a cover of the
Beatles' ``She's Leaving Home'' and a hilariously revamped reading
of the Four Tops' ``Walk Away Renee'' with former Smiths great
Johnny Marr on guitar. For an assemblage of bits and pieces, this
works surprisingly well as a cohesive effort. 3 stars

IRISH TENORS/``THE IRISH TENORS'' (Master Dance Tones)
</P>
<P>
   When Irish tenor Joe Feeney on ``The Lawrence Welk Show''
reached for high notes, he sounded as if someone had just
overtightened a screw in his back. That unpleasant memory makes
``The Irish Tenors,'' recorded live at the Royal Dublin Society
Main Hall, a delightful surprise. John McDermott, Anthony Kearns
and Ronan Tynan make the music of their homeland appealing to any
listener. Each of the 20 tunes is a story, relating Ireland's
tormented history, lifelong love, impetuous courtship, sweet
memories and more. McDermott, a North American for most of his
life, has the most Irish sound. A self-trained Celtic tenor, he
sings with a lilt, hanging on consonants rather than vowels, which
would make an opera purist cringe but is perfectly suited to this
material. McDermott's ``Danny Boy'' and ``Believe Me'' are eloquent
in their simplicity, and ``The Old Man'' is very poignant. Kearns
is a lyric tenor whose expertise with both oratorio and Gilbert &AMP;
Sullivan is evident. He brings sweetness to ``Grace'' and high
spirits to ``Eileen Og'' and ``Boolavogue.'' Ronan Tynan,
discovered at a talent contest five years ago, displays a natural
gift and heartfelt intensity in ``I'll Take You Home Again
Kathleen'' and ``The Town I Loved So Well.'' His range and style
are a good bridge between McDermott and Kearns. Their trio efforts
also are charming, particularly the flirtatious ``Will Ye Go,
Lassie, Go?'' The Royal Symphony Orchestra, with conductor-arranger
Frank McNamara's light touch, uplifts the vocals rather than
smothering them. 4 stars

MARC ANTHONY/``MARC ANTHONY'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   His namesake was a Roman general who loved Cleopatra and died
tragically. Salsa superstar Anthony loved Jennifer Lopez and faces
down a batch of tragically overproduced schlock. By turning his
back on the salsa genre that made him famous, Anthony misplaces
much of his bite in favor of sappy love ballads. Sometimes, the
mush can be mildly diverting, but too much syrup set to throbbing
strings can leave even the most ardent romantic fool cold. Although
one or two tunes, including ``That's Okay'' and ``I Need to Know,''
act as a good foil for Anthony's internationally popular voice, we
were reaching for the hemlock by the end of this treacly ordeal. 1

STEFON HARRIS/``BLACK ACTION FIGURE'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Harris, at a mere 26 years of age, has been touted as one of
jazz music's brightest stars and this impressive release confirms
the designation. Building on the solid foundation of ``A Cloud of
Red Dust'' (Harris' debut last year as a leader), ``Black Action
Figure'' finds the vibraphonist playing with more confidence,
versatility and artistry, delivering a varied program of masterful
music. Harris is ably supported by the Blue Note stable, including,
most notably, Greg Osby and Gary Thomas on sax and pianist Jason
Moran. The selections swing from the Ornette Coleman-like
complexities of ``There Is No Greater Love'' to delicate ballads
like the closing ``Faded Beauty.'' Believe the hype _ Harris is the
real deal. 3 1/2 stars

COURT DEALS BLOW TO GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advocates of gun control are applauding the
nation's first appellate-level court ruling declaring that gun
manufacturers can be held accountable in criminal shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued Wednesday by the First District Court of
Appeal, allows the families of eight victims in the 1993 shooting
at a San Francisco office building to proceed with their lawsuit
against the maker of the guns used in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 ruling, the state court said Navegar Inc., the
Miami-based company that makes the TEC-DC9 and TEC-9, marketed the
semiautomatic weapons to appeal to people attracted to violence and
should have foreseen the injuries. The court said the weapons
appeared to have no legitimate civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   The mentally disturbed gunman, Gian Luigi Ferri, entered the
downtown high-rise with two TEC-DC9 pistols in July 1993 and opened
fire in a law office. Ferri shot dead eight people and wounded six
others before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude there are triable issues as to whether Ferri would
have engaged in the conduct at 101 California Street, and could
have killed and injured as many people as he did, if the TEC-DC9
had not been promoted by Navegar as it was and made available to
persons like him,'' Justice J. Anthony Kline wrote in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Jetto, the lawyer representing the gun manufacturer, said
he would probably appeal the decision to the California Supreme
Court. He said he would challenge the new standard established in
Wednesday's decision that gun manufacturers have a duty not to
engage in ``negligent marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is brand new,'' Jetto said. ``I think it introduces great
uncertainty in marketing practices in any number of different ways.
What marketing practices will cross the line under this test? I
think that will be one of the primary issues on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Educational Fund to
End Handgun Violence in Washington, D.C., hailed the court's
decision as a major step forward in the push to hold manufacturers
responsible for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, manufacturers would say, `We don't really care
who gets the gun. Once it goes out of our shop, we don't have any
responsibility,''' he said. ``Courts are saying, `Yes you do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The TEC-DC9 is a weapon designed for mass killing, said Dennis
Henigan, legal director of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
in Washington and lead lawyer for the families of the victims in
the San Francisco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a gun Navegar was promoting for home self-defense
or hunting or target shooting. Clearly Navegar understood that a
good part of its market was the criminal market,'' he said. ``It
was a gun designed for war, to be spray- fired from the hip, and
that's exactly how Mr. Ferri used it.''
</P>
<P>
   A TEC-DC9 was also carried by one of the two students who killed
13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April.
The two teen-ager gunmen then killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justice Paul Haerle expressed distaste for weapons
such as TEC-DC9 but said Ferri was solely responsible for his
actions. He said the majority opinion made ``legal and analytical
errors'' and committed ``an egregious exercise in judicial
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is one of about two dozen cities in the country
suing gun manufacturers for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The new judicial standard established in the ruling would
bolster San Francisco's claim, said Deputy City Attorney Cam Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our case, we're alleging some manufacturers are engaging in
wrongful distribution that would enhance the risks to the public,''
he said. ``If you're distributing in a way that it will increase
the risk it will fall in the hands of criminals and felons ...
you're violating this duty.''

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., OCT. 11, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Claire
Rankin and Robert McNeill Duncan in a scene from the ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' episode ``Alice.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Scene 44 is a long, long trek.
 &HT;    It's early in the morning on Stage 9 at Paramount Pictures,
where veteran director David Livingston is preparing the day's
first shot on ``Alice,'' the ``Star Trek: Voyager'' episode that
will air on Oct. 20.
 &HT;    Livingston has gathered everyone _ sound, lighting and camera
crews, as well as guest star Claire Rankin and series regulars
Robert Duncan McNeill and Roxann Dawson _ on a Voyager corridor set
to describe his vision of the scene at hand.
 &HT;    ``Alice'' involves an alien ship so desperate to get home that
its id, in the form of a beautiful woman named Alice (Rankin),
takes possession of Tom Paris (McNeill) and forces him to pilot the
ship back to its own world. No one but Paris can actually see
Alice, making his increasingly combative conversations with her
seem like the ramblings of a madman to those around him,
particularly Torres (Dawson).
 &HT;    ``This episode has a lot of scary stuff in it that's been fun to
play,'' McNeill says during a break. ``You know what it reminds me
of? Do you remember the John Carpenter film, `Christine'? Instead
of someone dealing with a possessed car, we've got a possessed
shuttle that I have to deal with.''
 &HT;    Livingston has made it clear how he wants to handle the scene,
which involves Paris confronting Torres and then storming away,
only to run into Alice and exchange harsh words with her, too. A
hand-held Steadicam will capture the action in a single lengthy,
fluid shot, cutting back and forth between two-shots _ in which two
people share a frame _ and closeups.
 &HT;    ``It's all about the mystery and the weirdness of the
consciousness existing only in Paris' perception and no one
else's,'' Livingston explains during a brief break. ``The challenge
is getting that on the screen, and we're trying to do it with cool
camera moves that reveal Alice's presence.
 &HT;    ``We're doing a lot of rotation shots, where we start in one
place and pan over,'' he adds. ``We start the episode that way,
without showing Alice, and people will probably say, `Why is the
director doing this?' Then we start to show Alice, and we're still
doing the rotation shots.
 &HT;    ``It's a stylistic conceit that we're trying to do on the
episode,'' Livingston concludes. ``As a director, you just try to
come up with some kind of hook that keeps you interested in the
episode and, hopefully, it will keep the audience interested,
too.''
 &HT;    Rehearsal begins an hour later, after everyone has donned their
costumes and had makeup applied, and after the sound crew has
figured out how to work around McNeill and Rankin's loud-crinkling
spacesuits. Livingston watches the first moments of rehearsal
anxiously _ something's not working, and the clock is ticking.
 &HT;    McNeill leans against a wall as his tirade at Alice builds to a
crescendo, and the actor's positioning leaves no room for the
cameraman to maneuver.
 &HT;    ``That's the part that's ugly,'' Livingston says, creating a box
with his fingers and peering through it as if it were a camera
lens. ``It's just going to be the backs of heads when we put it on
film.''
 &HT;    The director makes several suggestions, and the scene is
rehearsed again. McNeill, himself a director of several
well-received episodes, puts in his two cents' worth, and the
cameraman offers his thoughts. Subsequent runthroughs satisfy
Livingston, and he orders the camera to roll.
 &HT;    On take one, McNeill blows his line.
 &HT;    ``You're really out of breath,'' he ad-libs to Dawson, ``and
your hair looks great.''
 &HT;    Everyone cracks up, even Livingston.
 &HT;    Dawson, McNeill and Rankin tinker with their line delivery in
takes two, three and four, none of which thrill Livingston.
 &HT;    On take five, however, everything clicks.
 &HT;    ``Perfect,'' Livingston announces. ``Print that.''
 &HT;    A stickler, Livingston wants more. Take six elicits another
``Perfect, print that.'' So does take seven. The actors and crew
are ready to move on to the next scene, but Livingston wants yet
one more.
 &HT;    For take eight, the actors play the hell out of the scene.
 &HT;    ``Fabulous! Great!'' Livingston says. ``Print that.''
 &HT;    Scene 44 is in the can. Three-plus hours have passed. The scene
will run less than two minutes on screen.
 &HT;    Welcome to the 24th century.

intercontinental ballistic missile. And the air force was about to
unveil its new ``Flying Leopard'' fighter plane in a screaming
flyover of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian groups and 91 floats from all over China were primed to
round out the parade, evening extravaganza and colossal fireworks
scheduled to keep central Beijing paralyzed for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of police isolated the heart of the capital
before dawn Friday in a form of martial law aimed at guaranteeing
that no disruption _ or any speck of spontaneity _ would sully the
$36 million festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 marchers and entertainers were as carefully picked
and placed as the 500,000 potted flowers stuck all over the city in
metal frames, shaped into huge boats, shooting stars or
gaily-colored columns.
</P>
<P>
   To assure none strayed from key nationalistic themes,
participants had a list of 50 approved slogans to shout, such as
the less-than-trenchant: ``Stress theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct!''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour parade hailed China's progress, with floats
including replicas of a space rocket launch and a snowy peak in
Tibet, where mountaineers surrounded by rainbows planted China's
red flag with five yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   The troops, Communist Party cadres, bouncy youth groups and
ethnic minorities in multi-colored costumes would march down the
Avenue of Perpetual Peace, the capital's biggest east-west
boulevard, to be reviewed by President Jiang Zemin near the
entrance to the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was shaping up as an eccentric combination of the
dour Stalinesque might of Moscow's Cold War processions in Red
Square and the pastel pageantry of Psdadena's New Year's Day Rose
Bowl parades.
</P>
<P>
   Central Beijing started shutting down at noon Thursday, when two
lines of troops carrying bull-horns swept across Tiananmen Square
to evict thousands of strolling Chinese and foreign tourists.
Bomb-sniffing German shepherd dogs followed.
</P>
<P>
   Then offices and shops along the parade route were searched,
locked and sealed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sidewalks closed around the Forbidden City Thursday,
gray-haired Du Zhiying, 70, was having his picture taken before the
ever-present portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motherland has prospered,'' said Du, who was in Tiananmen
Square the day 50 years ago when the late Great Helmsman Mao
declared the People's Republic of China into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Du came from Shanxi Province for the celebration, but the
lifelong party bureaucrat said he was afraid he wouldn't get within
sight of Friday's events. They were open only to officials and
invited guests, and he was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also tried to guarantee control by turning down
pollution, turning out itinerant workers and tuning off beepers and
mobile telephones that might interfere with military
communications.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's pollution is so foul that it obscured the last display
of military air power in 1984 during New China's 35th anniversary,
so factories this year got orders to shut down smoke-belching
furnaces 10 days before the event.
</P>
<P>
   No military parade was held for the 40th anniversary, a bleak
celebration in 1989 that came just months after tanks and soldiers
had made an unscheduled, blood-filled appearance, driving down the
same parade route and into Tiananmen Square to quell weeks of
student-led protests.
</P>
<P>
   Then, no one wanted a reminder of the efficiency of China's
military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mood is brighter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese live enormously better than they did 50, 20 or even 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Life was genuinely grim in 1949 when Mao Tse-tung stood atop the
Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the meaning of his army's
victory in a vicious civil war. Hearts lifted with his proclamation
of a new era: ``We, the 475 million people of China, have now stood
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then a peasant family may have shared a single pair of
pants among 10 people who took turns going outside. Life expectancy
was 35 years, and education an extravagance for a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't change quickly. After a modest start into
industrialization, expanded education and agricultural renewal,
Mao's bizarre notions of continuing revolution sent China into one
chaotic frenzy after another.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Leap Forward. The Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stilted titles lay famine, smeared reputations and
tens of millions of deaths. Mao and his minions nearly wasted a
generation of youth sent not to school but to pound stones or dig
potatoes into the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the relative calm and bloom of prosperity
brought by subsequent leaders _ initiated with the reforms of the
late Deng Xiaoping _ the Chinese people have been forced to do
without free expression and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Economic gains have been remarkable since Deng's reform began in
1978. China has become the world's 11th largest trading power,
churning out a gross domestic product, or GDP, of $96 billion last
year after a decade of average growth rates surpassing 10 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy now is 71 years. Illiteracy is less than 15
percent, mostly among elderly and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stirrings of protest, targeting both political restrictions
and uneven economic distribution, have the communist leadership on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   To head off public dissent, especially in the anniversary
run-up, authorities have taken drastic steps.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16,000 migrant workers were expelled from Beijing, and
thousands more Chinese without proper papers were dumped in
detention centers. Beggars, peddlers and prostitutes were driven
from streets. Even Chinese tour groups were forbidden to enter the
capital for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt called ``operation strike hard'' produced
the arrests since summer of nearly 70,000 people officially
described as ``escaped'' or ``wanted'' criminals. Human rights
groups said democracy activists and religious leaders also have
been detained.
</P>
<P>
   The most sweeping control directive was the July outlawing of
the Falun Gong, a quasi-religious exercise and meditation group
claiming to have 100 million followers. After thousands of
adherents ringed the center of government in a silent protest in
April, authorities made mass arrests and banned public practice of
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The group's vibrant popularity among all classes and types of
Chinese was attributed to one factor the Communist Party has not
been able to control: the void in values so many Chinese want to
fill.

 &HT;    Cincinnati Reds control their own destiny, seek first title
since 1995
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Cincinnati Reds are in the state of Wisconsin
and they also are in the state of confusion. And it has nothing to
do with choosing bratwurst or knockwurst or what kind of crackers
to have with the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Their confusion surrounds whether they should be concerned about
the Milwaukee Brewers, the Houston Astros, the New York Mets or
whether some moronic fan might leap from the County Stadium stands
tonight and assault first baseman Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon offers solid advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against any wall and we decide our own fate,''
McKeon said before leaving Houston, where the Reds and the Astros
split a two-game series Tuesday and Wednesday. ``That means if we
win our last three games, no convoluted playoff system can rob us
of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are so close to their first National League Central
championship since 1995 that they can sniff the champagne with the
corks still tucked in the bottles. They and the Astros are tied for
first place and each has three to play.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati takes step one of its three-step program tonight in
County Stadium against the Brewers and they certainly are putting
their best arm forward. Left-hander Denny Neagle, 6-0 with a 2.30
earned run average in his last six starts and 9-3 with a 3.23 ERA
in 12 games since coming off the disabled list, gets the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't get it done, it's midseason acquisition Juan Guzman
on Saturday. If he can't get it done, it's veteran Pete Harnisch on
Sunday. If they can't get it done, the Reds are done.
</P>
<P>
   While the Reds finish with the Brewers, Houston has three in the
Astrodome against the Los Angeles Dodgers. If both the Reds and
Astros win all three and finish in a tie, the Reds are division
champions on the strength of their 9-4 mastery over Houston in
head-to-head games.
</P>
<P>
   As the sign painted on a wall outside the Houston clubhouse
says, ``It can Happen!''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Cincinnati Reds become Cin-derella? They think so as
after five months and 159 games the season comes down to three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously would have liked to gone to Houston and won two
games to put Houston two games behind us with three to play,''
Casey said. ``But we were on the road, 55,000 screaming fans _ so
we're glad we got a split in that situation. We're glad to be where
we are (in the standings) going into this last series of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it is all about,'' Casey added. ``You can't ask
for anything more. These last three games mean something . . . mean
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Milwaukee is a National League bottom-feeder, the
Reds haven't whomped them. They are 5-4 this season against the
Brewers, 3-3 at home and 2-1 in County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the final game in the Astrodome _ 4-1, on Wednesday to
drop into a tie after beating the Astros, 4-1, on Tuesday to take a
24-hour one-game lead _ isn't causing McKeon to sweat around the
collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win six in a row, you're going to lose once in a
while,'' he said. ``We'll try to start another streak. We're tough.
We bounce back after losses.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a third party in the scenario. The New York
Mets still can make it a three-way tie or they can snatch the
wild-card sweepstakes from the Reds or Astros if one deflates
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Houston outfielder Carl Everett isn't afraid to show his disdain
for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't care less about the Mets,'' he said. ``I hate the
Mets. I hope they lose every game.'' And tomorrow Everett will
reveal how he really feels.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon admits that while his team argues with Milwaukee this
weekend, he'll keep one eye on the scoreboard to see how
Houston-Los Angeles is progressing and the other eye on the same
scoreboard to see how New York-Pittsburgh is unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much else to do between innings in the dugout,''
McKeon said. ``I don't have a book to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a book entitled, ``How to Win Games and Influence
Pennant Races''?

MAILING LISTS SOLD AT A RAPID CLIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Rogers Cadenhead is taking some time off. He
left us a few of his favorite items from yesteryear. His column
will resume with sparkling fresh material when he returns.)
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Is it true that if you buy nose-hair clippers from a
magazine ad, your name will be sold to direct-mail marketers? _
J.T., Dallas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Apparently, yes. Author William Poundstone investigated
this bit of urban lore, which holds that people who buy mail-order
Klipette nose grooming products are a highly prized demographic
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, that mentality is just right for some
direct mail-order pitches,'' Poundstone writes in ``Big Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers distributors can make more money selling the name of
purchasers than they do on the product, he writes. The author
ordered clippers under a fake name, and 10 months later, that name
started getting pitches for virility products and other unusual
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What exactly is the Curse of Barilko? _ J.S.,
Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The curse is a bit of hockey lore involving the Toronto
Maple Leafs, the Stanley Cup, a star player and a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Bill Barilko won the Cup for the Maple Leafs by scoring
an overtime goal to beat the Montreal Canadiens, 3-2. It was the
fourth NHL title the Leafs had won since Barilko joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cup finals, Barilko disappeared on a plane flight
during a Hudson Bay fishing trip, and his remains were not found
until 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs did not win a Cup during the decade that Barilko was
missing, and they won immediately after his body was found. Leafs
fans, used to winning titles, concluded that a curse was to blame
for all those Cup-impaired years.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Can you confirm that the word ``rhubarb'' was used to
describe a baseball fight in the '50s? _ U.C., Fort Worth, texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The term ``rhubarb'' was popularized in 1939, when
Brooklyn Dodgers broadcaster Red Barber used it to describe heated
arguments and brawls on the field.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stuart Berg Flexner in ``Listening to America,''
the term dates back to 1915, when it was used in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Actors in a crowd scene, needing to appear angry, confused and
moblike, would yell ``rhubarb!'' over and over. The term has fallen
into disuse today among baseball commentators.  &QL;

`UNCOMMON FRIENDS': A MAN WHO KNEW THE ELITE BUT WASN'T KNOWN
HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Narrated by Walter Cronkite, a peculiar documentary titled
``Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century'' is built on the
relationships of a Zelig-like Floridian named Jim Newton with some
of the foremost figures of this time.
</P>
<P>
   A weak broth of biography, spiritual uplift and environmental
concerns, this film is strongest in its use of personal photographs
and archival film to recall people like Thomas A. Edison, Henry
Ford, Harvey Firestone and Charles A. Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   But its generally uncritical and sometimes apologetic posture
(Lindbergh's acceptance of a Nazi medal) and its failure to
distinguish between its authentic film images and its re-enactments
of events, like an incident during the invention of the electric
light, undermine the value as documentary history of its already
sketchy biographical materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncommon Friends,'' directed by John Biffar, is based on the
1994 autobiography of Newton, who was 20 in 1924 when he met Edison
while developing Edison Park, a residential community in Fort
Myers, Fla., where Edison was a winter resident.
</P>
<P>
   Edison took a liking to the young man, and the friendship
between the two led to Newton's friendships with Ford, Firestone,
Lindbergh and members of their families.
</P>
<P>
   The generous helping of Edison films, accompanied by
reminiscences by Newton and his wife, Ellie, are the highlights of
``Uncommon Friends.'' Edison proves to have a winning sense of
humor, particularly when the great inventor responds to a question
about Einstein's theory of relativity by saying, ``I don't think
anything of Einstein's theory, because I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``Uncommon Friends'' amounts to no more than a
brief, small footnote to history.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `UNCOMMON FRIENDS OF THE 20th CENTURY'
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by John Biffar. Running time: 63 minutes.

`HAPPY, TEXAS': TWO UNLIKELY CANDIDATES TO WIN MR. CONGENIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``Happy, Texas,'' a risk-free satire that picked up some
positive buzz at this year's Sundance Film Festival, catches the
public's fancy, it will be because the nonsensical story of a pair
of crooks ducking the law in a small Texas town is so soft-hearted
it wouldn't hurt a fly. Almost everybody in this not-so-funny
comedy is giddy and cuddlesome with a gosh-oh-gee enthusiasm that
is at first engaging but quickly becomes a sign of a desperation to
be liked.
</P>
<P>
   In portraying itinerant fishes out of water with a twist of
sexual ambiguity, the movie belongs roughly to the same school of
comedy as ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' and
``To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Happy, Texas'' lacks the audacity and pathos of
``Priscilla'' and the funky drag humor of ``Wong.'' In addressing
attitudes toward homosexuality in rural Texas, the movie pretends
that rabid gay-bashing doesn't exist in the area. And one scene,
set in a country-and-western bar packed with male couples strutting
the Texas two-step, suggests that the region has a booming gay
culture. The movie's portrayal of a children's beauty pageant, a
juicy target for satire in the age of JonBenet Ramsey, is more
celebratory than mocking.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins when Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), two convicts on the lam, go through the
contents of the Winnebago they have just stolen and discover that
its owners are a gay male couple who travel around the country
producing pageants. Stopped by the sheriff, Chappy Dent (William H.
Macy), the pair are shocked to find that instead of being arrested,
they are escorted to Happy, Texas, and welcomed as the potential
miracle workers who can whip the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant into
professional enough shape for the town to make the regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, the smarter of the two, instantly grasps the situation
and convinces the reluctant Wayne that they should go along with
this case of mistaken identity and muddle through. This means not
only staging the pageant, but also pretending to be lovers. And in
having them play gay, the movie deserves a round of applause for
not requiring Northam and Zahn to fall back on offensive,
limp-wristed stereotypes. While awkwardly demonstrating signs of
connubial attachment, they remain more or less themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Northam and Zahn play together reasonably well without
demonstrating the chemistry of natural comic partners. Northam's
Harry is so impossibly suave and courtly, he is almost James
Bond-like, while Zahn's Wayne is goofy, a macho Don Knotts with
muscles and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   None other than the sheriff gets a crush on Harry and meekly
asks him out. Later in a moment of doe-eyed adoration, he gives him
a rabbit's foot. Harry slyly strings Chappy along while wooing the
beautiful local banker (Ally Walker), whose institution he plans to
rob. Meanwhile, Zahn, in the movie's funniest role, tries to direct
a roomful of eager little girls while their supervisor, Ms.
Schaefer (Illeana Douglas) gazes on admiringly. When the time
comes, Harry and Wayne have little trouble convincing their
designated sweethearts that they're not really gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas,'' directed by Mark Illsley from a screenplay he
wrote with Ed Stone and Phil Reeves, builds up expectations of a
cathartic comic explosion with the staging of the pageant. But when
the big moment comes, the movie blows its opportunity. The event
ought to be a hilarious catastrophe. But in turning away from the
parading little misses to focus on a car chase and a bungled bank
robbery, ``Happy, Texas'' abruptly fizzles out. &QL;

`DRIVE ME CRAZY': BOY NEXT DOOR IS THE NEXT BEST THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As teen-age romantic comedies go, ``Drive Me Crazy'' ranks among
the easy to take.
</P>
<P>
   The principals are Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart, the
star of television's ``Sabrina, the Teen-Age Witch,'' whose looks
are attractive without being extraordinary. The supporting cast,
led by Susan May Pratt, Mark Webber, Ali Larter and Gabriel
Carpenter, among others, is well chosen. And best of all, ``Drive
Me Crazy,'' directed by John Schultz from a Rob Thomas screenplay
based on Todd Strasser's novel ``How I Created the Perfect Prom
Date,'' treats its teen-agers as characters, not caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Hammond, portrayed by Grenier, even knows how to use
``who'' and ``whom,'' and in one of several signs that it is witty
as well as wise, ``Drive Me Crazy'' doesn't shy from letting him do
so.
</P>
<P>
   When Chase was a little boy, he and Nicole Maris, the girl next
door, were good friends. But as they grew up, they grew apart; and
at the outset of ``Drive Me Crazy,'' while still occupying adjacent
houses, they also occupy opposite ends of the high school social
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The long-haired, dark, scruffy Chase is part of the bright rebel
crowd. Nicole, blond and effervescent, represents the
establishment, busy planning the school's centennial celebration
and waiting eagerly for its basketball star, the handsome but not
too intelligent Brad ( Carpenter) to pop the important question:
will she be his date for the big dance.
</P>
<P>
   But when Chase is dropped by his cause-loving girlfriend, Dulcie
(Ms. Larter), and when Brad literally falls for a cheerleader from
a rival school, Nicole enlists Chase in a scheme to win them back
by pretending to be romantically involved and making them jealous.
</P>
<P>
   So Chase endures a makeover and starts going to basketball
games, and he and Nicole get to know each other again.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, making much mischief, is Nicole's devious and
cynical best friend, Alicia (Ms. Pratt), who has an agenda of her
own, while Chase's decent but uncharismatic pal Dave (Mark Webber)
pursues a cyber-romance with a mysterious woman.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay furnishes its protagonists with some
psychological underpinning as the children of single parents:
Nicole a product of divorce and an unreliable father, and Chase
scarred at an early age by the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to an ending, ``Drive Me Crazy'' offers no
surprises, but it arrives there in amiable, sensible style.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `DRIVE ME CRAZY'
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Drive Me Crazy'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes some importunate back-seat groping, some
excessive drinking and its consequences, and schoolyard language
that seems intended to spare the film the dreaded G rating that
might have alienated the teen-agers who are its most likely
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Schultz; written by Rob Thomas, based on the
novel ``How I Created My Perfect Prom Date'' by Todd Strasser;
director of photography, Kees Van Oostrum; edited by John Pace;
music by Greg Kendall; production designer, Aaron Osborne; produced
by Amy Robinson; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 93
minutes. This film is rated PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Melissa Joan Hart (Nicole Maris), Adrian Grenier (Chase
Hammond), Stephen Collins ( Maris), Mark Metcalf ( Rope), William
Converse-Roberts ( Hammond), Faye Grant (Mrs. Maris), Susan May
Pratt (Alicia), Mark Webber (Dave), Ali Lartner (Dulcie) and
Gabriel Carpenter (Brad).

 By DEBORAH SOLOMON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Charles Saatchi had promised to meet me at a restaurant on
Savile Row. Arriving in central London a few minutes early, I gazed
into the shop windows, with their stylish suits of twill and tweed.
They reminded me of something Gertrude Stein once said.
 &HT;    Asked why she had such an impressive art collection, she
replied, ``Because I don't buy any clothes.''
 &HT;    I wondered how Saatchi would answer the same question, but
mostly I wondered whether he would even materialize for our
meeting. Famously reclusive, he is Britain's leading patron of
contemporary art, and he had already warned me not to expect too
much of him.
 &HT;    A few days earlier, I had picked up my phone and heard a British
voice blurt: ``You can't possibly be serious about this interview.
It's just ridiculous that you would cross the Atlantic to meet a
man who speaks in monosyllables and has nothing of interest to
say.''
 &HT;    Saatchi, of course, is an advertising wizard, the founder with
his younger brother Maurice of the huge firm of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
But these days his most inspired campaign is surely the one that
has turned him into the Maecenas of new British art.
 &HT;    The London art scene had its '80s in the '90s _ it suddenly rose
up as a happening place _ and this is largely Saatchi's doing. For
about a decade, he has been buying the latest art in large
quantities and exhibiting it at the Saatchi Gallery, his palatial
if hard-to-find museum in residential north London.
 &HT;    In the process, he has brought international recognition to a
generation of hypercaffeinated artists led by Damien Hirst of
pickled-shark fame, and reinvented drizzly London as a shining
capital of contemporary art.
 &HT;    Saatchi is vastly controversial in London, which is not
surprising. The British, forever hemming and hawing, have never
been comfortable with either vanguard art or undiluted ambition.
 &HT;    They speak of Saatchi as a ``human Hoover'' who buys art in bulk
and manipulates the market for personal gain. His traveling show,
``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,''
is scheduled to open Sat., Oct. 2, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
 &HT;    New York 's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, after viewing the exhibition
catalog, said the work was ``sick stuff'' and threatened to cut off
all subsidies to the museum unless it cancelled the show.
 &HT;    On Sept. 28, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by threatening
to cut off its funding. City officials announced that they too are
preparing for legal action.
 &HT;    When ``Sensation'' was unveiled two years ago at the Royal
Academy of Arts in London, visitors to the exhibition, who had
never quite thought of elephant dung or an erect cucumber as the
stuff from which masterpieces are made, were appalled that the
Royal Academy had chosen to lend its imperial imprimatur to
Saatchi's sexy collectibles.
 &HT;    Academicians resigned in disgust, protesters hurled eggs and
radio broadcasters led off their hourly news bulletins with
dispatches from ``the Royal Academy of Porn,'' as The Daily Mail
rechristened the museum. In other words, ``Sensation'' went exactly
as planned.
 &HT;    In Brooklyn, before Giuliani's expressions of personal outrage,
the show actually was expected to be less controversial than it was
in London, in part because many of the 43 artists in it have
already won a loyal following in the New York art world.
 &HT;    There is, for starters, Damien Hirst, Brit Art's charismatic
forerunner, who remains best known for suspending a shark in an
enormous tank of formaldehyde, a symbol of the coming art invasion.
There is Rachel Whiteread, a sculptor whose plaster casts of whole
rooms, or of old bathroom sinks and tubs, have a ghostly, nearly
classical presence.
 &HT;    The show has lots of serious painting _ from the good-taste
abstractions of Fiona Rae, Jason Martin and Gary Hume to the
figurative sublimities of Jenny Saville, whose obese female nudes
make cellulite seem almost appealing.
 &HT;    To be sure, some of the work in the show goes for cheap thrills
(like the Chapman brothers' penis-headed mannequins) and some of it
is merely flaky (like Tracey Emin's ``Everyone I Have Ever Slept
With 1963-1995,'' a tent appliqued with the names of her many bed
mates).
 &HT;    Skeptics see the exhibition as Saatchi's latest effort to
inflate the value of his holdings, the sly move of a man for whom
art is mainly a speculator's game.
 &HT;    Yet it seems more likely that Saatchi is a genuine original, the
latest in a line of historic collectors to be acquisition-addicted
and prone to eccentric ways. He gives parties he does not attend,
has never been to a board meeting and is so camera shy I didn't
know what he looked like before we met.
 &HT;    In fact, when a handsome man ambled over to my table in the
restaurant, I assumed he was the maitre d'hotel and started to ask
for fizzy water, only to hear him say, in a voice just above a
whisper: ``Charles Saatchi. Sorry I'm late.''
 &HT;    Saatchi is an animated, striking man of 56 with a tangle of
black hair and large, watchful eyes. He was dressed casually in a
white, short-sleeve shirt and loose black pants. Sitting down to
lunch, he lighted up a Silk Cut cigarette (``I'll never quit,'' he
said with cheerful defiance) and mentioned he was leaving for Italy
the next morning to binge on Renaissance art.
 &HT;    Piero della Francesca is one of his passions. Racing go-carts is
another. He offered me a cigarette and when (why not?) I accepted,
he smiled and said, ``Oh, good, we can be weaklings together.''
 &HT;    I had expected him to be someone else, a
skulking-around-in-the-shadows type, the diffident spook of legend.
But now I saw that he can be extremely charming. Taking out a small
note pad, he pretended to interview me (``Tell me, how did you
become an art critic?'') and in general displayed a disarming mix
of attentiveness, modesty and wit.
 &HT;    Two hours into our lunch, I opened my own note pad. That's when
he shut down. He appeared pained and fidgeted nervously with the
sugar packets on the table.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing complicated about me,'' he insisted with comic
futility. ``There are no hidden depths. As Frank Stella used to say
about Minimalism, What you see is what you see.''
 &HT;    From an art perspective, England has always been
ultraconservative and, frankly, a bit of a snore. England is a
literary country, as opposed to a visual one _ a place that accepts
the most radical innovations in fiction, drama and even high-end
television, but not in the visual arts.
 &HT;    But, regardless of one's picks and pans, the main point is that
Saatchi has managed to assemble the defining contemporary art
collection of a nation.
 &HT;    Not since the '60s, when David Hockney bleached his hair, donned
a gold lame jacket and became a painter-celebrity, has the London
art scene generated so much interest.
 &HT;    His critics insist that Saatchi is not a bona fide collector but
a glorified art dealer interested only in stimulating markets and
making a killing. They say that artists have been hurt by his
divestments and like to tell the tale of Sandro Chia, the Italian
figurative painter. His prices plummeted, his gallery dropped him
and he talked of ``emigrating to Alaska'' after Saatchi bought and
sold his work en bloc.
 &HT;    The abstract painter Sean Scully, some of whose canvases were
once owned by Saatchi, says: ``He's really a commodities broker who
has been let loose on the art world. He claims to love art, but his
is the love that the wolf has for the lamb.''
 &HT;    Faced with such charges, Saatchi says heatedly: ``If I were
interested in art as investment, I would just show Picasso and
Matisse. But that's not what I do. I buy new art, and 90 percent of
the art I buy will probably be worthless in 10 years' time to
anyone except me. I don't know how much of the art I like is
significant; I hope some of it is. Who knows what will last?
History is very cruel, isn't it?
 &HT;    ``At any rate,'' he continued, ``I try to keep my collection
fresh. I don't want to end up like William Randolph Hearst in
Xanadu, who just hoarded art and squirreled it away. Why do I buy
art? I often ask myself the same question. I do it for the pleasure
of putting on shows. The whole thing is purely selfish. It's for my
personal gratification.''
 &HT;    His friends insist that the criticism surrounding him is just
sour grapes. As Hirst says: ``You can't imagine how much people in
England resent success. If you leave a really big tip in a
restaurant, the waiter looks at you like, Who the hell do you think
you are to try to impress me and patronize me like that?''
 &HT;    More to the point, Saatchi is not just another British success
story, but a defiant outsider. Born in Baghdad, the son of a
textile-mill operator, Saatchi grew up in a Jewish family in north
London.
 &HT;    An indifferent student and college dropout, he was 27 when he
and his kid brother started Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. That was in 1970.
Maurice oversaw the business side and Charles took care of the
creative side. By 1986, the firm had become the biggest ad agency
in the world, but Charles was already off on a second career.
 &HT;    If he brought an American-style brashness to British
advertising, he would soon do the same thing to the British art
scene.
 &HT;    ``I grew up on Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley,'' Saatchi says.
``I grew up in the cinema. I was completely in love with anything
American. When I was 19, I came to New York for the first time and
saw a Pollock painting at the Museum of Modern Art and it was
life-changing. Looking at pictures, going to a movie and seeing a
girl was my ideal day when I was young.''
 &HT;    He started collecting early _ jukeboxes, initially _ and
purchased his first work of art (a Sol LeWitt drawing) when he was
still in his 20s. Soon he and his first wife, Doris, an
American-born art writer, were flying to New York once a month to
shop for major art.
 &HT;    In 1985, they opened the Saatchi Gallery, 30,000 square feet of
dazzling whiteness tucked behind imposing gray gates on Boundary
Road. They put on shows that established them as the collectors
with more _ more Julian Schnabels (27 paintings), more Anselm
Kiefers (23 in all), more Cy Twomblys, more Joel Shapiros and, in
particular, more gleaming grids and tilting trapezoids by the
Minimalists.
 &HT;    But then their romance with the American art world seemed to
evaporate almost overnight. In 1990, Saatchi and Doris were
divorced, and like a man who longs to divest himself of his past
and his possessions, he sold off most of the artwork they had
purchased together.
 &HT;    ``I loved Minimalism very passionately,'' Saatchi says, ``but
when you realize there are other things in life besides Carl Andre
and Robert Ryman, it's difficult to look at them and have the same
love affair.''
 &HT;    He became consumed by a circle of British artists who were in
their early 20s and had befriended one another at Goldsmiths
College. They were clearly aware of New York art and its theories,
but their work appeared to be as much about the issues of youth _
sex, death, cigarettes, looking back in anger, etc. _ as the issues
of art.
 &HT;    By now, it would be hard to find a collector who is more
temperamentally allied to the art of the '90s, more in sync with
the pop thrust of contemporary art, than Saatchi, he of the
Elvis-embracing heart.
 &HT;    Last December, Saatchi _ who lives in a townhouse in Chelsea
with his second wife, Kay Hartenstein, and their 4-year-old
daughter _ donated 130 artworks for a Christie's auction that
raised $2.6 million to create scholarship bursaries at four London
art schools. And then, in February, he gave an additional 100
pieces from his collection to the Arts Council of Great Britain.
 &HT;    Moreover, he and his brother not long ago financed the
construction of a London synagogue and named it after their
(still-living) parents. The new Saatchi Synagogue is highly
unusual, not least because it is looking to generate buzz.
 &HT;    When the temple opened, a poster for it was plastered throughout
the London Underground _ a spoof of a Damien Hirst dead-animal
sculpture featuring a chicken floating in a tank of chicken soup.
``My parents think I'm nuts,'' Saatchi tells me.
 &HT;    His art, it seems, leaves him with little time for the
advertising business. ``I'm too old for advertising,'' he says with
typical self-mockery. ``It's a business for young minds. I show my
stuff to people and they laugh at me.''
 &HT;    We were still in the restaurant, and it was getting late. I
asked him why a man with abundant social poise might choose to lead
a reclusive life. It was one of many questions he dodged with
humor, saying only, ``I think it's time to put you into a taxi.''
 &HT;    The other day, I was sent a 90-minute documentary about the
Saatchi brothers that was recently broadcast on Britain's Channel
4. It's called ``The Real Saatchis: Masters of Illusion,'' and it
is grossly unflattering.
 &HT;    Saatchi is characterized as arrogant and reckless, a
``megalomaniac'' with 17 cars and not one firmly held conviction,
other than an adman's belief that image is everything.
 &HT;    As I watched the documentary, I wondered to myself: Who is
Charles Saatchi? A man I had lunch with one Tuesday on Savile Row,
a man who had charmed me to the bone. I admit he won over my
critical heart. Was I naive, taken in by a brilliant image maker?
 &HT;    Actually, I believe he is genuine. I can still see him now,
standing on the street corner where we parted, awaiting the taxi,
hands in his pockets. He said to me then: ``Do I have a good eye? I
have a good eye for me. I don't know that my collection will ever
satisfy anyone. But it satisfies me.''

 By DEBORAH SOLOMON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Charles Saatchi had promised to meet me at a restaurant on
Savile Row. Arriving in central London a few minutes early, I gazed
into the shop windows, with their stylish suits of twill and tweed.
They reminded me of something Gertrude Stein once said.
 &HT;    Asked why she had such an impressive art collection, she
replied, ``Because I don't buy any clothes.''
 &HT;    I wondered how Saatchi would answer the same question, but
mostly I wondered whether he would even materialize for our
meeting. Famously reclusive, he is Britain's leading patron of
contemporary art, and he had already warned me not to expect too
much of him.
 &HT;    A few days earlier, I had picked up my phone and heard a British
voice blurt: ``You can't possibly be serious about this interview.
It's just ridiculous that you would cross the Atlantic to meet a
man who speaks in monosyllables and has nothing of interest to
say.''
 &HT;    Saatchi, of course, is an advertising wizard, the founder with
his younger brother Maurice of the huge firm of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
But these days his most inspired campaign is surely the one that
has turned him into the Maecenas of new British art.
 &HT;    The London art scene had its '80s in the '90s _ it suddenly rose
up as a happening place _ and this is largely Saatchi's doing. For
about a decade, he has been buying the latest art in large
quantities and exhibiting it at the Saatchi Gallery, his palatial
if hard-to-find museum in residential north London.
 &HT;    In the process, he has brought international recognition to a
generation of hypercaffeinated artists led by Damien Hirst of
pickled-shark fame, and reinvented drizzly London as a shining
capital of contemporary art.
 &HT;    Saatchi is vastly controversial in London, which is not
surprising. The British, forever hemming and hawing, have never
been comfortable with either vanguard art or undiluted ambition.
 &HT;    They speak of Saatchi as a ``human Hoover'' who buys art in bulk
and manipulates the market for personal gain. His traveling show,
``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,''
is scheduled to open Sat., Oct. 2, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
 &HT;    New York 's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, after viewing the exhibition
catalog, said the work was ``sick stuff'' and threatened to cut off
all subsidies to the museum unless it cancelled the show.
 &HT;    On Sept. 28, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by threatening
to cut off its funding. City officials announced that they too are
preparing for legal action.
 &HT;    When ``Sensation'' was unveiled two years ago at the Royal
Academy of Arts in London, visitors to the exhibition, who had
never quite thought of elephant dung or an erect cucumber as the
stuff from which masterpieces are made, were appalled that the
Royal Academy had chosen to lend its imperial imprimatur to
Saatchi's sexy collectibles.
 &HT;    Academicians resigned in disgust, protesters hurled eggs and
radio broadcasters led off their hourly news bulletins with
dispatches from ``the Royal Academy of Porn,'' as The Daily Mail
rechristened the museum. In other words, ``Sensation'' went exactly
as planned.
 &HT;    In Brooklyn, before Giuliani's expressions of personal outrage,
the show actually was expected to be less controversial than it was
in London, in part because many ofthe 43 artists in it have
already won a loyal following in the New York art world.
 &HT;    There is, for starters, Damien Hirst, Brit Art's charismatic
forerunner, who remains best known for suspending a shark in an
enormous tank of formaldehyde, a symbol of the coming art invasion.
There is Rachel Whiteread, a sculptor whose plaster casts of whole
rooms, or of old bathroom sinks and tubs, have a ghostly, nearly
classical presence.
 &HT;    The show has lots of serious painting _ from the good-taste
abstractions of Fiona Rae, Jason Martin and Gary Hume to the
figurative sublimities of Jenny Saville, whose obese female nudes
make cellulite seem almost appealing.
 &HT;    To be sure, some of the work in the show goes for cheap thrills
(like the Chapman brothers' penis-headed mannequins) and some of it
is merely flaky (like Tracey Emin's ``Everyone I Have Ever Slept
With 1963-1995,'' a tent appliqued with the names of her many bed
mates).
 &HT;    Skeptics see the exhibition as Saatchi's latest effort to
inflate the value of his holdings, the sly move of a man for whom
art is mainly a speculator's game.
 &HT;    Yet it seems more likely that Saatchi is a genuine original, the
latest in a line of historic collectors to be acquisition-addicted
and prone to eccentric ways. He gives parties he does not attend,
has never been to a board meeting and is so camera shy I didn't
know what he looked like before we met.
 &HT;    In fact, when a handsome man ambled over to my table in the
restaurant, I assumed he was the maitre d'hotel and started to ask
for fizzy water, only to hear him say, in a voice just above a
whisper: ``Charles Saatchi. Sorry I'm late.''
 &HT;    Saatchi is an animated, striking man of 56 with a tangle of
black hair and large, watchful eyes. He was dressed casually in a
white, short-sleeve shirt and loose black pants. Sitting down to
lunch, he lighted up a Silk Cut cigarette (``I'll never quit,'' he

 &HT;    Piero della Francesca is one of his passions. Racing go-carts is
another. He offered me a cigarette and when (why not?) I accepted,
he smiled and said, ``Oh, good, we can be weaklings together.''
 &HT;    I had expected him to be someone else, a
skulking-around-in-the-shadows type, the diffident spook of legend.
But now I saw that he can be extremely charming. Taking out a small
note pad, he pretended to interview me (``Tell me, how did you
become an art critic?'') and in general displayed a disarming mix
of attentiveness, modesty and wit.
 &HT;    Two hours into our lunch, I opened my own note pad. That's when

sugar packets on the table.

divestments and like to tell the tale of Sandro Chia, the Italian
figurative painter. His prices plummeted, his gallery dropped him
and he talked of ``emigrating to Alaska'' after Saatchi bought and
sold his work en bloc.
 &HT;    The abstract painter Sean Scully, some of whose canvases were
once owned by Saatchi, says: ``He's really a commodities broker who
has been let loose on the art world. He claims to love art, but his
is the love that the wolf has for the lamb.''

They reminded me of something Gertrude Stein once said.
 &HT;    Asked why she had such an impressive art collection, she
replied, ``Because I don't buy any clothes.''
 &HT;    I wondered how Saatchi would answer the same question, but
mostly I wondered whether he would even materialize for our
meeting. Famously reclusive, he is Britain's leading patron of
contemporary art, and he had already warned me not to expect too
much of him.
 &HT;    A few days earlier, I had picked up my phone and heard a British
voice blurt: ``You can't possibly be serious about this interview.
It's just ridiculous that you would cross the Atlantic to meet a
man who speaks in monosyllables and has nothing of interest to
say.''
 &HT;    Saatchi, of course, is an advertising wizard, the founder with
his younger brother Maurice of the huge firm of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
But these days his most inspired campaign is surely the one that
has turned him into the Maecenas of new British art.
 &HT;    The London art scene had its '80s in the '90s _ it suddenly rose
up as a happening place _ and this is largely Saatchi's doing. For
about a decade, he has been buying the latest art in large
quantities and exhibiting it at the Saatchi Gallery, his palatial
if hard-to-find museum in residential north London.
 &HT;    In the process, he has brought international recognition to a
generation of hypercaffeinated artists led by Damien Hirst of
pickled-shark fame, and reinvented drizzly London as a shining
capital of contemporary art.
 &HT;    Saatchi is vastly controversial in London, which is not
surprising. The British, forever hemming and hawing, have never
been comfortable with either vanguard art or undiluted ambition.
 &HT;    They speak of Saatchi as a ``human Hoover'' who buys art in bulk
and manipulates the market for personal gain. His traveling show,
``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,''
is scheduled to open Sat., Oct. 2, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
 &HT;    New York 's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, after viewing the exhibition
catalog, said the work was ``sick stuff'' and threatened to cut off
all subsidies to the museum unless it cancelled the show.
 &HT;    On Sept. 28, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by threatening
to cut off its funding. City officials announced that they too are
preparing for legal action.
 &HT;    When ``Sensation'' was unveiled two years ago at the Royal
Academy of Arts in London, visitors to the exhibition, who had
never quite thought of elephant dung or an erect cucumber as the
stuff from which masterpieces are made, were appalled that the
Royal Academy had chosen to lend its imperial imprimatur to
Saatchi's sexy collectibles.
 &HT;    Academicians resigned in disgust, protesters hurled eggs and
radio broadcasters led off their hourly news bulletins with
dispatches from ``the Royal Academy of Porn,'' as The Daily Mail
rechristened the museum. In other words, ``Sensation'' went exactly
as planned.
 &HT;    In Brooklyn, before Giuliani's expressions of personal outrage,
the show actually was expected to be less controversial than it was
in London, in part because many of the 43 artists in it have
already won a loyal following in the New York art world.
 &HT;    There is, for starters, Damien Hirst, Brit Art's charismatic
forerunner, who remains best known for suspending a shark in an
enormous tank of formaldehyde, a symbol of the coming art invasion.
There is Rachel Whiteread, a sculptor whose plaster casts of whole
rooms, or of old bathroom sinks and tubs, have a ghostly, nearly
classical presence.
 &HT;    The show has lots of serious painting _ from the good-taste
abstractions of Fiona Rae, Jason Martin and Gary Hume to the
figurative sublimities of Jenny Saville, whose obese female nudes
make cellulite seem almost appealing.
 &HT;    To be sure, some of the work in the show goes for cheap thrills
(like the Chapman brothers' penis-headed mannequins) and some of it
is merely flaky (like Tracey Emin's ``Everyone I Have Ever Slept
With 1963-1995,'' a tent appliqued with the names of her many bed
mates).
 &HT;    Skeptics see the exhibition as Saatchi's latest effort to
inflate the value of his holdings, the sly move of a man for whom
art is mainly a speculator's game.
 &HT;    Yet it seems more likely that Saatchi is a genuine original, the
latest in a line of historic collectors to be acquisition-addicted
and prone to eccentric ways. He gives parties he does not attend,
has never been to a board meeting and is so camera shy I didn't
know what he looked like before we met.
 &HT;    In fact, when a handsome man ambled over to my table in the
restaurant, I assumed he was the maitre d'hotel and started to ask
for fizzy water, only to hear him say, in a voice just above a
whisper: ``Charles Saatchi. Sorry I'm late.''
 &HT;    Saatchi is an animated, striking man of 56 with a tangle of
black hair and large, watchful eyes. He was dressed casually in a
white, short-sleeve shirt and loose black pants. Sitting down to
lunch, he lighted up a Silk Cut cigarette (``I'll never quit,'' he
said with cheerful defiance) and mentioned he was leaving for Italy
the next morning to binge on Renaissance art.
 &HT;    Piero della Francesca is one of his passions. Racing go-carts is
another. He offered me a cigarette and when (why not?) I accepted,
he smiled and said, ``Oh, good, we can be weaklings together.''
 &HT;    I had expected him to be someone else, a
skulking-around-in-the-shadows type, the diffident spook of legend.
But now I saw that he can be extremely charming. Taking out a small
note pad, he pretended to interview me (``Tell me, how did you
become an art critic?'') and in general displayed a disarming mix
of attentiveness, modesty and wit.
 &HT;    Two hours into our lunch, I opened my own note pad. That's when
he shut down. He appeared pained and fidgeted nervously with the
sugar packets on the table.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing complicated about me,'' he insisted with comic
futility. ``There are no hidden depths. As Frank Stella used to say
about Minimalism, What you see is what you see.''
 &HT;    From an art perspective, England has always been
ultraconservative and, frankly, a bit of a snore. England is a
literary country, as opposed to a visual one _ a place that accepts
the most radical innovations in fiction, drama and even high-end
television, but not in the visual arts.
 &HT;    But, regardless of one's picks and pans, the main point is that
Saatchi has managed to assemble the defining contemporary art
collection of a nation.
 &HT;    Not since the '60s, when David Hockney bleached his hair, donned
a gold lame jacket and became a painter-celebrity, has the London
art scene generated so much interest.
 &HT;    His critics insist that Saatchi is not a bona fide collector but
a glorified art dealer interested only in stimulating markets and
making a killing. They say that artists have been hurt by his
divestments and like to tell the tale of Sandro Chia, the Italian
figurative painter. His prices plummeted, his gallery dropped him
and he talked of ``emigrating to Alaska'' after Saatchi bought and
sold his work en bloc.
 &HT;    The abstract painter Sean Scully, some of whose canvases were
once owned by Saatchi, says: ``He's really a commodities broker who
has been let loose on the art world. He claims to love art, but his
is the love that the wolf has for the lamb.''
 &HT;    Faced with such charges, Saatchi says heatedly: ``If I were
interested in art as investment, I would just show Picasso and
Matisse. But that's not what I do. I buy new art, and 90 percent of
the art I buy will probably be worthless in 10 years' time to
anyone except me. I don't know how much of the art I like is
significant; I hope some of it is. Who knows what will last?
History is very cruel, isn't it?
 &HT;    ``At any rate,'' he continued, ``I try to keep my collection
fresh. I don't want to end up like William Randolph Hearst in
Xanadu, who just hoarded art and squirreled it away. Why do I buy
art? I often ask myself the same question. I do it for the pleasure
of putting on shows. The whole thing is purely selfish. It's for my
personal gratification.''
 &HT;    His friends insist that the criticism surrounding him is just
sour grapes. As Hirst says: ``You can't imagine how much people in
England resent success. If you leave a really big tip in a
restaurant, the waiter looks at you like, Who the hell do you think
you are to try to impress me and patronize me like that?''
 &HT;    More to the point, Saatchi is not just another British success
story, but a defiant outsider. Born in Baghdad, the son of a
textile-mill operator, Saatchi grew up in a Jewish family in north
London.
 &HT;    An indifferent student and college dropout, he was 27 when he
and his kid brother started Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. That was in 1970.
Maurice oversaw the business side and Charles took care of the
creative side. By 1986, the firm had become the biggest ad agency
in the world, but Charles was already off on a second career.
 &HT;    If he brought an American-style brashness to British
advertising, he would soon do the same thing to the British art
scene.
 &HT;    ``I grew up on Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley,'' Saatchi says.
``I grew up in the cinema. I was completely in love with anything
American. When I was 19, I came to New York for the first time and
saw a Pollock painting at the Museum of Modern Art and it was
life-changing. Looking at pictures, going to a movie and seeing a
girl was my ideal day when I was young.''
 &HT;    He started collecting early _ jukeboxes, initially _ and
purchased his first work of art (a Sol LeWitt drawing) when he was
still in his 20s. Soon he and his first wife, Doris, an
American-born art writer, were flying to New York once a month to
shop for major art.
 &HT;    In 1985, they opened the Saatchi Gallery, 30,000 square feet of
dazzling whiteness tucked behind imposing gray gates on Boundary
Road. They put on shows that established them as the collectors
with more _ more Julian Schnabels (27 paintings), more Anselm
Kiefers (23 in all), more Cy Twomblys, more Joel Shapiros and, in
particular, more gleaming grids and tilting trapezoids by the
Minimalists.
 &HT;    But then their romance with the American art world seemed to
evaporate almost overnight. In 1990, Saatchi and Doris were
divorced, and like a man who longs to divest himself of his past
and his possessions, he sold off most of the artwork they had
purchased together.
 &HT;    ``I loved Minimalism very passionately,'' Saatchi says, ``but
when you realize there are other things in life besides Carl Andre
and Robert Ryman, it's difficult to look at them and have the same
love affair.''
 &HT;    He became consumed by a circle of British artists who were in
their early 20s and had befriended one another at Goldsmiths
College. They were clearly aware of New York art and its theories,
but their work appeared to be as much about the issues of youth _
sex, death, cigarettes, looking back in anger, etc. _ as the issues
of art.
 &HT;    By now, it would be hard to find a collector who is more
temperamentally allied to the art of the '90s, more in sync with
the pop thrust of contemporary art, than Saatchi, he of the
Elvis-embracing heart.
 &HT;    Last December, Saatchi _ who lives in a townhouse in Chelsea
with his second wife, Kay Hartenstein, and their 4-year-old
daughter _ donated 130 artworks for a Christie's auction that
raised $2.6 million to create scholarship bursaries at four London
art schools. And then, in February, he gave an additional 100
pieces from his collection to the Arts Council of Great Britain.
 &HT;    Moreover, he and his brother not long ago financed the
construction of a London synagogue and named it after their
(still-living) parents. The new Saatchi Synagogue is highly
unusual, not least because it is looking to generate buzz.
 &HT;    When the temple opened, a poster for it was plastered throughout
the London Underground _ a spoof of a Damien Hirst dead-animal
sculpture featuring a chicken floating in a tank of chicken soup.
``My parents think I'm nuts,'' Saatchi tells me.
 &HT;    His art, it seems, leaves him with little time for the
advertising business. ``I'm too old for advertising,'' he says with
typical self-mockery. ``It's a business for young minds. I show my
stuff to people and they laugh at me.''
 &HT;    We were still in the restaurant, and it was getting late. I
asked him why a man with abundant social poise might choose to lead
a reclusive life. It was one of many questions he dodged with
humor, saying only, ``I think it's time to put you into a taxi.''
 &HT;    The other day, I was sent a 90-minute documentary about the
Saatchi brothers that was recently broadcast on Britain's Channel
4. It's called ``The Real Saatchis: Masters of Illusion,'' and it
is grossly unflattering.
 &HT;    Saatchi is characterized as arrogant and reckless, a
``megalomaniac'' with 17 cars and not one firmly held conviction,
other than an adman's belief that image is everything.
 &HT;    As I watched the documentary, I wondered to myself: Who is
Charles Saatchi? A man I had lunch with one Tuesday on Savile Row,
a man who had charmed me to the bone. I admit he won over my
critical heart. Was I naive, taken in by a brilliant image maker?
 &HT;    Actually, I believe he is genuine. I can still see him now,
standing on the street corner where we parted, awaiting the taxi,
hands in his pockets. He said to me then: ``Do I have a good eye? I
have a good eye for me. I don't know that my collection will ever
satisfy anyone. But it satisfies me.''

`ELMO IN GROUCHLAND': THAT SPECIAL BLUE B-L-A-N-K-E-T 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
(jt) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Elmo the Muppet's first movie gets off to an enchanting start.
Bert and Ernie welcome everybody; Elmo wakes up in polka dot
pajamas in his own adorable little-child's bedroom and sings a
tribute to his comforting blue blanket; Elmo spills orange juice on
his blanket; Elmo goes to the laundromat to wash it, and a lot of
people and Muppets from ``Sesame Street'' are there. The Henson
magic is at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' stays great right
through the scene in which Elmo chases his blanket, accidentally
whisked away by a passing Muppet Rollerblader, down the street and
tells the gathered crowd to move on. ``Nothing to see here,'' he
tells the onlookers. ``Just a little monster trying to get his
blanket back.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Elmo descends into Oscar the Grouch's trashcan home
and, through a colorful, spiraling magic tunnel, into Grouchland,
and much too much of the warm fuzziness disappears. Sure, his line
upon arrival, ``Elmo doesn't think he's in `Sesame Street'
anymore,'' is nice for the adults (there are ``Titanic'' and ``Gone
With the Wind'' references too), but after that most of the jokes
are about the joys of grossness (there's a car mess instead of a
car wash and the most popular ice cream flavor is anchovy swirl).
Yes, small children love dirt, but this magical land just looks
depressing. And yes, Oscar is a ``Sesame Street'' favorite, but one
grouch goes a long way; here we have an alternative universe of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Elmo's quest is the faraway hilltop castle of Huxley (Mandy
Patinkin), who has come into possession of the blanket and won't
give it back. Huxley's problem, of course, is that he hasn't yet
learned to share. Patinkin, wearing extra eyebrows, is just right
as the villain, enjoying playtime as much as any child. ``Which one
of you dares to question my evil ways?'' he says to his terrified
underlings at one point. Vanessa Williams, as the Queen of Trash,
looks beautiful but doesn't fare as well comically.
</P>
<P>
   The film offers lessons about cooperation, perseverance and
transformation, including but not restricted to growing up (``I've
got what it takes,'' says a caterpillar, explaining that he's a
butterfly-to-be, ``right here inside''), and they're well handled.
But the somewhat complicated plot may disappoint or confuse some
tiny Elmo fans. It's a good thing that Bert and Ernie turn up on
screen periodically to explain, reiterate and reassure.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Charles Saatchi had promised to meet me at a restaurant on
Savile Row. Arriving in central London a few minutes early, I gazed
into the shop windows, with their stylish suits of twill and tweed.
They reminded me of something Gertrude Stein once said.
 &HT;    Asked why she had such an impressive art collection, she
replied, ``Because I don't buy any clothes.''
 &HT;    I wondered how Saatchi would answer the same question, but
mostly I wondered whether he would even materialize for our

voice blurt: ``You can't possibly be serious about this interview.
It's just ridiculous that you would cross the Atlantic to meet a

 &HT;    Saatchi, of course, is an advertising wizard, the founder with
his younger brother Maurice of the huge firm of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
But these days his most inspired campaign is surely the one that
has turned him into the Maecenas of new British art.
 &HT;    The London art scene had its '80s in the '90s _ it suddenly rose
up as a happening place _ and this is largely Saatchi's doing. For
about a decade, he has been buying the latest art in large

``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,''
is scheduled to open Sat., Oct. 2, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

 &HT;    ``I grew up on Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley,'' Saatchi says.
``I grew up in the cinema. I was completely in love with anything
American. When I was 19, I came to New York for the first time and
saw a Pollock painting at the Museum of Modern Art and it was
life-changing. Looking at pictures, going to a movie and seeing a
girl was my ideal day when I was young.''
 &HT;    He started collecting early _ jukeboxes, initially _ and
purchased his first work of art (a Sol LeWitt drawing) when he was
still in his 20s. Soon he and his first wife, Doris, an
American-born art writer, were flying to New York once a month to
shop for major art.
 &HT;    In 1985, they opened the Saatchi Gallery, 30,000 square feet of
dazzling whiteness tucked behind imposing gray gates on Boundary
Road. They put on shows that established them as the collectors
with more _ more Julian Schnabels (27 paintings), more Anselm
Kiefers (23 in all), more Cy Twomblys, more Joel Shapiros and, in
particular, more gleaming grids and tilting trapezoids by the
Minimalists.
 &HT;    But then their romance with the American art world seemed to
evaporate almost overnight. In 1990, Saatchi and Doris were
divorced, and like a man who longs to divest himself of his past
and his possessions, he sold off most of the artwork they had
purchased together.
 &HT;    ``I loved Minimalism very passionately,'' Saatchi says, ``but
when you realize there are other things in life besides Carl Andre
and Robert Ryman, it's difficult to look at them and have the same
love affair.''
 &HT;    He became consumed by a circle of British artists who were in
their early 20s and had befriended one another at Goldsmiths
College. They were clearly aware of New York art and its theories,
but their work appeared to be as much about the issues of youth _
sex, death, cigarettes, looking back in anger, etc. _ as the issues
of art.
 &HT;    By now, it would be hard to find a collector who is more
temperamentally allied to the art of the '90s, more in sync with
the pop thrust of contemporary art, than Saatchi, he of the
Elvis-embracing heart.
 &HT;    Last December, Saatchi _ who lives in a townhouse in Chelsea
with his second wife, Kay Hartenstein, and their 4-year-old
daughter _ donated 130 artworks for a Christie's auction that
raised $2.6 million to create scholarship bursaries at four London
art schools. And then, in February, he gave an additional 100
pieces from his collection to the Arts Council of Great Britain.
 &HT;    Moreover, he and his brother not long ago financed the
construction of a London synagogue and named it after their
(still-living) parents. The new Saatchi Synagogue is highly
unusual, not least because it is looking to generate buzz.
 &HT;    When the temple opened, a poster for it was plastered throughout
the London Underground _ a spoof of a Damien Hirst dead-animal
sculpture featuring a chicken floating in a tank of chicken soup.
``My parents think I'm nuts,'' Saatchi tells me.
 &HT;    His art, it seems, leaves him with little time for the
advertising business. ``I'm too old for advertising,'' he says with
typical self-mockery. ``It's a business for young minds. I show my
stuff to people and they laugh at me.''
 &HT;    We were still in the restaurant, and it was getting late. I
asked him why a man with abundant social poise might choose to lead
a reclusive life. It was one of many questions he dodged with
humor, saying only, ``I think it's time to put you into a taxi.''
 &HT;    The other day, I was sent a 90-minute documentary about the
Saatchi brothers that was recently broadcast on Britain's Channel
4. It's called ``The Real Saatchis: Masters of Illusion,'' and it
is grossly unflattering.
 &HT;    Saatchi is characterized as arrogant and reckless, a
``megalomaniac'' with 17 cars and not one firmly held conviction,
other than an adman's belief that image is everything.
 &HT;    As I watched the documentary, I wondered to myself: Who is
Charles Saatchi? A man I had lunch with one Tuesday on Savile Row,
a man who had charmed me to the bone. I admit he won over my
critical heart. Was I naive, taken in by a brilliant image maker?
 &HT;    Actually, I believe he is genuine. I can still see him now,
standing on the street corner where we parted, awaiting the taxi,
hands in his pockets. He said to me then: ``Do I have a good eye? I
have a good eye for me. I don't know that my collection will ever
satisfy anyone. But it satisfies me.''

`LOVE REINVENTED': GLIMPSES OF THE WORLD AIDS HAS WROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gay men have sexual encounters in a car parked on a Paris
street, in a young stranger's apartment, in a New York subway
station, beside a perfect beach and in a hospital room. Lesbians
talk about HIV while strolling near dawn by the Seine. Condoms are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When watching ``Love Reinvented,'' it helps to know what most of
these 12 short films were originally meant for. In 1995 the
Association of Lesbian and Gay Pride Films in France held a
screenplay competition, seeking material for AIDS-related
public-service shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting films were shown on French television, then in
theaters. Alone, any number of these would be powerful, poignant or
both. Together, for the purposes of a theatrical release, they
almost cancel one another out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rubber'' looks most like a commercial for safe sex. In it
two gay men who have been seeing each other drive off in a
convertible for a romantic weekend and show that they didn't forget
to pack lots of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherish,'' one of two non-French films added to the package,
is particularly touching. An AIDS widower mourns his dead lover in
flashbacks of happy days, as he goes about ordinary daily tasks
like washing the dishes. Grief may be the most prevalent AIDS
experience now, remembering our friends, relatives and lovers who
got sick and died too soon for protease inhibitor cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ordinary Night,'' in which a seemingly joyous young man
sings as he rides his bicycle to his date, is also effective. The
date turns out to be a night at the hospital with his dying
boyfriend. ``Inside'' is an affecting monologue by a young man with
AIDS, alone and perpetually indoors, telling his video camera all
the things he wishes he had been able to do (``I'd have liked to
meet a guy.'' ``I'd have liked to grow old.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Reinvented'' is a reminder that despite education and
near-miracles in treatment, the AIDS crisis isn't really over. All
over the world some men and women, young and old, straight and gay,
still say, like the unseen narrator of ``A Moment,'' ``He's too
young to have it'' and act accordingly. &QL;

AUTHORS EXPECT DOW TO TRIPLE ITS CURRENT LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where's the bear?
</P>
<P>
   With half the adult population in the United States invested in
the stock market, that question must be almost always gnawing at
the back of most investors' minds.
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible that the market could continue with such
strength. In 1982, the Dow Jones industrial average was a mere 777
points.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed
out the possibility of ``irrational exuberance'' in stock values,
the Dow had climbed to more than 6,400.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the bear?
</P>
<P>
   If you believe a financial journalist and an economist, nowhere
in sight. James Glassman and Kevin Hassett suggest that you think
big _ really big. They see the Dow more than tripling the current
level, and that's in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   They published those opinions in an article in The Wall Street
Journal in 1998, headlined ``Are Stocks Overvalued? Not a Chance.''
The article discussed a new way of looking at stock values,
ditching the price/earnings ratios that are historically used to
gauge whether stocks prices are overheated.
</P>
<P>
   The article infuriated academics and rallied investors. Glassman
and Hassett decided they were onto something.
</P>
<P>
   Now their opinions are spelled out in a new book, ``Dow 36,000:
The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock
Market'' (Times Books, 294 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Glassman, a seasoned business journalist, was a columnist for
The Washington Post and now writes a financial column for Reader's
Digest. He's a frequent commentator on National Public Radio's
``Morning Edition'' and public television's ``Nightly Business
Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassett, who has a doctorate in economics, is a former senior
economist for the Federal Reserve Board and is a resident scholar
at the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they have thrown out convention, which hasn't been
accurately explaining the phenomenal bull market, and come up with
a new idea. Their timing may be just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No area of inquiry is more ripe for a paradigm shift than
modern finance,'' they write. ``The old model, which focuses on
historical valuations, does not seem to work any longer. Everyday
investors, spurred on by the efforts of creative thinkers like Tom
and David Gardner, the brothers who launched the Motley Fool Web
site and books, are learning to ignore the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett's concept on valuing stocks is based on a
term they call the ``perfectly reasonable price'' of a stock. To
get to that price, the authors suggest looking at two fundamentals
of a company, dividends and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Their research found that since 1946, dividends have risen on
average more than 6 percent annually, while after-tax earnings have
risen more than 7 percent. With compounding, that means those rates
double about every 10 years, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those growth rates are at the heart of our theory about rising
stock prices,'' Glassman and Hassett write. ``They have largely
been ignored by analysts, who prefer to judge stocks by
backward-looking valuation techniques that, much of the time, have
argued against investing in stocks at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Their theory holds even with companies that don't pay dividends,
the authors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dividend is not just the quarterly check you get from a
company,'' they write. ``Microsoft has value now even if we expect
that it will never pay regular dividends as traditionally defined
because, ultimately, someone will take cash out of the firm _
either after a liquidation or after a buyout by another company.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be 100 years before that cash flows into a shareholder's
pocket, but the value of the stock could still reflect that cash
flow today, Glassman and Hassett write.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides interesting fodder on why this stock market
does not appear to be heading towards the bear side anytime soon.
And it shows individual investors how simple math can help them
ride the market as high as it goes.

`SIEGFRIED AND ROY: THE MAGIC BOX': THAT OLD 3D MAGIC, WITH SMOKE
AND TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies are not a hospitable medium for magic, at least not the
kind of magic practiced in Las Vegas by Siegfried and Roy.
</P>
<P>
   So the new 3-D Imax film, ``Siegfried and Roy: The Magic Box,''
must be classified a disappointment, even if it did not prove also
to be an overblown compound of windy narration, repetitive
illusions, undernourished biography, swollen music and ludicrous
performance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, moviegoers routinely exposed to the filmmaking magic
that transports them to alien worlds, among imaginary creatures,
into intergalactic explosions and ancient societies, among other
illusions, can hardly be expected to sit jaws agape while a couple
of caped vaudevillians drape cages and make elephants and tigers
and themselves disappear and reappear amid puffs of stage smoke,
belching flames and legions of marching, dancing showgirls.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, thanks to 3-D, a tiger or lion appears to vault
overhead or move close enough to invite a pat on the nose, but
otherwise little seems wondrous about ``Siegfried and Roy,'' which
was directed by Brett Leonard, whose credits include the superior
and more imaginative ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hopkins, the narrator of ``Siegfried and Roy,'' must
have had all he could do to keep a straight face while intoning its
repetitive words about realizing dreams, the awesome power of
magic, the harmony of man and animal and especially the line about
the character who grew up in ``pre-post-World War II Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is at its most charming in its re-creation of the time
when Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn met as young men
while working as stewards aboard an ocean liner, where they first
joined forces in a magic act (involving Roy's pet cheetah) for its
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried and Roy'' is at its most cloying at its outset, when
two little boys overdo their awe while wandering backstage into a
meeting with the two magicians that leads to the interwoven,
fanciful depiction of their early life in Germany and their act in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Given the popularity of Siegfried and Roy, the reality of their
performance is probably more entertaining than this 3-D cinematic
illusion. &QL;

`MYSTERY, ALASKA': A SMALL HOCKEY TOWN TAKES ON THE BIG GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to capturing the bone-crunching, high-velocity
world of sports, Hollywood has a surprisingly spotty record, often
preferring to present the game as metaphor (``Field of Dreams'')
instead of diving into the bruising reality of the arena. But
``Mystery, Alaska,'' an upbeat meat-and-potatoes movie that is a
striking change in directorial style for Jay Roach, who oversaw the
garish Austin Powers romps, conveys some of the thrill and ferocity
of ice hockey while skillfully folding together multiple personal
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by David E. Kelley, the king of television drama
(``L.A. Law,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal''), who wrote the
screenplay with Sean O'Byrne, the movie is clearly a project dear
to Kelley's heart. Twenty years ago, he was captain of Princeton's
hockey team, and the screenplay includes enough technical jargon to
demonstrate an insider's knowledge of the sport without clogging up
the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' uses sport to explore the hardy psyche of a
remote Alaskan town that lives and breathes hockey and whose pride
and joy is its legendary pond hockey team. The movie has the look
and feel of an unusually well-constructed television drama in which
a dozen sharply drawn characters interact in ways that are fairly
predictable without seeming too snugly formulaic. You can also feel
the chill; the climactic game takes place in minus-10-degree
weather. In an amusing satirical touch, Little Richard (of all
people) opens the event with a rendition of the national anthem
that is so slow that some of the waiting players worry that their
bones will begin to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   What sparks the drama is the return to Mystery of Charles Danner
(Hank Azaria), a native son who forsook his hometown for New York
City to become a television producer. Danner has come up with a
promotional scheme to pit the locals against the New York Rangers
in a nationally televised exhibition game to be broadcast live from
Mystery. The show would be an economic boon to the town. Without
actually demonizing Danner, the movie presents him as a shifty city
slicker and the high-powered network personnel who descend on
Mystery as blase media gypsies. One dreadful pat, and inaccurate,
marketing pitch proposed is to dub the Mystery team Eskimos on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's moral and emotional grounding wire is Mystery's
sheriff, John Biebe (Russell Crowe), a 13-year veteran of the team
and local sports hero who is devastated to learn that he is being
retired from the first string to make room for Stevie Weeks (Ryan
Northcott), a naive eager beaver only half his age. Biebe is a
terrific role for Crowe, whose Rock of Gibraltar machismo anchors
the film in decent common-sense values. Biebe's demotion sends a
shock through the town and through his marriage to Donna (Mary
McCormack), who years ago dated Danner but chose to marry Biebe and
live a very circumscribed life.
</P>
<P>
   Other colorful locals include the town's mayor, Scott Pitcher
(Colm Meaney); Skank Marden (Ron Eldard), the team's resident stud
who blithely cuckolds Pitcher; the local judge, Walter Burns (Burt
Reynolds); his wife, Joanne (Judith Ivey); their hockey-playing
son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), and their teen-age daughter, Marla
(Rachel Wilson). Finally there is Bailey Pruitt (Maury Chaykin),
the blustering hyper-emotional lawyer who travels all the way to
New York to argue the team's case when the game is in danger of
being canceled because of union problems.
</P>
<P>
   What gives zest to a story that builds to a predictable David
and Goliath confrontation on a pond (in which a Coca-Cola logo has
been imprinted beneath the surface of the ice) is a screenplay that
locates the characters' idiosyncrasies and a calm directorial style
that respects their dignity even when they're under extreme stress.
Where most films about small towns caught up in sports mania take a
patronizing view of grown-ups living vicariously through their
athletic children, ``Mystery, Alaska'' never questions the
community's values. Without fawning over the players, the movie
presents them as rugged, earthy embodiments of a healthy pioneer
spirit that enables communities like Mystery to stay closely knit
and proud.

`PLUNKETT AND MACLEANE': TAKING FROM THE RICH AND GIVING TO
THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody beats the British when it comes to concocting cinematic
visions of society as a fetid swamp of debauchery and sadism. And
``Plunkett and Macleane,'' the film debut of Jake Scott, a British
director from the world of music video, fits right in to a nasty
tradition that embraces everything from Ken Russell's portraits of
the artist as sacred monster to the kitchen-sink nihilism of
``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the true adventures of two ``gentlemen'' highwaymen in
the mid-18th century, this frenziedly overdirected hybrid of a
buddy movie and a costume drama could be described as a Hogarthian
panorama of depravity and treachery set to a late-'90s disco beat.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally recalling the gleefully scatological spirit of
``Trainspotting,'' ``Plunkett and Macleane'' reunites two of that
movie's stars, Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller, as scoundrels
who play a Robin Hood game of stealing from the rich and giving to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The aristocrats on whom these larcenous antiheroes prey are as
loathsome a bunch of gargoyles as you're likely to encounter in any
film this year. Consumed by greed, lust and vanity, they are
extreme caricatures of corruption and depravity. Leading the list
is Lord Rochester, played by Alan Cumming with an electrical dash,
a smirking, slithering effeminate proto-dandy whose favorite
pastime is ``corrupting the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly out of sexual desire and partly out of his innate impulse
toward mischief, Rochester becomes Macleane's tour guide in an
upper-crust social jungle that the movie portrays as a garish
18th-century prototype of the Studio 54 culture rife with drugs,
prostitution and venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   The movie savagely ridicules 18th-century foppishness in a scene
at a wig maker's where some of the headdresses trotted out are
laugh-out-loud ludicrous. A ballroom dance is depicted as a rowdy
beat-driven free-for-all at which many of the men are flouncing gay
blades and the women voracious leering harpies.
</P>
<P>
   These people are so unattractive that when the pair hold up
their carriages or break into their fancy parties and make off with
their jewels, you practically want to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Will Plunkett (Carlyle), the brains behind the
operation, and his partner, James Macleane (Miller), a thief and
priapic gigolo, are morally superior to the people they rip off.
They're just better looking. Macleane, especially, is as wild and
insatiable as his victims. No sooner has the pair amassed a fresh
trove of stolen treasure than he squanders it at the gaming table
and the tailor's.
</P>
<P>
   The two team up in prison, where Plunkett recognizes Macleane as
a man who, when properly attired and coached, could pass himself
off as a gentleman of leisure. Observing the young man's sexual
stamina with the female prisoners, he also realizes that Macleane's
charms, properly deployed, could help smooth his way into some of
England's grandest houses to glean useful information about the
transportation of money and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Bribing their way out of prison with a stolen ruby, the two go
into business and soon become 18th-century tabloid stars. Their
first mark is the Lord Chief Justice Gibson, with whose beautiful
daughter, Rebecca (Liv Tyler), Macleane becomes instantly besotted.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's sadistic second-in-command, Chance (Ken Stott), also
covets Rebecca. And as Plunkett and Macleane pull one daring
robbery after another, Gibson's reputation as a supercop plummets,
while Chance's soars. It all builds up to a daring rescue and chase
in which Plunkett, Macleane and Rebecca flee Chance and an army of
policemen through a network of sewers.
</P>
<P>
   None of it adds up to terribly much beyond a rip-roaring
adventure that shows off Carlyle and Miller as cynical British city
cousins of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. &QL;

   ``Jupiter's Bones''
</P>
<P>
   by Faye Kellerman
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   William Morrow, $25
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a good book.
</P>
<P>
   The elements are there. 1. Corpse of eccentric person found in
mysterious circumstances. 2. Several suspects with motives. 3.
Harried detective with a wife and children who want him home rather
than out chasing hunches on his own time.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jupiter's Bones'' lacks three things: an editor, another
editor and a proofreader.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptive passages go on too long. The action bogs down. Far
too many words are devoted to developing the wackiness of the cult
that the deceased person led. One imagines the editors of this book
_ if there were any _ sitting around thinking up stupid character
names when they should have been doing the sweaty work of pruning
words and sentences while leaving the pith. ... Uh, let's see, was
it Pluto or Nova who signed the death certificate?
</P>
<P>
   There's far too much telling rather than showing. An editor
could have explained to Faye Kellerman that verbs speak louder than
adjectives or even adverbs. And for heaven's sake, let's please not
have any ``noxious habits.'' Let's just smoke and hide the butts.
</P>
<P>
   Far too many strain-your-credibility scenes are included to
accentuate the good-guyness of Detective Pete Decker. He keeps
peace among his subordinates. He mollifies his wife even though
she's trapped all day with a 5-year-old and he breaks yet another
date. He talks his teen son into giving up dope, porn films and sex
with his true love, all in one conversation (interrupted, of
course, by a call from the office).
</P>
<P>
   Less than halfway through the book, the reader begins to hope
the detective is really the perpetrator. It'd take a murder to tip
his scales away from saintliness.
</P>
<P>
   One hesitates to bring up typographical errors when one's own
newspaper recenty, for lack of an ``r,'' turned a pantry into an
article of feminine clothing. But let's do it anyway. Worse than
the abundance of typos in ``Jupiter's Bones'' is the omission of
crucial words. The reader can usually decipher what is meant. But
one doesn't expect the price of a book to include Mad Libs, the old
parlor game of fill-in-the-blank.
</P>
<P>
   It's too long, the writing is stilted and the editing and
proofreading are shoddy. But it has a plot, all right, albeit a
formulaic one. If the Heaven's Gate tragedy interested you, this
book may be worth a look. But one is reluctant to endorse a work in
which the publisher seemed to have so little faith.

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR PROVIDES GLIMPSE OF TAX RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE and ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, who four years ago expressed
doubt about whether he could afford life on a City Hall salary,
reported personal income of $780,000 since taking office, his tax
returns show.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is running for re-election this year, also recorded
an apparent windfall in 1995 on the $3 million sale of a radio
station he co-owned, which netted the mayor $1 million, the returns
show.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gave reporters one hour Wednesday to review four years
of federal income tax returns dating back to 1995. But he refused
to release copies and instead called on one of his re-election
challengers, Clint Reilly, to disclose several years of income tax
returns and tax filings by corporations and real estate
partnerships under Reilly's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is willing to throw open the door on his financial
records, but he does not want copies of his actual personal records
floating around,'' said P.J. Johnston, the Brown campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenge Mr. Reilly to do the same _ make available his
tax returns and financial holdings for the past eight years,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   A millionaire political consultant turned real estate investor,
Reilly was the first among the candidates for mayor to disclose his
income taxes. In April, he released copies of his 1998 federal tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's tax returns show that in 1998 he and his long-estranged
wife, Blanche, had an adjusted joint income of $329,080, and paid
$75,650 in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mayoral pay of $146,255.43, Brown also
reported income in 1998 stemming from his former law practice, a
government pension from his 30-year career as a state lawmaker and
from a stake he holds in an East Bay real estate agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1996, during his first two years as mayor, Brown
reported an adjusted gross income of $240,032 and $210,032,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reilly campaign spokesman Tom Pier said Brown was
only ``feigning to release his taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen minutes of study per year of taxes is inadequate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pier didn't say whether Reilly would make more of his tax
returns available, but said the onus falls heavier on someone, like
Brown, who has been in elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown has been representing the citizens of San
Francisco as mayor for the last four years and he has a duty to
fully disclose his income over that period,'' Pier said. ``Clint
Reilly has been a candidate for public office for one year and he
has released his taxes for that period.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Reilly released his 1998 federal tax return showing
an adjusted gross income of $700,934, including $57,780 earned by
his wife, Janet, who worked in public relations for a department
store chain. He paid $118,123 in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's tax return also contained financial information on
transactions that didn't all show up on his bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he reported receiving $2 million in rent from
commercial buildings in San Francisco and Sacramento. But, after
expenses and losses from other ventures were subtracted, his real
estate dealings added only $392,934 to his tax return.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Brown was weighing a run for mayor, he expressed
doubts about whether he could afford to hold the office _ which
forbids incumbents to engage in other occupations or business
activities.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Brown combined his pay as Assembly speaker with
income from his San Francisco law practice, which paid him $1.15
million between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At a May 1995 luncheon in Sacramento, Brown said he was worried
about the effects that the salary cut that would go along with
being mayor would have on his wife and their three grown children,
to whom at the time he was lending at least some support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of running for mayor. I love the idea of being
mayor of the City and County of San Francisco, but I have a serious
problem, a real serious problem,'' he said during the 1995
luncheon. ``If I could work out an income stream that would take
care of their obligations ... I will in an eye flash be a
candidate.''

`NEW ROSE HOTEL': CORPORATE INTRIGUE, STEAMY SEDUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Abel Ferrara began making a directorial name for himself in
the early 1980s, it was as a bad-boy filmmaker with tastes for
lurid sex, gritty violence and gripping, stylish stories of life in
the fast lane going wrong. It's a sign of the times that Ferrara,
whose cinematic obsessions have barely changed, has come to seem
positively tame. But even though the threshold for onscreen
exploitativeness has been raised ever higher, this filmmaker's work
still retains its peculiar innocence. Nobody could have made ``Bad
Lieutenant'' without taking it to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sleaze notwithstanding, Ferrara's work hews firmly to its own
ideas of purity. He continues to encourage stony leading men toward
remarkable feats of self-flagellation, and to have faith in the
ability of kinky eroticism to settle most situations.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Blackout,'' which surfaced at Cannes in 1997 and
confirmed that his tastes had not remotely changed, Ferrara is back
with ``New Rose Hotel.'' As written by the director with Christ
Zois, it is adapted from a story by William Gibson and affirms that
soft-core porn is alive and well in cyberpunk.
</P>
<P>
   Willem Dafoe and Christopher Walken are Exhibits A and B this
time, allowing themselves to be drawn into the steamy turmoil of
Ferrara's world. In a story that involves corporate intrigue, they
play spies trying to seduce a Japanese geneticist with the help of
one of those compliant, dreamy prostitutes (Asia Argento) who loom
so large in the filmmaker's imagination. As ever in Ferrara's
films, the steam is on, the ridiculous only is at arm's length and
the credits are intriguing. The musicians Ryuichi Sakamoto (who won
an Oscar for ``The Last Emperor'') and John Lurie turn up in the
cast, as does Annabella Sciorra. The geneticist in this
international tale is played by Yoshitaka Amano, a big man in the
world of designing video games.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `NEW ROSE HOTEL'
</P>

A WIDE GULF SEPARATES RUSSELL'S EARLIER FILMS AND `KINGS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not too many filmmakers videotape themselves being interviewed,
or cite books by former President Bush during those interviews. But
not too many filmmakers are like David O. Russell.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy whose first film, ``Spanking the Monkey,'' was a
film-festival favorite about a young man who has an affair ... with
his mother. Whose second film, ``Flirting With Disaster,'' was a
screwball comedy about a young man's ill-fated search for his birth
parents. Whose third film, ``Three Kings,'' seems like an
out-of-character choice: It's an action movie.
</P>
<P>
   But not too many action movies are like ``Three Kings,'' which
stars George Clooney, rapper-actors Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg, and
video director Spike Jonze as U.S. soldiers who go after a cache of
stolen Kuwaiti gold only to find their renegade mission turning
more serious in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with dark humor, filled with surreal touches, and filmed
and edited to create a sense of disorientation, ``Three Kings''
also makes some pointed observations about U.S. policy in the
Persian Gulf area immediately after the gulf war _ chiefly, about
how once Kuwait was liberated, Iraqi civilians were left to fend
for themselves in an uprising against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Until Russell began working on the movie, though, he didn't know
all that much about the war _ or more specifically, its aftermath,
the days in which the movie takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like everybody else,'' Russell says during a Dallas
stop, as a friend videotapes the interview for a project Russell is
working on. ``I just saw the bombs like fireworks going off at
night on TV. I was at the Sundance Film Festival, and I thought it
was the most riveting show in town. It was the most bizarre and
sort of sickening, in a way. And that was it. I didn't pay much
attention until I got this opportunity, after making two movies, to
make this, y'know, kind of the MASH of Desert Storm, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell spent 18 months researching the war, and although the
story is fiction, much of it has some basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that these guys were partying,'' Russell says,
referring to U.S. troops who remained stationed in the Persian Gulf
area after the war. ``It is true that there was an (Iraqi)
insurrection, it is true that there was $800 million in bullion
stolen that went missing until long after the war was over, it is
true they had Bart Simpson on the front of some trucks, it is true
that there were cows in the middle of the battlefield, it is true
that milk trucks were blown up inadvertently _ by our Army
sometimes _ it is true that the guys went for joy rides in the days
after the war ended, and that those things are not enforced as
harshly as they are during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that, despite much pre-release acclaim, ``Three
Kings'' could be a tough sell. Russell is aware that it might turn
off some of the fans he earned with his first two films. He's aware
that the movie might not attract the types of moviegoers who don't
care for action movies. And he's aware that the movie criticizes
the policies of a president who has strong Lone Star State ties,
and whose son is a leading contender for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm conscious of being in (President) George Bush's state, and
I think that the questions that I raise, or that history raises, I
think that George Bush has acknowledged himself,'' Russell says,
going so far as to read aloud passages from ``A World
Transformed,'' which Bush co-wrote with his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is aware that the movie's comic side might be
misinterpreted. And he wants people to know that despite the
movie's dark humor, he respects the U.S. troops. He relates a story
told to him by Maj. Jim Parker, a Vietnam and Persian Gulf War vet
who acted as an adviser on the film, and who died during production
(the film is dedicated to him).
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he was ... with the 82nd Airborne,'' Russell
says. ``And those are the most gung-ho kids, and they were in tears
because they didn't understand, they were confused by the fact that
the war was over, yet Saddam Hussein was over there, crushing a
democratic uprising, and they were to do nothing about it. And at
night, they would take it upon themselves to do things to help the
rebels, which they were not supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie's violence is graphic (to the point of
showing what a bullet can do to the inside of a body), it's not
exploitative or excessive; rather, it's one of the strongest
cinematic depictions of the pain that violence can cause. Russell
acknowledges that some parts aren't for the squeamish, but he
believes that the movie will score with audiences who usually steer
clear of this kind of fare, if only they'll give it a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we previewed the movie ... I was surprised to see that
the women's scores were in many cases higher than the men's
scores,'' he says. ``I think that's because of the heart the movie
has coming down the home stretch. And that it has a human approach
even to the action, y'know, the guy gets a splinter in the middle
of an action scene. That they end up having a face.''

<P>
   With his uncommonly assured first two films, ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and the pitch-perfect ``Flirting With Disaster,'' the
writer and director David O. Russell didn't need much to make an
indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was fabulous, his ideas fresh and his taboo-busting
imagination much to be admired. Now Russell moves onto a much
bigger battlefield with ``Three Kings,'' an absurdist, gimlet-eyed
``Catch-22'' for the Persian Gulf War.
</P>

   It's ultimately a much more ambitious and impassioned work. But
it isn't nearly as successful a showcase for this filmmaker's
extraordinary talents.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russell is most impressive for his writing and his
immensely witty direction of actors, ``Three Kings'' begins by
placing its emphasis firmly elsewhere: on the camera. Against the
huge, bleached panorama of a desert war, which is ending just as
the film begins, he sets out to convey the amorality and chaos of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   American soldiers celebrate with frat-party abandon and without
the faintest interest in what their victory actually means to the
people of Iraq. All they know is that they want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The film captures some of this malaise through the wisecracking
of its principals: Special Forces Capt. Archie Gates (George
Clooney), a shrewd cowboy type; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), a
new father, and Staff Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), who is as devout
and serious as some of the others are cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   These three may not sound like soldier of fortune material, but
they wind up joining forces in a scheme to liberate (i.e., steal) a
huge stash of confiscated gold.
</P>
<P>
   In investing this not so unfamiliar premise with energy and
novelty, Russell experiments nervously with music-video camera
styles. This is a tactic that can and does wind up inadvertently
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts of ``Three Kings'' concern the crazy paradoxes
that the three principals discover, like a bunker full of luxury
cars in mid-desert, where civilians are terrified and desperate,
and Russell's casual expertise in letting the Iraqis' ordeal begin
to color the Americans' story.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker's strong implicit criticism of the Bush
administration's wartime policy, in which Iraqi rebels were
encouraged to challenge Saddam Hussein and then left to the mercy
of his army, did not need jazzing up. It comes through most clearly
in the increasingly intense and single-minded performances of the
film's leading men.
</P>
<P>
   The Pandora's box of camera tricks that is opened here must
surely have been intended to capture the speed and disorientation
of wartime experience, and the jittery atmosphere in which
soldiers' snap judgments are made.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a sure hand to know when to eliminate the
superfluous and let a story unfold on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   When Russell begins to do that in the latter half of ``Three
Kings,'' his film begins homing in on the political and moral
conundrums that were always at the heart of this material. But when
that finally happens, it remains too little, too late.
</P>

TAKING A CALL FROM ET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My desktop computer has a hobby. When it's not busy being my
word processor, or balancing my checkbook, or being my portal to
the Internet, it casts its eyes skywards and searches for
extraterrestrial life. It's listening for an ET _ not an ET that is
phoning home, but one that is calling to us.
</P>
<P>
   My computer isn't doing this alone, of course. Searching for ET
requires a lot of things I don't have, the first one being a
multi-million dollar radio telescope. Even if I had my own
telescope, my computer lacks the power to analyze all of the radio
signals coming in from space, filter out the background noise, and
scan for the sounds that might be characteristic of intelligence.
In fact, there is no computer on the earth today that is powerful
enough to accomplish this task.
</P>
<P>
   That's why my computer has joined the ranks of more than a
million other machines in the international Search For
Extraterrestrial Intelligence At Home (SETI(at symbol)Home)
project, which is being coordinated by the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(at symbol)Home is one of several projects under way right
now that is harnessing the power of multiple computers for a single
purpose. Another is Distributed.NET, which is using spare CPU time
on several thousand computers to crack encryption keys. Both these
projects distribute a special-purpose screen saver that runs on
Windows and Macintosh-based PCs. When you aren't using your desktop
computer, the screen saver comes on and starts crunching
mathematical problems. When you start using your computer again,
the program politely saves its work and gets out of your way.
(Versions of the SETI(at symbol)Home program are also available for
more than a dozen versions of UNIX.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the key to coordinating these distributed
projects. The first time you start up the SETI(at symbol)Home
program, the software makes a connection over the Internet to a
computer in California and downloads a ``work unit'' _ that is, a
set of measurements from a particular part of the sky. The work
unit is about 350 kilobytes of data, so it downloads in less than
three minutes over a dial-up telephone line. That's not a lot of
data, but it takes about 40 hours of CPU time on a 550 Mhz Pentium
III computer to crunch it. When my computer is done with the data
processing it makes another call on the Internet to Berkeley,
uploads its results, and downloads a new work unit. So far my
desktop has completed 10 work units.
</P>
<P>
   I run a second copy of SETI(at symbol)Home on my laptop
computer. Now, between my trips, the laptop spends its days
searching the stars. It's about a third as fast as my desktop, but
it has still completed more than 10 work units all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it costs money for me to leave my computers on all
the time. My laptop's power supply draws 82 watts, which translates
to between 5 and 10 cents per day in higher electricity costs. But
that's money that I'm happy to pay to support this scientific
project. Indeed, this nickel-a-day donation is key to the success
of the Berkeley project. Even if Intel or Compaq had donated a
million desktop computers to the SETI project (an unlikely
proposition at best), it is hard to imagine that the Berkeley team
could have risen to money to pay for the electricity, cooling, and
laboratory space those machines would have needed.
</P>
<P>
   To further mobilize the community, the SETI(at symbol)Home
researchers have put together a comprehensive Web site that allows
participants like me to see how their contributions to the effort
stack up against the project as a whole. The Web site reports the
number of work units you have completed, the total time you have
spent crunching data for the project, and the average amount of
time spent per work unit. The Web site further appeals to the
competitive streak that most humans have by allowing individuals to
join together in teams. Schools, clubs, and companies all have
fielded SETI teams. Not surprisingly, the top-ranked teams are at
Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics, where engineers run the
software on some of the world's fastest workstations. Not only is
this great for science, but it's also a not-so-subtle form of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have said SETI(at symbol)Home is a model for
how many science projects requiring massive amounts of computation
will work in the future. Others have taken the idea further, saying
we'll be able to make a few extra dollars by renting out our
computers to corporations, electronically selling cycles to the
highest bidders. I don't think this is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The first barrier is security. Everyone who runs SETI(at
symbol)Home on their computers has put a tremendous amount of trust
in the program's authors. We trust that the astronomical screen
saver isn't doing anything nefarious, like searching for
credit-card numbers or spinning calculations for nuclear weapons.
Likewise, the SETI(at symbol)Home coordinators trust that misguided
pranksters won't modify their programs and make them report false
sightings of ET. It might only take a few such cases to poison the
community spirit that has led more than a million people all over
the world to download and run the SETI software.
</P>
<P>
   A second potential threat is competition. As more of these
parallel computation projects spring up, there will be more and
more competition between them. Clearly, if there are hundreds of
projects like this on the Internet, they all won't be able to get a
million participants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these fears of mine, SETI(at symbol)Home is off to a
wonderful start. And it would be auspicious indeed if the only way
that we could hear ET's call is by working together as a human
race, without national or language barriers separating us.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more about the SETI(at symbol)Home project, and
download the software, by visiting

   CENSUS-INCOME (Washington) _ Lifted by the strong economy, 1.1
million poor Americans rose out of poverty in 1998 and the
percentage of the population still below the official poverty line
fell to 12.7 percent, the lowest level since 1989, the Census
Bureau reported Thursday. The income of the typical household also

   FUNDRAISING-REPORT (Washington) _ Posing a strong challenge,
former Sen. Bill Bradley dealt a sharp setback to the presidential

Gore's $6.5 million, also has more cash in the bank than Gore to
spend on the winter's Democratic presidential primaries. The
fundraising juggernaut of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, meanwhile,
continued to vacuum up donations at a record pace and now has $37

 &HT;    A wardrobe off the web off the web
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3
 &HT;    By Goutami Hyma Mikkilineni
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As each day passes, virtual shopping becomes more of a virtual
necessity. In sprawling metropolises such as Atlanta, the time it
takes to drive to a mall or boutique can exceed the time one has to
shop.
</P>
<P>
   E-tailing for clothes can save you time and money.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to the horizon-broadening nature of the World Wide
Web, shopping online could spare you the embarrassment of arriving
at an event wearing something that somebody else has on.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive Net surfing, we've honed homed in on a handful
of e-tail sites that stand out.
</P>
<P>
   THE SITES
</P>
<P>
   www.bluefly.com
</P>
<P>
   Overview: Bluefly buys designer goods at a discount and claims
to charge its e-customers 35 percent to 40 percent less than
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rear view: Calvin Klein cotton briefs that cost $6.50 or more at
department stores are only $4 per pair from Bluefly.
</P>
<P>
   Obstructed view: All e-tailing entails delayed gratification.
Bluefly offers three delivery options: Standard (three to five
business days for $3.95), two-day delivery ($9.95) or overnight
($14.95). There's a 90-day grace period for returns, which might
come in handy, because Bluefly doesn't offer ``virtual modeling''
of its merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   www.gap.com
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the divide: This site is eerily similar to Gap stores
themselves. Everything even costs the same. The e-tail advantage is
the wider range of colors and sizes available online. Filling the
void: Given that there's no chain with more outlets and no easier
store to shop at than the Gap, a Web site seems like overkill. If
there were a price advantage to shopping the Gap online, this site
would be more useful. As it is, it acts as one huge advertising
vehicle. Gap fanatics, delve right in.
</P>
<P>
   Perk up: This site makes gift-giving easy. Once you enter loved
ones' birth dates, for example, the site reminds you to place an
order on time. Shipping is fast and the delivery cost is nominal.
</P>
<P>
   www.clinique.com
</P>
<P>
   Bonus time: Can't find your favorite shade of Clinique makeup at
the nearest mall? Log on to this site for the full complement of
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Face time: The site offers tips, demonstrations and previews of
the company's upcoming free gift offers. It also advises online
shoppers to visit a Clinique counter instead of the site if they're
not sure what they want. Good advice, because if the tint on your
computer screen is off, you could wind up purchasing a very wrong
shade of eyeliner. But if you're looking for new supplies of old
favorites, have at it.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time: Unless you pay extra shipping costs, it's going to
take a week to get your makeup.
</P>
<P>
   www.lancome.com
</P>
<P>
   More than skin deep: This site is gorgeous, with arguably the
Web's best tips on applying makeup and directions easy enough for
any cosmetics novice to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Pore choices: The dizzying breadth and depth of Lancome's
cosmetics are showcased with exceptional visuals. And the site
offers good advice about coordinating colors.
</P>
<P>
   Lip service: The only letdown is that you can't actually make
purchases from this site. It merely whets your
</P>
<P>
   appetite for the products and lists stores where they're
available. No word on whether they'll be e-tailing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   www.ashford.com
</P>
<P>
   Dollar figures: This site is a must-see for those who like to
dress as if they do all their shopping out of town. Besides items
such as Cartier watches and Louis Vuitton bags, there's also a
``shop'' for vintage apparel. If price is no object, point your
mouse here.
</P>
<P>
   Greener pastures: This 6-month-old site's ``boutique'' section
is still under construction. When it's finished, Ashford promises
to offer the most glamorous clothes from the world's fashion
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Handling charges: Ashford doesn't charge for shipping. And why
should it, when it's already charging top dollar for the
merchandise?
</P>
<P>
   www.eoffprice.com
</P>
<P>
   A penny saved: This site rivals Bluefly in the level of savings
offered. Eoffprice claims that its designer clothes are discounted
from 25 percent to 75 percent off manufacturers' suggested retail
prices.The best deal: women's Calvin Klein jeans for $29.50.
</P>
<P>
   Slow credit: The merchandise selection appears limited. And
shipping can be confusing, because this site caters to customers
worldwide. Also, delivery takes from one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Small change: Eoffprice, which offers children's wear as well,
might appeal to parents who dread trotting their offspring to malls
for clothes.

 &HT;    Tobacco town rises from the ashes
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Fla. _ When the shade tobacco business went belly up and
the canning company closed in the 1960s, this little
wide-spot-in-the-road town near Tallahassee just about rolled up
its sidewalks. Nothing much happened for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1984, a renaissance began when Lee Hotchkiss and Keith
Henderson moved their Tallahassee antiques shop to an ivy-covered
brick building at Main Street and Seventh Avenue in the heart of
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;H Antiques became the cornerstone of what is now one of the
Southeast's largest arts and antiques centers. Earlier this month,
Tallahassee Magazine bestowed its Best Antiques Shop award
collectively on all of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Although businesses have come and gone in the past 15 years,
there are nearly 40 antiques shops, galleries, boutiques and cafes,
enough to keep a visitor busy for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the town will be abuzz with the 4th Annual Havana
Bead and Jewelry Festival. And looking even further ahead, Havana
MusicFest 2000 is set for March 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   The town, with a population of 1,500, chugs ahead like the
Little Engine That Could, despite the deaths this year of two of
its biggest boosters: watercolorist Lee Mainella, who founded the
Florida Art Center and Gallery, and Paul Nicholson, founder of the
popular Nicholson Farmhouse Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two pillars of the community,'' says Sandi Beare,
co-owner of Mirror Image Antiques and self-appointed one-woman
visitors bureau. ``They are the type of people who inspire you to
carry on. We would be remiss if we did not continue'' what they
pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Image specializes in antiques, fishing collectibles and
baseball and sports memorabilia. The space also includes the Vault
Art Gallery, inside a 1906 bank vault.
</P>
<P>
   Beare's father, Richard Beare, runs Lord Beare's Gourmet
Specialties in a small pantry in the back of the shop. Among the
dozens of items offered there are English teas, McVitie's Original
Digestion Biscuits, Scott's Porage Oats, clotted cream and frozen
entrees such as Cornish pasties and Scottish beef bridies.
</P>
<P>
   While Havana made its reputation as an art and antiques mecca,
``We are becoming an international design marketplace,'' Beare
says.
</P>
<P>
   Home furnishings abound _ from international finds hand-picked
by Terri Paul in Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, South America,
Mexico and China at Wanderings to plain Amish designs from Amish
Country Oak Furniture and Tarahumana Gardens. There's antique
wicker and old wrought iron patio furniture at Specialty Designs,
child-size wooden furniture made by Davey Edwards at Carole's Doll
Shoppe, and just about anything you might want, new or old, spread
through two buildings and a veranda at the massive Antiques Center.
</P>
<P>
   Little River General Store feels as homey as its name.
Proprietor Rita Love stocks kitchen gadgets, country gourmet foods,
wooden and metal toys (no plastic!), gardening tools, household
cleaning agents, natural health and beauty aids, Woolrich clothing
and much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a froufrou gift shop,'' says Love. ``Everything I
sell is useful and has a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   At H&AMP;H Antiques, where it all started, Hotchkiss and Henderson
help clients select furniture and upholstery from their Norwalk
line. They've expanded from antiques and now offer custom-made
heart pine and cherry reproductions made by local craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday and Sunday, the town is packed,'' says Hotchkiss,
who lives above the store with her business partner. ``People like
it that you're usually dealing directly with the owner of the
store. You get better service.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the H&AMP;H team, Christy Parks-Witt and her family live in the
100-year-old house where she runs her business, the Berry Patch.
The shop not only offers quality antiques, Heirloom lace and a line
of bath and home aromatherapy products, but it welcomes guests to
the Tea Room on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great summer,'' says Parks-Witt. ``We're seeing a
lot of tourists, but the local folks are getting smart and keeping
their money in our county. Tons of people are moving in. Young
couples are buying homes in the historic district. You can raise
your family here. It's more like Mayberry RFD.''
</P>
<P>
   Artist Jay ``Animal'' Williams thrives in the laid-back
atmosphere. ``It's quiet here, and I need that. This really is the
place for an artist to be.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Williams
works at his Laffing Bird Gallery, creating whimsical works of art
_ mirrors, brooches and kaleidoscopes _ from stained glass and
broken china, as well as abstract sculptures in brass, copper,
steel, glass and found objects. He is working on an intricate
stained glass ``painting'' of an undersea scene that involves
fitting together hundreds of pieces of glass like a jigaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love people,'' says Williams, who'll chat with visitors no
matter how busy he is. ``A lot of my work has to do with humanity.
I feel alientated by modern culture _ computers, answering
machines. I want some human response in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks away at Havana's Cannery, ownerTrey Morgan
is turning out small batches of his private-label sauces, which
include honey mustard, barbecue and citrus ketchup. The Cannery is
a 31,000-square-foot antiques mall with more than 100 antiques
dealers, plus Rafters Interior Market, Shade restaurant and the
bottling operation. Constructed in 1934, the two-story building was
home to Havana Canning Co. for nearly three decades, followed by
Cal's Tupelo Honey until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spark here,'' says Morgan, a Tallahassean who
purchased the building in 1994. ``It's been here awhile. It's not
an easy business we've picked, but I'm sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan predicts that Havana's best days are yet to come. ``It
takes time. Lee Mainella knew how to do it. He taught me. It's
coming to fruition.''

 &HT;    A puckish comedy just meets its goal
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not much mystery to ``Mystery, Alaska,'' a
by-the-numbers mixture of ``Northern Exposure,'' ``The Mighty
Ducks'' and any small-town comedy-drama about sexual intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   TV whiz David E. Kelley (``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice,''
etc., etc.) co-produced and co-wrote the flick. While it lacks the
tin-eared dialogue of his dumb crocodile-attack movie, ``Lake
Placid,'' ``Alaska'' is a soggy series of bite-size vignettes and
spoon-fed emotions, suitable for commercial breaks _ except for the
addition of raunchy humor and profanity to justify the big-screen
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, it's still pretty watchable. But you know you're
in the land of pandering when a movie's first line includes a big
four-letter word spouted by an adorable tyke to get an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The kid belongs to John Biebe (Russell Crowe), the sheriff of
tiny, snowy Mystery (a made-up locale, created for the film in
Alberta, Canada). He's a team member of the revered Saturday Game.
That's the tiny town's main event, a weekly hockey demonstration of
speed and strength on an iced-over pond. When a former local named
Danner (Hank Azaria) writes about the team in Sports Illustrated,
the publicity snowballs (ha-ha) into the chance to play a
promotional match against the New York Rangers of the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the Mysteriosans are willing to take on the pros, at
the risk of their pride. The stern former coach, Judge Burns (Burt
Reynolds), warns the locals to shirk the limelight and cling to
``our dignity and our illusions.'' But we know it's only a matter
of time before these snowbound Davids will do their best to beat
the Gotham Goliaths, not with slings but with hockey sticks.
</P>
<P>
   During this holding pattern until the Big Game, the screen fills
up with your usual lovable small-town eccentrics, including horndog
Skank (Ron Eldard), who's having an affair with Mary Jane (Lolita
Davidovich), who happens to be married to the mayor (Colm Meaney).
Meanwhile, Danner gets all flirty-eyed with John's wife, Donna
(Mary McCormack). The movie piles on jokes about teenage sex in
snowplows, jokes about a drunken driver on a Zamboni, condom jokes,
shovel-upside-the-head jokes and puck-to-the-crotch jokes.
</P>
<P>
   One character has a heart attack, to stir up cheap sentiment,
and you can bet that some old friend will leave a hockey puck on
his grave as a show of love.
</P>
<P>
   When Crowe, who is fine in a brooding, low-key role, has to
deliver the eulogy at the dead man's funeral, he rallies the crowd
with the assertion, ``We're a hockey town.'' You might find
yourself wondering, well, what the heck else could it be, since ice
is the burg's only abundant commodity?
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ``Mystery, Alaska'' has a generous spirit. It
loves its cliches and stick figures so much that you almost do too.
It's a safe date movie, because you don't have to pay attention to
know exactly where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the strong cast includes the likes of Maury
Chaikin as the local lawyer, Michael McKean as a corporate
slimeball and Judith Ivey as Reynolds' wife (she has a priceless
comic bit when trying to act calm while her teenage daughter blurts
out details of her budding sex life).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention that Little Richard shows up, and so does
Mike Myers as a sportscaster, maybe as a favor to director Jay
Roach, who helmed both ``Austin Powers'' flicks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds. Rated R
for profanity and sexuality. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers but fairly pleasant David-vs.-Goliath comedy,
on ice.

 &HT;    Elmo-esque antics will tickle the tots
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe if this movie had been ``The Adventures of Elmo in
Groucho-Land.'' If only.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' has nothing to do with
the Marx Brothers. Actually, it has little to do with the usual
brand of Muppet movies (say, this summer's ``Muppets From Space'').
Rather, it's a kind of extended ``Sesame Street'' episode in which
all the characters _ Muppet or otherwise _ who never got much of a
career going outside the show are given their 15 minutes of
big-screen fame. You know: Maria, Big Bird, Bob, Grover, Gordon,
the Count and the rest of the Children's Television Workshop
regulars so many of us grew up with. Thus, for the parental
element, ``Elmo'' has nostalgia going for it, if nothing else
(let's just say that Big Bird has aged better than Bob and leave it
at that).
</P>
<P>
   As for what happens, well, it's pretty much just like the title
says. Little Elmo _ of ``Tickle Me'' Christmas-frenzy fame _ loses
his blankey (that's Elmo-speak for blanket) and has to go to
Grouchland to retrieve it. The trouble is, a meaney named Huxley (a
hammy Mandy Patinkin) has claimed blankey for himself. And there
are other obstacles, such as the vampish Queen of Trash (Vanessa
Williams).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly aimed at a tot audience, ``Elmo'' borrows a trick from
the similarly targeted ``Barney's Great Adventure.'' That is, the
characters on-screen address the audience directly and invite them
to interact with whatever's going on (there's even a track to
encourage the kiddies to applaud, cheer, laugh or whatever). And if
things threaten to get a little too, well, threatening, stalwarts
Bert and Ernie jump in, freeze the action and make reassuring
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, I guess, is to make a truly child-safe movie, and as
far as its intended audience is concerned, ``Elmo'' probably works
just fine. Just don't expect any touches of Muppet madness. This
picture, as the Count would be delighted to note, is strictly by
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo

 &HT;    `Guinevere' is Svengali love story
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, ``Guinevere'' sounds like grist for a grim
feminist diatribe about our culture's wink-wink, nudge-nudge
approval of older man/younger woman pairings. But instead of a
tongue-lashing, writer-director Audrey Wells has delivered a sweet,
rueful, somewhat sorrowing love letter. And her movie is so
achingly perceptive that one can't help but wonder whether it's a
bit autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   Harper Sloane (Sarah Polley from ``The Sweet Hereafter'') is a
bright, well-bred college grad headed to Harvard Law School in the
fall. Which, of course, is nothing less than what her wealthy San
Francisco family expects of her. But Harper also is a sensitive,
complex young woman who's spent too much of her life doing exactly
what her family expects of her. As a result, she lacks
self-confidence and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), the 50-ish scruffy,
ironic photographer at her older sister's wedding. His attention
both flatters and scares Harper. But he seals the deal by (1)
keeping his promise to keep her out of all the family group
portraits, and (2) sending her an exquisite candid shot of herself.
</P>
<P>
   She moves into his artist's loft and becomes the latest in a
long line of ``Guineveres'' _ beautiful yet malleable young things
to whom he can impart the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art and
late-night bull sessions with his opinionated bohemian buddies over
pitchers of beer (among them is a former Guinevere played by Gina
Gershon).
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss Connie as a self-serving lecher who
needs the validation of an adoring young woman by his side.
Certainly that's one aspect of him, one that's made harshly clear
when Harper's mother (Jean Smart) discovers what's going on. This
coldblooded, blue-blood mom delivers a devastating assessment of
Connie that's as cruel as it is, alas, accurate. Having asked him
why he doesn't like women his own age, she answers the question
herself, saying, ``No real woman could ever stand in front of you
with awe in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Sloane can't _ and never will _ see is Connie's odd
selflessness. She doesn't notice or care that her daughter has
blossomed under his tutelage. That she has become more confident,
more certain of her self-worth. Nor can she see that, deep down,
Connie is all too aware of his failings. And of his
ever-more-foolish future. After all, even Warren Beatty settled
down at 60.
</P>
<P>
   The picture loses some steam toward the very end as Harper (and
we) are forced to recognize Connie's diminishing powers. A last-act
gathering of all the Guineveres is more a good idea than a good
scene. And Wells' well-meaning portrait of Connie's aging-radical
cronies is a rainbow coalition cliche.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much wisdom here. And a canny ear. And some
flat-out gorgeous acting. Smart is frighteningly sharp as the
controlling mother; her tell-off scene is a stunner. So is Gershon,
cast as a deflating Cassandra figure to Harper's romantic notions.
The raffishly rumpled Rea _ you know him from ``The Crying Game'' _
hits a perfect balance between rescuer and user.
</P>
<P>
   As for Polley, this is breakthough, Oscar-worthy work. There is
no higher compliment than to say she may remind you of Jodie
Foster. The same wary intelligence and chiseled good looks.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of ``Guinevere'' is a salute to a gallant spirit,
flaws and all. The movie looks back, not in anger, but with a
sadder-but-wiser gratefulness. As Harper says, ``If you're supposed
to learn from your mistakes, Connie was the best mistake I ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley and Jean Smart. Directed by
Audrey Wells. Rated R for strong language and sexuality. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A wry, perceptive and oddly heartbreaking romance.

 &HT;    Visuals pop in Clooney and Co.'s Bush-bashing quest for Saddam's
gold
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Kings'' is set in the war of the stretch limos.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the mostly chin-up heroism of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
this cynical, intentionally ragged movie about the Persian Gulf War
finds U.S. soldiers commandeering Saddam Hussein's pilfered luxury
cars amid their renegade quest to grab stolen Kuwaiti gold. It's
not so much about American bravery as political savagery.
</P>
<P>
   Here, George and Bush are dirty words. A lot of the bitter
fighting is between jaded journalists jockeying for the hottest
story. Never mind that the oil fields are brightly burning and that
Iranian wildlife is paralyzed and dying in thick, black goo. That
was yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   With all its kicky visual posing and dark humor, ``Three Kings''
hankers to be the next war-is-freaky ``Apocalypse Now,'' the next
insanity-reigns ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' the next violence-as-art
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not nearly any of those. But ``Three Kings'' does have
juice. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube portray three
ordinary, bored American soldiers stuck in a base camp in
desert-strewn Iraq while waiting out the high-tech war's inevitable
conclusion. They find a map on an Iraqi prisoner _ let's just say
it's hidden on his person _ that apparently will lead them to
Saddam's stash of stolen Kuwaiti gold bullion worth billions.
</P>
<P>
   They go AWOL in a Humvee into Iraqi territory to find their
shiny treasure. And, in a sort of ``The Magnificent Seven'' twist,
come face to face with anti-Saddam civilians being rounded up,
tortured and executed by Iraqi soldiers. In this movie's mind-set,
these are the same civilians President Bush encouraged to rise up
against Saddam, only to be left behind after America's
chest-beating victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' isn't entirely the contrived
rogues-turned-heroes story you've seen in ``Gunga Din'' or ``The
Dirty Dozen.'' Writer/director David Russell (``Spanking the
Monkey,'' ``Flirting Disaster'') would rather rock the casbah.
Keeping a heavy political hand on the script, Russell
jump-startsthe soundtrack with pop-heavy radio tunes and pumps the
visuals with freewheeling camera pans and zooms. The images are
pointed and sometimes disturbing. Bullet trajectories become slow,
jerky paths to pain. How often do you witness what happens inside
somebody who's taken a slug in the gut?
</P>
<P>
   All three stars are fairly adept at the unskilled bravura of
``Three Kings.'' Clooney plays Special Forces Capt. Archie Gates
with the trademark icy coolness that worked so well in last year's
``Out of Sight.'' As Sgt. Troy Barlow, a young, impressionable Army
Reserve soldier plucked from his family to wage the good fight,
Wahlberg evokes a credible mix of nerve and naivete. And as Staff
Sgt. Chief Elgin, an airport baggage handler in Detroit when he's
not toting military firearms, Ice Cube subtly bolsters the group's
emerging sense of morality.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the film's persistent, crazed comic relief, Nora
Dunn, as a driven TV journalist, Jamie Kennedy (``Scream''), as her
wacked-out military escort, and Spike Jonze, as an unschooled
redneck private, are all believably goofy.
</P>
<P>
   This Gulf War is combat littered with human suffering and the
immense booty of Kuwait _ cell phones, coffee makers, jewels, gold
bars and those long, long limos.
</P>
<P>
   What is war good for? In the unkept promises so bitterly
displayed in ``Three Kings,'' absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. Written and
directed by David Russell. Rated R for graphic war violence,
profanity and sexuality. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A sardonic, rock-'em, sock-'em Gulf War flick.

 &HT;    Smart as a whip: Role in `Guinevere' a stunner
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I'm married, or I couldn't get another
date,'' Jean Smart says with a gravelly laugh. ``Except maybe
masochists.''
</P>
<P>
   She's talking about her small but devastating role in the
independent film ``Guinevere.'' She plays Deborah Sloane, wealthy
San Francisco mother of 20-year-old Harper (Sarah Polley), a young
woman who falls for the charms _ sexual, artistic and intellectual
_ of a 50-something photographer named Connie (Stephen Rea).
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the movie, a hit at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, Deborah turns up unexpectedly at Connie's loft and sizes
up this Svengali figure with a mix of honesty and venom that stops
the film cold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Smart's only scene in the movie, but it's a triumph of
intense acting. Atlanta Constitution movie critic Eleanor Ringel
Gillespie and the New Yorker's David Denby have both singled out
the scene as a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually went quite smoothly,'' she says about shooting the
confrontation, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. ``Stephen has
this great sense of humor, and Sarah has so much going on inside,
plus those big eyes of hers _ I felt awful every time I looked at
her. It was like whipping a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the character of Deborah, Smart, 40, adds, ``She's a
very smart lady, and she's very witty, but it's sad when you see
that combined with anger and disappointment and rage. So much of it
spills over onto her daughter. It's almost as if she's an
alcoholic. It's satisfying to her, but she can't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that attracted her to ``Guinevere'' was the movie
``The Truth About Cats &AMP; Dogs,'' starring Janeane Garofalo and Uma
Thurman. It was written by ``Guinevere'' writer-director Audrey
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had always been one of my all-time favorite romantic
comedies,'' Smart says. ``It wasn't typical and it wasn't cliched.
I loved the fact that for once, the leading lady (Garofalo) was the
one who was shorter, darker, heavier, funnier and smarter, and the
sidekick was the physically perfect one.'' In other words, a
reversal of the usual Hollywood formula.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that Smart delivers the movie's key
dramatic moments, since she's just as well-known for comedy,
whether in ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (as a dipsomaniacal neighbor)
or playing Charlene Frazier Stillfield for five seasons of
``Designing Women,'' the sitcom set in Atlanta but filmed in Los
Angeles. (Smart actually has been to Atlanta, performing in
Christopher Durang's ``A History of the American Film'' at the
Alliance Theatre in the early '90s.)
</P>
<P>
   Ask her which she prefers playing, comedy or drama, and it's a
draw. ``It's like asking what do you like best, chocolate or steak?
Well, both. If I had to choose one to do exclusively, maybe I would
choose drama, only because it might be good therapy _ you get all
of that stuff out of your system.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, her next two movies are comedies: In one, called
``Tiara Tango,'' she plays an ex-Texas beauty queen, with Robert
Wagner as her ``out-of-work, alcoholic, lounge-lizard singer
boyfriend.'' Then there's the Chevy Chase movie ``Snow Day.'' She
quips, ``I get to be the good mommy in that one.'' (In real life,
Smart is a mother herself, with a 9-year-old son.)
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know what her next project is, but she hopes it's
the next movie based on a Wells screenplay. ``I'm praying to the
gods and lighting candles for Audrey's next movie, which she really
wants me to do,'' Smart says. ``But she's not directing that one.
So I'll just have to charm the socks off the director.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, with a laser-sharp performance like the one she gives in
``Guinevere,'' scare their socks off. ``Now I'm thinking, `Oh my
God, nobody's gonna want to work with me,''' she says with a laugh.
``Her treatment of Mr. Rea in that scene is a little scary, and I
hope people know I'm just acting.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo
</P>
<P>
   in Grouchland'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elmo
</P>
<P>
   (voice by Kevin Clash), Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of extended episode of ``Sesame Street,'' this movie is
recommended to the very, very, very young. Essentially, little Elmo
(voice by Kevin Clash) must go to Grouchland to rescue his blanket
from a meanie named Huxley (a hammy Mandy Patinkin.) Vanessa
Williams appears as the Queen of Trash. Fill in your own joke.
(ERG)1 hour,10 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' Not rated, but the theme may be
</P>
<P>
   too mature for children.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere
</P>
<P>
   and Beatrice Romand.
</P>
<P>
   Magali (Beatrice Romand), a widowed Frenchwoman in her mid-40s,
becomes the object of matchmaking by her best friend and by the
young woman who's dating Magali's son. By being sympathetic to and
ironic about the simple fact that seeking out romance reduces us
all to cringing adolescents, director Eric Rohmer, almost 80,
imparts wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour,
52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''(Bob Longino)1 hour, 37 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner
</P>
<P>
   and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea,
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Polley and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG) 1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM)1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (fantasy action and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) At metro theaters. 1 hour,
24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' PG-13 (violence and disturbing images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a Polish Jew who inspires his neighbors in
a Nazi-controlled ghetto by pretending to own a radio that's
broadcasting news of German defeat. While you'll be grateful that
Williams avoids his mawkish, laughter-through-tears routine, you
keep wanting him to do something memorable. Ultimately, it's what a
film like this should never be: dull. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Minus Man'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Owen Wilson
</P>
<P>
   and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   Not many pluses. An affable drifter (Owen Wilson) moves to a
small town and insinuates himself into the lives of the residents.
Trouble is, he's also a serial killer. The idea of a compulsive
killer as a freaky cipher who, if anything, seems too normal is
intriguing, but the film is as flat and affectless as Wilson's
performance. After a point, you kind of hope Wilson will kill
again, just to pick things up. (ERG)1 hour, 55 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' R (profanity, sex-related images,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lee and Alfre Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan delivers a sunny, low-key
crowd-pleaser about a therapist named Mumford (Loren Dean) whose
effect on his clients changes the mood of their whole town (also
called Mumford). With a crack supporting cast, it's a gentle
vacation from the high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs found
elsewhere in the multiplex. (SM)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to an
honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers but fairly pleasant David-vs.-Goliath comedy,
on ice. Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds star in TV wiz
David E. Kelley's tale of small-town hockey lovers taking on the
New York Rangers. The movie piles on raunchy jokes and is a soggy
series of bite-sized vignettes and spoon-fed emotions. For all
that, it's still pretty watchable. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes.C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert Carlyle,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   A highwayman movie that stands well enough but doesn't always
deliver. In 18th-century London, a common thief (Robert Carlyle)
and a fallen gentleman (Jonny Lee Miller) team up to rob the rich
and give to themselves. Liv Tyler is lovely but listless as the
love interest. The movie is visually stylish but lacks the kind of
panache that made ``The Mask of Zorro'' so much fun. (ERG)1 hour,
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content
</P>
<P>
   and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Town'' R (profanity, drug content, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ally Sheedy,
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Arquette and John Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Co-writer/director Allison Anders and Kurt Voss' pointed but
affectionate satire of the world of rock 'n' roll showbiz. They
introduce us to a loosely connected group of has-beens, wannabes

leaves you wanting more, and that's rare. (SM)1 hour, 32 minutes.

<P>
   Sometimes, cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B

<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's stolen
Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B

</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a
strange pas de trois. Exploring themes of love and loneliness, the
movie suggests that sometimes, wholeness can only be found by
letting go. (ERG)1 hour, 45 minutes. A-

   ``Wolves'' Not rated

<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps, Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>

   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM) 1 hour, 46 minutes. B

 &HT;    A tale of highwaymen for die-hard romantics
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so some of us are suckers for highwaymen movies. Even so-so
ones like ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane.''
</P>
<P>
   This British import attempts to capitalize on the enormous
stateside success of ``Trainspotting'' by re-teaming two of its
stars: Robert Carlyle (who's since become even better known for
``The Full Monty'') and Jonny Lee Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1748. Plunkett (Carlyle), an apothecary turned
thief, and Macleane (Miller), a gentleman fallen on hard times,
meet in London's Newgate Prison. A partnership is formed. Macleane,
leaning on his posh upbringing, chats up aristocrats at their own
parties and finds out who's the most loaded (financially and
alcohol-wise). Then he and Plunkett pick off the unlucky victim on
his way home. Their courteous manner earns them a certain amount of
public support, but Mr. Chance (Ken Stott), the corrupt and
sadistic Thief Taker General, wants their heads. He has political
ambitions that can be furthered only by seeing these bandits
swinging from the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jake Scott (son of Ridley, as in ``Blade Runner''
and ``Thelma &AMP; Louise''), the movie has an attention-grabbing
visual style. Either way, the dark, saturated tones at times
suggest Hogarth's etchings of the period. Plus, the decidedly
nonperiod soundtrack creates an anachronistic juxtaposition that's
eerie one moment, jarring the next. A strained minuet done to a
techno beat suggests the vampire's ball in Roman Polanski's ``The
Fearless Vampire Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   What the film lacks, alas, is a similar sense of style when it
comes to its characters and dialogue. We're supposed to take
Plunkett and Macleane as kind of Gen X versions of Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid (as incarnated '60s-style by Paul Newman and
Robert Redford). But the picture is so busy laying on the London
fog and the eat-the-rich grotesques that we barely get to know them
as individuals, much less as unlikely friends.
</P>
<P>
   Far too many scenes are devoted to a romance between Macleane
and ``fiery'' Lady Rebecca (a listless but lovely Liv Tyler) that
never sparks. (Maybe he should've tried animal crackers on her
belly a la ``Armageddon.'') Meanwhile, Carlyle is left with nothing
to do. This is a terrible mistake given that he's not only the best
actor on this screen but his is also the most intriguing character
_ a sort of common-man hero with no use for upper-class twits,
aside from robbing them of their valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Also wasted is Alan Cumming (Broadway's ``Cabaret''), playing an
extravagant yet likable fop who, as he says, ``swings every way.''
He also, from certain angles, looks remarkably like Pee-wee Herman
in a frock coat.
</P>
<P>
   So give ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' a chance if lines like ``Stand
and deliver!'' or ``The moon was a ghostly galleon'' get your blood
going. Just remember, this movie stands, but it doesn't always
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane''

 &HT;    `Sugar Town' a sweet destination
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More minor-key ballad than arena-rock anthem, ``Sugar Town'' is
co-writer and director Allison Anders' and Kurt Voss' pointed but
affectionate satire of the world of rock 'n' roll show biz _
emphasis on the biz side.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers introduce us to a loosely connected group of
has-beens, wannabes and hangers-on in the recording studios, aqua
pools and granola-crunchy reaches of Hollywood's peaks and valleys.
While the territory has been covered more sharply, from the
film-industry side, in Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' ``Sugar
Town'' doesn't waste time or linger too long. It leaves you wanting
more, and that's rare.
</P>
<P>
   The large cast includes Eva
</P>
<P>
   (Rosanna Arquette), a second-tier actress who's reached the
dread age when she's being cast as Christina Ricci's mother, and
hubby Clive (John Taylor of Duran Duran), a once famous 1980s rock
star whose waning popularity doesn't keep groupies from showing up
in their driveway at all hours. Including one ashram refugee who
dumps an angry kid named Nerve (Vincent Berry) on the doorstep,
claiming he's Clive's son.
</P>
<P>
   Clive is trying to kick-start his career by joining forces with
two other last-decade wonders, Nick (Michael Des Barres of Power
Station) and Jonesy (Martin Kemp of Spandau Ballet), who now gets
by selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the casting of actual '80s rockers is partly a gimmick, but
their presence gives ``Sugar Town'' a bittersweet verisimilitude
that enriches it.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix: Ally Sheedy as Liz, a neurotic production
designer trying to find happiness through massage, martial arts and
men; John Doe as a session player tempted away from his loving,
pregnant wife while touring with a Latin singer (Lumi Cavazos of
``Like Water for Chocolate''); Beverly D'Angelo, in a hilarious,
dragon-lady turn as an alcoholic matron willing to invest in a band
under very specific conditions; and newcomer Jade Gordon as Gwen, a
sexy sociopath who will do anything to get ahead, whether lie,
cheat, barter her body or even steal from a friend who's about to
OD.
</P>
<P>
   Anders (``Grace of My Heart'') and Voss met in college and
collaborated on the low-budget drama ``Border Radio,'' about the
L.A. punk scene. They know the music territory, and it shows in the
mix of amused disbelief and forgiveness they bring to their
observations. It's insidery, but not snide.
</P>
<P>
   As the plot lines weave together, you may find yourself
expecting the movie to arrive at a specific message. That's not the
point. Like a piece of music, ``Sugar Town'' balances themes,
motifs, harmonies and dissonances. It's like a pop song for the
eyes, something you hear from a passing car radio _ catchy and
brief, not at all profound, but liable to bring a smile to your
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Town''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ally Sheedy, Rosanna Arquette and John Taylor. Rated R
for strong language, drug content and sexuality. 1 hour, 32
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A minor-key Hollywood satire that leaves you wanting more.

 &HT;    With her rock star days long gone, singer Ronstadt prefers
keeping things simple
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You won't see Linda Ronstadt's story on VH1's ``Behind the
Music'' anytime soon. No boxed set of her four-decade career or
graying reunion tour with her former backup band, the Eagles. As
shocking as it may seem to the millions of fans who made her the
queen of California country-rock in the 1970s, when she warbled
such honey-powered hits as ``Blue Bayou'' and ``You're No Good,''
Ronstadt says she gladly _ no, ecstatically _ dropped out of the
pop mainstream. And she has no desire to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll is the least authentic thing I ever did,'' she
says bluntly, calling from her publicist's office in New York. ``It
was unbearable. I was unhappy onstage and unhappy performing. I
never felt happy. I never felt like a basic part of me was being
expressed. It's just a tiny part of my personality. I didn't love
it like other people did. It seemed a little junky even when I was
a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. This is Linda Ronstadt talking? With her darkly beautiful
looks and rich alto voice, the singer probably got more young women
to listen to pop radio in the Me Decade than just about any other
female artist. She sold millions of records, took home a passel of
Grammy Awards and had a who's who of guitar-slinging rocker
boyfriends along the way. Country diva Trisha Yearwood says the
only reason she's in the business is that Ronstadt's big sound
compelled her to sing into a hairbrush as a kid. There's hardly a
young country female vocalist, from gutsy Terri Clark to tiny
Martina McBride, who doesn't credit Ronstadt's early, hippie-tinged
forays into twang for making the genre alluring and hip to an
entire generation of women who didn't favor beehive hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling the plugs
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very, very successful blending the pop-rock and the
country stuff,'' observes Bob Bailey of Atlanta oldies station Fox
97. ``She sort of took her career in a lot of different directions:
the Broadway thing, the Spanish-language album. But I think it is
that '70s success that people remember most.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the 53-year-old vocalist, who makes a rare live
appearance Sunday at Symphony Hall with duet partner Emmylou Harris
to promote their new ``Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions'' album,
considers herself retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't perform very much and don't tour very much,'' Ronstadt
says unapologetically. ``I made a real concerted effort to stop it
since I turned 40. First, I stopped singing in English. Then I
stopped touring, then I stopped recording in English. I did come
back and make two more (English-language albums), but all during
that I wanted a life and a home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what she got in the early 1990s. Fed up with the
superficial demands of the entertainment business, Ronstadt moved
home to Tucson, Ariz., where she adopted two children and focused
her energies on getting back to basics. First she threw out her
vinyl album collection, including even the Rolling Stones records
(off which she had one of the most popular cover hits of her
career, the raunchy ``Tumbling Dice''). Then she pulled the plug on
the television, the VCR, the CD player, the dishwasher and even the
touch-tone telephone. She hangs clothes out on the line and listens
only to National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took out everything in my house that blinked except for the
children,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who have seen the Ronstadt-Harris show in other cities
say that Ronstadt indeed seems to approach the stage with the
casualness of someone who's just come in from the garden. In
Phoenix, she wore rolled-up bluejeans, a denim shirt and clogs.
She's heavier than the days when she posed in Daisy Duke
short-shorts for album covers, but she seems much happier.
</P>
<P>
   Memories for a generation
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is so unkind to music,'' she says. ``My whole life I've
tried to stay off of it. It's too narrow a sound band, and the
image with the little square box just defeats everything. TV became
so influential in trying to dispense our music, but it's like
dipping a gourd into a vat of kerosene. The music had to be altered
to go through the medium, and it was the undoing of pop music in
this culture. It destroyed regionalism, subtlety, anything that
wasn't mass-produced.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album with Harris, with whom Ronstadt has collaborated
since they made ``I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You)''
in 1975, is a low-key exploration in which the pair weave their
harmonies around many sounds and styles. Recorded at the Arizona
Inn in Tucson, the album is much less country than the duo's work
with Dolly Parton. It drifts toward the more experimental,
featuring material from writers such as Patty Griffin, Sinead
O'Connor and Leonard Cohen. The title track was penned by Rosanne
Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt usually tosses in one or two gems during the live show.
Sometimes it's ``Heart Like a Wheel''; sometimes it's ``It Doesn't
Matter Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Steve Harris, who is bringing the duo to Symphony Hall,
says he feels that Ronstadt has ``gotten back to music that is her
calling,'' and that's the attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (people in the audience) are there to hear the kind of
songs they grew up with,'' Harris says. ``These were superstars in
the old days, seen minimally at the Fox or Chastain. To see them in
a 2,000-seat room is a treat. When we announced the show, my
attorney called me four times wanting tickets. The fans have got
the enthusiasm back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly memories of sweet, granola rock that sent
49-year-old Bert Kelley of Buckhead to stand in line at Symphony
Hall the morning tickets went on sale. The show sold out within
hours, with many seats going to middle-aged fans who abandoned live
music years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been to a concert in 20 or 25 years,'' Kelley says.
``I remember swearing them off in my 20s because of the crowds and,
unless you had tremendous seats, you couldn't see anything. But
when I opened up the paper and saw that picture of Linda and
Emmylou together at Symphony Hall, it just did something to me. I
played these two women's albums over and over again. ``Silver
Threads and Golden Needles,'' ``Don't Cry Now.'' As a young, single
woman, their music spoke to me. I don't even have any of the albums
anymore, and it's made me want to go out and get all their CDs.''

 `FAITH OF MY FATHERS': STANDING HUMBLY BEFORE A McCAIN FAMILY(EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appearance of Sen. John McCain's ``Faith of My Fathers''
seems to have been timed to the unfolding presidential campaign in
which McCain, an Arizona Republican, is a candidate. But this book
is not your typical campaign autobiography, and this is because
McCain has not had the experience of your typical candidate.
</P>
<P>
   His book, which centers on his seven years as a prisoner of war
in Vietnam, is a testament to the martial values of honor and
patriotism. It is also a record of McCain's struggle to live up to
the expectations passed down from generation to generation in a
family that has served in the armed forces since before the
Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides admiring portraits of his grandfather, John
McCain Sr., and his father, John McCain Jr., both of whom were
four-star admirals in the U.S. Navy. He tells of his own early
introduction to the martial tradition of his family as well as his
rebellious bottom-of-the-class performance at the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the centerpiece of this book is McCain's account of his
years of imprisonment, during which he and his fellow POWs fought
against the determined effort of the enemy to take away their
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his straightforward recitation of those nightmare
years, McCain remains a model of modesty, giving credit for greater
bravery to others who, he says, endured more than he did and showed
greater powers of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But if he never presents himself as a hero _ and he does not
conceal what he regards as his one terrible moment of capitulation
to his captors _ it is impossible to read this book without
realizing that a hero is what he is.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a review of a book, not a man, and thus the question
remains: Has McCain written a good book? Certainly ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' which McCain wrote with his legislative assistant, Mark
Salter, is lively and readable. One learns a good deal about the
character and philosophy of this presidential candidate, although
one learns pretty much nothing about his current political program
or of his life, private or public, since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's book is in this sense a modest achievement of both the
autobiographical and the prison-writing genres. Almost everything
before the chapters on the POW experience seems like a sketchy
preface. The story of his imprisonment is vivid and concrete and
ought to be read, but McCain has written of it with terse
effectiveness before.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with a memorable family scene: his father and his
grandfather meeting on the bridge of a submarine tender in Tokyo
Bay right after the Japanese surrender. In his first several
chapters he summarizes their careers and provides affectionate
sketches of them, complete with testimonials from others. He cites,
for example, a radio commentator who declared his grandfather ``one
of the world's greatest carrier task force commanders, an
outstanding example of American manhood at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain does not want only to express admiration of his father
and grandfather but to explicate what he sees as both a privilege
and a burden. ``The relationship of a sailor and his children is,
in large part, a metaphysical one,'' he writes. ``By your father's
calling, you are born into an exclusive, noble tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says that noble tradition required him to live up to a
standard of courage set by the father and grandfather who went
before him. During one moment, after enduring savage beatings that
continued for days, McCain tape-records a phony confession that is
used in North Vietnamese propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   He recovers his self-esteem after that moment, which he sees as
a failure, a weakness; but nothing seems more important to him than
his father's laconic absolution of him for it. ``You did the best
you could, John,'' his father tells him after his release. ``That's
all that's expected of any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's father was the commander of all U.S. forces in the
Pacific for many of the years in which his son was a POW, and that
led to a special situation for McCain. When the Vietnamese wanted
to score a propaganda victory by offering to release him ahead of
his jailed comrades, McCain, despite being tortured and badly in
need of medical treatment, refused.
</P>
<P>
   Typically he does not give himself a great deal of credit for
this honorable and courageous stand. Instead he talks about the
inspiration provided by his father and grandfather and by the
amazing spirit of resistance demonstrated by the other Americans
held in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered love and honor,'' he writes. ``If you valued
them, and held them strongly, love and honor would endure
undiminished by the passing of time and the most determined assault
on your dignity. And to hold on to love and honor, I needed to be
part of a fraternity. I was not as strong a man as I once believed
myself to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there one wishes for greater specificity and more
openness. It seems coy of McCain, for example, to talk about two
American prisoners in Hanoi who openly sided with the enemy and
received privileges in return without giving their names. He talks
glowingly about the steadfastness of his wife, Carol, who raised
his three children alone while he was imprisoned, but he does not
even mention that the two were divorced after his return, and that
he remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain's description of what he and his fellow prisoners
endured is gritty and moving. He shows admirable restraint here. He
tells us about being regularly beaten or of having his arms roped
and pulled behind him and left that way overnight, but he does not
ask us to share his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Early on he says that if you haven't been a POW yourself, it is
impossible fully to understand what it was like. That is certainly
true. Yet one can understand a pithy something about it thanks to
this restrained and honest account.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As is almost always the case in the culture wars, the
event that provokes the skirmish turns out to be much less
entertaining and far less significant than the political fight it
kindles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation,'' the survey of work by young British artists,
finally opens to the public Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
two years after it was on view in London. Normally that would make
the show old news in the New York art world, where many of the
artists have had gallery shows already.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been impossible for even the Amazing Kreskin to
anticipate that the exhibition would provoke Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
to go so far as to try to evict the museum from its building. But
the failure to predict at least that ``Sensation'' might genuinely
hurt people who are not art insiders, accustomed to what young
artists do, suggests the extent to which the art world is out of
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the debate over the meaning of Chris Ofili's ``Holy Virgin
Mary.'' Like previous debates about the merits of other disputed
art in the culture wars, this one founders on the most basic level
of interpretation. It is as if the argument were being conducted by
people speaking different languages.
</P>
<P>
   We might look on the bright side and see the argument as an
indication of art's allusiveness. Artists intend certain things,
but then their work gains unintended meaning as other people bring
their own assumptions to it. The same work can mean different
things to different people, and in this way it is given new life.
Unfortunately, when the debate becomes as public and angry as the
one over Ofili, it overwhelms the artwork and defines the artist
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The art world should begin by admitting it is elitist. It is cut
off from the rest of the world to the extent that it chooses to be.
Contemporary artists like those in ``Sensation'' expect you to
relate to their work on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   Damien Hirst is a clever artist not because he slices dead
animals and packs them in containers of formaldehyde, but because,
among other reasons, those huge containers, like his cabinets of
pharmaceuticals and his zippy spot and spin paintings, allude
intriguingly to Minimalist sculpture and other '60s art. An
outraged public fixated on the animals themselves becomes a foil
for him. That's the cynical part of the operation. The good part is
that art, as the saying goes, is an equal-opportunity elitist:
anyone who wants to can learn to speak the language.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it helps to see a work before deciding what you think
it means. A pity of the Brooklyn debacle is that even some of the
museum's defenders on First Amendment grounds have said they won't
visit the exhibition because they are sure it will offend them.
</P>
<P>
   Being a poor cousin to the city's big art institutions, the
Brooklyn Museum occasionally may be excused for trying to cook up
gimmicks to entice parochial Manhattanites across the river. But
its fake ``health warning'' for ``Sensation'' (``The contents of
this exhibition may cause shock, vomiting, confusion'') not only
gave ammunition to Giuliani, it cheapened the institution and hurt
the art in the show. If the museum's own advertisement describes
the work as nauseating, is it a surprise that people should assume,
sight unseen, that it is?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some of it is, but not all of it. The show is uneven, like
most big group shows of new art. It includes 40 artists, and with
around 90 paintings, sculptures and installations, many of them
large, it sprawls luxuriously across two upper floors of grand
galleries in the museum, kicking European paintings out of their
usual rooms. A few of the exhibition's works are in other parts of
the museum as well. As theatrical presentations of new art go, this
is one of the most lavishly installed in years, no doubt the most
spectacular visually that the Brooklyn Museum has done.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the galleries do look great. One of them mixes Rachel
Whiteread's famous ``House,'' her big plaster cast of the inside of
a room, with Richard Billingham's glossy tragicomic candid
photographs of his working-class family, unexpectedly linking two
dissimilar artists through the theme of dysfunctional domesticity.
Another gallery puts Gary Hume's stripped-down, eye-popping
abstract paintings, coolly mechanical, beside Hirst's sculpture of
a sliced cow in several large clear containers to stress an equally
clever connection through Minimalist sources.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a sales pitch by the museum that Britain is
producing an unusual number of good young artists at the moment. If
Ms. Whiteread's plaster and rubber sculptures, cast from the
undersides of chairs or the inside of a bathtub as well as a room,
aren't exactly original, they have a somber dignity. Fiona Rae
paints serious, jazzy abstractions. The best work in the exhibition
basically does what all good art should do: It makes you think.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Ofili's art. He has several large pictures in the
show, all of them incorporating elephant dung, one way or another.
They're basically abstract, brightly colored, meticulously made
works of swirling shapes and beautifully stippled surfaces,
throwbacks to '60s psychedelic art, with occasional bits of text
woven into them, conveying a lightness of spirit that has to be
weighed against what his detractors are now saying about him.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Hirst's mischievous sculptures have a buoyancy and
wonderment about them, like the old dioramas at the Museum of
Natural History, which belies their macabre reputation. There are
other artists here who are interesting in different ways, different
being the crucial word: Peter Davies, for instance, who paints
texts about other artists, like hand-written billboards,
obsessively scrawled, that are good one-liners; and Gillian
Wearing, who makes videos that surprise us in ways more memorable
for not being predictable.
</P>
<P>
   But smart though parts of the installation are in making
connections among some of these artists, nothing really ties all
the works in the show together conceptually. They are simply owned
by Charles Saatchi, the London advertising executive who has been
instrumental during the last decade in promoting various '90s
British artists.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's latest strategy for taking over the museum is to
charge that it has conspired with the show's sponsor, Christie's,
to inflate the value of Saatchi's collection. Christie's denies
that it is planning to move the art directly from the museum to the
auction block. These are legal matters for the courts to decide.
But from an art perspective, exhibitions of private collections,
although they have been a staple of museum programming for decades,
raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   If this museum wanted to survey contemporary British art, it
could have organized an exhibition itself. Saatchi was even allowed
to oversee the installation in Brooklyn. Maybe it isn't as crucial
to ask whether taxpayer money should go toward enhancing a
collector's fortune as to ask whether it should go toward art that
some people think is offensive. But it is a question.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the art world can be a depressing place. The other big
art story this week is that Mary Boone, the dealer, was arrested
Wednesday because Tom Sachs, the artist who's having a show in her
gallery, had been distributing live 9 mm cartridges as souvenirs.
Sachs' show features handmade guns and a reproduction of an
airplane toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that a parade of felons had been marching
into Ms. Boone's burnished Fifth Avenue gallery to pick up free
ammunition, and the escalating presence of New York City government
officials policing the art world is ominous.
</P>
<P>
   That said, idiotic art, desperate to provoke a response, gets
shown in big galleries and museums, then everyone else is expected
to defend it on First Amendment grounds when it does. In
``Sensation,'' this means potentially defending works like Marc
Quinn's ``Self,'' his frozen cast of his head made of his own
blood, and Marcus Harvey's portrait of Myra Hindley, the English
murderer of children, made out of hand prints of children, the
painting that caused the biggest ruckus, understandably, when the
show was in London. It also means potentially defending the Chapman
brothers' child mannequins with multiple genitals, and Sarah Lucas'
inexplicably fashionable sculptures using melons, fried eggs and
cucumbers as genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary circumstances, bad art naturally gets sorted out
and disappears. That is how history works when it's left alone to
do its job. The paradox of the culture wars is that they have made
celebrities out of some artists who would otherwise vanish.
Censorship has become a growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the best argument, in the end, for unfettered
freedom of expression.

THE GAME'S UP FOR A PITCHER, A THIEF AND A SUBURBAN DAD

</P>
<P>
   ``What is it with you and heating ducts?'' a Los Angeles police
detective asks Malone (Lawrence), the newly appointed head of the
burglary division. Any time Malone spots a grating around the
precinct house, he wants to rip it open and crawl right in.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Malone really isn't Malone but Logan, a jewel
thief who, while fleeing a compromised robbery situation two years
earlier, taped an $18 million diamond to the ventilation system of
what was then a building under construction and is now the police
station.
</P>
<P>
   To retrieve the stone, he impersonates an officer. After
heroically disarming a suspect who happens to be an old criminal
buddy, he gets promoted and starts his diamond hunt in earnest.
With his past experience, he's highly qualified to lead the
burglary squad.
</P>
<P>
   For example, out at the airport he gives an impromptu primer on
how big thefts are faked to mask bigger drug deliveries. He can
also spot a prison tattoo at 30 paces.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow officers are so impressed that they are reduced to
straight men for Malone's jivey patter. But the diamond hunt is
sidetracked by a drug case. The FBI gets involved. So does a former
associate who wants the rock for himself.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-wreck car and truck chase pulls up at the Mexican
border, which works out well for Malone. By now he has been found
out and needs another lineage. Has he told anybody that he's part
Mexican? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years as a major league pitcher have left Billy Chapel
(Costner) with a sore shoulder, a salary that enables him to stay
in hotel suites that resemble Chenonceaux and the chilly, slightly
patronizing manner of a paragon who will proceed from the Hall of
Fame into American folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's life story unfolds on the day he takes the mound against
the Yankees for the last game of his last season. He's really a
decent fellow, but all the ideals he must uphold in this movie
leave him acting and talking like a wind-up exemplar.
</P>
<P>
   Told by the Detroit owner (Cox) that the game stinks these days,
he replies: ``The game doesn't stink, Wheeler. It's a great game.''
Spoken like a man whose entire life has been devoted to baseball
from the days he pitched to his tall, devoted dad (cut to home
movies), who loved the game as passionately as he loved Billy's
revered mother.
</P>
<P>
   As for Billy's own track record with women, there is his
five-year relationship with Jane (Ms. Preston), an attractive book
editor with a spirited young daughter (Ms. Malone).
</P>
<P>
   After meeting exceedingly cute when her car breaks down, the
pair begin a strange arm's-length affair that consists mainly of
very long periods apart followed by short, intense get togethers
during which there is much anguishing over whether Billy could ever
love her as much as he does the game.
</P>
<P>
   Answering that for herself, Jane takes a great job in London.
But the day she leaves happens to be the day Billy is on the mound
at Yankee stadium and (guess what?) pitching a perfect game. But
that 40-year-old rotator cuff is really hurting.
</P>
<P>
   On cue Billy breaks a sweat and even winces a little. As the
soundtrack rises to a celestial level, the whole country is
watching on the tube _ even Jane, who has put off her flight to
London. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None but Billy bleeds profusely after cutting his
pitching hand with a saw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Billy and Jane grapple in an elevator and make love one
night, though far, far from the camera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Locker-room talk is punctuated with some solid swear
words. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE Billy is a heavy enough drinker to suppose that he
either has a problem now or will have in future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 It's baseball, but there's all the romance stuff
and at 140 minutes this is a major league sit for little ones (and
others). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 The film falls through the cracks for children and
teen-agers. Either the sports will appeal but not the love story or
vice versa. And to some viewers, though not all, developments on
both fronts will seem both overdone and interminable (just throw
the ball, why doesn't he?). &QL;

<P>
   Deep in weirdest suburbia, Lester Burnham (Spacey), who is dead,
relates how it all ended just when he had pulled the plug on his
whole miserable existence and started to make headway as a
liberated man, of all things, with an entirely revamped attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A victim of downsizing at work, he takes a philosophical
approach to the employment situation and gets a job at a fast-food
chain called Smiley. Leave the money-grubbing to his wife, Carolyn
(Ms. Bening), a frantically stressed-out real-estate woman whose
drive to succeed has her so tied in knots she can only sputter
slogans to herself as she barges around town in her sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Sulking at home is their neglected teen-age daughter, Jane (Ms.
Birch), who hates them both and even half-seriously discusses
killing her father with Ricky (Bentley), her boyfriend and
next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled Ricky, who is a drug dealer, shadows everybody and
everything with a video camera. He is also at a dead end with his
father (Cooper), a disturbed Marine colonel who collects Nazi
memorabilia and disciplines his son by beating him up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lester lusts after Jane's teen-age friend Angela (Ms.
Suvari), works out rigorously in his garage, throws crockery around
the dining room and lays down the law. No longer will he be
dominated by his wife and daughter. Lester will just be Lester. But
now Lester is dead. &QL; 
 &QL;

every pore. &QL;

RIGHT BANK IS LURING PARIS DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night two years ago, the Paris antiques dealer
Ariane Dandois recalled, she was at a dinner party, bored stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly I had a flash,'' she said. After owning a gallery for
25 years on the Rue des Saints-Peres, off the Boulevard
St.-Germain, she said she told herself: ``The Left Bank is over for
dealers. Sotheby's has opened on the Faubourg St.-Honore;
Christie's is moving near the Champs-Elysees. I have to move to the
Right Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   She left the party and drove to the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore,
Paris' equivalent of Madison Avenue, lined with embassies, art
galleries, luxury hotels and fashion boutiques like Hermes and
Versace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the middle of the night,'' Ms. Dandois said. ``I drove
up and down, looking for a building for sale.'' She saw one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuitively,'' she said, ``I realized it might be the last
available space on the street for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That night she couldn't sleep. The next morning she told a real
estate agent she wanted to buy it. She had a strong premonition
that it would be sold that day.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. The sale was to close that very day, at noon.
Undeterred, she drove to the site at 11:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to the seller,'' she said, ``and offered $100,000
above the asking price. He said, `Done.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Dandois gallery opens this week at 92 Rue du Faubourg
St.-Honore. The building is one of three on the Place Beauvau, a
square alongside the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore that was
established in 1770, when one of Louis XV's generals built a
mansion amid the district's vegetable gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is a fashionable address, a block from Sotheby's and
across the street from the Elysee Palace, the official residence of
French presidents since 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dandois is in excellent company. One neighbor, Jacques
Perrin, a specialist in fine 18th-century French antiques, is vice
president of France's National Union of Antiques Dealers. He has
spent the last 10 months redoing his own gallery with help from
Francois-Joseph Graf, a well-known Paris decorator who excels at
traditional luxe French interiors.
</P>
<P>
   With yards of brown damask and antique boiseries on the walls,
the new gallery, which reopens this week, looks like a very grand
but comfortable Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor is Aveline, an antiques gallery founded in 1956
that has just moved to the Place Beauvau. It is owned by Jean-Marie
Rossi, an elder statesman of the Paris antiques world who
specializes in art and important continental antiques. Rossi also
hired Graf to design his gallery. The space will not officially
open until late October, although he is already receiving clients
there.
</P>
<P>
   Dandois, Perrin, Aveline _ together with Didier Aaron and
Maurice Segoura, two other respected Paris antiquaires _ cater to
an exclusive clientele. They routinely sell signed palace furniture
for millions of dollars to museums like Versailles and to the most
serious collectors, including the Americans Henry Kravis, Ronald
Perelman, Susan Gutfreund and Anne Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Aaron, who also has a gallery in Manhattan, sells his
most expensive antiques at his Paris gallery, at 118 Rue du
Faubourg St.-Honore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to spend half a million dollars on a Louis
XIV chair made for Versailles,'' he said, ``you would just as soon
travel to Paris, stay at the Ritz and have a wonderful
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   These galleries are also destinations for successful American
designers like Peter Marino, Alan Wanzenberg, Jeffrey Bradfield and
Juan Pablo Molyneux. As Marino said: ``French dealers do their own
thing. Ariane supplies us with forgotten markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her neighbors, Ms. Dandois designed her own space, which
is minimalist and spare. Instead of parquet, the floors are paved
in a pale gray marble from Greece. Instead of damask, the walls are
painted pale taupe with flecks of silver and gold to catch the
light.
</P>
<P>
   A famously stylish woman, Ms. Dandois deliberately chose a cool,
clean modern setting to showcase her Edo screens from Japan, and
her French, Russian, German and northern Italian furniture.
</P>
<P>
   She has an inventory of 1,500 pieces, and though she is known
for 18th- and 19th-century French, Russian, Swedish and Baltic
antiques, she does not specialize in any period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found how wonderful it was not to be limited,'' she said.
``The most amusing thing on earth is to shop. And there are lots of
things to discover. The best part is the research.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had spent days trying to identify two 18th-century
black commodes with simple bronze decorations she had bought. She
finally realized she had seen an identical one in a museum in
Prague.
</P>
<P>
   She is now showing an unusual Italian piece: a circular center
table whose base is carved in the form of a tree trunk, covered by
gilded vines festooned with grapes. The base also has carved paw
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The table is circa 1830 and is similar, she said, to one in the
Getty Museum that Christie's sold in New York in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French think a table like this belongs in a kitchen,
because they don't know about it,'' she said. ``I bought it from a
private house in Turin where it sat in the front hall. It has
grandeur and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The price is $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be original,'' she said. ``I just have
unusual taste.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributes this to her being half Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In her gallery she is showing a pair of overscale carved gray
oak settees, circa 1735, in the manner of the architect William
Kent. They are from Rushbrooke Hall, the seat of the Jermyn family
in Suffolk, England.

WATCHING FOR A BREAKOUT  
 POLLACK GETS AGE-CONSCIOUS  
 SODERBERGH'S DEVELOPMENT  
 SUNDANCE FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>

   &UR;  &LR; HOLLYWOOD _ A lot of eyes are watching the box-office numbers this
weekend. Of course, there are always a lot of eyes watching the
weekend box-office numbers in Hollywood. Sometimes it seems as if
that's all they're watching (that and one another). But this
weekend a lot of people are watching with breath held and something
resembling hope in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' the acid-laced suburban comedy from Sam
Mendes, a first-time movie director, has been among the
best-reviewed films of the year. It opened on just 16 screens in
five cities on Sept. 15 and earned more than $53,000 a screen in
its opening weekend. Originally Dreamworks, the studio distributing
the film, planned to put the movie into wider release on Oct. 1.
Instead, studio officials decided to push it onto more than 400
additional screens on Sept. 22, when it still earned nearly $14,000
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   These are impressive numbers, especially for a film as dark and
hard-to-define as ``American Beauty.'' This weekend it will expand
into more than 200 additional screens. At that point ``American
Beauty'' will have moved beyond the big-city theaters into smaller
cities and outlying suburbs. If it continues to do well, even more
screens will be added into mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the film is working with big-city audiences,'' said
one marketing executive from a rival studio. ``But the question is
whether it will do well in the South and small towns in Ohio and
everywhere, because to be a real breakout hit, you have to do well
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another studio marketing executive said: ``I hope it does make
it. But it's a little early to be handing out gold medals. There
are plenty of cases of movies that started out strong and then
expanded onto more screens and died. This could turn out to be a
$35 million movie, or it could be a $75 million movie. It's too
early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this weekend another offbeat, independent-minded studio
production _ David Russell's Gulf War film, ``Three Kings,''
starring George Clooney _ will be released by Warner Brothers. It
is unusual for major studios like Warners and Dreamworks to release
films like ``American Beauty'' and ``Three Kings,'' both of which
have more of the feel of an independent movie. And that's why so
many people in Hollywood are interested in seeing how they do,
along with another forthcoming studio film with an independent
sensibility, David Fincher's ``Fight Club,'' coming out of 20th
Century Fox on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very interested in seeing if these movies do well,
especially `American Beauty,''' said one director who was busy with
the release of his own fall movie. ``If it does well and makes a
lot of money, it's going to be a very good thing for all
filmmakers, especially those interested in making sophisticated
films for sophisticated audiences, instead of the latest
high-concept or teen-gimmick thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Youth
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Pollack, who has been making movies since ``The Slender
Thread'' in 1965, is also interested in what older, more
sophisticated moviegoers are going to see this fall. His newest
film, ``Random Hearts,'' with Harrison Ford and Kristen
Scott-Thomas playing a cop and a congresswoman thrown together when
they discover their spouses had an affair, is opening on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gotten truly excited about something and had them
say, `Sydney, my boy, no, we can't make this movie because it
doesn't appeal to the youth market,''' Pollack said. ``That hasn't
happened to me. Yet. I still believe there are exceptions to that
youth rule, at least I hope there are. I think 35- or 40-year-old
people are hungry for mature entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that have changed in the 34 years he has been
making movies, Pollack said, is how ``economics have started to
color everything.'' Several of his films _ he named ``Jeremiah
Johnson'' and ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' _ probably
couldn't be made today, he said, ``largely because it's just a
different marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Young moviegoers, who have always been important to the film
business but are even more important today, seem to want to see
movies with young people in them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first knee-jerk reaction for a 23-year-old couple on a
date is to go see a movie about 25-year-olds,'' he said. ``But I
still believe there are exceptions. At least, I hope there are.''
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Matter of Structure
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to figure out what you're good at, because at
the beginning you think you can do anything,'' Steven Soderbergh
said.
</P>
<P>
   This director was slowly working his way through a sandwich
during a break in the marketing mania of the recent Toronto
International Film Festival. Soderbergh was at the festival, as he
had been at Cannes earlier in the year, with his film noir ``The
Limey,'' about a British thug who comes to Los Angeles to find out
who killed his daughter and makes rather nasty work of a bunch of
Hollywood types. The star of the film, Terence Stamp, was seated at
a nearby table. (``During the filming, Steven evoked feelings in me
that hadn't been evoked since I worked with William Wyler,'' Stamp
had said earlier. ``You could just tell, with both of them, that
they absolutely knew what they were doing.'')
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, who began his career as a film-festival darling with
``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' and whose last film, ``Out of Sight,''
was chosen by several critics' groups as the best of 1998, has been
able to bounce back and forth between the studio and the
independent worlds. While ``The Limey'' is an independent effort,
to be distributed by Artisan Entertainment, his next movie, ``Erin
Brockovich,'' will be made for Universal with Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh said that only now, after eight films, did he feel he
understood his strengths and limitations as a director. This has
led him to take more of an interest in the structure of his films,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished `Out of Sight,' I wanted to do something right
away,'' he said. ``I had a buzz. I was energized. I wanted to work
again immediately. And I wanted to make a movie set in Los Angeles,
but one without the usual visual cliches of L.A. movies. I was
having all of these ideas about structure. I had this idea about
playing around with how the meaning of an image can shift through
repetition, how it begins to have a different meaning as the film
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``The Limey'' had, he said, was a simple story line with
well-defined, easy-to-understand characters that allowed him to
take chances with time shifts and nonlinear storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the simplicity of the through line that makes it work,''
he said. ``Otherwise you'd have people saying, `Huh, what's going
on?' It could get ugly.''

 HOLLYWOOD: get ugly.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For ``The Limey,'' Soderbergh adopted a new way of shooting his
scenes, which he retained on ``Erin Brockovich.'' He watches
through the camera while the scene is being shot. Many people think
that's how all directors work, but they don't. There has been a
growing distance between the director and the set, often with the
director parked in a tent many yards away, watching the proceedings
on video monitors. Soderbergh said he tried that approach and
thought it was counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look through the camera because it is bringing me as
close to the movie as is humanly possible,'' he said. ``It's
literally like seeing the film while you are shooting. And I truly
believe that the energy of the set needs to be directed to where
the camera is pointing, not diffused between the set and some tent
nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamp said the technique had an extraordinary effect on his
performance. ``Steven could sometimes whisper directions to me
while we were in the middle of a scene, while I was still in the
moment,'' he said. ``It was so intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy Indeed
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn, who appeared in Soderbergh's ``Out of Sight,'' was
also at the Toronto festival, as he had been at the Sundance
festival earlier in the year, promoting his latest comedy, Mark
Illsley's ``Happy, Texas,'' in which he plays a supremely dimwitted
convict who is forced to pose as a beauty pageant coordinator in a
small Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   The film emerged as one of the favorites at Sundance in January,
but there was some grumbling about how Zahn and his co-star, Jeremy
Northam, were cast as straight guys pretending to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is when you're meeting a new director,
sometimes you try to test each other,'' Zahn said. ``But in this
case we hit it off immediately, and we agreed that we should not
play these characters as over-the-top or flamboyant when they're
pretending to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes have been trimmed from the film and some extra
looping of dialogue added since Sundance, Zahn said, but it was
mostly little bits and pieces lost and additions for clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Zahn said he was drawn to ``Happy, Texas'' by the richness of
the comedy, even down to the smallest roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people are doing movies just to do movies,'' he said.
``But here was a case where people were doing it because they
really thought it was a good movie. You know, it's become a pastime
for Americans to make fun of people, to laugh at people. A lot of
the comedy now is about making fun of someone. I loved this because
it wasn't like that. It was laughing at something that's a real
story. You'd be surprised how rarely you see scripts like that.''

SPOTLIGHTING A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL TRUX: ``Veterans of Disorder'' (Drag City).
</P>
<P>
   Rock may be losing its sense of confusion. Easily sorted into
camps and sounds these days, and into both the mainstream and the
substreams, the music is more calculated than ever to make you feel
a certain way, happy or sad, or angry or obnoxious. So it's nice to
hear the eighth Royal Trux album and think one more time, What on
earth are these people up to?
</P>
<P>
   This duo, Jennifer Herrema and Neil Hagerty, started out making
murky collage records in the late '80s; they made the listener work
hard to get close to them. Slowly they began to favor
straightforward rock songcraft with unusual details, made a couple
of major-label records and more recently circled back to some of
their old, opaque ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans of Disorder'' combines these approaches in a record
that's alternately beautiful and awful, but at least it's trying
desperately for something ... something ... well, something.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herrema, who just wheezes and snarls when she travels
outside a narrow pitch range, sounds like Janis Joplin with a
throat condition. Hagerty, a versatile instrumentalist, sings, too,
playing guitar riffs that you might have heard out of the window of
a hand-me-down gas guzzler in a suburban parking lot in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded with various accomplices, the album's a mixed message:
bored and cantankerous like the Rolling Stones but also full of
old-fashioned electronic sounds that woof up out of the mix and
abrupt snip-offs at the end of each song that undermine a sense of
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Trux's production sound is so jarring and alien _ with so
much bleeding of sound, layering of tracks, hill-and-dale dynamics
and deliberate gunk _ that its skill at making records is quite
naturally underrated. Whoever hears the band feels queasy at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans of Disorder'' starts with ``Waterpark,'' a great riff
tune; you think you're going to hear an album of Detroit-style hard
rock.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the rest of the record brings droning stomps; chants
like ``Shake off that second skin'' and ``Yo se!''; an
unlistenable, out-of-tune song with a habanera rhythm called
``Lunch Money''; an intriguing tape-edit work with chimes, tea
kettles and Ms. Herrema yelling the numbers 1 through 30, and a
fairly beautiful, serene nine-minute song at the end called ``Blue
Is the Frequency,'' a song for driving into a California sunset,
with a long guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short record, and there's much to pay attention to. Royal
Trux performs Friday night at the Cooler, in Manhattan.

   Collectivizing the farm turned out to be a rotten idea, Jessie
the dog lets us know at the start of ``Animal Farm,'' TNT's
stylish, shrewd but oddly unengaging version of Orwell's classic.
Barely mentioned in the book, here Jessie is its melodious-voiced
narrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a storm of judgment,'' she says as the camera roams
over the lush, rain-ravaged countryside and she recalls how the
rebellious animals took control of the farm, only to have their
socialist dreams destroyed by a megalomaniac leader, a pig named
Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing Jessie's role and making the story her flashback were
among the film's wisest ideas. Julia Ormond gives her a voice that
is affecting and maternal. It could be called human except humans
are among the villains here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we had been hiding from oppression, hiding from
Napoleon's spies,'' Jessie says. Her tone of sad retrospection
makes sense, for she is telling us what history already has.
Orwell's fable, after all, lost its political urgency long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1945 as a warning against Stalin's repressive
control of the Soviet Union, ``Animal Farm'' had a hard time seeing
print in the post-World War II atmosphere of sympathy for the
Soviet Allies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the post-Cold War era, it is a cautionary tale whose
battles have all been fought, however much historians continue to
wrangle over their meaning. (Orwell's ``1984,'' by contrast, is
more ominous than ever. Big Brother, the Thought Police and
full-time video surveillance are just a few of its nightmarish
legacies.)
</P>
<P>
   The film tries, with shaky results, to capture what is most
brilliant about ``Animal Farm,'' which Orwell subtitled ``a fairy
story'': the double layer that allows it to work as a children's
animal tale and a political allegory. But Hallmark Entertainment
(the producers of extravaganzas like NBC's ``Merlin'') has created
a work that could also have been called ``Animatronic Puppets
Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie includes real animals and computer-generated
effects, the charming puppets from Jim Henson's Creature Shop give
them their most vivid and humane qualities, and the stunt of their
lifelike presence threatens to overwhelm the drama itself. The
puppets' mouths do not always move in perfect synch to the words,
but the animals have been given amazingly expressive eyes that make
them convincing as thinking, speaking creatures.
</P>
<P>
   It is still easy to see in these characters the historical
models for Orwell's animals, models so specifically Soviet that the
novel doesn't translate easily to any other regime.
</P>
<P>
   The actors' voices are all superbly chosen. The blustery Peter
Ustinov is Old Major, the Marxist-Leninist pig who creates the
theory of animalism. ``Man is our enemy,'' he says, standing on
high bales of hay in the barn and preaching to the masses below.
``Remove man and we will be free and equal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free and equal,'' the sheep bleat in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Stewart brings his great authority to Napoleon, Josef
Stalin's stand-in, who amends Old Major's rule ``All animals are
equal'' to ``But some animals are more equal than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey Grammer is Napoleon's rival pig, Snowball, who is exiled,
like his real-life model, Leon Trotsky. Napoleon's attack dogs are
sent after him; in this case they are Jessie's puppies whom
Napoleon has taken from her at birth and trained to be his fiendish
security force, a doggy KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Holm is especially sinister as Squealer, Napoleon's
propaganda minister. As the pigs grow closer to vile humans in
their lust for riches and power, Squealer takes to wearing a
monocle on a green ribbon. It is one of the film's many sharp small
touches. Paul Scofield is Boxer, the exploited workhorse who
believes the lies of the pigs in charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the overthrown capitalist, Farmer Jones, Pete Postlethwaite
is among the few human actors on screen. Scenes added to the book
give Jones a nasty personality and the animals reasons to revolt,
but they add a bluntness to the tale. Jones accidentally shoots Old
Major, who in the book dies of old age.
</P>
<P>
   And while the animals are singing an anthem, ``Beasts of the
world/We shall unite,'' which evokes the marching rhythm of the
``Internationale,'' the song is intercut with a scene of a drunken
Jones having adulterous sex in the farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Some changes are even more heavy-handed. Though the story is
still set in the 1930s and '40s, television is the opiate of the
barnyard. Napoleon and Squealer see the other animals watching
Jones' television, mesmerized by the Keystone Kops. ``Keeps them
quiet,'' Napoleon observes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be useful,'' says Squealer. It is an irresistible idea
handled with none of Orwell's deftness.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda films that Napoleon and Squealer create are
delicious, though: black-and-white movies that owe a debt to Leni
Riefenstahl, showing geese marching in step.
</P>
<P>
   The largest change is also the worst. Cautionary tales do not
have happy endings, yet this ``Animal Farm'' invents a conclusion
that is hopeful and far too abrupt.
</P>
<P>
   For all its thoughtfulness, the uneven film is too tough to be
entirely childlike, too soft to be politically powerful, too
lacking in dramatic pull to keep viewers' attention. In the end it
misses that tenuous balance that made Orwell's work so enduring.

   `THE SECRET LIFE OF GEISHA'
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E, Sunday night at 8
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Arthur Golden's best-selling novel, ``Memoirs of a
Geisha,'' will revel in this colorful glimpse behind the veiled
life of Japan's mystery women. The two-hour documentary, narrated
by Susan Sarandon, takes the camera into today's geisha houses and
interviews members of its archaic profession.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, one of the on-screen experts, explains a traditional way
to tell geishas, who do not sleep with their clients, apart from
prostitutes. Geishas wore their boxlike sashes, called obi, tied in
back. Prostitutes tied theirs in front for ease of removal. This is
not an artfully made documentary, but its detailed subject is
thoroughly fascinating.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sprawling biblical narrative of the sort that
Cecil B. De Mille used to whip up is the cinematic genre being
spoofed in ``Epic Proportions,'' the flailing attempt at a comedy
that opened Thursday night at the Helen Hayes Theater. But it's
understandable if you find yourself thinking of another type of
popular melodrama from a bygone era, the kind in which the winsome
heroine is cruelly held captive and tortured while she strains to
stay plucky and hopeful as she prays for deliverance. For there
before you, smiling as though her life depended upon it, is Kristin
Chenoweth, the undersize actress with the outsize presence who
walked away with last season's revival of ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth, bless her heart, is imprisoned in a relentlessly
unfunny cartoon, and all the charm and luminosity in the world
aren't going to raise the dampening clouds that hang over her.
</P>
<P>
   This actress, whose performance as an angst-ridden preschooler
in ``Charlie Brown'' netted a clutch of theater awards last spring,
became the personification of a cherished Broadway fairy tale, in
which the determined kid from corn country is transformed overnight
into a big-time star.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, however, is no longer the enchanted kingdom of success
fables like ``42nd Street'' and ``Morning Glory.'' Gone are the
days when a relative unknown like Mary Martin could dazzle
Manhattan in a novelty number in Cole Porter's ``Leave It to Me''
and proceed into a glittering succession of tailor-made vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recent careers of Faith Prince, Melissa Errico and
Rebecca Luker, who have yet to find a show to match their
breakthrough performances in, respectively, ``Guys and Dolls,''
``One Touch of Venus'' and ``The Boys From Syracuse.'' (Audra
McDonald and Donna Murphy are the rare contemporary exceptions, and
their appeal is of a moodier, more cerebral variety.) Little wonder
that for such gifted performers, the prospect of a television
series starts to look like the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   If I seem to be putting off any detailed description of ``Epic
Proportions,'' which was written by Larry Coen and David Crane and
has been directed (after a fashion) by Jerry Zaks, it's because
there isn't much to say about it except, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   This shaggy dog story about shooting a ``Ten
Commandments''-style movie on an Arizona desert in the early 1930s
was warmly received in an earlier off-Broadway incarnation in 1986,
before Crane went on to glory as a co-creator of the hit sitcom
``Friends.'' It is possible that in a more relaxed, intimate
environment the show's galumphing blend of slapstick gags and hoary
jokes might have worked better.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to imagine this material successfully
stretching to much more than a five-minute television sketch or a
fleeting segment in a Mel Brooks movie. (With the well-advised
deletion of its intermission during previews last week, the show
now runs a long 85 minutes.) The eight-member ensemble, which Zaks
appears to have left mostly to its own devices, must deliver lines
as old as vaudeville, supplemented with grimaces and stiff, stagy
postures that seem less to have been thought out through rehearsal
than improvised in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth is Louise, an assistant director in charge of
extras and the focus of a romantic triangle in which two brothers,
local farmboys who have signed on as spear carriers, vie for her
affections.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Bennet (Alan Tudyk) is the one who wants to be an actor,
but it is the hunkier Phil (Jeremy Davidson) who first captures
Louise's attention with his knack for manipulating crowds, a talent
acquired during his time in a high school marching band. Before
Phil arrived, says Louise in a joke that represents the high point
of the evening's humor, they had planned to part the Red Sea on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Richard B. Shull portrays D.W. DeWitt, the nutty old director
who soon disappears into the sanctuary of a newly erected pyramid,
and Tom Beckett, Ross Lehman, Ruth Williamson and Richard Ziman
play everybody else, from a swishy leading man ( Beckett) to an
aging, predatory movie queen (Ms. Williamson).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scenes seem to keep coming back at you, as though
they had been staged on a treadmill, including antic moments
involving the pulling of chest hair and the repeated bludgeoning of
performers during takes of the same scene. And here is a typical
sample of the dialogue: ``It's the greatest story ever told.''
``It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   All the performances need reining in; on the other hand, without
the mugging, there would be nothing to command the attention,
except for William Ivey Long's costumes and David Gallo's sets,
which bring to mind a minimalist version of Tony Walton's
comic-strip designs for ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   With marcelled hair, Ms. Chenoweth looks the very model of a
1930s ingenue, a dewier version of the young Joan Blondell, and she
again demonstrates a solid instinct for comic timing. But there is
so little character for her to work with that she overcompensates
in self-sabotaging ways. She wrings the cuteness in her Betty Boop
voice, and she bizarrely underscores her punchlines by licking her
lower lip in the manner of Ernestine, the telephone operator of
Lily Tomlin routines.
</P>
<P>
   To say that she deserves better is an understatement. Shaw's
Joan of Arc complained that the world was unable to accept its
saints; the Broadway of today seems similarly incapable of
nurturing its natural stars.
</P>

when the Chinese government cracked down on student protestors in
Tiananmen Square. But 10 years later, on the 50th anniversary of
the People's Republic of China, the three have a more positive view
of China's government and its future. To them, Chinese today have

   ALA-MISSING _ A muddy 1989 Chevrolet Caprice containing six

vehicle's tags matched the missing car belonging to Lamar Junior
Stackhouse, 25, of Enterprise, signaling an apparent end to the
mystery of what happened to a group of six friends who disappeared
after a night of partying May 9. The car, with the remains still
inside, was taken to the Alabama Department of Forensic Science in
Montgomery for autopsies, said Alabama Bureau of Investigation
agent Simon Benson. Because of the decomposed state of the bodies,
authorities could not positively identify the remains Wednesday
night. State police are treating the deaths as an accident but
planned to search the area today. Early in the search there were
worries that the six friends were victims of a hate crime. (Manuel,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   A Trove of Titles At the Library &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the MacArthur Foundation Library Video Project set out
to alert the public that libraries were good places to find many
titles one didn't find lying around the average video store.
Librarians needed to be reminded, too.
</P>
<P>
   By helping them set up consortiums to buy large amounts of
titles like ``Best Boy,'' Ira Wohl's acclaimed documentary about
his retarded cousin, and ``Hearts and Minds,'' Peter Davis' Vietnam
documentary, the project built awareness among a list of
participants that has grown to 12,000 libraries.
</P>
<P>
   That message delivered, the focus narrowed to groups of videos
in single-subject areas. In 1994 it was Latino issues and in 1996,
health. This year the topic is aging. Libraries can choose from
among 47 titles _ most of them feature documentaries _ dealing with
family biography, the aging process, discrimination and
intergenerational stress, sexuality, health and care-giving and
like matters. The organization, now called the Library Media
Project, helps them buy a selection at favorable prices.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are available for lending, of course, but there is
another purpose. ``The idea is to foster public discourse,'' said
Mary Kirby, the project's executive director. Libraries organize
discussion groups around documentaries like Wohl's follow-up film
``Best Man: `Best Boy' and All of Us 20 Years Later''; Frederick
Wiseman's award-winning ``Near Death''; ``Sonny and Cornblatt,'' a
kind of nonfiction ``Grumpy Old Men'' about two elderly people who
gradually grow to like each other, or Skip Sweeney's ``My Mother
Married Wilbur Stump,'' about a family's consternation when a
parent marries an alcoholic, seven-times divorced piano player 13
years her senior.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians or interested individuals who would like their own
libraries to take part may get in touch with the project at (800)
847-3671 or fax (773) 878-8404. The e-mail address is
info(AT)librarymedia.org and the Web site is

<P>
   Eccentric Duo
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will immediately warm to what they see in the
Brothers Quay Collection, recently released by Kino, but given a
chance, films by the eccentric pair, Tim and Stephen, tend to grow
mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   One cassette includes 10 of the brothers' animated shorts, six
of them for the first time on video. On another tape is ``Institute
Benjamenta'' (1996), the Quays' first live-action film.
</P>
<P>
   Their animated work is caught in a dreamworld of tiny objects.
``Street of Crocodiles,'' a 21-minute short and their best-known
film, is based on a story of the Holocaust by the Polish Jewish
writer Bruno Schulz. ``Institute Benjamenta'' interprets Robert
Walser's Kafkaesque novella about a disruptive influence loose in a
school for servants. ``Later in life we will be something very
small and subordinate,'' a student says. Information: (800)

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pushing Tin
</P>
<P>
   A film about air traffic controllers telegraphs its climax, but
an exceptionally strong cast carries the story well beyond the
inevitable crises aloft. John Cusack is Nick, hotshot of the
control tower, and Cate Blanchett is his wife, Connie, an Elizabeth
I who talks about tuna casseroles with a Long Island accent.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is Russell, the daredevil newcomer to the tower.
Angelina Jolie is his wife Mary, a former biker chick who shakes up
the controllers' wives, not to mention Nick, who makes his play one
boozy night.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Mike Newell, ``Pushing Tin,'' Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, ``gets past its initial `M-A-S-H'-style
comic chaos and becomes a four-character story with four characters
worth watching.'' &QL;

   This Is My Father
</P>
<P>
   A glum Irish-American schoolteacher named Kieran (James Caan)
returns to the old sod in search of his roots. Flashing back to
1939, Paul Quinn's film centers on the romance between Kieran's
mother, the pretty, impetuous 17-year-old Fiona Flynn (Moya
Farrelly) and his father, a shy orphaned farmer also named Kieran
(Aidan Quinn).
</P>
<P>
   An aged fortuneteller (Moira Deady) helps uncover the tale of
Fiona's malevolent mother (Gina Moxley) and her efforts to keep the
couple apart. Some stellar actors, including Colm Meany and John
Cusack, add verve in cameo parts, while its principal players
``move through this story in quietly impassioned style'' (Maslin). &QL;

   Lost and Found &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a beautiful French cellist named Lila (Sophie Marceau) sees
in a chicken-breasted twerp of a restaurant owner named Dylan
(David Spade) is hard to imagine. In Jeff Pollack's film it is
posited that Dylan's concern for her lost dog, Jack, somehow
transforms into romance down the line, but that's a reach to say
the least.
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, Dylan has hidden the pooch in his apartment,
where it swallows a diamond and necessitates a probe through doggy
doo. Perhaps therein also lies a metaphor for ``a rancid little
nothing of a movie'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   Doug's First Movie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an animated film based on the television series ``Disney's
Doug,'' the sweet, geeky Doug Funnie spots a weird creature
swimming around polluted Bluff Lake. Grounded by the toxic waters,
the ``monster'' turns out to be a cuddly blue thing Doug names
Herman Melville and hides from hordes of crazed reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Doug is trying to gain the attention of pretty
Patti Mayonnaise, who is also being courted by Guy Graham, the
obnoxious editor of the school paper. Put all of this together and
Maurice Joyce's film ``isn't inspired children's entertainment, but
it has a certain charm'' (Anita Gates). &QL;

Lewis and the vocalist Jon Hendricks. Backstage interviews are

THE ANIMALS RULE IN TNT'S TURN ON ORWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, so the new movie version of ``Animal Farm'' backs
down a little at the end to brighten George Orwell's bleak
allegory. It's not as if ``Animal Farm'' (Sunday on TNT) is about
to be confused with the glad-girl joy of ``Pollyanna.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the makers of this splendid cable movie keep faith with
the spirit of Orwell's amazing barnyard blast at totalitarianism.
They also keep up with the latest advances in animatronics and
computer wizardry to make ``Animal Farm'' a visual wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Stewart (Napoleon), Kelsey Grammer (Snowball), Julia
Ormond (Jessie), Ian Holm (Squealer), Paul Scofield (Boxer) and
Peter Ustinov (Old Major) lead the film's credits for their voice
work, but the true star here is Jim Henson's Creature Shop.
</P>
<P>
   The London workshop is the sole component of the late Henson's
legacy that hasn't declined since Henson died nine years ago. It
just keeps getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Henson's artificial creatures stood in for live animals in much
of the endearing theatrical hit ``Babe,'' and some of those same
replicates, the sheep especially, seem to be on display here.
</P>
<P>
   But the porcine creations reach new heights, or maybe grand new
wallows. (Too bad, though, that Kevin Bacon couldn't have been a
voice talent.)
</P>
<P>
   Old Major, the prize boar of Manor Farm and the story's version
of Karl Marx, is an imposing hunk of authority and porky decency.
Snowball, representing Leon Trotsky, is your basic white pig. But
Napoleon is sublimely Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   The animatronic pig is symbolically Stalin in its crudity; its
mouth and snout are full of drool, snorts and foul, wet mysteries.
But it's Stalin as well in its heft, its carriage and in those sly,
suspicious eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pig that helps drive off the drunken farmer Jones
(Pete Postlethwaite) and establish a utopia of animal equality,
only to become a dictator who begins his tyranny by hogging, as it
were, the milk and apples.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Napoleon is sleeping in a farmhouse bed, slurping
whiskey, selling the steadfast horse Boxer to the glue factory, and
striking deals with his human collaborator, Mr. Pilkington (Alan
Stanford). He's also the beneficiary of a cult campaign managed by
his propaganda minister, Squealer.
</P>
<P>
   By then, in Orwell's enduring phrase, the denizens of Animal
Farm are taught that all animals are equal, but some animals are
more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hope-filled tag-on at the end of the movie,
screenwriters Alan Janes and Martyn Burke have altered Orwell's
1945 novel to fatten the role of the kindly sheepdog, Jessie. The
purpose is to give viewers a narrator, and a sort of easy onscreen
entry into the story.
</P>
<P>
   But first-time director John Stephenson, who heads the Creature
Shop in London, doesn't veer unreasonably from the source material.
And he brings to the film a sure sense of pacing and a keen, mature
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Little propaganda movies within the movie, paeans to Napoleon,
are dead-on parodies of grim, Soviet-style propaganda films.
Stephenson, with the help of skillful film editing, also winningly
creates a pitched barnyard battle between the animals and their
human antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   (He manages to slip in a dig at television, too. Noticing that
farmer Jones' TV set has a strangely calming effect on the other
animals, Napoleon murmurs, ``Hmmmm, keeps them quiet. Could be
useful.'')
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Robert Halmi, television's most prolific impresario
for literary classics, ``Animal Farm'' is sure to remind viewers of
``Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all those creatures, of course, but also the bucolic
fairy-tale look of the piece. Where is this, and when? Someplace
with a British thumbprint, it seems. (In fact, gulp, it was filmed
in Ireland.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Babe'' was the antic fable of the little pig that could.
``Animal Farm'' is a darkly corrosive story of human vice, told
whole-hog.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Finley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS,'' starring Bruce Willis and Nick
Nolte. Directed by Alan Rudolph (R, 110 minutes). Stuffed with
visual gags and acted with the cartoonish exaggeration of a John
Waters film divested of camp, Rudolph's screen adaptation of Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s 1973 novel is a psychedelic fun house of a movie.
The movie's style is so hyperventilated that it is exhausting to
watch. And if the satire on easy targets like middle-class
conformity, American kitsch culture and 1950s-style Puritanism is
relentless, it also seems old hat. Still, you've got to admire this
director's courage in making a movie this uncompromisingly weird
and noncommercial (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DOUBLE JEOPARDY,' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a
touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington state
to New Orleans' French Quarter, Ms. Judd plays a woman who's free
to kill her husband because she's already gone to prison for the
crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away
with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her
character becomes less of a victim. In this co-ed homage to ``The
Fugitive,'' Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a
knack for barking orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it
takes a line like ``I feel like I've grown in the last six years''
to signal the passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FOR LOVE OF THE GAME,' starring Kevin Costner and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 140 minutes). This film,
starring Costner as Billy Chapel, an aging Detroit Tigers pitcher,
is a baseball movie the way ``You've Got Mail'' was a movie about
the retail book business. Deep down the film is really about the
love of a difficult man for a good woman, played by Ms. Preston.
The baseball story, thanks to Costner's athletic credibility (see
``Bull Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams'') and a complement of real
ballplayers, works better than the romance. Taken together, they
add up to routine entertainment, because the overloaded love story
doesn't really tug the heartstrings. Underlying the story of
Chapel's crucial game is the story of his five-year romance with
Jane (Ms. Preston), seen in flashbacks, as he tries to coax one
more win out of a worn-out arm. Is it time for Chapel to quit?
Filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes even a
talented lineup produces unexceptional results (Lawrence Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `GUINEVERE,' starring Sarah Polley and Stephen Rea. Written and
directed by Audrey Wells (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Polley shines as a
shy, rebellious 21-year-old involved in an affair with an older
man. Escaping her chilly family, she moves into the well-populated
space beneath the wing of a bohemian photographer, played with
great charm by Rea. This coming-of-age film takes a knowing,
intimate view of the dynamics of such a relationship and watches
its heroine blossom. So does Ms. Polley, as a luminous, mysterious
young actress capable of exceptionally subtle shadings (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JAKOB THE LIAR,' starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Liev
Schreiber and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Peter Kassovitz
(PG-13, 114 minutes). In a Holocaust story to make Roberto Benigni
look like Primo Levi, Williams plays a man who brightens life in a
Polish ghetto with imaginary good news about the imminent end of
the war. Surrounded by a strong supporting cast (with Arkin giving
the film's only genuinely funny performance), he again indulges
that unfortunate yen to play the clown who cried. The direction is
sincere but sloppy. Watch the microphone make repeated, unwelcome
entrances from the top of the frame (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes).
What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically
intense as Bogey and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman
is the one who ends up doing the thinking for both of them
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MUMFORD,' starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre
Woodard and Mary McDonnell. Written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(R, 115 minutes). An immensely likable semiscrewball comedy from
the director of ``The Big Chill,'' ``Mumford'' follows the
adventures of an engaging charlatan psychotherapist (Dean) fleeing
a sleazy former life, who names himself after the town (Mumford) in
which he settles and helps a lot of troubled people, even though he
is without credentials. His most endearing client ( Lee) is a warm,
fuzzy billionaire computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds
it's lonely at the top. Mumford's moral ambiguity (he's both a hero
and a fraud) keeps this delightful Frank Capraesque fable of
self-invention from becoming too sappy (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUSE,' starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie
MacDowell and Jeff Bridges. Written by Brooks and Monica Johnson.
Directed by Brooks (PG-13, 97 minutes). In his latest mordantly
hilarious cri de coeur about contemporary life, the ever grousing
Brooks takes on the capriciousness of success in a world of
show-business ethics. And in coming up with the title character,
played by Ms. Stone in a delectable comic performance, he gives
that world exactly the kind of divinity it deserves. This muse is
quite a piece of work, but she seems to get results, on the
evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The joke of a premise
winds down before it reaches a punch line. But Brooks again manages
to be funny and bleak with equal ease (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE,' starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy
Smart and George Wendt. Written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly
and Michael Corrente. Directed by Corrente (R, 95 minutes). Three
of Rhode Island's finest, the director of ``Federal Hill'' and the
brothers behind ``There's Something About Mary,'' collaborate on a
rowdily funny yet also unexpectedly tender coming-of-age tale. This
rueful and very likable comedy tells of a Pawtucket teen-ager who
is abruptly separated from his druggy old cronies and packed off to
a Connecticut prep school, where he is a sharp-eyed observer of the
characters around him. Loosely knit, sometimes uproarious, the film
benefits enormously from Baldwin's deft performance as the boy's
small-minded, memorably impossible father (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIGMATA,' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh hairdresser,
receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead body of a
Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror show.
Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and Pryce the
evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could damage the
church. The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects
and religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of
pea soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood
and flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead it shows what happens when the
boy's closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens
to find himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a
grippingly intense performance as a man terrified by his new
extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it
means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early
momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for
the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SUGAR TOWN,' starring Rosanna Arquette, Ally Sheedy, Beverly
D'Angelo, Jade Gordon, John Taylor and John Doe. Directed by
Allison Anders and Kurt Voss (R, 92 minutes). An Altmanesque
cross-section of California show-biz strivers, and a film with an
inordinate supply of strong, funny female characters. Made so
quickly that its actors' obvious enthusiasm never has a chance to
flag, it illuminates subjects like power dating and the travails of
a has-been rock band. Ms. Sheedy is especially memorable as the
walking embodiment of every self-help fad and Type A trait. But
it's not easy to pick a favorite character in this warm, knowing
ensemble comedy (Maslin).

REALLY, REALLY GRAND
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Grand Illusion'' is simply among the finest films ever made, a
delicately etched look at an era that was ending even as the movie
was being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Renoir's reverie on the struggles of French soldiers
suffering at a German prison camp during World War I isn't filled
with the kind of atrocity that we've come to expect from such
films. But that's because it's a movie about the spiritual horror
of what was thought to be the last World War _ ``Grand Illusion''
was initially released in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   As the French prisoners put together their escape plans, Renoir
offers a window on the imperiled and dying European nobility, a
class of people more closely aligned with the 19th century _ in
which time their training and ideals were born _ than the 20th,
which was as new and strange to them as Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Renoir is impatient with this class, he notes its death
with a touch of regret, perhaps because no filmmaker's work is more
suffused with craft and empathy. The scene of noblesse oblige as
Jean Gabin is dying, and Erich von Stroheim's attempt to minister
to him as his station merits, will stay with you forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Illusion'' is unrated, with adult subject matter. In
French, with subtitles.

A CLEAR CASE OF BLANKIE-PANKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Henson's Muppets have always been decidedly more hip than
other characters in children's programming. They're funnier and
more savvy, even a little grittier _ if the imagination allows a
connection between ``Muppets'' and ``gritty.'' In short, they're as
cool as multi-hued cloth puppets can be, and their human
personalities make them far more fun than all those other creatures
on kids' television.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland,'' the latest Sesame
Street spinoff to hit theaters, Elmo and the gang capitalize on
that coolness quotient as much as they can in a movie aimed at
4-year-olds. And it's that smartness _ a way of being funny without
talking down to kids _ that makes the movie worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with Elmo and his blanket doing a musical number
in a laundromat, with fellow customers _ and pieces of laundry _
joining in. But Elmo won't share his blanket, and when it gets away
from him, he goes into full panic mode.
</P>
<P>
   In search of his fabric friend, Elmo trespasses in Oscar the
Grouch's trash can. A secret door falls open and whisks him away to
Grouchland, Oscar's hometown, a land of garbage and grossness. But
just as Elmo is adjusting to ``grouch culture,'' the evil menace
arrives on the scene in a helicopter. It's Huxley (Mandy Patinkin),
who lives in a castle in Grouchland and wants to take everything
from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Huxley takes Elmo's blanket, prompting Elmo to make a long,
lonely journey to the castle to get it back. Along the way, Elmo
becomes discouraged and then inspired by a bug and a talking plant.
Finally, he decides he does have the strength to stand up to the
selfish Huxley. Personal growth ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Bert and Ernie stop the action occasionally to explain things to
the audience _ a plus for small children.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin is convincingly evil _ as convincing, that is, as a
grown man who covets blankets and toys and lollipops can be.
Vanessa Williams is the Queen of Trash, who convinces Elmo to
persevere.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Elmo's friends arrive to help him (from Maria to Big
Bird, they all slip through Oscar's magic door), he has figured out
the big lesson: ``Nobody wants to be friends with a greedy, selfish
villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids will probably like the interaction that develops between
characters and the audience. And _ no surprise _ the film
encourages teamwork and sharing.
</P>
<P>
   But who else would bring you singing socks with such finesse?
Who else would throw in a talking plant that wonders, ``How come
nobody ever thinks their shrubbery got somethin' to say?'' In a
movie that's essentially about losing, finding and then sharing a
security blanket, ``Elmo'' proves Sesame Street is a pretty cool
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' is rated G and is
suitable for all audiences.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' is one of those movies that deserve two
reviews: One for its target audience, and one for people who can
drink legally. This isn't meant to be as condescending as it might
sound. But it seems unlikely that people who have put any distance
between themselves and high school would be interested in this
slight comedy-drama, while teens can probably relate to its
characters' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teens will probably have a moment of clarity, though, when
Barenaked Ladies' ``It's All Been Done'' plays on the soundtrack.
It's all been done, all right, again and again. It's so been done
that ``Drive Me Crazy'' is like holding up some gender-switching
mirror to ``She's All That.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a shallow, popular guy, there's a shallow, popular
girl (Melissa Joan Hart of TV's ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'').
Instead of a nonconformist girl getting a makeover, it's a
nonconformist boy (Adrian Grenier). Instead of a bet, it's
teen-romance politics that creates their liaison: He wants to make
an ex-girlfriend want him back, she wants to attract the attentions
of a hunky basketball player. Instead of a prom, there's a school
centennial dance _ but a prom scene, by any other name, still
smells like a prom scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' could have used some of the high spirits and
pop-cultural self-consciousness of ``She's All That,'' which used
those ingredients to steamroller many of its flaws. ``Crazy'' is
actually pretty sane, and its diagrammed structure and slack pacing
give you too much time to think about things that are wrong with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Things like the way Grenier's character makes the transition to
the ``in'' crowd so fast, it looks as if he's been brainwashed by
the Gap's ``everybody in khakis'' commercials. Things like the way
the movie tries to equate high-school pep rallies with Nazi
rallies, a callow joke that overstates the evil of the former and
trivializes the evil of the latter. Things like the way the movie
can't quite decide whether conformity or nonconformity is better,
then tips its hand by linking itself to the latest Britney Spears
single.
</P>
<P>
   Hart and Grenier are likable enough, although Grenier was much
better in the recent ``Adventures of Sebastian Cole,'' in which he
played a character who would have dismissed ``Drive Me Crazy'' as
soon as he saw its poster. The most likable characters, though, are
a not-that-geeky geek (Mark Webber of the upcoming ``Whiteboys'')
who tries to keep Grenier in line, and a beauty queen (Keri Lynn
Pratt) who has a strong, compassionate side. If the movie had been
about them, it could have been something interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' is rated PG-13 for infrequent strong language
and scenes of teens drinking.

`MYSTERY, ALASKA' SCORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, no movie plays by the rules quite like a
sports movie. It's a game in which you have to have one or more of
the following: a rag-tag group of underdogs; a grizzled vet who's
getting too old for the game; a young hotshot to replace the vet;
an irascible coach; an inspirational speech or two; and, of course,
The Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   The secret, as in real sports, is how well you play the game
using those rules. ``Mystery, Alaska,'' which includes all of these
ingredients, pulls off what could be called a stunning upset: It
triumphs over its own cliches, formula and manipulation to become
thoroughly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   There's no mystery about the town of Mystery; it's hockey-mad.
Every Saturday, Mystery's team takes on other area teams in
four-man pond-hockey matchups. The Mystery men are so good that
Sports Illustrated does a feature on them, which leads a former
resident (Hank Azaria) to arrange a publicity stunt: a game against
the New York Rangers. Mystery's residents have a great deal of
small-town pride and insularity, but despite fears that the game
will turn the town into a joke, they accept the Rangers game. The
Rangers are a little more reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing you can say about ``Mystery's'' screenplay, which
was co-written by TV whiz David E. Kelley, is that it doesn't feel
like a Kelley script. Nothing against Kelley; his writing for ``The
Practice'' is arguably the finest on television, and although his
``Ally McBeal'' is mind-bogglingly erratic, you can count on it to
make at least one or two cogent observations per show. And unlike
Kelley's summer entry, the forced horror comedy ``Lake Placid,
Mystery'' doesn't condescend to its genre _ in fact, it celebrates
its David-vs.-Goliath conventions as few sports movies have since
the original ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Jay Roach takes an unobtrusive approach, placing his
trust in his actors and his writers, and stepping up when he's most
needed. ``Mystery's'' affable cast includes Russell Crowe as the
aging player, who's also threatened when his wife's former
boyfriend (Azaria) returns to town. Mary McCormack, as Crowe's
wife, gives a glowing performance, and is blessed with what may be
the best female character the supposedly female-friendly Kelley has
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Reynolds is stolid as the town's dignified judge; Colm
Meaney, who has a silent moment that's some of the best acting
you'll see all year, is the mayor and team owner; Lolita Davidovich
is touching as his younger, neglected wife; Maury Chaykin is
amusing as that Kelley specialty, an eccentric lawyer; and Ron
Eldard is goofily charming as the team's ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say just why ``Mystery'' works so well with
ingredients that can, and have, flopped when used elsewhere. Maybe
it's just a matter of fielding the right team and playing the game
well. No doubt some people will be able to resist its charms, but
that's their loss. Even when ``Mystery'' trips up with occasional
underwritten moments, it's still a movie to root for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska,'' is rated R for nudity, strong language,
sports-related violence and locker-room humor.

THE GALL OF PEOPLE, LINKING BUSH TO FATHERLY FAVORS  
 (ADV: RESENDING TO FIX GARBLE)

   PHOENIX - The influence of famous political fathers has often
helped their kids.
</P>
<P>
   John Quincy Adams, the country's sixth president, was the son of
the second. John F. Kennedy wouldn't have made it to the White
House without his father's clout. Vice President Al Gore's career
got a boost from Al Gore Sr., a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of privileged sons whose dads have given them a
leg up, it's predictable that some malcontents would grumble about
Texas Gov. George W. Bush owing much of his success to special
treatment as the son of a president.
</P>
<P>
   From keeping out of active military duty during the Vietnam War
to getting rich in the oil business to becoming lead owner of the
Texas Rangers baseball team, George W. has used his father's
political influence to cut in line, they squawk.
</P>
<P>
   The gall of these people.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with how he got into the Texas Air National Guard in
1968 after his graduation from Yale. The war was at its height, and
the draft was at full throttle. But George W. was able to secure a
spot in the Guard, also known then as ``Air Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his father was then a Texas congressman, some people
wondered if strings were pulled. What cynics! As George W. has
assured us repeatedly, he received no special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Ben Barnes, who was speaker of the Texas House of
Representatives, now says he called the head of the Texas Air
National Guard in 1968 and recommended George W. for a Guard slot.
Barnes said he did so at the request of the late Sidney Adger, a
Houston oilman and friend of the elder Bush. Soon after, George W.
got the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubting Thomases have deduced that George W.'s dad,
wanting to stay in the background, probably asked his pal Adger to
urge Barnes to grease the skids. Any fair-minded person, of course,
couldn't believe such a far-fetched scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In business, too, skeptics say George W. had all the breaks. I
can't imagine why.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he started an oil company called Arbusto Energy with
money from his trust fund and wealthy friends of his father. The
company struggled through years of low oil prices, and he merged
twice, the second time in 1986 with Harken Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Harken didn't give George W. a management position, but aware of
his father's connections, made him a director and gave him 212,000
shares of stock worth $500,000, or about $2.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he sold that stock for $4 a share, or $848,560. Eight
days later, Harken finished the second quarter with a stunning loss
of $23 million. Its stock ended the year barely above $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Critics howled that he must have illegally used inside
information to sell before the loss was reported, but what do they
know? Regulators found no evidence that he had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Before the stock was sold, it was collateral for a $500,000 bank
loan he obtained to invest in the Texas Rangers in 1989. Getting
the franchise proved to be his most lucrative business deal and a
launching pad for his campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Though several people wanted to buy the team, George W. was
given preference because owner Eddie Chiles was a longtime friend
of his father, who was then president. But George W. was unable to
line up enough money until Peter Ueberroth, then baseball
commissioner, persuaded Fort Worth billionaire Richard Rainwater to
come into the deal. Ueberroth asked Rainwater to join George W.
partly ``out of respect for his father,'' the ``New York Times''
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise, bought for $86 million, soared in value with the
construction of a new stadium, funded mostly by a half-cent sales
tax increase that some sourpusses complained was corporate welfare.
Last year, the team was sold for $250 million, and George W. got
$14.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he was born on third base. They say he's led a charmed
life filled with political favors. They say if his name were George
W. Bosh, he'd be a political nobody.
</P>
<P>
   They're jealous. Asked about his paternal advantages, George W.
said all he can do is ``play the hand I've been dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   It just happens to be aces. &QL;

   If the 18th-century highwaymen Plunkett and Macleane were as
proficient as director Jake Scott, they might have had a more
successful career. Scott tries a fresh spin on this tale of two
freebooters, the up-from-the streets Plunkett (Robert Carlyle) and
the well-born but broke Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), who throw
together their lots. Plunkett's goal is to use Macleane's
background and access to fellow noblemen to scope out their homes
as likely robbery targets. Macleane's ambition is to squander his
life in the tradition of spoiled gentry, by gambling and
womanizing. Scott's application of a less formal and more playful
directing style to the stodgy costume drama results in a few
elements stolen ... er, pilfered ... um, inspired by about 900
other movies, including ``Les Miserables.'' He must think half his
job is done when he uses two stars of the tricked-out
``Trainspotting.'' Scott is lucky that one of those stars is
Carlyle, one of the most intense and charismatic actors around.
Plunkett is a conceit _ an apothecary/explosives expert who is,
ironically, more noble than Macleane. But Carlyle, a performer with
a fiery love of acting in his eyes, elevates Plunkett into a full
character. The wastrels he plans to rob are totally unreal to
Plunkett: To him, they're garbage wrapped in skin.
</P>
<P>
   A bond grows between Plunkett and Macleane only because of
Carlyle's emotional investment. Both parts are underwritten,
although Scott dances through the material by using anachronisms so
relentlessly, including a banging techno score, that you might as
well be watching a Janet Jackson video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' is rated R for violence, profanity and
adult sexuality.

   NEW YORK _ The game of the week was musical chairs _ director's
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' a musical adaptation
of Joyce's short story, a formal announcement was released on
Tuesday that Richard Nelson would be sharing the directing credit
with Jack Hofsiss, originally announced as the show's sole
director. The show's first preview is Friday night at Playwrights
Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sanford, the artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, said
Nelson, who adapted Joyce's story, had been handling most of the
directing chores since last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rehearsals weren't where we wanted when we made the switch,''
Sanford said. ``We talked to Jack, and Jack addressed the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors had been circulating that Hofsiss, a veteran Broadway
director, had been dismissed or pushed out. Sanford denied those
rumors and said that Hofsiss was still attending rehearsals and
that much of his work was still evident in the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``This took a year and half to mount,'' he said. ``And Jack was
driving for most of that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift would have no effect on the show's schedule, Sanford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pretend that this wasn't dramatic,'' he said.
``But there have been much more dramatic things happen in
rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Public Theater, another directorial change was made,
under very different circumstances. Marcus Stern, the planned
director of ``In the Blood,'' by Suzan-Lori Parks, was forced to
drop out of the production after seriously injuring his knee.
</P>
<P>
   David Esbjornson, director of the recently opened ``Mud'' and
``Drowning'' at the Signature Theater Company, has taken over, but
the first preview has been pushed back a week, to Nov. 2. Charlayne
Woodard heads a six-person ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, however, talk of directorial changes seemed to be
just that, talk. The rumor du jour on Broadway was that Sam Mendes,
the director of ``Wise Guys,'' the new Sondheim musical, and of the
film ``American Beauty,'' was close to leaving the developmental
production at the New York Theater Workshop. Gossips also posited
that the show, scheduled to begin on Oct. 29, might be delayed
because rehearsals began a week later than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But John Barlow, a spokesman, said that while rehearsals for
principal performers were delayed by a week, the show's stars,
Nathan Lane and Victor Garber, are now in the second week of music
rehearsals at the workshop and the full company rehearsals with
Mendes would begin on Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim and John Weidman, the book writer, are working on the
script and score, and on Monday, a letter went out to renewing
subscribers of the workshops inviting them to the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on schedule,'' Barlow said. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The Gershwin Theater, Broadway's biggest theater,
seems to be becoming its biggest dance hall.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next spring, the 1,933-seat Gershwin will be home to
``Riverdance,'' the Irish dance spectacle. But coming up first is
the return of ``Tango Argentino,'' a surprise critical and popular
hit in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the show, a two-hour revue performed by 30 dancers,
sparked a minirevival of the tango in the city, replete with tango
lessons, tango togs and tango parties. It ran six months. This
fall's version will be an eight-week run, beginning on Nov. 11 with
much of the original cast, including Hector and Elsa Maria Mayoral,
who are described in press materials as ``President Clinton's
personal tango instructors while he was in Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being another all-dance entry on Broadway,
``Argentino'' seems to be the latest to try to capitalize on the
throngs of people expected in the city for the millennial
celebration. Other limited-run entertainments include planned gigs
by the comedian Jackie Mason, the singer Liza Minnelli and by the
daytime-television actress Susan Lucci in ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the regional summer theater festivals, New York Stage
and Film, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., has kept a lower profile, inviting
fewer big-name movie stars and little critical appraisal than
festivals like the Williamstown Theater Festival.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 1999-2000 season develops, it looks as though as many
as five plays that had their debuts in Poughkeepsie will appear on
New York stages.
</P>
<P>
   The first up is ``Chesapeake,'' by Lee Blessing, a one-man show
that features Mark Linn-Baker as both its actor and one of its
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The play, about a performance artist who kidnaps a conservative
senator's dog, had its debut at the Stage and Film this summer and
begins previews at Second Stage Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it, I knew it was something I wanted to do,'' said
Linn-Baker, of the play. ``I was just praying I wasn't the only one
that thought that.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't. For ``Chesapeake,'' Linn-Baker teamed with Max Mayer,
the director and the man with whom he and Leslie Urdang founded
Stage and Film in 1984. The program, on the campus of Vassar
College, now runs eight weeks and presents nearly two dozen new
works. The whole idea, then and now, was to develop work ``outside
the scrutiny of critical and commercial eyes,'' Linn-Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   But that ethos has not prevented some intrepid producers from
sampling the fare and importing it to New York. This season,
transfers from Stage and Film will include ``The Clearing,'' now
playing at the Blue Light Theater Company; ``Hurricane,'' by Erin
Cressida Wilson, opening at Classic Stage Company in December and
``Bomb-itty of Errors,'' a hip-hop Shakespearean adaptation, which
has been optioned by the producer Daryl Roth.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, Manhattan Theater Club confirmed that the play
``Current Events,'' by David Marshall Grant, will open on its
second stage in June 2000. David Petrarca will direct. The play had
its premiere at Stage and Film in July.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all this, might Linn-Baker have a future as a
big-time producer? ``I'm an actor and a director,'' he said. ``I
like to get my hands dirty.''

THREE GUYS FROM TEXAS MARK THREE DECADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the CD title implies, that little ol' band from Texas marks
its 30th anniversary this year of pumping out superamped
boogie-blues. That's brawny beats from Frank Beard, rumbling bass
and the occasional lead vocal from Dusty Hill, and salacious
singing and swaggering guitar solos from Billy Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   And by now, it ought to be all over: There's only so much you
can do with three guys and a bunch of Lightnin' Hopkins and Freddie
King guitar riffs on 11, and it would figure that by now it's all
been said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the '90s have been a relatively lean decade for da
Top: They released their worst CD ever, ``Antenna,'' in 1994. And
they are not the concert draw they were in the '80s, when a
combination of smart tunes and fun videos for ``Legs, Gimme All
Your Lovin''' and others made them one of the most popular live
acts in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But lo and behold, the new ``XXX'' is a darned good record. Due
to some by-the-numbers, been-there-done-that boogie, this isn't one
of their greatest efforts by any means, but it does sound as though
the band is energized and still willing to tinker with the formula.
It is, at times, downright strange _ and that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   There is, first of all, the rap _ yes, rap _ touches of
``Crucifixx-A-Flatt.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the slow blues _ every Top CD has to have one, you
know _ of ``Made Into a Movie,'' which has a slightly psychedelic
expansiveness that compares with Neil Young's ``Cortez the
Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets odder, though. ``Dreadmonboogaloo'' is a quirky, quick
little slice of organ-spiced ZZ-goes-lounge (er, kind of) that sets
up four live songs _ the first time that the band has mixed live
and studio cuts since 1975's ``Fandango!,'' the LP that gave the
band the huge hit single ``Tush.''
</P>
<P>
   The introduction to these songs is by one Ross Mitchell, who
basically takes the intro James Brown got on his 1963 ``Live at the
Apollo'' and makes it sound real stiff and white-bread, going so
far as to call them ``the ZZ Tops.'' Then the band comes on in what
sounds like a packed bar and does ``Sinpusher,'' an obvious remake
of 1994's ``Pincushion.'' And if that's not strange enough, the
next song is Elvis' ``Let Me Be Your (Teddy Bear),'' slowed down
considerably and featuring Dusty on lead vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? The final two songs, ``Hey Mr. Millionaire'' and ``Belt
Buckle,'' are only fair, but by this time the left turns, the fat,
thick sound and the small handful of stellar tunes _ ``Movie'' and
the opening ``Poke Chop Sandwich'' among them _ has made this, if
nothing else, an interesting CD. It doesn't have the consistency of
1973's ``Tres Hombres, Fandango!'' or 1983's ``Eliminator,'' but it
shows that the three wise men of rock 'n' roll are still good for
some aural barbecue and the occasional pleasantly twisted detour
from the norm.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   With moisture having been swept east over the Atlantic by
Thursday's cold front and with moisture over the Gulf of Mexico
corralled by steering winds from the west, most of the East will be
dry Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One small exception will be southern and central Florida, where
isolated showers and thunderstorms develop mainly during the
afternoon in response to warm air converging and rising near a
stalled front lying across the middle of the peninsula. Also, a few
showers will skirt upstate New York and northwest New England as a
moisture-starved disturbance pivots east across southern Ontario
and southern Quebec. But spotty showers from variable clouds will
be confined mainly to the St. Lawrence River Valley, including the
island of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of rain will spread from South Dakota toward Iowa,
southern Wisconsin and northwest Illinois Friday and Friday night.
Some snow may fall during the first half of the day in a narrow
swath on the northern fringe of the rain shield. Thus, only limited
parts of South Dakota will likely be affected by snow. As
temperatures rise from their morning nadir, all of the
precipitation that develops across parts of the Middle West will
fall as rain. Meanwhile, the leading edge of the coldest air mass
of the season will brush North Dakota and northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of snow will develop east of the Front Range of the
Rockies from the Black Hills of South Dakota to parts of northeast
Wyoming and southern Montana as moist, chilly winds from the east
ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Santa Ana Heat
</P>
<P>
   The temperature soared to 102 degrees at Los Angeles Thursday,
marking one of several records that were set in California. Heat
mounted as winds from the east, which were orchestrated by a
sprawling high pressure system over the Rockies, warmed on descent
from the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. Moreover, these
winds kept the layer of cool Pacific air confined to the beaches.
Offshore winds that bring heat to California are called Santa Anas,
which derive their name from the canyon through which they course
on their westward journey toward the coast.

   FBC-TENN-ESPN _ Are the officials at ESPN upset with the
Tennessee football program? That's what fans and players in
Knoxville are thinking after a recent story by the cable network
alledging academic fraud among the university's football players.
Tennessee offensive lineman Spencer Riley has recently gone on the
record with comments about ESPN and fans believe the cable network
had a role in promoting Michigan's Charles Woodson to win the
Heisman over Vols quarterback Peyton Manning in 1997. Fans in
Knoxville are not happy with the cable giant. (Barnhart, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-UGA-SANKS _ Georgia coach Jim Donnan and running back Jasper
Sanks think unrealistic expectations from fans and media
contributed to Sanks'disappointing debut last season. Despite
entering as one of the Bulldogs' most heralded freshmen since
Herschel Walker, Sanks had weight problems and injuries and
finished with 65 yards on 10 carries. But a rededicated Sanks
reported 18 pounds lighter this season (216) and stronger from a
year in theweight room. After an injury-free preseason, he gained a
starting job. And after three games, he has consecutive 130-plus
rushing games. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 14.

   FBC-BUCKEYES _ Heading into a big matchup with Wisconsin, we

points plus underdogs. The Bucks may be in trouble when they lineup

   Another Estate, More Picassos
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week Christie's announced that it was selling a
group of paintings, drawings and sculptures belonging to Madeleine
Haas Russell, one of San Francisco's most important collectors, who
died in April. This week, it's Sotheby's turn to crow about being
chosen to sell artwork from a major estate.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Nov. 10, it will auction a collection of
20th-century art belonging to Eleanore and Daniel Saidenberg, the
Manhattan gallery owners who represented Picasso in the United
States from 1955 until the artist's death in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Saidenbergs' estate is far bigger than Mrs. Russell's, so
big that Sotheby's is selling the works in a special evening
auction by itself. Included in the sale are 46 works of
20th-century art from the couple's personal collection. Sotheby's
estimates that the auction could total $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Saidenbergs were not typical art dealers. Mrs. Saidenberg,
who died in August, was a founder of the Art Dealers Association of
America. She was also a modern dancer. Saidenberg was also a
well-known cellist and conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The couple first opened their gallery, which was on the Upper
East Side, in 1950. In addition to Picasso they showed such
20th-century masters as Braque, Leger and Kandinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saidenbergs were dealers first,'' said Charles Moffett,
co-chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department
worldwide. ``They didn't create an enormous collection but a
special one. Clearly the things they held back for themselves were
works that spoke to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting that will get the most attention at the sale is
Picasso's ``Seated Woman in a Garden.'' Made on Dec. 8, 1938, it is
one of the grandest depictions of Dora Maar, a mistress of Picasso
whom the artist frequently painted. Maar is regally seated on a
thronelike chair surrounded by naively rendered flowers in this
densely painted work, adorned by a variety of stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's estimates that the painting, which measures 51 by 38
inches, could bring $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another prized Picasso belonging to the Saidenbergs will be
offered in November. It is ``The Statuary,'' a 1925 neo-classical
work in which a female figure poses formally beside a modeling
stand on which rests a bust of an elderly man. The painting was
shown at the artist's request in an exhibition of his work at the
Galerie Georges Petit in Paris in 1932. It is estimated to bring
$12 million to $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the only Picassos on offer in November. Christie's
will auction one from the Haas estate that depicts another of
Picasso's mistresses, Marie-Therese Walter. Painted in 1932, it
measures 65 inches by 53 inches and shows Walter reclining with one
arm over her head. Christie's believes it could bring around $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Saidenberg sale also includes paintings, drawings, sculpture
and ceramics by a variety of artists, among them Braque and Leger.
</P>
<P>
   A Sideways Pollock?
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Whitney Museum of American Art say they haven't
made a mistake. Jackson Pollock's ``No. 27, 1950,'' displayed in
the opening gallery of the second part of ``The American Century:
Art and Culture 1900-2000,'' has been hung vertically on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow drip painting is signed on the horizontal side and
has always been exhibited that way, except at its first public
appearance in Pollock's 1950 show at the Betty Parsons Gallery on
West 57th Street in Manhattan, when it was oriented vertically.
Next to the elevators on the Whitney's fifth floor, where the
painting now hangs, the museum is displaying several photographs of
that first show as supporting evidence. Also on display are eight
small square drip paintings that were in the Parsons show and are
visible in the photographs. They hang in stacks of four not unlike
a Donald Judd wall sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had only ever seen it hung horizontally,'' said Lisa
Phillips, the show's curator, who is now director of the New Museum
for Contemporary Art in Soho. ``But when I went to a lecture given
by T.J. Clarke at the Museum of Modern Art around the time of its
Pollock retrospective, he showed the painting hanging vertically.
It was a revelation. We wouldn't have done this if Pollock himself
hadn't approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney, said that ``No. 27''
was hung vertically ``in part out of a desire to provide a sense of
the original character of the works in the show.'' Still, many
visitors who notice the signature going up the painting's left-hand
side are perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of paintings and sculpture at the
Modern, noted that when Hans Namuth filmed Pollock working outside
his Long Island studio in East Hampton, ``Pollock is moving around
the painting's sides, so there's no telling if he had any
particular orientation in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Varnedoe, who organized the Modern's giant 1998 Pollock
retrospective, said he hung the painting horizontally in that show
because of the orientation of its signature. But he added that ``if
it had been sufficiently important to Pollock, it wouldn't have
been hung vertically at Betty Parsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlem Losing Director
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasha Holman Conwill is stepping down after 11 years as
director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. The museum's collection
grew significantly during Ms. Conwill's tenure, and she helped
organize more than 40 exhibitions. Recently she announced that the
institution, on West 125th Street, would undergo a major expansion
and renovation to install the first galleries devoted to its
permanent collection. The museum will expand to 72,000 square feet
from 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   George Knox, chairman of the museum's board of trustees, said
the museum had formed a search committee to find a new director.
Although Ms. Conwill is leaving Oct. 31, the board has not yet
named an interim director.  &QL;

RUSSIA MOVES TROOPS INTO CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's campaign against Islamic rebels in Chechnya
moved closer to full-scale war Thursday as federal forces entered
the breakaway Caucasus region where Moscow suffered a humiliating
and costly defeat three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian warplanes hammering targets in Chechnya for an
eighth day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said an unspecified
number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area
had moved into positions inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat operations in Chechnya are already under &UR;  &LR; way,'' Putin
said in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian
targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster
along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not say exactly where the soldiers crossed into
Chechnya and there were no reports of ground fighting, but tensions
were running high.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had
advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's
capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's Defense Minister Magomed Khambiyev said specially
trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news
agencies here reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat action will start on the territory of Russia,''
Khambiyev said. ``Russian citizens (will) feel the gruesome nature
of the war, the bitterness of losing relatives and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded
neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy
casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya.
The militants also have been blamed for four recent bomb blasts in
Russia that killed nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has been calling for talks to
avert war but has been rebuffed by the Kremlin, which is demanding
he turn over suspected terrorists. Thursday, Maskhadov appealed to
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to help set up talks with
President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian generals have hinted that they plan to partition
Chechnya and slowly push the rebel fighters into the mountains
south of Grozny. Colonel General Valery Manilov, seen as one of the
main planners of the operation, said the fighting could be
concluded by winter.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts questioned the wisdom of beginning a ground
campaign so late in the year _ especially one that appears to have
been hastily improvised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military strategy says that you should never, ever, initiate a
ground operation with winter approaching,'' said Alexander Zhilin,
military analyst for the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. ``From a
military point of view it makes no sense. I am afraid that there
are going to be massive casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin tried to play down the meaning of the Russian move into
Chechnya, which Moscow sees as a part of Russia. Since federal
troops withdrew from the region in 1996, Chechnya has run its own
affairs, although no country has acknowledged its claim to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring
control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from
being a base for terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no border with Chechnya _ that is the Russian
Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever
necessary,'' Putin said. ``This is a very important question we
must answer: Where do we want to create the security zone if we
create one? On our own territory? And wait for them to come again
to our villages . . . so that we would bomb our own people? I don't
think that's very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, named by Yeltsin as the Kremlin's favored candidate in
next year's presidential vote, has vowed to crush the rebels but
avoid the mistakes of the last war.
</P>
<P>
   Then, green Russian draftees were often thrown into battle
situations where hardened Chechen guerrillas had nearly every
advantage. Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately,
turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign already shows similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel
bases, but Chechnya's government accuses the Russians of
indiscrimately hitting civilian targets. The Chechens say 550
civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified civilians continue to pour out of Chechnya, and a line
of vehicles stretched for miles outside of Grozny Thursday.
Already, 78,000 refugees have fled to Ingushetia, a tiny and
impoverished Russian region west of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the Russian plan appears to be based on
Putin's political goals, rather than military expediency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mass idiocy,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based
defense analyst. ``I don't understand Russia's military strategy. I
am afraid that Russia is headed for a total military disaster. I am
really afraid.''

   GAME OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (2-1) vs. Pittsburgh (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Buckle down for a fierce battle, a tingling fight, a
knock-'em-down-and-out affair between the American Football
Conference's top-ranked defensive teams. Points will be a premium.
So will rushing yards. There is bad blood here but also an intense
rivalry and respect between divisional foes who have won four
apiece in their last eight meetings. And the winning team in each
of those games has been the home team. Jacksonville last season
ended Pittsburgh's hold on the AFC Central. That will fuel the
Steelers. So will quarterback Kordell Stewart handling the ball,
back Jerome Bettis running with it and linebacker Jason Gilden
pursuing it. Steelers, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   1 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (1-2) vs. Dallas (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Dallas has won 16 of its past 17 meetings versus
Arizona but the last game was the loss, a wild-card playoff game
last year where Arizona shocked Dallas and quarterback Jake Plummer
riddled them. In fact, Plummer in his last two games against Dallas
has completed 50 of 92 passes for 678 yards with five touchdowns
and three interceptions. Last year in a regular-season game against
Dallas he threw the ball 56 times and gained 465 passing yards. No
doubt, the Cowboys have him targeted and gained an extra week
through the bye to find solutions. Arizona panicked in its Monday
night loss at home against San Francisco and Dallas will blitz
Plummer heavily to force more errors. Cowboys, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (1-2) vs. Atlanta (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: It has gotten ugly quick for Atlanta with injuries and
spotty play and turnovers. The Falcons have won five of six against
the AFC and 10 of 11 at home. It did that with a sure running game
and with surer hands _ few turnovers. Error-free ball will be
Atlanta's chief goal in this game. Stopping Ravens back Errict
Rhett will be another. Expect an Atlanta rebound with Chris
Chandler to receiver Terance Mathis paving the way. Linebacker
Jessie Tuggle and the Atlanta defense will play in inspiring,
aggressive style, and, for the moment, right Atlanta. Falcons,
23-13
</P>
<P>
   New England (3-0) vs. Cleveland (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: New England has won close games with late, exacting
offensive drives for scores and with a fourth-quarter defense that
has excelled. Now they travel to the new Dawg Pound and are in
jeopardy of being bitten. This is a dangerous game for New England
because quarterback Tim Couch will be improved and so will the
Browns defense. Too, Cleveland has the fewest penalties (8) and
penalty yards (50) in the league. The Browns are hungry for that
first victory. New England will need another fourth-quarter surge.
Patriots, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (1-1) vs. Chicago (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Mike Ditka remains legend in Chicago and the city is
excited, once again, to welcome him back. Ditka will find a better
Bears team, though. Their three games have each been decided 7 or
fewer points. The Bears defense leads the league in fumble
recoveries and it leads the NFC with nine total turnovers forced.
Bears quarterback Shane Matthews has not not forced his passes and
back Curtis Enis has gained 193 rushing yards and 135 receiving
yards. End Clyde Simmons has four sacks. Look for the Bears to play
in their old style with robust defense and a solid running game.
Ditka would be proud. Problem is, this time, he is on the receiving
end of a Bears throwback victory. Bears, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (0-3) vs. Giants (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Eagles were shut out by Buffalo last week and show
little signs of life. They enter against a team struggling on
offense, particularly in the running game. Joe Montgomery gets a
crack at running back for the Giants and expect him to surprise. He
has excellent quickness and shows determination at the end of his
runs. The Giants, like many NFL teams, are slow to put the ball in
the hands of rookies but Montgomery will show why this is often an
ill-advised philosophy and why if a player can, indeed, play,
experience matters little. The Giants offense will emerge and the
Eagles as a team will continue to sink. Giants, 33-17.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (2-0) vs. Cincinnati (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Willie Jackson of the Bengals leads the AFC in kickoff
return average. That's about it for Cincinnati. It is off to
another woeful start and meets a team that is excited about its
play. The Rams are averaging nearly 400 yards of offense and their
quarterback, Kurt Warner, is one of only two in the league in the
last 50 years with three touchdown passes in his first two starts
(Dan Marino in 1983 is the other). Warner wasn't even supposed to
be playing: the Rams invested big free agent dollars in Trent Green
during the offseason to be their quarterback. But Warner and a team
full of optimism for the first time in a long time continue their
winning ways. The Bengals? There's always Willie Jackson. Rams,
23-20.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (2-1) vs. Minnesota (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Mitch Berger punts for the Vikings and his average
leads the league. He will get plenty of practice against Tampa Bay
because the Bucs own the league's No.-1 ranked defense. Tampa Bay
is averaging only 143.3 passing yards and 55 rushing yards allowed.
But they may play without end Warren Sapp, injured and likely
slowed even if he plays. That gives Minnesota a slight edge in a
rugged game where turnovers late are decisive. Vikings, 16-10.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (2-1) vs. San Diego (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Not only are the Chargers the best in the league at
allowing the fewest average yards per carry, they also have not
allowed a 100-yard rusher in 21 consecutive games. The Chargers
have turned the ball over only once. They could be 2-0 but wilted
against the Colts last week at home. Kansas City has won two
straight and has beaten San Diego in three of its last four. But
watch quarterback Jim Harbaugh outplay the Chiefs' Elvis Grbac and
for back Natrone Means to help the Chargers win with tough
fourth-quarter running. Chargers, 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-2) vs. Washington (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: George Seifert has not lost to Washington and Norv
Turner has not lost to Carolina. Something between these head
coaches must give. It will be Seifert. He used to handle the
Panthers while 49ers head coach but his Panthers do not have
similar talent. They whipped the Bengals last week and back Tim
Biakabutuka gained 132 rushing yards. He added
franchise-record-long touchdown runs of 62 and 67 yards. On one of
them, he reversed field and sped away. Against the Redsksins, he
will reverse, spin _ and run into more defenders. His counterpart,
the Redskins Stephen Davis, has eight rushing touchdowns and he
will reach the end zone again. So will his team, often, in another
display of why they figure to battle prominently for the NFC East
divisional crown. Redskins, 30-17.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (0-3) vs. Denver (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: A rematch of last season's AFC championship game (won
by Denver, 23-10) has fizzled into a fight for survival. Both
teams, winless, are reeling. Steve Atwater, the Jets safety, played
10 seasons for Denver before joining the Jets. He will give them an
inside track, particularly on the Broncos defense. It is a big game
for Broncos kicker Jason Elam; with 2 points he passes Jim Turner
and become's Denver's all-time leading scorer. Terrell Davis rushed
for 167 yards the last time these teams played. He won't get that
many this time, but enough to give Denver the victory. Broncos,
21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (3-0) vs. San Francisco (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Tennessee is turning heads. It is in sole possession of
first place for the first time in six years. It has never been 4-0.
It won't be this time, either. The Titans showed wonderful resolve
on the road at Jacksonville in winning a critical divisional game
against a strong team. Asking for that two weeks in a row, even
without the 49ers Steve Young in the lineup, is too much. Young is
out nursing a concussion and his backup, Jeff Garcia, will find
receiver Terrell Owens open for big plays. The 49ers defense is led
by veteran end Charles Haley, an inspiration to his teammates and
one of the game's most knowledgeable players. 49ers, 17-12.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT:
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (2-1) vs. Seattle (2-1) COMMENT: Oakland and Seattle
battle for first place in the AFC West under bright lights and
scrutiny. Are the Raiders for real? Can coach Mike Holmgren work
similar magic with Seattle as he did in Green Bay? Oakland trails
only Indianapolis in AFC offensive yards gained. The Raiders have
gained a boost in back Tyrone Wheatley's power running. But Seattle
is a team full of stars that have underachieved. Playing in prime
time often brings out the best in underachievers. Look for Seattle
to click. Seahawks, 28-20.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT:
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (2-1) vs. Miami (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Another divisional battle for the top spot. Miami leads
the AFC East. Buffalo wants an early share of the top spot. Watch
how Miami defends Doug Flutie. Expect the Dolphins to rush him wide
and make his scramble up the middle where linebacker Zach Thomas
will be waiting. Scrambling against this defense could be scary for
Flutie. The Dolphins gang tackle and punish ballcarriers. This is a
game Miami wins with defense. Dolphins, 21-9.

HE'S NO KING ARTHUR, BUT SHE'S NO GUINEVERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's apparent that a romance movie has issues when a
smooch between the Guy and the Girl makes one squirm in one's seat,
when every domestic quarrel warrants silent celebration, when all
one can really hope for the characters is terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Guinevere,'' an artsy film about a 20-something girl who
``comes of age'' by shacking up with a man at least twice her age,
this issue is not about blushing at on-screen lip-lock or the
conventional conflicts and slightly ``ageist'' criticism of
May-December romances. After Clinton and Monica, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The issue at hand, or should we say lip, is failure on the part
of writer-director Audrey Wells, and likely on the part of the
actors, to convince us that there is anything behind that kiss
other than stage direction.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, best known for writing ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,''
has penned the love into the script, doing plenty of telling about
why a 21-year-old girl would need a 50-year-old man, but she fails
to capture on camera any of the magic that is falling and being in
love.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Polley (Go) is Harper Sloane, a lost little rich girl
raised in San Francisco by a family of lawyers. On the eve of
entering Harvard Law School under pressure by her family, she meets
Connie Fitzpatrick, played by Stephen Rea (Michael Collins''), who
decides she has it in her to be a photographer like him, even
though she's never taken a picture, painted a painting, etc.
</P>
<P>
   He calls her his Guinevere, as in the ``aging King Arthur falls
in love with young Guinevere'' tale, and invites her to move in
with him if she promises to devote herself to kissing and becoming
an artist. (There's other stuff along the lines of kissing that is
implied off-screen, thank goodness.)
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks into her study, Harper discovers she's the latest in
a long line of Connie's Guineveres and leaves in an angry huff,
eliciting much personal viewing joy. (Lan-ce-lot! Lan-ce-lot!)
</P>
<P>
   But she comes back, there's more lip-lock, and critics' disgust
ensues.
</P>
<P>
   This film is not all bad. The plot is cliched, but with the
simple inclusion of on-screen love, it could have been saved. The
cinematography is hearty and gentle, putting an artistic edge to
the lens that mirrors the plot beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the love issue, which is large, a normally outstanding
Polley gives a great performance, particularly as she giggles her
way through the very first kissing scene. She wears her insecurity
on the extra-long sleeves she stretches and clutches in moments of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Rea does well as the playboy photographer past his prime,
avoiding the bottled performance that could have been brought so
easily to this role. Again, he just fails to show us his affection
for Polley in anything other than a fatherly, distant way.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Smart as the lawyerly, affection-hungry, sexy Mrs. Sloane
is a wonder to watch in a plot sadly underplayed by Wells. The
monologue in which Rea's character is taken from King Arthur status
to a quivering sliver of a man with a few of Smart's crafty eye
squints and her gutsy delivery is the sole reason to see this
movie. It is here that Wells shows her best talent and character
introspection.
</P>
<P>
   But all is lost once more at the ending, which we won't give
away, except to note that it involves fictionalized ascension to
heaven: white clouds, white clothes and all. Harper starts the
scene by saying ``OK, so I know this is cheesy, but . . . '' But
nothing. She's right.
</P>
<P>
   Where, oh where, is Lancelot when you need him? &QL;

 &HT;    Around the world on a budget
 &HT;    By Jason C. Nuttle
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The trip started with a phone call.
``Remember talking about traveling around the world?'' my best
friend Chad asked.
</P>
<P>
   And soon we were off.
</P>
<P>
   We spent four months and $7,000 each (including the $2,000 I had
to get wired to me) hauling our backpacks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   We traveled by plane, train, motorcycle, bike, felucca (an
Egyptian sailboat) _ you name it.
</P>
<P>
   We used a Eurail pass to explore England, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
Austria, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   And onward by air _ to Cairo, Bangkok, and Hong Kong. Chad found
an online travel agency called Ticket Planet (www.ticketplanet.com)
that specializes in around-the-world air fares for budget
travelers. We stayed in hostels and lived cheap.
</P>
<P>
   What would I have done differently? That's easy. I would have
bought a more comfortable pair of shoes, saved more money and asked
for more time off work.
</P>
<P>
   And I would have made sure my ATM card didn't expire halfway
into the trip.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROUTE: We traveled by train throughout Europe, then flew to
Cairo, Bangkok and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWING THE ELEPHANTS IS A WASH: On the second day of a
motorcycle trip in northern Thailand we came across an elephant
camp. Three elephants walked along the roadside and about a dozen
more splashed in the river. We parked the 150cc dirt bikes we had
rented and spent an hour watching the guides feed and bathe the
elephants. While scrubbing the elephant's back, one guide slipped
and fell in the river. He stripped off his shirt and washed up,
too.
</P>
<P>
   OH CAMEL, ALL YE FAITHFUL: In Cairo, I was determined to ride a
camel around the Great Pyramids in Giza. Horses were available,
too, but who wants to ride a horse to the pyramids? I shopped
around, and we finally found the right camels for the right price
($13 for an hour and a half). It was upsetting to see how much
garbage was around the pyramids and how poorly maintained they
were.
</P>
<P>
   DECK THE (FORMER) WALL: The two days we spent in Berlin should
have been two weeks. We took in umpteen museums and a three-hour
walking tour. We walked through Tiergarten park, and the city's old
zoo, saw the Reichstag, the city's Brandenburg Gate, remnants of
the Berlin Wall, and ended at Checkpoint Charlie, the gateway for
foreigners between the two Berlins during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS AND DOLLS: A young girl with two Teletubbies peered out a
train window in an Antwerp, Belgium, train station, which was more
elaborate than a cathedral a few blocks away. The train station
stood about three stories and spanned two city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   SOARING OVER PRAGUE: One of the most majestic places in Europe
has to be Prague. I fell in love with it the first day. The locals
were all concerned about how prices have doubled and sometimes
tripled over the past few years due to the tourist dollar. We
thought everything was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   COWBOY JOE: A Barcelona street performer took time off from
working as a live statue of a cowboy for a hot cup of coffee on the
pedestrian street Las Ramblas. Passers-by would throw money into
his bucket and he would give a slight bend of the elbow and a
thumbs up. Other performers dressed as clowns, trees and silver
Roman figures. There also were artists and musicians on the street.
We spent Christmas at a nearby hostel called the Kabul, and instead
of the turkey dinner served in the hostel's kitchen, a group of us
opted for a little Pakistan/Mid-Eastern restaurant called El Gallo
Kirko. Chevy Chase's ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,''
dubbed in Spanish, was on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTING THE TOWN: A portrait artist waited in a courtyard in
Florence, Italy, for a client to paint. The city has terrific art
galleries, ancient buildings mixed with modern complexes, and
millions of mopeds. We stayed in a hostel that used to be a
convent.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIGHTS OF VENICE: After an all-night train ride from
Budapest, we were in Venice. A gondolier tied his gondola to a dock
off one of Venice's many canals. The first thing I noticed when we
emerged from the train station was the sound of water everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   LEAPING OVER TO ATHENS: On a trail leading up to the Parthenon
is a rock where people congregate to take in the city and relax. We
spent the day milling around the ancient ruins and the museum until
we were kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   WINDMILLS IN OUR MINDS: You'd think it would be easy to find a
windmill in Holland. We were told they were north of Amsterdam and
could be reached by bike. Finding them was difficult. We finally
just stumbled upon one. It had a sign in the front yard telling
tourists not to walk in, that it was a private residence.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNEY ON THE NILE: We sailed in a felucca (a sailboat) on the
Nile River from Aswan to Luxor, Egypt, and spent three days
stopping by temples and sleeping underneath the stars. I woke
before sunrise and saw a family pulling up to shore near our boat.
They were there to buy food and clothes in the market. The boy was
standing with two women dressed in traditional black waiting for
the men to tie the boat.
</P>
<P>
   BUDAPEST FEST: One night on the way back to our hostel, The
Yellow Submarine, we came across a group of about 200 Hassidic Jews
dancing and singing near the train station. We spent the next day
soaking in hot baths, getting massages and relaxing, all for about
$15. The city is famous for its mineral waters.

MARK MARTIN IS ONE TOUGH DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a gutty little guy. Plays with pain, as they say in
football.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets out of bed, Mark Martin hurts, yet he puts the pain
aside. It is mind over matter, and when he wants to, Martin can be
very focused.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his adult life, what Martin has focused most on is
driving a race car.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, given the level he competes at, that is enough. If
there is a driver in Winston Cup who can actually will himself to
win, that driver is Martin. A few others can match Martin's
intensity and concentration, but only a few.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, it has gotten tougher and tougher for
Martin to maintain his intensity. Drive a race car hard enough long
enough and you are almost certain to pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   A shredded tire sends you into the wall. A bump from behind
turns you sideways in front of oncoming traffic, which slams into
your car.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ran his first Winston Cup race in 1981 and the years have
taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, Martin is a physical fitness fanatic and that has no
doubt helped him. But there is still a bad back that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the wrecks. For example, Martin crashed during the
final practice in Daytona before this year's Pepsi 400. He broke
his left wrist, a bone in his left knee and a rib. Still, he was in
his car the next day, his crew helping pull him out the driver's
window after he finished 17th.
</P>
<P>
   The next week at New Hampshire, he was sixth despite going into
a spin after Kenny Irwin got into him.
</P>
<P>
   Such things are not recommended as part of the healing process,
but must be accepted if you continue to compete, and in Martin's
mind, there was never a thought of not competing.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that he continued to race, and last
Sunday, on the return trip to New Hampshire, his perseverance paid
off with a win, his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The wrist is better and the ribs are better and the knee is OK,
but the back is another story. Drivers have to decide for
themselves when not to race, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Elliott told me I was crazy,'' Martin said. ``He saw me
sitting sideways in the middle of the backstretch at New Hampshire.
He said I was crazy and should have been taking care of myself
instead of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking care of myself,'' Martin declared. ``I'm not done
driving, yet. When I am done, I'll be done. I'll be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not finished yet, so that means if I'm physically and
mentally capable of driving that race car, I'm going to drive it
every race until I decide that I've had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of this sport,'' Martin said. ``I have a
race team that has dedicated their lives to the effort, sponsors
who have dedicated their budgets, and I have more people riding on
what that 6-car does and what I do than the average person
realizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to drive the car and I'm going to do a good job. I
don't care if I've got broken bones or not,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a day of reckoning, it will come immediately
after the season ends, when Martin is scheduled to have an
operation on his troublesome back.
</P>
<P>
   After last year, he was to have surgery to correct a bulging
disc. But when an MRI disclosed that the bulge had disappeared,
Martin elected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, what about my pain?' And they said, `Well, your
pain is a deteriorating disc and the only alternative we have is
fusion.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's it, I'm outta here. We ain't been talking
about fusion. I've heard bad things about fusion.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I didn't have it done, but now I'm up for the fusion as
long as somebody will not guarantee me, but really convince me,
that I'm gonna be better after I have it,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he will simply keep on keeping on. And if he
does not have too many brushes with the wall, if he is not sent
spinning too many times, he will put the pain aside and go for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it is what Mark Martin does, that's why.

 &HT;    Medical thrillers pay off for former doctor
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Michael Crichton, Tess Gerritsen discovered that the pen is
mightier than the scalpel. Or at least more lucrative. A former
doctor who gave up medicine to raise her children, Gerritsen has
found a new career as the author of best-selling medical thrillers
such as ``Harvest'' and ``Life Support.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest novel, ``Gravity'' (Pocket, $24.95), has been sold to
New Line Cinema for $1 million and is scheduled to be a movie next
summer. ``Contact'' screenwriter Michael Goldenberg is developing
the novel for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity'' is a kind of ``Outbreak'' in space, she says.
``Anything that can go wrong, does go wrong.'' Set aboard a space
station, the story follows the efforts of Dr. Emma Watson to
control the outbreak of exotic DNA-mutating microbes called
Archaeons that could destroy humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Gerritsen, who lives in Maine with her physician husband, got
the idea for ``Harvest,'' her first blockbuster, while having
dinner with a police officer who had been traveling in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard from a Moscow cop that there were orphans vanishing
from the streets of Moscow, and the Russian police felt these kids
were being sent to the Middle East as organ donors. After trying to
convince people to look into it legally, with no response, I
decided to write a book. I like doing these kinds of novels because
suspense puts characters through the greatest crises they can
possibly face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerritsen will sign her novel at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Chapter 11
Discount Books in Alpharetta. 10945 State Bridge Road,
770-667-0023.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary gathering: More than 175 authors are expected at the
11th annual Southern Festival of Books Oct. 8-10 on the Legislative
Plaza in downtown Nashville. Headlining the event are Peter
Matthiessen (``Bone by Bone''), Scott Turow (``Presumed Innocent,''
``Personal Injuries''), Bobbie Ann Mason (``Clear Springs''),
Reynolds Price (``Letters to a Man in the Fire,'' ``Roxanna
Slade'') and Peter Guralnick (``Careless Love: The Unmaking of
Elvis Presley''). For a complete schedule, call 615-242-4400 or go
to www.tn-humanities.org on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Historical perspective: What a difference a century makes. In
his new book, ``London 1900: The Imperial Metropolis'' (Yale
University Press, $29.95), Georgia Tech history professor Jonathan
Schneer examines the capital city of the British empire at its peak
and follows the struggles of those who opposed racism and
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism pervaded every aspect of life, from advertisements on
down,'' Schneer says. ``Everything conspired to romanticize the
British empire.'' Even the London zoo, with its collection of
animals from British-controlled territories, reminded Londoners of
the vastness of the empire.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was a racist imperialist at the time, Schneer
notes. Some, such as African explorer Mary Kingsley, argued that
blacks were different, not inferior. And, in 1900, a group of black
Londoners organized a Pan-African Conference that was attended by
W.E.B. DuBois of Atlanta. It was a bold gesture at a time when Jim
Crow laws were at their height in America, Schneer says.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one lesson to be learned, Schneer concludes, it is
that empires come and empires go. ``The British thought they would
rule the world forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneer will talk about his book at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday in Room
177 of the Student Services Building, behind the Georgia Tech
Student Center. 225 North Ave., 404-894-3196.

 &HT;    Emotions ring false in story collection
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blurb on the book jacket tells us that Susan Perabo was the
first woman to play NCAA baseball, and that she has a place in the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   In the author's acknowledgments, she thanks the University of
Arkansas faculty ``for turning me from some pretty shaky raw
material into a writer, a teacher, and a reader of great books.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't sit in on one of Perabo's classes at
Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, where she teaches creative
writing, or check out her bedside reading, there's this, her debut
collection of stories. And while the verdict is still out on
whether the professors in Fayetteville can live up to their lofty
accolade, there are a couple of very nice reads in this promising,
albeit uneven, little volume.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo's modus operandi is to give ordinary life some cute
little quirk. But unlike a Guy de Maupassant or an O. Henry, who
saved their one-two punches until the end, she tells you what's
going on right up front, then asks you to tag along for the rest of
the ride. There's the Hollywood actor whose father turns out to be
a late-blooming kleptomaniac (``Thick as Thieves''). The woman who
splurges her inheritance on one of Princess Di's gowns (``Counting
the Ways''). The widow who pawns her silver and her car to buy
$35,000 worth of lottery tickets in nine months (``The Greater
Grace of Carlisle'').
</P>
<P>
   Only three stories into the book, a pattern emerges _ and it's
not that interesting as a literary device or a mirror of our times.
That we are more addicted to ephemeral pleasures than the ennobling
pursuits of the heart; that we trade in the currency of cash, not
love; that falling apart is easier than getting a life: Perabo has
fun pointing out what a sad, pill-popping, cigarette-smoking,
angst-ridden mass of humanity we are.
</P>
<P>
   But most of these stories are emotional duds with off-key humor.
Perhaps this collection wasn't a part of Perabo's master's thesis
at Arkansas, but at times it reads like it. This could be material
for a time capsule, but it doesn't serve the literature. As for the
comedy, one sometimes senses that Perabo needs you to write in the
margins: ``How clever!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It rained the morning of the day we killed Dennis Zeller,''
says the first sentence of ``Gravity,'' about two schoolgirls who
accidentally push their nemesis-bully over a precipice. Not only is
this story all cliff and no hanger, but it ultimately fails because
the characters feel so made up.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ... there's something awfully poignant about the man who
fakes amnesia to try to win back his wife (``Reconstruction'') or
the pyromaniac teenage girl whose cloudy, Xanax vision begins to
lift, thanks to the affection of her stepfather (``Some Say the
World''). If Perabo can get beyond the creative-writing mentality
and into the psychological resonance of the real world, she may end
up in the short-story writer's hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   For now, we recommend Laurie Colwin and Lorrie Moore.

 &HT;    Tasty details make `Times' tale a lively read
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a switch: an American royal family of high achievement
and glamour that isn't dogged by decline, scandal or tragedy.
Imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   The Ochs-Sulzberger clan, which founded and still runs The New
York Times, may not make juicy tabloid copy the way the Barrymores
and Kennedys have done, but theirs is a fascinating 100-year saga
of high ideals and power plays on the world stage. And oh yes,
there's enough family warfare and Machiavellian office politics to
keep the narrative lively. Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones tell
the story well.
</P>
<P>
   Too well, perhaps. Gassy at 780 pages, ``The Trust: The Private
and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times'' would make twice
the impact at half the length. It cries out for the ruthless blue
pencil of a Times editor.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``The Trust'' is good, though, it's very good. The first
200 pages have the built-in drama of the Times' unlikely rise from
a faltering daily in the 1890s to a great international organ by
the 1920s. The reason: Adolph Ochs. The ultimate Gotham outsider, a
newly arrived Jew from Chattanooga, where he owned another
struggling Times, Ochs was an inexhaustible entrepreneur. In the
early years the owner-publisher was always one step ahead of the
creditors, one inch from financial disaster, bluffing his way to
new loans with the illusion that everything was under control.
</P>
<P>
   Everything wasn't. Ochs was in constant crisis. Rival publisher
William Randolph Hearst (the model for ``Citizen Kane'') described
the Tennessean in his Journal-American as ``an oily little
commercial gentleman'' _ clear anti-Semitic code. The best revenge
for Ochs was the way he steamed past Hearst and other press lords,
achieving financial success with a journalistic quality and
integrity unmatched on the American scene.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ochs' and his descendants' well-founded fear of
appearing ``too Jewish'' became paranoia: The Times' article on the
liberation of Dachau never mentioned the word ``Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama droops when the publisher's mantle passes to Arthur
Hays Sulzberger, husband of Adolph's daughter Iphigene. Though more
than the steward of Adolph's vision, the suave, cocktail-swirling
Sulzberger had a comfortable enough tenure that he could spend a
lot of time with chorus girl mistresses. This slack center of the
book dwells on the Ochs-Sulzbergers' wealth and social whirl (``at
each place was a finger bowl, a hand-rolled ball of butter ...''),
as if targeted toward the crowd that devours books on the late
Princess Diana. You don't have to be a socialist to get testy with
the cushy lives of all the Sulzberger cousins and in-laws that we
don't need to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   One of Arthur and Iphigene's pampered kids was Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger, who can never quite shake his childhood nickname of
Punch _ a clue to why he was barely taken seriously until his 50s.
But Punch comes into his own, and the book regains its excitement,
in the late 1960s (page 480). He braves the threat of a government
lawsuit in deciding to publish the secret Vietnam documents known
as the Pentagon Papers. He pressures two of his distinguished
newsroom relatives into early retirement, causing a family uproar
but allowing new blood to rush in. Since the late '70s Punch, and
his brash son Arthur Jr., have in turn boldly remade the Times from
the Great Gray Lady of yore into a more colorful, surprising
chronicle of the age.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Iphigene, the Times' perennial ``gyroscope'' of
stability, its offstage ombudsman, with her cantankerous letters to
the editor published under a variety of assumed names.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of tasty detail pops up often in Tifft and Jones'
narrative, so you can forgive the breathless accounts of butter
balls. ``The Trust'' is thoroughly researched, entertainingly
written, and pulls no punches on the failings of the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The Ochs-Sulzbergers: a clan that didn't squander its gifts. Now
there's a man-bites-dog story.

HEMP BAR COMPANY UNDER GUN FROM DEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By MATT WEISER   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ Federal drug enforcement officials say that
a company here must forfeit its inventory of hemp-based food
products because it has been found to contain traces of the active
ingredient in marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastopol-based Nutiva says it was on the verge of runaway
success with its new hemp-seed-based nutrition bar, a rival for the
likes of Powerbar and other snack foods. It had hoped to capitalize
on growing public interest in the health benefits of hemp, driven
in part by a burgeoning hemp products industry that is largely
based in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   But now the company is struggling to fend off the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency, which has recently focused on the growing trade
in hemp seeds for food and health products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is coming right at a time when our sales are exploding,''
said Nutiva president John Roulac on Wednesday. ``You can't get
high on hemp seeds. People are buying our bar because it tastes
great and because of the nutritional benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nutiva bar is made in Canada using hemp seeds produced by
Kenex Ltd., an Ontario firm that bills itself as North America's
leading supplier of industrial hemp products.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, a shipment of Kenex hemp goods was seized in Detroit
by U.S. Customs officials, who determined from shipping manifests
that the goods did not meet America's zero-tolerance policy for
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the euphoria-producing active
ingredient in marijuana, hemp's botanical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   THC is a controlled substance under U.S. law and is not allowed
in commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenex shipment contained less than 10 parts per million of
THC, the allowable limit under Canadian law and an amount the
industry says could never produce a marijuana-like ``high.''
Nutiva, the broker and importer for Kenex products in the western
United States, says nutrition bars made from Kenex seeds are the
top-selling hemp-food product in America.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seizing the shipment, which was bound for other
U.S. customers, federal officials ordered Kenex to recall 17
earlier shipments of hemp-seed products, including those marketed
by Nutiva. The goods must be returned to the Detroit customs office
under penalty of a $500,000 fine and possible criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the DEA has allowed hemp seeds to be imported to
the United States as bird seed if shipments are sterilized so the
seeds cannot be germinated into a living plant. Bird breeders and
owners have long used hemp seeds as a health supplement for their
pets.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp seeds do not contain THC, but seeds often pick up the
chemical after coming in contact with leaves and stems during
harvesting. Most industrial hemp seed undergoes a rigorous cleaning
and sterilization process to remove remnants of THC.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian rules permit trace amounts of THC to remain on the
seeds at the time of sale, leading to the confusion that resulted
in the action by DEA and Customs.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that import hemp seeds from other suppliers
said they've experienced no problems at the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were just recently aware that the shipments that
were coming through did have THC,'' said John Holmes, supervisory
special agent with U.S. Customs in Detroit. ``At this point, if the
hemp seed has THC in it, then it is not allowable into the United
States. It is not permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   The action is baffling to Roulac and Kenex officials, who have
been bringing hemp seed into the United States for months without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point the DEA has chosen to interpret the U.S. law a
little differently than it has in the past,'' said Jean Laprise,
director of Kenex. ``It's basically crippled us. The majority of
our business is in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemp seed is rich in protein and Vitamin E. The shelled seeds
are about the size of sunflower seeds and taste similar. In
addition to its nutrition bars, Nutiva also markets raw hemp seed
used in cooking. It supplies hemp seed to 700 other businesses,
including several restaurants in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Candi Penn, a member of the board of directors of the Hemp
Industry Association, based in Occidental, said the DEA action
against Kenex comes at a critical time for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products are absolutely legal,'' said Penn, who noted
that hemp has grown to a $100 million industry this year, from just
$5 million in 1993. ``It's a potential for jobs in America. It's
baffling to see that they even want to stop it. Federal rules are
not keeping pace with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Roulac said he is consulting an attorney as he decides how to
respond to the federal order. In the meantime, his products are
staying put in his Southern California warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for another source of hemp seeds, but we could
be potentially liable,'' Roulac said. ``We've been advised that
they may be charging us with importing a controlled substance.''

RED STRIPE, TAKE ME AWAY!

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a long night. It's almost 10 p.m. Dallas time, your
flight to New York's La Guardia has been delayed for more than
three hours, and even if you left RIGHTNOWTHISVERYSECOND, you'd
still get into the city, oh, around 3 a.m. And your big-deal,
``gotta be there'' corporate breakfast meeting kicks off at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the pilot's voice crackles over the speakers. ``Ladies
and gentlemen, the storms have passed in New York and we've been
given clearance, so please return to your seats and we'll get
going. Flight attendants, prepare for departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers are still frantically stowing overhead luggage as the
plane backs away from the gate. Then, without warning, the interior
cabin goes pitch black. The vent system also shuts down. Eerily
silent, the packed plane coasts backward, just like a rowboat cast
from shore. And as we gradually roll to a stop, stalled like an
overheating '73 Mercury on a hot day, I think to myself, ``Boy, a
Red Stripe would taste pretty good right about now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, that wonderful Jamaican brew, which supposedly takes its
name from the stripe down the pants leg of Kingston's policemen.
Red Stripe is the flagship product of Desnoes &AMP; Geddes, the
Caribbean's largest brewery and a division of the giant Guinness
corporation. It's also strong (4.6 percent), so don't even think
about throwing down more than two Red Stripes in rapid succession,
or you'll be reelin' and a-rockin', rollin' till the break of dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Red Stripe comes in a distinctive, old-fashioned brown bottle
and requires an opener, and be careful as you pry the top off: More
than once, the bottles have snapped off at the neck as I've opened
them. But what's a little ground glass in your gullet when the
prize is as good as this?
</P>
<P>
   So as I sit in this winged, combustible liquid-filled aluminum
tube, passengers muttering and whispering to one another with
concern, I sit back and relax. I know it's just an auxiliary power
generator that failed, and we don't need it during flight, so I'm
not worried. And as the little orange tractor tows us back to the
gate for another try at New York, my mind is filled with pictures
of the bright blue waters of Jamaica, the friendly ``toot toot'' of
little motor scooters on crowded village streets, and the cool,
clean, refreshing taste of Red Stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, mister pilot: Could I possibly persuade you to change
our destination? First round's on me.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Honda and Toyota started with the same concept, an
automobile powered by both an internal-combustion engine and an
electric motor, and each company will begin shipping such hybrid
cars to dealers in a few months, the first of what
environmentalists hope will be a flood of innovative cars from
companies around the world. But the two Japanese companies that
will be the first to market have assembled similar ingredients into
products as different as a potato chip is from a French fry.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Insight will be in showrooms by December, the first
mass-produced hybrids offered for sale in this country. Two-seaters
vaguely reminiscent of the Honda CRX, which went out of production
in 1992, they will have an Environmental Protection Agency fuel
economy rating of more than 70 miles per gallon, the company said,
and will sell for less than $20,000, including amenities like
keyless entry and power windows (although with only a manual
transmission, at least for now). With a range of 600 to 700 miles
on a 10.4-gallon tank of plain old unleaded gasoline, they avoid
the electric car's dilemma of where to recharge and then, after 100
miles or so, where to recharge again, and then again.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Prius, already on sale in Japan and due here later in
the 2000 model year, is a four-seater that will go more than 60
miles on a gallon of gas, the manufacturer says. The car will sell
in the low $20,000 range _ more than a Corolla, which is about the
same size, and less than a Camry.
</P>
<P>
   With these pioneering hybrid vehicles in the marketplace, a new
question presents itself: How electric is a hybrid?
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, it does not matter, since both are far more
fuel-efficient than existing cars, and the Insight is substantially
cleaner, too. Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, said in a
statement that because of their cleanliness, fuel efficiency and
performance, ``hybrid cars can revolutionize the automobile
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But engineers' strategies differ. The Insight is a 73-horsepower
combination, of which 67 is produced by the gasoline engine and
just 6 by the electric motor. The 98-horsepower Prius has a balance
of 58 horsepower in the engine and 40 in the motor. The Prius runs
on electricity alone at low speeds; the Insight's motor is never
more than a helping hand for the gas engine.
</P>
<P>
   (The Prius represents not only a somewhat different use of
technology, but with four doors and four seats, it is also aimed at
a different market.)
</P>
<P>
   A third approach, a car with an electric-only system for turning
the wheels, and a tiny gasoline engine for charging the batteries,
has caught the attention of engineering students in university
competitions, because of its high potential for efficiency and
cleanliness. Engines running at constant speed can be tuned to run
very cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   The approach taken by Honda is what some engineers call a ``mild
hybrid,'' a vehicle with a small, supplemental electric system that
gets its charge by absorbing energy from the gas engine when the
car is not accelerating, or in absorbing mechanical energy and
converting it to current when the driver slows down. (Honda
designers say that mild hybrid is a vaguely derisive term that
originated with electric utilities disappointed that the vehicle
will not be charged from a wall socket.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its etymology, the mild hybrid is a conservative
idea, because the Insight can be driven even if the electric side
fails _ although it would perform ``like a dog,'' one Honda
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows the value of incremental steps. Dan W.
Reicher, an assistant energy secretary who drove around Washington
in one of the half-dozen Insights that Honda brought here last
week, said admiringly, ``It was remarkably unremarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The car demonstrates some neat technological tricks that could
show up in other hybrids or in other conventional vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   One is what Honda calls ``idle stop,'' which means that when the
speed slows to less than 5 mph, the engine shuts off. Push in the
clutch and throw the shift lever into first gear, and the engine
starts again. It is running smoothly before the driver can let the
clutch out.
</P>
<P>
   That is made possible by the nature of the electric motor, which
is doubling as a starter. In a conventional car, the starter is a
whiny little motor that drives the teeth of the flywheel. But in
the Insight, and possibly in conventional gasoline cars to come, it
is a big flat disk, just 2 1-3 inches wide, mounted between the
engine and the transmission. The rotor (the part that turns) is the
driveshaft of the car; the stator (the part with the magnets that
push the rotor) forms the outer circumference. Size and
configuration make it more powerful and less noisy than a
conventional starter.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Teves, a leading supplier of parts to the auto
industry, has been trying to sell such a system to car companies
for their conventional gasoline models.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight's engine is also a refinement. Displacing 995 cubic
centimeters, or less than the motor of a big motorcycle, it has a
plastic intake manifold and valve cover and an oil pan of
magnesium, which is 35 percent lighter than aluminum. To reduce
friction, it has four valves per cylinder and an offset crankshaft
to minimize side forces on the piston as it descends.
</P>
<P>
   All technologies would work well on a conventional car, as would
a smooth plastic bottom, another Insight refinement, and a total
weight 47 percent less than a similarly sized Civic hatchback's. In
fact, Honda says the Insight gets 85 percent better mileage than
the Civic; of that, 30 percent is due to a lighter, more
aerodynamic body. Another 30 percent is because of engine changes,
including four valves per cylinder and the offset crankshaft. But
the engine can also be smaller, because the electric motor meets
part of the peak power demand.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where even a mild hybrid makes a difference. The
gasoline engine can be smaller because where it is weakest _ at low
engine speeds and high demand, as when the stoplight turns green _
the electric motor is powerful, with high torque, or pulling power,
even at low speeds. The dashboard of the Insight has a small
display that indicates whether the electric system is charging or
assisting; whenever the gas engine is turning slowly, at times when
anyone used to a manual transmission would want to downshift, the
dashboard indicates that the electric assist is running, and not to
shift down. The motor is programmed to provide slightly more help
in the intervals between cylinder firings, to reduce the vibration
inherent in a three-cylinder engine, and a driver who resists the
temptation to downshift will achieve high fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   On a drive through the rolling hills of Maryland north of
Washington, the car climbed smoothly at 30 mph even in fifth gear.
At stop signs, downshifting engaged the electric motor in recharge
mode, recapturing the mechanical energy.
</P>
<P>
   Reicher, of the Energy Department, who oversees development
efforts for more exotic vehicles, gave the Insight high praise for
its ordinariness, which in this case may mean its marketability.
``I've driven many, many Hondas,'' he said, ``and it drove like a
nice Honda, like a regular car.''

KEN SCHRADER GETS A NEW RIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago when Andy Petree was walking around the
garage with a very upbeat attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He had just gotten a new sponsor, Oakwood Homes, for his Chevy.
He and Ken Schrader, his driver, had agreed to an extension of
Schrader's contract, although nothing was signed. And Sammy Johns
was working out well as crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   All of sudden, though, Petree is scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   First, Schrader shocked him by announcing he was leaving to take
Ernie Irvan's place in Read Morton's Pontiac. That immediately put
the deal with Oakwood Homes in jeopardy because it was Schrader who
brought Oakwood Homes to Petree.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Oakwood Homes is having financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Johns is leaving to go with Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   So suddenly, Petree has no driver, no crew chief and maybe no
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what happens with Schrader and
Johns. Morton's car has close ties to Hendrick Motorsports, which
supplies Morton's engines. And Hendrick's engines are among the
best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, one of the reasons Schrader left Petree was because
he felt Petree's engines were underpowered.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical move for Schrader. He will be 45 next year,
and this is probably his last chance to resurrect his career.
Schrader's last win came when he drove for Hendrick in 1991. It's
been a downhill slide since then.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his third year with Petree, his best finish with the team
is fourth, and he has not been in the top five in any race this
season.
</P>
<P>
   For Johns, this represents another potential step up. In his
first year as Schrader's crew chief, Johns hit it off with the
veteran driver, which is why Schrader is taking him along.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's ride is regarded as nearly as good as the one in Robert
Yates' Ford, which was taken by Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's team is only in its third year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   If Schrader and Johns can take advantage of the situation, it
will have a major impact on their careers.

 &HT;    U.S. FOOD AID PROGRAM FED RUSSIAN CORRUPTION, SENATE TOLD
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just days after Moscow asked for 5 million tons of
new U.S. food aid, a congressional panel was told Thursday that
previous food programs have nourished Russian official corruption
more than the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. food program in Russia is ``a major scandal,'' said
Peter Reddaway, a political science professor at George Washington
University and a leading scholar on Russia. He was describing more
than $1 billion in agricultural products sent to Russia during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pushed by our government because we wanted to help U.S.
farmers,'' he told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
``And it was pushed by corrupt elements in the Russian government
who wanted to benefit directly from it themselves'' and then sent
too late to be of help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the current U.S. program, American farmers
are paid for their products, which are shipped to Russia to be sold
at market value. The proceeds are supposed to go to the Russian
government's pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually nothing has gone into the Russian pension fund,''
Reddaway charged, in contradiction to the official U.S. government
position.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks appeared to surprise Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who
told the hearing that he had helped push through last year's food
aid for Russia after hearing ``bleak'' predictions of empty shelves
and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   But he told Reddaway, ``If you are correct, we should not be
going ahead with such a program.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as Moscow this week asked for close to double
the amount of aid it received under an agreement reached last year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said this week that the
Clinton administration was studying the new request and would make
a decision based in part on ``our experiences with the current
program.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the money that was supposed to be deposited in the
Russian pension fund, the U.S. State Department and Glickman
separately issued the same tersely worded statement that
``Currently, these deposits are being made on the agreed
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Reddaway's panning of the program, Agriculture
Department spokesman Andy Solomon said, ``Russia requested the
assistance, so they must believe it to be of some help to their
people.''
</P>
<P>
   American farmers are urging the extra assistance, which would
include at least 1 million tons of wheat. ``That's a good place to
start,'' said Dawn Forsythe, spokeswoman for U.S. Wheat Associates,
the export marketing arm of the wheat industry. ``Their bins are
empty and their harvest was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that her association saw ``no evidence of diversions''
of U.S. wheat shipped during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   However, she acknowledged other problems, including the fact
that the aid, which had been sought to help Russia make it through
the winter, did not begin arriving until March.

 &HT;    COMMUNIST CHINA STARTS 50TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION WITH SECURITY
LOCKDOWN
 &HT;    (EDs: Contains optional trim.)
 &HT;    With CHINA-CHRONO-1001.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Communist China began saluting 50 years of phenomenal
change Friday with an ironhanded security lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in central Beijing was immobilized one minute after
midnight. By dawn, four columns of tanks, mobile artillery guns and
other armored vehicles had lined up in a camouflage-green phalanx
on the Avenue of Perpetual Peace, awaiting the order to start the
first military parade through Tiananmen Square in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting soldiers were gathered to step smartly in the company
of 25 groups of weapons, from tanks to radars to the new ``East
Wind 31'' intercontinental ballistic missile. And the air force was
about to unveil its new ``Flying Leopard'' fighter plane in a
screaming flyover of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian groups and 91 floats from all over China were primed to
round out the parade, evening extravaganza and colossal fireworks
scheduled to keep central Beijing paralyzed for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of police isolated the heart of the capital
before dawn Friday in a form of martial law aimed at guaranteeing
that no disruption _ or any speck of spontaneity _ would sully the
$36 million festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 marchers and entertainers were as carefully picked
and placed as the 500,000 potted flowers stuck all over the city in
metal frames, shaped into huge boats, shooting stars or
gaily-colored columns.
</P>
<P>
   To assure none strayed from key nationalistic themes,
participants had a list of 50 approved slogans to shout, such as
the less-than-trenchant: ``Stress theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct!''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour parade hailed China's progress, with floats
including replicas of a space rocket launch and a snowy peak in
Tibet, where mountaineers surrounded by rainbows planted China's
red flag with five yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   The troops, Communist Party cadres, bouncy youth groups and
ethnic minorities in multi-colored costumes would march down the
Avenue of Perpetual Peace, the capital's biggest east-west
boulevard, to be reviewed by President Jiang Zemin near the
entrance to the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was shaping up as an eccentric combination of the
dour Stalinesque might of Moscow's Cold War processions in Red
Square and the pastel pageantry of Psdadena's New Year's Day Rose
Bowl parades.
</P>
<P>
   Central Beijing started shutting down at noon Thursday, when two
lines of troops carrying bull-horns swept across Tiananmen Square
to evict thousands of strolling Chinese and foreign tourists.
Bomb-sniffing German shepherd dogs followed.
</P>
<P>
   Then offices and shops along the parade route were searched,
locked and sealed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sidewalks closed around the Forbidden City Thursday,
gray-haired Du Zhiying, 70, was having his picture taken before the
ever-present portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motherland has prospered,'' said Du, who was in Tiananmen
Square the day 50 years ago when the late Great Helmsman Mao
declared the People's Republic of China into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Du came from Shanxi Province for the celebration, but the
lifelong party bureaucrat said he was afraid he wouldn't get within
sight of Friday's events. They were open only to officials and
invited guests, and he was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also tried to guarantee control by turning down
pollution, turning out itinerant workers and tuning off beepers and
mobile telephones that might interfere with military
communications.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's pollution is so foul that it obscured the last display
of military air power in 1984 during New China's 35th anniversary,
so factories this year got orders to shut down smoke-belching
furnaces 10 days before the event.
</P>
<P>
   No military parade was held for the 40th anniversary, a bleak
celebration in 1989 that came just months after tanks and soldiers
had made an unscheduled, blood-filled appearance, driving down the
same parade route and into Tiananmen Square to quell weeks of
student-led protests.
</P>
<P>
   Then, no one wanted a reminder of the efficiency of China's
military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mood is brighter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese live enormously better than they did 50, 20 or even 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Life was genuinely grim in 1949 when Mao Tse-tung stood atop the
Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the meaning of his army's
victory in a vicious civil war. Hearts lifted with his proclamation
of a new era: ``We, the 475 million people of China, have now stood
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then a peasant family may have shared a single pair of
pants among 10 people who took turns going outside. Life expectancy
was 35 years, and education an extravagance for a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't change quickly. After a modest start into
industrialization, expanded education and agricultural renewal,
Mao's bizarre notions of continuing revolution sent China into one
chaotic frenzy after another.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Leap Forward. The Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stilted titles lay famine, smeared reputations and
tens of millions of deaths. Mao and his minions nearly wasted a
generation of youth sent not to school but to pound stones or dig
potatoes into the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the relative calm and bloom of prosperity
brought by subsequent leaders _ initiated with the reforms of the
late Deng Xiaoping _ the Chinese people have been forced to do
without free expression and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Economic gains have been remarkable since Deng's reform began in
1978. China has become the world's 11th largest trading power,
churning out a gross domestic product, or GDP, of $96 billion last
year after a decade of average growth rates surpassing 10 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy now is 71 years. Illiteracy is less than 15
percent, mostly among elderly and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stirrings of protest, targeting both political restrictions
and uneven economic distribution, have the communist leadership on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   To head off public dissent, especially in the anniversary
run-up, authorities have taken drastic steps.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16,000 migrant workers were expelled from Beijing, and
thousands more Chinese without proper papers were dumped in
detention centers. Beggars, peddlers and prostitutes were driven
from streets. Even Chinese tour groups were forbidden to enter the
capital for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt called ``operation strike hard'' produced
the arrests since summer of nearly 70,000 people officially
described as ``escaped'' or ``wanted'' criminals. Human rights
groups said democracy activists and religious leaders also have
been detained.
</P>
<P>
   The most sweeping control directive was the July outlawing of
the Falun Gong, a quasi-religious exercise and meditation group
claiming to have 100 million followers. After thousands of
adherents ringed the center of government in a silent protest in
April, authorities made mass arrests and banned public practice of
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The group's vibrant popularity among all classes and types of
Chinese was attributed to one factor the Communist Party has not
been able to control: the void in values so many Chinese want to
fill.

U.N. TO INVESTIGATE RIGHTS ABUSES IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA) 
(th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Overriding Indonesian objections to an
international investigation into human rights violations in East
Timor, Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Thursday for a report on
abuses in the territory to be conducted by an international panel
of experts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission voted on Monday to establish an
outside investigation, in which Asians would be involved. But the
panel rejected Asian requests to let Indonesia's rights commission
do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Annan asked for a report by Dec. 31. It will cover all of 1999,
because violence began soon after President B.J. Habibie of
Indonesia announced in January that he would offer East Timor
autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the high commissioner for human rights who will
organize the investigation, said she would be cooperating with the
Indonesian human rights commission, which has asked her for help in
starting its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, she said that the Indonesians
would have more ready access to West Timor and other places where
international investigators could not automatically go.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said West Timor was a high priority because of
continuing reports of intimidation of East Timorese forced into
camps there. West Timor, which shares an island with East Timor, is
undisputed Indonesian territory.
</P>
<P>
   An American diplomat said Thursday that the United States was
considering sending a high-level envoy to West Timor to try to
determine the extent of dangers to refugees there. Julia Taft, the
assistant secretary of state for refugees, visited West Timor last
week and sent back a report that American officials called
``chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said she was concerned about many reports of
abuses against women in West Timor that reached her when she
visited Darwin, Australia, recently to talk with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard very alarming allegations that even in the boats
taking them that women were raped constantly, frequently, and that
in three camps this continued to be a pattern of rape and sexual
assault,'' she said. She added that she was given similar accounts
in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said she was confident that cases against rights
violators could be built relatively quickly in the case of East
Timor, where pro-Indonesian militias backed by the military were on
a rampage for more than a week after the voting results showed that
the people of the territory had chosen independence by a wide
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a very large number of witnesses of violations, and
they know who the perpetrators were,'' Mrs. Robinson said. ``They
know the names.''

COHEN ADMONISHES INDONESIA FOR `ABETTING' VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA-U.N.-RIGHTS) 
(th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Defense Secretary William Cohen met with
Indonesia's president and its top general Thursday and admonished
the military for ``aiding and abetting'' a terror campaign by
militias in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President B.J. Habibie and the armed forces
chief, Gen. Wiranto, Cohen issued a written statement that called
on Indonesia's military to punish those responsible for the
violence and to disarm militias that have taken refuge in West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Bangkok, Cohen said he believed that
Indonesia's leaders were committed to the success of the
Australian-led U.N. peacekeeping effort in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Australian Embassy here, hundreds of protesters
massed, burning debris and an Australian flag, throwing stones and
home-made gasoline bombs. Other protests erupted elsewhere in the
capital and around the country, including the provinces of Aceh and
Irian Jaya, both home to their own independence movements.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of a new security law last week by the outgoing
legislature giving the military new powers to quell unrest has
sparked violent student protests. ``The situation in East Timor has
weakened Habibie in a way that has strengthened the military,''
said Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, foreign intervention in East Timor has
unleashed a torrent anti-Western sentiment that has unnerved some
foreign executives, jeopardizing trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto denied rumors Thursday that the military might respond
to growing civil unrest by taking political control. Nonetheless,
he has been cast as a political kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Wiranto summoned the leaders of the country's six
major parties to discuss how the new legislature would be run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't put tanks in the street, but behind the scenes they
are sending a clear message that they want to control the
situation,'' a European banker said.

ALL-TO-FAMILIAR THEMES LEAVE `ALASKA' BEREFT OF MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have sledded through ``Cool Runnings,'' skated past sequels
to ``The Mighty Ducks'' and now we're being snowballed by another
winter sports movie, ``Mystery, Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone noticed all these films come from the same
distributor and they all tell the same feel-good,
triumph-over-adversity story?
</P>
<P>
   Disney seems intent upon overdosing audiences with the little
guy proving himself against a seemingly superior force _ in this
case the New York Rangers hockey team. But no matter how warmly you
dress ``Mystery, Alaska'' with a top-notch cast that includes
Russell Crowe (``L.A. Confidential''), Hank Azaria and Burt
Reynolds, the film never achieves anything new or more enlightening
than Disney's earlier efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Team Mystery members play an ice hockey match every Saturday
morning. They're more devoted to the sport than they are to church
or their families. Hockey is the passion of the town of Mystery and
each of its 633 residents joins in to root for the oddball team
which includes solid Sheriff John Biebe (Crowe), sweet playboy
Skank Marden (Ron Eldard) and speed-skating teen-wonder Stevie
Weeks (Ryan Northcott).
</P>
<P>
   But when Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) returns home for one of
his infrequent visits, Team Mystery is about to become big news.
Danner left years before, chafing from small-town life, to pursue a
career as a journalist in the big city. He recently has written an
article for Sports Illustrated about the team and he's also the
ex-boyfriend of Biebe's wife, Donna (Mary McCormack).
</P>
<P>
   Danner devises a plan to pit Team Mystery against the
professional New York Rangers. Soon nerves will fray,
</P>
<P>
   relationships frazzle, dark secrets emerge and Mystery's
residents will wake up and find out what they're really made of.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jay Roach (the two ``Austin Powers'' movies) meanders
through rambling, heart-tugging, try-too-hard material that holds
few surprises. To his credit, he makes Mystery a place of somber,
icy beauty that is, unfortunately, thawed by the predictable
actions of its inhabitants. Try as he may, he can't transcend the
fact that ``Mystery, Alaska'' never sheds a TV-movie sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense when you look at the writing credits and notice
that Emmy-winning boy wonder, David E. Kelley _ who has created
everything from ``Ally McBeal'' to ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Picket
Fences'' and ``The Practice'' on the small screen _ co-wrote the
film with Sean O'Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' resembles Kelley's award-winning series with
its strong women, frenetic pacing, eccentricities and survival of
the underdog under adverse conditions. Kelley knows what audiences
emotionally respond to, but by stretching his trademark themes past
the running time of a TV program, he produces too little, too late
and for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery, Alaska. Directed by Jay Roach. Written by David E.
Kelley, Sean O'Byrne. Cast: Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Mary
McCormack, Burt Reynolds, Ron Eldard. Hollywood Pictures. 118
minutes. Rated R for language, nudity.

IT'S HARD TO LIVE WITHOUT TELEVISION
</HEADLINE>
  (For release October 7)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our family intended to go TV-free this summer.
</P>
<P>
   All summer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching reruns, I decided, we'd visit the
neighborhood pool, play whiffle ball in the back yard, go on
minivacations and camping trips, and visit friends.
</P>
<P>
   We started off with a bang, by sending the 21-inch Magnavox in
our living room home with my newly retired father-in-law. When the
kids hit the couch after school, staring at the spot where the TV
used to be, I saw how entrenched our viewing habits had become.
</P>
<P>
   The next to go was the RCA in the basement rec room, which we
were going to simply unplug for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, however, presented a new excuse for leaving the tube
tethered just a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   First, my 8-year-old had his tonsils out and had to stay inside
and quiet for several days. ``I understand and applaud your
intentions,'' said his doctor. ``But now would really not be the
time to take away TV.'' And then, catching himself, he added:
``Heaven forbid he should actually have to read books for the whole
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, forcing a TV-free zone on a hurting kid was more than I
could justify, so we positioned our son on the basement couch with
pillows, Popsicles and the remote.
</P>
<P>
   After Adam healed, a family of eight came to visit. Great, I
thought _ backyard kickball games, cookouts, tours of local parks.
Then it rained the whole weekend. The crew camped out in the
basement, eating pizza, playing Nerf tag and watching every video
on the shelf, from the ``Star Wars'' trilogy to ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, excuse followed excuse: my parents came
to visit (my dad's a news junkie; my mom loves to follow her team
sports) national events broke, a special work project HAD to get
done on a Saturday, the kids were having meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   At times, allowing an hour of ``Winnie-the-Pooh'' or
``Wishbone'' was, I believe, what saved my delicate sanity.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not opposed to TV per se _ I enjoy vegging out in front of
``Ally McBeal'' or ``Profiler'' after the kids are in bed. My
husband will watch if I have the set on but is indifferent to most
TV viewing, preferring to build a bookshelf or get that elusive
eight hours of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   And the kids were getting just a little too comfortable with
marathon cartoon sessions when mom and dad weren't paying strict
attention. A half-hour would slip into an hour and a half of
``Scooby Doo'' without even trying.
</P>
<P>
   At best, we probably managed just a few weeks without any TV at
all.
</P>
<P>
   During one of those, Adam and Sarah were playing on the plastic
gym in the yard, staring through a square-shaped hole in the side.
``Hey, this is just like watching TV,'' Adam said, captivated by
the framed view of sky, pine tree and squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   Now that fall is here, school has resumed, and schedules are
back to normal, the kids get their regular half-hour on school
nights/hour on weekends of screen time (computer or TV.)
</P>
<P>
   But we're still down to being a one-TV household. And aiming to
stay that way.

`ELMO IN GROUCHLAND' RETURNS TO THE MUPPETS' WINNING WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For parents who have been holding their breath in anticipation
of a film geared specifically to toddlers and younger kids, it's
time to exhale. ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' will
entertain youngsters and reassure parents worried about scary or
inappropriate content.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this episode of Muppet mayhem veers away from the
glitzy format that made ``Muppets From Space'' so mediocre and
derivative of adult movies. Instead it remains faithful to the
essence of ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma in the film is simple: Elmo learns about sharing
after his beloved, fuzzy, blue blanket falls into Oscar's trash can
house. In his anxiousness to get it back, he mistakenly opens a
Pandora's Box of a door that transports him into Grouchland, a
place where it's against the law to ask for help, the daily paper
is
</P>
<P>
   The New York Slimes, residents get their hair done at the ``ugly
parlor'' and movie idol Sharon Groan is starring in ``Basically It
Stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmo, followed by some loyal Muppet (and human) friends, must
leave Sesame Street and make a quest to get his best blue friend
back from the greedy, selfish cad Huxley (Mandy Patinkin), a bad
guy with eyebrows that ``need a weed-whacking'' who rules over
Grouchland by taking everything from its inhabitants and then
hoarding it in his castle.
</P>
<P>
   On his journey, Elmo meets the Queen of Trash (Vanessa Williams)
and must face a ritual in self-esteem. Ultimately, he both teaches
and learns some other lessons in friendship and selfishness and how
the two just don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' also invites kids to
help Elmo on his Oz-like journey. There is an interactive,
shout-it-out ease to the film that is playful and pulls from the
same education-based format as the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   While adults may feel out of their league, there are a few jokes
that will appeal to them. And if the kids and toddlers who attended
a screening of the film last week are any indication, Elmo and his
pals just might have made a successful transition from ``Sesame
Street'' in this elemental adventure about manners.
</P>
<P>
   The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. Directed by Gary
Halvorson. Written by Mitchell Kriegman, Joseph Mazzarino. Cast:
Mandy Patinkin, Vanessa Williams. Columbia Pictures. 77 minutes.

TV AND BLACK-EYED PEAS TEACH NEOPHYTE SURGEONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If you want to be a surgeon, pickin' black-eyed peas
may be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Pickin' 'em up and puttin' 'em in your ``pocket'' _ a small
container with a hole in the top _ is not as easy as it sounds.
Especially when you are picking them up with a blunt-nosed pincers
with a 24-inch handle under a foam table while watching what you
are doing only indirectly, on a TV monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds confusing, but practicing laparoscopic surgical
technique is much safer this way. If a pea gets smashed or goes
squirting out of the grasper's clutch, you can always grab another.
That's not so with a slippery, diseased gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``slam dunk,'' the drill is designed to help train
the surgeon to use the nondominant hand and develop better hand and
eye coordination.
</P>
<P>
   I'm at the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, testing a
virtual-reality surgical simulator that is part of HealthExpo, the
exhibit that fills the Hall of State. My surgical assistant is Nick
Gabriel, a general surgeon and postdoctoral fellow with the Yale
University School of Medicine's Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Center.
</P>
<P>
   He and his boss, Dr. James ``Butch'' Rosser Jr., also at Yale
(and who joins us from there on a monitor via cyberspace), say the
virtual reality simulator can dramatically change the way surgeons
are trained. The two conduct two-day laparacopic ``boot camps,'' in
which they have trained more than 500 surgical residents. They say
they can train anybody to do minimally invasive laparoscopic
surgery in two days. (Anyone who has a dominant hand, maybe, I
think.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to deliver the highest quality care to
everyone on the planet, no matter where they are,'' Gabriel says.
</P>
<P>
   Rosser developed the training kit for the simulator and many of
the instruments as well as the book, CD-ROM and video that go with
it and uses them to ``telementor'' surgeons in small hospitals in
remote areas all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make the equipment,'' Rosser explains. ``I work with
manufacturers to integrate the equipment and the technology to work
in ways they didn't plan. We can now teach people to use the
equipment and guide them while they do their first few surgeries _
from thousands of miles away. I can go everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And he virtually does. For example, from the familiar
surroundings of his own surgical suite in New Haven, Conn., Rosser
recently directed a surgeon in Hawaii through his first complicated
laparoscopic procedure to cure a patient of chronic heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   But do these people from Yale think they can really teach
``anyone'' to do laparoscopic surgery in two days? Drills to help
master ``the terrible triangle'' convinced me that I have no
dominant hand. All these years I've thought I was right-handed, but
I'm really no better at maneuvering surgical instruments that I
can't see with my right hand than I am with my left.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible triangle is that formed by three trocars (sharp
hollow tubes) stuck through three tiny incisions that give access
to the inside of the abdomen without cutting open the patient. The
portals are for two long-handled graspers that can hold scissors,
scalpel, needle or other surgical necessities, and the tiny camera
that shows you what you are doing _ if it's at the proper depth and
angle.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel holds the camera steady and talks me through a more
difficult exercise, known as the ``Cobra Rope Drill,'' where one
examines the loops of the small bowel by running a coiled rope from
end to end, handing it off from one grasper to the next, every four
inches or so.
</P>
<P>
   I lost the bowel twice and had to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I just need to work on picking some more of those peas.
</P>
<P>
   FYI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the State Fair of Texas in Dallas can practice
laparoscopic surgery at the HealthExpo in the Hall of State, 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. daily through Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   These visitors can also enter a ``Jedi Knight'' contest, testing
their dexterity at laparoscopic skills. The winner will be invited
to participate in a skills shootout at the American College of
Surgeons meeting in San Francisco on Oct. 11-14.
</P>
<P>
   Planners say about 250,000 of the State Fair's total 3.4 million
visitors are expected to participate in HealthExpo, which also
includes 35 computer terminals where visitors can log on to all the
best health Web sites and a celebrity kitchen where they can learn
gourmet-style healthful cooking.

FLASHY `PLUNKETT' HAS TOO MUCH MTV, TOO LITTLE SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not an original idea rattling around in the empty-headed
but gorgeous-to-behold period film, ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane.''
</P>
<P>
   Its story is a borrowed mish-mash of plot points from ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``Tom Jones,'' ``Robin Hood'' and
even ``The Duellists,'' which was directed by Ridley Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And that's an important note because ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' is
the debut film from Jake Scott, son of Ridley (``Bladerunner,''
``Thelma and Louise'') and nephew of Tony (``The Hunger,'' ``Top
Gun''). A young Jake even had a small role in ``The Duellists,''
his dad's 1978 classic about honor set during the Napoleonic Wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' is as achingly atmospheric as Ridley and
Tony Scott's movies but Jake hasn't yet learned to overcome his MTV
and television commercials background and mentality. The film will
most likely please those with a short attention span because it's
illogically plotted, jam-packed with a bizarre, out-of-place rock
music soundtrack and contains lots of holes and silliness. But its
glittery, lavish sets and costumes almost convince us we're viewing
a guilty pleasure in the making.
</P>
<P>
   It also wastes a talented cast. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert
Carlyle, who starred together in ``Trainspotting,'' at least have
screen time, but actress Liv Tyler and especially Alan Cumming, the
scene-stealing, lascivious actor who won a Tony for his portrayal
of the emcee in the Broadway production of ``Cabaret,'' are given
little to do but pose and pout.
</P>
<P>
   In this ``buddy movie'' based on real-life characters, the
low-class Plunkett (Carlyle) and Captain James Macleane (Miller), a
gentleman who lives for pleasure, meet in debtors prison. The pair
buy their way to freedom after they cut a ruby out of a corpse.
They begin a new life in 1748 London with Plunkett planning their
criminal undertakings while Macleane handles the carnal pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   That changes after Macleane spies the niece of the Lord Chief
Justice Gibson (Michael Gambon), the spirited Lady Rebecca (Tyler).
Macleane falls in love and Lady Rebecca struggles to thwart the
advances of the odious and nefarious Thief Taker General Chance
(Ken Stott), her uncle's ambitious second-in-command. She, too, is
smitten.
</P>
<P>
   Before long Plunkett and Macleane have become infamous as
highwaymen, robbing coaches crammed full of drippingly decadent
nobles that pass along the road at night. Chance desperately wants
to bring down the thieves in order to advance his career. But the
duo have already become folk heroes to the poor, who applaud their
every move.
</P>
<P>
   If this story line sounds familiar, it's because it has been a
staple in films for decades. ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' almost
convinces us it's a little different because of its breathtaking
production design and costuming. But don't be fooled. Beneath its
extraordinary exterior coat of paint is a less-than-ordinary film.
Jake Scott has clearly inherited the family's artistic eye but
he'll need to brush up on his continuity and story skills if he's
to surpass his dad's already legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett &AMP; Macleane. Directed by Jake Scott. Written by Robert
Wade, Neal Purvis, Charles McKeown. Cast: Jonny Lee Miller, Robert
Carlyle, Liv Tyler, Alan Cumming. USA Films. 102 minutes. Rated R
for violence, sexual content.

   JAPAN-NUKE (Tokyo) _ A major leak at a uranium-processing plant
in northeastern Japan on Thursday sent radiation levels
skyrocketing and contaminated dozens of workers, sending at least
three to the hospital. (Summary from wires) By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BRADLEY-DEBATE (Los Angeles) _ Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley are likely to take part in an unusually
early and intense series of debates in the run-up to the primary
season next year. Their campaigns said Thursday that the first
nationally televised event will take place only four weeks from now
in New Hampshire. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-INCOME (Washington) _ Lifted by the strong economy, the
typical American household finally regained in 1998 the income it
had lost since 1989, to recession, wage freezes, downsizing and the
competition of foreign workers. Rising incomes brought 1.1 million
poor Americans out of poverty last year, the Census Bureau reported
yesterday, and while blacks failed to gain ground on either the
poverty or income fronts, as they had in 1997, they held onto the
gains that have come to them as a result of the boom that began
four years ago By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-TREATY (Washington) _ In an abrupt but calculated reversal,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Thursday offered to schedule a
vote on a treaty banning nuclear testing, one of President
Clinton's top foreign policy goals. He made the offer apparently
confident that the treaty will not be approved. By Eric Schmitt.

BUSH CAMP REMOVES NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST FROM BOOK PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By WENDY BENJAMINSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
has removed a newspaper columnist as the ghostwriter of his
autobiography in a dispute over how many policy details the book
should contain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign Communications Director Karen Hughes will complete
the book and her name will appear as the ghostwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Herskowitz, a Houston Chronicle sports columnist, said
his initial deal with the Texas governor was that the book would be
``30 percent biography, 70 percent issues and (campaign)
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes disagreed, saying that it was to be a ``broad-strokes
book on the governor's themes and philosophies and how he arrived
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz said, however, that when he finished the biographical
portion of the book last summer, working under a July deadline, he
sought detailed policy positions from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, he said, the Bush campaign delivered to his house a
carton containing 1,000 speeches from which, he believed, he was to
glean Bush's stands on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually five speeches the governor has given 200
times,'' Herskowitz said. ``There was no way I could write 70
percent of a book off that material.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz said the candidate's staff told him that Bush's
positions on issues were ``still evolving.'' He added that Hughes
did not want the book to contain specific positions on certain
issues, ``nothing that could be criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting among Hughes, Herskowitz and Bush, they decided
that Hughes would complete the policy portion of the book and take
the ghostwriting credit. Herskowitz, Hughes said, would receive an
acknowledgment for ``getting the project started.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she and Bush never wanted the book to be the
``typical guide to the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was supposed to be biographical and philosophical,
giving insight into the themes he is using in the campaign and how
he arrived at them,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Herskowitz's initial chapters, Hughes said, ``We
decided to get a book done that was insightful about the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Wachtel, an executive editor at William Morrow &AMP; Co.
Inc., which is publishing the book, said she was not satisfied with
Herskowitz's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't seen the manuscript,'' she said. ``None of his
material is in the book. We got some chapters from him we found
unacceptable. We went to the Bush campaign and now we have a book
we're very happy with.''

BOND PRICES UP FOR 1ST TIME IN 4 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices were up for the first time in
four days Thursday, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Revised data on economic growth significantly eased investor
concern that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest
rates at Tuesday's monetary policy meeting. The bounce in prices
was most likely the result of the oversold conditions in the market
and an unwillingness among market participants to drive prices
lower at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some window dressing by portfolio managers at the
end of the fiscal quarter was at work, spurring a little buying
from Asian accounts overnight. The short maturities were firmer as
market participants parked cash in them. Despite Thursday's gains
in stocks, there was still a flight to quality toward the
government bill market as many investors remained nervous and
sought safe haven in the liquid market for Treasuries. Other
analysts noted widespread declines in commodity prices, which are
viewed by some as barometers of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today looked more like a laundry list of excuses,'' said Kim
Rupert, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a market research
firm in San Francisco. ``But it's more the case that sellers are
taking a breather, leaving buyers in charge today.''
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 1 4/32, to 101 5/32,
while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, stood at
6.04 percent, down from 6.12 percent on Wednesday. The bond yield
is only slightly lower for the month of September.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management,
said he believed the Fed would leave monetary policy unchanged when
the Federal Open Market Committee gathers for its October meeting
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fine went on to say that ``at this juncture, a
tightening at the November FOMC forum is still clearly on the
table, with the ultimate decision a function of the extent of any
economic deceleration, the path of the inflation indicators and the
direction of equity prices during the intervening period.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine added: ``A further sharp correction in the stock market
could quickly produce an economic slowdown via its impact on
consumer spending, which could well obviate the need for further
Fed tightening over the near term, should it occur. However,
recently released economic statistics are still suggesting a
buoyant pace of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that second-quarter gross domestic product was revised
downward slightly to 1.6 percent, but all indications point to a
noticeable rebound in gross domestic product growth during the
third quarter. And, he said, August new-home sales were
surprisingly strong, with the near-record pace certainly not
indicative of an economic slackening.

GUENTER GRASS, GERMANY'S POSTWAR CONSCIENCE, WINS NOBEL PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Guenter Grass, whose epic first novel, ``The Tin
Drum,'' first tackled the theme of Germany's agonized identity,
which he has examined from various angles throughout his life, was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday by the Swedish
Academy in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Uncompromising in his political stances, often headily evocative
in his rhythmic prose, Grass, 71, has probed the development of
Germany from Nazism through Cold-War division to unification with a
relentlessly vivid eye. He became the first German to receive the
prize since Heinrich Boell in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy said Grass'
``frolicsome black fables portray the forgotten face of history.''
It praised his gift for ``reviewing contemporary history by
recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers and
lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 20th century's fictional characters, perhaps few are
as memorable as Oskar Matzerath, the boy with the tin drum and
glass-shattering voice who stopped growing and so passes largely
unnoticed as he observes the horror of the Nazi years with an
unwavering gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entire credulous nation believed, there's faith for you, in
Santa Claus. But Santa Claus was really the gasman,'' Oskar
observes in ``The Tin Drum'' as he contemplates Germany's pious
infatuation with Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The raw power of such writing propelled the book, published in
1959, to worldwide fame and helped revive German literature after
what the Swedish Academy called ``decades of linguistic and moral
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass was en route to the dentist Thursday in Luebeck, his
hometown in northern Germany, when informed of the prize. Later, he
said, ``It's a great joy for me, not just for myself but for all
German literature, which is honored with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncharacteristically patriotic remark from a man who
was bitterly critical of German unification in 1990, describing it
as another Anschluss and insisting that Auschwitz should have made
a united Germany forever impossible because it demonstrated that
such a country was a danger to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Solidly built, his face dominated by mischievous eyes and a
drooping walruslike mustache, Grass has never shied away from
challenging what he has often seen as his country's bourgeois
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   He explored his anger, and angered many of his countrymen, in
his major novel of the 1990s, ``Ein Weites Feld.'' Published in
1995 and translated as ``A Broad Field,'' the book was widely
criticized in Germany for its portrayal of ignorant and avaricious
business tycoons taking over the ``people's property'' of the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the work, whatever the criticism, captured the mutual
incomprehension that had plagued Germany's attempts at integration
throughout the 1990s, and the academy said that it confirmed ``the
author's position as the great prober of the history of this
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass, whose passionate engagement in German society is utterly
removed from the minimalist introspection of some modern
literature, said Thursday: ``A writer must not only fulfill
literary obligations, but also those of a citizen by being involved
politically. I hope that young writers remember this in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The admonition came from a man who has repeatedly found
inspiration in the turbulence and tragedy of 20th-century German
life. Among Grass' best-known books, all published in the United
States, are ``Cat and Mouse'' (1961) and ``Dog Years''(1963), which
with ``The Tin Drum'' make up the ``Danzig Trilogy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 came ``The Flounder,'' a bustling and mischievous yarn
woven from world history in which the destructiveness of men is
contrasted with the achievements and sanity of women. This year
Grass published ``My Century: A Novel of Stories,'' which is a
running commentary on his times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prize was long overdue,'' said Martin Walser, a prominent
German writer. ``Grass deserved to win the Nobel Prize for `The Tin
Drum' alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last year Walser said that he was impatient with
constant reminders of the Holocaust, remarks that prompted debate
in Germany and revealed the uneasy conscience and uncertain
national identity so often examined by Grass.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 16, 1927, in Danzig, now Gdansk, Poland, Grass saw the
rise of Nazism as a child and was drafted into the army in 1944. He
narrowly escaped death when many 17-year-old members of his company
were ripped to shreds by shelling. Later, when Germany surrendered,
he was captured by the U.S. Army and briefly held.
</P>
<P>
   Grass worked on a farm, in a mine and as an apprentice
stonemason before studying sculpture and beginning to write poems
and plays in the 1950s. He also worked as a journalist and
illustrated some of his books. A first marriage to a Swiss dancer,
Anna Margareta, ended in divorce after the birth of four children;
Grass married Ute Grunert in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was indelibly influenced by his youth, which was shaped by
war, the loss of a home that disappeared into Poland and
involvement with a Nazi convulsion for which he was too young to
bear any responsibility but whose guilt he could not escape. He was
just too old for what Helmut Kohl, born in 1930, later called ``the
blessing of late birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass turned his wounds into powerful literary and political
expression. With a handful of other writers, including Boell and
Hans Magnus Enzensberger, he fought relentlessly after the war
against German amnesia, what Enzensberger once called the ``nice
contented grave'' of the postwar economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this context of postwar authoritarianism, of an
American-assisted German reconstruction so successful that it
served to blanket memory of past crimes, that ``The Tin Drum''
burst upon the national consciousness with all the power of a
thunderbolt.
</P>
<P>
   Grass did not hesitate to remind his compatriots of precisely
the history from which they had emerged. Gdansk might be in
Communist Poland, conveniently behind the Iron Curtain, but little
Oskar had seen what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, the author mocked Germans looking for Poland with
``Leicas and compasses, with radar, divining rods, delegations and
moth-eaten provincial students' associations in costume.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``One of these days they will go searching for
Poland with rockets. I, meanwhile, conjure up Poland on my drum.
And this is what I drum: Poland's lost, but not forever, all is
lost, but not forever, Poland's not lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, as it happened, was Germany's Nazi past, the thugs whom
Oskar observes after they have ransacked the toy shop of Sigismund
Markus, a Jewish merchant in Danzig: ``One had drawn his dagger. He
was cutting dolls open and he seemed disappointed each time that
nothing but sawdust flowed from their limbs and bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, under the moral suasion of writers like Grass and
the protests of the postwar generation, this history returned to
form a central part of Germany's modern consciousness, a reference
point and a warning to which the country is now painfully vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   The language of Grass was so pungent, even overwhelming at
times, that it left Germans with no escape from the world it
evoked. Reviewing ``The Tin Drum'' in The New York Times Book
Review, Frederic Morton commented: ``The Bruegel landscape suddenly
swarms with the consummate monsters of Hieronymus Bosch.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass has never been entirely satisfied that the monsters are
tamed. Through his writing and political stands, he has always
attacked any indications of re-emergent German satisfaction or
smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Always a man of the left, although his relations with the Social
Democratic Party have been stormy, Grass has repeatedly criticized
what he once described as the ``closet racism'' of Germans,
evident, he argued in 1997, in their attitude toward the country's
large Turkish population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Social Democrat because socialism without democracy is
worthless to me and because an unsocial democracy is no
democracy,'' Grass once said. He later left the party, and has been
critical of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's attempts to shift Social
Democracy toward a more pro-business stance.
</P>
<P>
   Grass became the fifth successive European to receive the prize
after Jose Saramago of Portugal in 1998, Dario Fo of Italy in 1997,
Wislawa Szymborska of Poland in 1996 and Seamus Heaney of Ireland
in 1995. From 1929 to 1998 the prize had been bestowed upon only
two German authors, Thomas Mann and Boell. The Nobel Prize is worth
about $1 million and is to be presented to Grass at a ceremony in
Stockholm later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded its citation Thursday by saying that Grass
goes ``deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of
good and evil.'' Perhaps in no other country but Germany, home to
Goethe and to Goebbels, to Heine and to Hitler, is this
intertwining so intense. The author's authority rests in his power
to imbue his prose with a matching intensity.
</P>
<P>
   As Grass writes in ``Dog Years,'' ``While God was still at
school, in the heavenly playground he came up with the idea of
creating the world, together with his schoolmate, the talented
little devil.''
</P>
<P>
   This devil, moreover, was powerful, seductive to a conformist
nation, and often cleverly disguised. ``He's coming. He's coming.
Who is coming?'' Grass writes in ``The Tin Drum.'' ``The Christ
child, the Saviour? Or is it the heavenly gasman with the gas meter
under his arm, that always goes ticktock?''

 &HT;    MEXICO QUAKE KILLS AT LEAST 10, SHATTERS STRUCTURES AND NERVES
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A powerful 7.5 earthquake rumbled through southern
Mexico Thursday morning, shattering hundreds of buildings and
reportedly killing at least 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck at 11:30 a.m. (CDT) (12:30 p.m. EDT) and was
centered about 280 miles southeast of Mexico City along the
sparsely populated Pacific coast of Oaxaca state. The epicenter was
offshore and in between the tourist resorts of Huatulco and Puerto
Escondido.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed in Puerto Escondido and some hotels and
other buildings were damaged in the city of 18,000. In the state
capital of Oaxaca, two people were killed when they tried to take
refuge in a doorway and it collapsed on them, according to Oaxaca
Gov. Jose Murat. Two others died in Oaxaca after falling debris
struck them as they tried to flee into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed when buildings collapsed in rural
villages in Oaxaca state and one Mexican news service reported that
a 12-year-old girl suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's quake, which hit in a series of rumbles lasting
several minutes, also jolted Mexico City, Veracruz, Michoacan and
Tabasco states. The quake was slightly stronger than the 7.4
temblor that killed more than 15,000 people in Turkey on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, terrified residents poured into the streets,
some fainting or sobbing out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the hell out of me. I was so afraid because I live
on the fourth floor of a five-story building. It was horrible to
see everything moving, and hear my neighbors screaming and
running,'' said Laura Urzua, an 18-year-old student in this city.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred houses in Oaxaca state and about 100 businesses _
many of them in Oaxaca city's historic colonial center _ were
reportedly damaged and 20 people were hospitalized, according to
Murat's office.
</P>
<P>
   People said they were especially terrified because of the recent
earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan, and the memory of Mexico City's
1985 temblor of 8.1 on the Richter scale. That quake killed more
than 10,000 people and destroyed many buildings in Mexico's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange that one quake after another has struck
recently,'' said Gabriela Duran, a 23-year-old Mexico City hardware
store employee.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed news reports here said that in addition to at least
10 fatalities in Oaxaca, a woman in Veracruz state died after she
fell and hit her head trying to flee the quake.
</P>
<P>
   A man in Mexico City, some reports said, may have also died of a
heart attack suffered after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   News reports also claimed that most of Oaxaca state's water and
sewage treatment plants were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried about Oaxaca,'' Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said in a televised interview Thursday. Mexican military
helicopters were surveying the state, which includes some very
isolated communities.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City office workers who streamed into streets remained
there long after the shaking subsided, hugging and crying. Some had
to be carried out of buildings because they had fainted or were
dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   At Mexico City's police headquarters _ a building that had been
shored up after the 1985 quake _ six people fainted, according to
television reports.
</P>
<P>
   On one street here, the brick facade of a large building slid
off during the quake, tumbling onto about a dozen cars parked next
to the structure.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, Mexicans were jarred by a 6.7 quake that struck 165
miles southwest of Mexico City, killing at least 17 people and
injuring nearly 200. More than 7,700 homes and buildings were
damaged, many in the colonial city of Puebla east of Mexico City.

APPELLATE COURT SNUFFS OUT DRUG CONVICTION OF TEXAS MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The conviction of a Houston man for marijuana
possession went up in smoke Thursday when an appellate court said
the arresting police officer followed his nose instead of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the first ruling of its kind, the 1st Court of
Appeals said a police officer cannot enter a residence without a
search warrant simply because the officer smells marijuana inside.
The court overturned the 1998 conviction of Josh January, 59, a
drifter whose whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opinion means some people get to sit in their homes and
smoke dope, so be it,'' said Donald Catlett, January's
court-appointed attorney.
</P>
<P>
   According to the opinion by a three-judge panel of the appellate
court, January had permission to live in an abandoned Houston
apartment building in 1998. Houston Police Officer Gerald Siens
suspected drug trafficking was taking place inside, and entered
January's residence without a warrant after smelling marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear from the appellate opinion if the officer knew if
the apartment was January's legal residence.
</P>
<P>
   January pled no contest to possessing a small number of marijuna
cigars and was sentenced to 15 months in prison, Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was this man's home. Even though it was an abandoned
apartment complex, he should have the same constitutional
protection as any part of River Oaks,'' Catlett said, referring to
an affluent neighborhood in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said the opinion ``validates the Fourth Amendment
notion that people are supposed to be safe and secure in their
homes and not subject to people coming in, kicking down their door
without a warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court ordered a new trial. Catlett said the
marijuana cigars will not be introduced into evidence if the ruling
stands because they were illegally seized.
</P>
<P>
   He said January has likely already spent the 15 months in prison
because he was unable to afford a bond for his release while the
appeal was pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the travesty of it,'' Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Rikke Graber, who
prosecuted the case, said she will appeal. She said the appellate
court only discussed whether an arrest was properly made, but the
only issue raised on appeal was whether the search was proper. She
said searches and arrests have different case laws, and the
appellate court did not properly distinguish between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett disagreed, saying the court ruled the arrest was based
on an illegal search.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, January had previous marijuana
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Both attorneys said the smell of marijuana smoke would likely be
enough reason for police to obtain a warrant. They also said police
would not necessarily need warrants to legally search cars if they
smelled smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett and Graber said they are not familiar with other
appellate rulings on whether the smell of illegal drugs gives
police the right to enter homes without a warrant. The appellate
opinion cited other cases in which warrants were issued.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court said that under state law, police officers
can enter residences either with a search warrant or if there are
``exigent circumstances'' permitting warrantless entries. These
circumstances include: rendering assistance to those in need;
preventing the destruction of evidence; and protecting the officer
from armed persons.
</P>
<P>
   Graber said that once a person inside a residence realizes an
officer suspects the presence of drugs inside, an officer can go
inside without a warrant because the person might destroy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court said prosecutors did not raise that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's sole argument on appeal to justify the warrantless
search is `a smell of marijuana emanating from an apartment,''' the
opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was authored by Justice Davie L. Wilson, with
Justices Michol O'Connor and Eric Andell concurring.

   DILI, East Timor _ There was a new presence in the streets of
Dili On Thursday: hard, no-nonsense men with berets, flowing hair
and tiny two-way radios, the victors in a 24-year war of
independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting from their mountain strongholds for a first-hand look
at the capital, they were the first elements of the
pro-independence guerrilla army known as Falintil to make a public
showing here.
</P>
<P>
   In a convoy of two tiny, crowded vans, a truck and a half-dozen
motorcycles, the 30 fighters slowly toured the burned-out city,
looking but saying little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoy!'' they shouted when they spotted friends on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey!'' their friends shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   As they passed the Santa Cruz Cemetery, the scene of a massacre
by the military in 1991 that severely discredited the Indonesian
presence here, an onlooker raised his fist in a salute and did a
small jig.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas stopped twice to meet with officers from the
international peacekeeping force whose presence here for the last
11 days has made the fighters' emergence from the mountains
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just having a bit of a yak,'' said an Australian soldier,
refusing to describe what happened in one meeting at the back of a
small house in Becora, a strongly pro-independence neighborhood
that had often been attacked and burned before the peacekeepers
arrived. It was here that Sander Thoenes, a Dutch journalist, was
killed last week by withdrawing Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as the guerrillas and the soldiers sat under the trees
in white plastic chairs to talk, a thin stream of residents walked
by them, returning home from the hills. They had fled there when
the violence began after the announcement that East Timor had voted
overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia in an Aug. 30
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   At the small house, the guerrillas handed over a cache of
weapons and ammunition they said they had captured from militia
groups armed and supported by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of Thursday's expedition, Cornelio Gama, 54, the
deputy commander of Third Regional Command, said the members of
Falintil _ who were unarmed on their visit to the city Thursday _
would not lay down their own weapons, in defiance of a demand for
disarmament by the international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the national liberation army of East Timor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gama, a small man with a nimbus of frizzy hair around his thin,
lined face and a clutch of Roman Catholic medallions around his
neck, has dedicated most of his life to the war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier in the army of Portugal, the colonial power
here until 1974, he said he became a resistance fighter on the day
the Indonesian troops invaded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He has lived as a fighter in the mountains ever since, he said.
This was his first visit to Dili.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought for 24 years without any international
support,'' Gama said. ``Now Falintil trusts the multinational
force. We respect that they are now the ruling power.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Becora, the tiny convoy stopped in the shade. Gama
waved his hand, and a lieutenant pulled a can of warm Bali Hai beer
from inside his shirt _ an almost impossibly rare commodity in this
devastated city.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inside one of the vans, three young guerrillas _
including a teen-aged girl _ played a tape of a popular song in the
local language, Tetun.
</P>
<P>
   Beer in hand, Gama spoke in a loud voice over the sound of the
music. ``If you capture any militias, hand them over to Interfet,''
he said, using the acronym for the international peacekeeping
force. ``Do not beat them. Respect the international forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A young guerrilla with a purple beret and bright green shirt
said this was not his first visit to Dili since the militias'
campaign of terror began this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything was burning, there were 15 of us in the city,
operating independently,'' he said. ``We had information that they
were going to carry out their campaign, so we came to observe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrilla, who refused to give his name, said he and his
comrades had orders not to take any action, part of a Falintil
policy to operate within the law and maintain the moral high
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Was it difficult, as a guerrilla fighter, to look on passively
as his city burned and his people were terrorized and killed?
</P>
<P>
   The young man's lips began to tremble, and he turned his head
away slightly. ``It was terrible,'' he said. ``It made my heart
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The convoy stopped at a seminary where international aid groups
have just begun providing medical care and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   With Gama still sitting inside his tiny van with a microphone,
obscured by an assistant who sat on the hood with the tape recorder
as an amplifier,'' his disembodied voice addressed the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more vengeance,'' he said. ``We must work for national
unity. We must end our hatreds. We must unite in our thoughts and
deeds to rebuild the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A small patter of applause greeted his speech. The people here
seemed uncertain who had just addressed them or why.
</P>
<P>
   Then three military liaison officers from the United Nations
appeared, from Uruguay, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have information,'' the Uruguayan officer said to
Gama. ``We need to have a clearer picture of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide handed Gama a red plastic lighter, and he lit a sweet
clove cigarette. ``Yes, we can share information with you,'' he
said. The two men agreed on a later meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the militia fading away and the Indonesian army gone except
for a token presence, power has shifted in Dili. But the city lies
in ruins, most of its houses burned and none of its shops reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The central marketplace has been burned to the ground. As the
Falintil convoy passed, a few people with brooms were starting to
sweep away the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   As the convoy moved down the pretty sea front, with its fresh
salt breeze, it passed graffiti marking the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat Hot Lead,'' read an angry message to the Timorese, sprayed
in black paint by the departing Indonesian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Under it was a new rejoinder: ``The most important thing is
freedom.''

 &HT;    Volunteers and vets work to save animals of N.C. flood
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ So weak it requires feeding by intravenous
needle, the beagle in cage No. 55 is one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   It survived Hurricane Floyd's devastating flooding and managed
to get rescued from the contaminated waters of eastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Now, along with another140 cats and dogs, the skinny beagle is
on the mend at an emergency field hospital for the feline and
canine victims of North Carolina's worst natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   While millions of dollars of aid for flood-ravaged people have
poured in from across America, a band of North Carolina State
University veterinarians and volunteers are doling out care on a
far more modest scale.
</P>
<P>
   They hope in coming months to reunite the misplaced pets with
their owners, presumably some who lost their homes and possessions
to floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can return healthy pets to people who lost everything,
it will be a bright spot for them,'' said Dr. Kelli Ferris, an N.C.
State veterinarian who is in charge of the yapping, barking,
doggy-smelling hospital on Raleigh's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening last week in the midst of the flooding, the
emergency hospital has treated more than 550 cats and dogs. They're
a mix of yard dogs without collars, valuable hunting dogs and house
cats accustomed to pampering.
</P>
<P>
   None has died, but many are sick from swimming in the swirling
black cesspool spawned by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   A brew of livestock and human waste, petroleum and chemicals,
the toxic mess threatens public health and the environment across
wide stretches of eastern North Carolina farmland and all the way
to its beaches. State health officials warn that people who venture
into the surf should avoid getting water in their eyes, mouths or
cuts because of pollution from coastal rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The beagle in Cage No. 55, for one, has a severe case of the
mange, a skin disease that vets believe has been aggravated by
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As listless as a brown-and-white rag, the dog is certainly one
of the saddest-looking patients in the Raleigh hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have named it Hope,''' Knightdale, N.C., veterinarian Phil
DeBrito said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was among 30 dogs that arrived Wedneday night from Tarboro,
one of the most flood-ravaged areas. Officials declared the animals
to be ``hazardous material'' because of pollution, DeBrito said.
</P>
<P>
   Before examining the dogs, vets put on full-body, zip-up suits,
sterile operating gowns, gloves and face shields. They also cut arm
and neck holes in thick-plastic cadaver bags and wear them as an
added precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know what they could be carrying out of those
areas,'' DeBrito said.
</P>
<P>
   After they were bathed, the dogs were put in cages in the
hospital. It's a 'round-the-clock swirl of activity as vets examine
the animals and keep track of their recovery on clipboards.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers take dogs for walks, feed them, clean their cages and
tote supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency hospital is a half mile from the N.C. State vet
school's teaching hospital, a precaution to minimize the chance of
disease being spread between the two facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-drawn yellow signs point down a muddy dirt road to the
makeshift hospital and an open shed where some of the animals are
being kept in cages.
</P>
<P>
   In a cracked parking lot, donations of dog and cat food are
piling up, alongside tables brimming with flea and tick powder,
medicine and rawhide chewies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, a red Chevy pickup truck arrived loaded with
Ol' Roy dog food, Special Kitty cat food and several bags of cedar
shavings.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers rushed over to unload the truck. ``I just want to
help take care of these animals,'' said Raleigh cat owner Martha
Joyce, volunteering with her husband, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State's College of Veterinary Medicine opened the
hospital, after rescuers with the Humane Society of the United
States and other groups began snatching animals from flood waters.
The number rescued now tops 1,000, in some cases overrunning
eastern North Carolina shelters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the animals at the Raleigh hospital has been
retrieved by their owners. However, officials say they know the
identities of about 40 owners whom they plan to contact.
</P>
<P>
   Humane Society volunteers are taking digital photographs of the
animals admitted to the hospital. The images are being posted on
the Humane Society of the United States Web site provided through
the Petshelter Network.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the vet school also plan to put the animals'
pictures in scrapbooks for owners who don't have Internet access.
If the animals aren't claimed within 30 days, volunteers will keep
them in their homes for a year in hopes of placing them in
permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of our top priorities to reunite owners with their
pets,'' said Dr. Sally Vivrette, an N.C. State vet.

MISSOURI CONVICT TESTIFIES IN TEXAS JAIL ATTACK CAUGHT ON
VIDEOTAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A Missouri murder convict testified Thursday
he did nothing to deserve being kicked and hit by officers and
bitten by a dog during a 1996 shakedown at the Brazoria County
Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just laying there,'' inmate Toby Hawthorne told jurors
hearing evidence in the case of two Brazoria County sheriff's
deputies and a private prison employee accused of using excessive
force on him during the videotaped jail search. ``I wasn't doing
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne referred to a sequence in the videotape in which he
lay on a cell floor as a dog handled by former Brazoria County
deputy David Cisneros twice bit him on the calf.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cisneros, 39, of Angleton, Texas, former jailer
Robert Percival, 37, and former private prison employee Wilton
David Wallace, 52, of Angleton, are on trial in U.S. District Judge
Kenneth Hoyt's court on charges of violating Hawthorne's civil
rights. Each faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace worked for Capital Correctional Resources Inc., which
housed 415 Missouri convicts in a portion of the Brazoria County
Jail the firm leased. The shakedown occurred Sept. 18, 1996, the
second day after the inmates arrived at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth man, former sheriff's Lt. Lester Eugene Arnold, 50, of
Vanderpool, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor count of
violating Hawthorne's rights by shocking him with a stun gun.
Arnold, originally indicted on three felony civil rights charges,
has agreed to testify against his former co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne spent more than three hours on the witness stand
Thursday, answering simply ``Yes'' or ``No'' to most of the dozens
of question prosecutors and defense attorneys asked as they
reviewed portions of the jail search video for 14 jurors, including
two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys suggested during cross-examination that
Hawthorne refused to follow officers' orders and was bitten by
Cisneros's dog because he thrashed around on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, however, denied doing anything to provoke jailers or
members of a six-man emergency response team the sheriff's
department sent to the jail to control prisoners during a search
for weapons and other contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Response team commander Lt. Robert Christopher testified
Wednesday that Hawthorne and other prisoners complied with orders
during the shakedown. On Thursday, he testified that a response
team member grabbed Hawthorne's arm when Hawthorne failed to get on
his cell floor quickly.
</P>
<P>
   During the videotape review, Hawthorne pointed out that a table
and the location of Cisneros's dog prevented him from quickly lying
flat on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, Percival and Wallace are expected to take the stand in
coming days and tell jurors their own versions of what happened in
the shakedown, portions of which were shown worldwide on television
after the videotape surfaced nearly a year after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Their attorneys have told jurors that Percival and Wallace deny
hitting or kicking Hawthorne. Through his attorney, Cisneros has
maintained he never ordered his dog to bite Hawthorne and pulled
the animal back after bites occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne testified, however, that Wallace kicked him in the
head during the shakedown. Prosecutors maintain the videotape shows
Percival struck Hawthorne without reason and Cisneros caused his
dog to bite the inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros attorney Donald ``Tex'' Tonroy downplayed the severity
of three tooth marks evident in a Polaroid photograph taken of
Hawthorne's calf after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But former jail nurse Sharon Sewell testified Thursday that the
bite marks were ``very deep'' and required periodic treatments and
dressings until Oct. 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne was brought to Galveston from a Missouri prison for
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne and the other Missouri inmates were at a prison in
Crystal City, Texas _ not Crystal City, Mo., as earlier reported _
immediately before arriving in Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, 22, pleaded guilty in 1995 to second-degree murder
and armed criminal action, or use of a gun in a crime. A St. Louis
judge sentenced him to concurrent 20-year terms on each charge.
</P>
<P>
   An East St. Louis, Ill., resident until he was arrested for
murder on Oct. 8, 1994, Hawthorne is now being held at the Missouri
Eastern Correctional Center in Pacific, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Hawthorne's murder case were unavailable.

 &HT;    Bradley edges Gore in campaign dollars
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who may be
moving toward a major upset or merely enjoying his 15 minutes of
political fame, now has more campaign cash in the bank than Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reports to be filed later this mnth will show that Bradley
collected $6.7 million in the quarter that ended Thursday, compared
to Gore's $6.5 million, according to the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to massive spending by Gore, who has raised about $26
million overall, the upcoming reports will show that Bradley's
estimated $10 million in the bank could be several hundred thousand
dollars more than Gore has. Bradley has raised $18.4 million since
beginning his long-shot attempt to defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Official finance reports for the period are not due until Oct.
15. The money amassed by Gore and Bradley will multiply when
federal matching funds are made available. The same will happen for
all the Republican contenders other than George W. Bush and Steve
Forbes, who are declining the federal money and the spending limits
it brings.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cash, Bush continues to be in a league of his
own. His campaign reported raising $19 million in the
July-September period, putting his total at more than $56 million
and leaving him with almost $37 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's expenditures, about $12 million in the recent quarter,
will be detailed in the Oct. 15 report. Bush, who began campaigning
months later than other candidates, has maintained a busy,
expensive travel schedule that, according to campaign sources,
costs an average of $40,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has now raised about three times the amounts raised by
eventual nominees Bill Clinton and Bob Dole at a similar point in
the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers on the Democratic side were released as Bradley
enjoys a surge in polls and publicity. Gore, despite spending about
$16 million so far, is unhappy with the way his campaign is going.
On Wednesday, acknowledging he is in a ``hard, tough fight'' with
Bradley, Gore announced he is moving his headquarters and staff
from Washington to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his campaign said the money side of the effort is
in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has all the resources he needs to be able to take his
message to the people of Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, California
and beyond,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We're right on
target at where we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, consistent with its candidate's
understated style, declined to gloat about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the steady growth in support the
campaign has enjoyed,'' said Douglas Berman, the campaign chairman.
``There are many people who want to support a candidate who is
running his campaign in a different way and leading on issues such
as health care reform, strong handgun control, child poverty and
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California on Thursday, Bush sounded a
now-familiar refrain about his campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled and honored that so many Americans are helping me
spread my message of improving schools to leave no child behind,
strengthening our military to keep the peace and ushering in an era
of responsibility in America,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew
said Bush still does not have enough money to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can't buy George W. Bush the leadership, the vision or
the policies to be president,'' said Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted Thursday that his money has come from 135,000
supporters and from every state. Under federal election law,
individual contributions are capped at $1,000 and political action
committee donations cannot top $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Thursday also released a list of 41 additional campaign
``pioneers,'' supporters who have collected at least $100,000 for
his campaign. Earlier this year, Bush listed 115 other pioneers.
The new additions include former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Roger
Staubach, Indianapolis mayor and Bush campaign adviser Steve
Goldsmith and a variety of people with ties to the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, auto dealer and Bush pioneer Paul Anderson
said his ties to the Bush family began about 15 years ago through a
friendship Jeb Bush, now governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they represent the important qualities of the American
family that I believe in,'' Anderson said of his admiration for
members of the Bush clan.

<P>
   The president and vice president of the United States are being
accused of having ``lost'' Russia _ the assumption being that
Russia was there to be ``lost'' by the West in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia is being portrayed in the media as perhaps the
most corrupt place in the world. The implicit message is: ``Don't
touch Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago I asked former Secretary of State George Shultz what
he thought had gone wrong in the U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We
should have found a way to show that we respect your country,'' he
replied, ``that we are ready to treat it as a real partner despite
its problems.'' Next to all the current confusion, that sounds good
to me.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the ``point man'' on
Russia in the Clinton White House, despite his expertise, has been
rather defensive and not very helpful: ``We have been aware from
the beginning that crime and corruption are a huge problem in
Russia and a huge obstacle to reform. Russian reform is not over,
but it's going to take decades and the problem will only get worse
if you isolate Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, for his part, has insisted
that all the negative headlines regarding Moscow going down the
drain are rooted in U.S. electoral politics and aim at
``besmirching Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But these reactions badly miss the point. There never was a
debate in the West about how to ``engage'' Moscow, and it truly
doesn't sound as if one is about to start now.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the so-called money-laundering, IMF-loan scandal.
It certainly shows no sign of abating. This is purported to involve
money from Russia, perhaps IMF loans, high-ranking Russian
officials and the Bank of New York. The story so far is complex and
convoluted and has fact, fantasy and flawed reasoning mixed in
unknown proportion.
</P>
<P>
   As to facts, it seems clear that large amounts of money, of
murky and possibly criminal origin, went through accounts in the
Bank of New York without triggering any reporting or regulatory
alarms or procedures. How this could happen in banking _ which is
arguably the most regulated area in the U.S. economy _ is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect that this would be the first question for the
media and congressional watchdogs to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly charged political atmosphere, the debate has taken a
different turn. ``Hands off Russia!'' ``Russia was never any
good!'' ``No wonder Russia lost the Cold War!'' _ this gloating is
a mere diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue that troubles me,'' says Condoleezza Rice, a top
adviser to likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush,
``is: Were we accepting the rhetoric of reform rather than real
reform in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the right questions to ask. Rice is also right to
use the word ``we,'' because the same mistake was made by President
Bush and President Clinton, by Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fundamental assumption was made that Russia was a
nation defeated in the Cold War, once the rhetoric of U.S. ``aid''
for Russia replaced the idea of cooperation, subsequent
developments flowed almost automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Troops of American university presidents with little or no
knowledge of the realities of Russia's economy arrived in Moscow to
``advise on economic reform,'' with no regard for the cultural
obstacles they were facing or the need to create a legal framework
for economic change. Sending fly-by-night academics to ``give
advice'' and then looking the other way as ``the new Russia''
degenerated into an orgy of oligarchy and corruption was not the
best way to show respect and willingness for partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, in a recent article in The Washington Post, U.S.
national security adviser Samuel Berger asserts that that was the
only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Well then, one has to live with the consequences. Mafia-style
economics and a merging of organized crime and bureaucracy become a
very real result when know-nothing advisers put fancy plans into
action that destroy a government's economic control _ and nothing
is put in place instead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not President Yeltsin and members of his family were
involved in any improprieties is almost irrelevant. What matters is
that Yeltsin is presiding over a system that has made a mockery of
democracy, market economics and the rule of law _ achieving those
goals was among Russia's priorities since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, still, the possibilities for cooperative U.S.-Russian
programs are virtually limitless. They exist today, as they have
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As two former senators, Gary Hart and Gordon Humphrey, wrote
recently in a letter to The New York Times, ``Why not a U.S.-led
program to create a sound banking system, a mortgage-lending
program, long-term oil purchase contracts to provide revenues for
infrastructure rebuilding and jobs, and a program to establish a
desperately needed pharmaceutical industry?''
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take elections in both countries to cool down
the rhetoric and assess what has been happening and where to go
from here.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it would not be a bad idea to quit lamenting
the death of Russia and instead take a long, hard look at the
global economy and what has happened to the barriers that once were
in place to prevent the free flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someone might even stand up (when all the noise pipes
down about ``dreadful Russia'') and ask this: Has it not become too
easy for the barons of dirty money to make and hide their mountains
of gold?
</P>

 &HT;    GOVERNORS WORRY ABOUT BACKLASH TO SCHOOL REFORMS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ Governors opened the third national Education
Summit Thursday by trading tips on how to squash a pending backlash
against tougher academic standards in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all going to face the predictable sniping,'' summit
co-chair Louis Gerstner, chief executive officer of IBM, told about
100 reform-minded participants, including educators, business
leaders and the governors of 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   He said attacks on the standardized tests used to measure
academic achievement typically include ``charges of discrimination,
and allegations that we're hurting people because they can't earn
passing grades based on the new standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner's response to the critics: ``People are getting hurt
right now, every day. They're being sentenced to enter the
workforce with diplomas that have all the value of a Russian
ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   Others made the same point in more circumspect language.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that goals set at the 1989 summit weren't met
despite the later emphasis on high standards that emerged from the
1996 summit, is that the ``goals were too high and the standards
had no teeth,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the only
governor to attend all three of the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Setting high standards was enjoyable. Enforcing them ``is the
bad part,'' said President Clinton, who went to the first summit as
governor of Arkansas and the last two as president. He said he
thinks that is why more states have set high standards than have
moved to tie rewards and punishments to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 summit, 14 states had adopted measurable standards,
and 11 used test scores to make decisions on whether to intervene
in a failing schools, or to let children graduate or move up to the
next grade. Today, 49 states have academic standards, but only 16
base high-stakes decisions for schools or students on test results.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas, which have had high-stakes tests the
longest, have had the greatest gains in national comparisons of the
performance of fourth-, eighth- and 12th-graders in several
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has worked and the consequences are good,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have had revolts by parents and business
leaders,'' said Washington Gov. Gary Locke. ``Parents have to
understand that the standards have to be tough in order to get
children ready for the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said that parents of children in strong
school districts are often the most vocal opponents of
state-mandated tests, which create a risk of marring their
college-bound children's high school transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the winners in the system as it now stands,'' said
Joseph Cirasuolo of the American Association of School
Administrators. ``I think some of the folks with kids in better
schools see more kids coming into competition with their kids for
the best (colleges) and best jobs if standards bring up the
performance of the schools that lag behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Using lots of experts and providing enough time and money to
develop valid tests helps undercut the contention that tests are
biased, Thompson said. But he warned his fellow governors to expect
battles with legislators over high-stakes tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Gov. Bob Taft said that Ohio avoided a lot of objections by
concentrating its first pass-fail test for promotion on whether
fourth graders could read well enough to move up to fifth grade.
``All the public would agree that kids could read,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank O'Bannon of Indiana said public outcries dimmed in
his state after state officials, educators and business leaders
``came together'' and developed a campaign to travel around the
state explaining why today's high school graduates need to know
more than those of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and other rewards to schools that show improvement in
their scores, even if they haven't reached the top yet, are being
tried in California, said Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have standards that are not variable, but we try to reward
progress toward meeting those standards,'' Davis said.

 &HT;    Editors' top 3 picks for a fashionable fall
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion editors live in a sort of perpetual
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone else is talking fall _ football rivalries, new
classes, possible Halloween costumes _ they're thinking spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them to discuss the present, and they look a little
confused. (When pressed, can you recall details of what occupied
your thoughts six months ago?)
</P>
<P>
   In between Fashion Week shows earlier this month, when designers
were trotting out skimpy swimsuits and strappy sandals and
barely-there dresses for next spring, we asked editors to name
their top 3 picks for this fall. As in right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean fall? Not spring?'' they said. Blank stares. Then
furrowed eyebrows. ``Wait a minute, wait a minute,'' said one. ``I
have to think back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they thought. And then they spoke:
</P>
<P>
   Polly Mellen, formerly with Allure:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``First of all, you've got to have a boot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Second of all, I love Marc Jacobs jackets that are sort of
turn of the century. They have a Victorian feel to them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Comme des Garcons sequined dress. It has a certain
simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you sensing a theme here? That's right: Boots!
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Weber Cleary, In Style magazine:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Something sparkly, with beading or sparkle details. For the
holidays, that's how designers have interpreted the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An animal print. A bag would be a good buy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Black-and-white combinations are very chic. Black and white
is a great thing because it goes from day to night very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickest update: The animal-print bag. You can buy a cute one at
Target for around $15, and it's sure to last as long as this trend
is hot. And right now, it's sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Betts, Harper's Bazaar:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Calvin Klein black leather trench coat.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Donna Karan modern ballgown.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Marc Jacobs chunky sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Short cut: The idea of a black trench coat may be a little
off-putting to some, but a black jacket in leather or
animal-friendly pleather is a classic piece. And more appropriate
for our balmy winters.

 &HT;    Fashion Week trends strap on all the extras
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   PACK A BAG ...
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui accessorized her romantic collection with embroidered
bags in feminine colors. There's no single identifiable bag trend
for spring. Ralph Lauren's models toted oversized gingham bags down
the runway, while Badgley Mischka's and BCBG's mannequins carried
smaller beaded and beribboned purses in feminine colors. Chado
showed purses that resembled mailing tubes outfitted with straps.
</P>
<P>
   PULL ON SHOES MADE FOR WALKING
</P>
<P>
   Strappy sandals with little heels, like those at Rebecca
Taylor's show, ultimately have a leg up on the cowboy
boot/pseudo-galoshes that came prancing down spring's runways.
DKNY's fast-stepping models sported space-age lucite wedges (''for
a look that walks on air''), and Anna Sui relied on embroidered
ballet slippers. But what you'll see most often in Spring 2000?
Colorful sandals with skinny straps.
</P>
<P>
   AND TAKE OFF FOR ... AN AFRICAN SAFARI
</P>
<P>
   Good news for animal-print lovers: They just won't go away.
Leopard prints were used for shirts, such as a magenta halter top
by Nicole Miller, and zebra prints showed up on dresses by Bill
Blass and Michael Kors. Diane Von Furstenberg's show was a
veritable Noah's Ark of prints: giraffe-print skirts,
chameleon-print dresses and embroidered flamingo tops.
</P>
<P>
   A VISIT TO THE OLD WEST
</P>
<P>
   Designers loved the Western look for spring, but they weren't
satisfied with plain 'ol bluejeans. Tommy Hilfiger spangled his
with fields of stars and flames rising from the hems. Jill Stuart
added heart stitching on a demin jacket, and Ralph Lauren dressed
up a pair of black leather pants with swingy fringe from hip to
toe.
</P>
<P>
   A TOUR OF EAST ASIA
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of a Geisha.'' While several designers bowed to
Japanese traditions of dress, Donna Karan based most of her
collection on the kimono, wrapping and re-wrapping her models'
wasp-thin waists in black, white and dark shades of blue. Alexander
McQueen and Cynthia Rowley based shirts on what looked like Asian
designs, and Han Feng shaped her soft, silk styles with colorful
kimono-like belts.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE ON THE EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Anything that can be stitched to a hem will be stitched to a hem
next spring. You won't be able to miss oversized sequins, strands
of tiny beads, ostrich feathers, and fringe long and short. Even
comparatively simple dresses, such as a Calvin Klein number and a
breezy slip from BCBG, don't stop at one hem. ``People are back to
romantic decoration and embellishment of clothes,'' explains Vogue
editor-at-large Andre Leon Talley.
</P>
<P>
   A TROPICAL GETAWAY
</P>
<P>
   Salsa dresses and sarongs and flirty little skirts _ not to
mention a field of florals _ called to mind the tropics on several
runways. Even more designers, from Bill Blass to BCBG, used sunny
island colors. Michael Kors paid kooky tribute to the '70s
glamorous life with a caftan, and Oscar de la Renta strung together
huge shells to create necklaces with as much coverage as some
Versace halter tops.
</P>
<P>
   BON VOYAGE!
</P>
<P>
   Even when seen from behind, shirts and dresses are busy with
extra details such as buttons meant for decoration only and
corset-like laces. This sheer DKNY top borders on the obscene from
the front, and its wraparound snakeskin print and uneven hem clamor
for your attention out back.

 &HT;    Bradley edges Gore in campaign dollars
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who may be
moving toward a major upset or merely enjoying his 15 minutes of
political fame, now has more campaign cash in the bank than Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reports to be filed later this month will show that Bradley
collected $6.7 million in the quarter that ended Thursday, compared
to Gore's $6.5 million, according to the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to massive spending by Gore, who has raised about $26
million overall, the upcoming reports will show that Bradley's
estimated $10 million in the bank could be several hundred thousand
dollars more than Gore has. Bradley has raised $18.4 million since
beginning his long-shot attempt to defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Official finance reports for the period are not due until Oct.
15. The money amassed by Gore and Bradley will multiply when
federal matching funds are made available. The same will happen for
all the Republican contenders other than George W. Bush and Steve
Forbes, who are declining the federal money and the spending limits
it brings.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cash, Bush continues to be in a league of his
own. His campaign reported raising $19 million in the
July-September period, putting his total at more than $56 million
and leaving him with almost $37 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's expenditures, about $12 million in the recent quarter,
will be detailed in the Oct. 15 report. Bush, who began campaigning
months later than other candidates, has maintained a busy,
expensive travel schedule that, according to campaign sources,
costs an average of $40,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has now raised about three times the amounts raised by
eventual nominees Bill Clinton and Bob Dole at a similar point in
the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers on the Democratic side were released as Bradley
enjoys a surge in polls and publicity. Gore, despite spending about
$16 million so far, is unhappy with the way his campaign is going.
On Wednesday, acknowledging he is in a ``hard, tough fight'' with
Bradley, Gore announced he is moving his headquarters and staff
from Washington to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his campaign said the money side of the effort is
in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has all the resources he needs to be able to take his
message to the people of Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, California
and beyond,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We're right on
target at where we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, consistent with its candidate's
understated style, declined to gloat about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the steady growth in support the
campaign has enjoyed,'' said Douglas Berman, the campaign chairman.
``There are many people who want to support a candidate who is
running his campaign in a different way and leading on issues such
as health care reform, strong handgun control, child poverty and
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California on Thursday, Bush sounded a
now-familiar refrain about his campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled and honored that so many Americans are helping me
spread my message of improving schools to leave no child behind,
strengthening our military to keep the peace and ushering in an era
of responsibility in America,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew
said Bush still does not have enough money to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can't buy George W. Bush the leadership, the vision or
the policies to be president,'' said Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted Thursday that his money has come from 135,000
supporters and from every state. Under federal election law,
individual contributions are capped at $1,000 and political action
committee donations cannot top $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Thursday also released a list of 41 additional campaign
``pioneers,'' supporters who have collected at least $100,000 for
his campaign. Earlier this year, Bush listed 115 other pioneers.
The new additions include former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Roger
Staubach, Indianapolis mayor and Bush campaign adviser Steve
Goldsmith and a variety of people with ties to the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, auto dealer and Bush pioneer Paul Anderson
said his ties to the Bush family began about 15 years ago through a
friendship Jeb Bush, now governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they represent the important qualities of the American
family that I believe in,'' Anderson said of his admiration for
members of the Bush clan.

 &HT;    GOVERNORS WORRY ABOUT BACKLASH TO SCHOOL REFORMS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ Governors opened the third national Education
Summit Thursday by trading tips on how to squash a pending backlash
against tougher academic standards in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all going to face the predictable sniping,'' summit
co-chair Louis Gerstner, chief executive officer of IBM, told about
100 reform-minded participants, including educators, business
leaders and the governors of 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   He said attacks on the standardized tests used to measure
academic achievement typically include ``charges of discrimination,
and allegations that we're hurting people because they can't earn
passing grades based on the new standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner's response to the critics: ``People are getting hurt
right now, every day. They're being sentenced to enter the
workforce with diplomas that have all the value of a Russian
ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   Others made the same point in more circumspect language.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that goals set at the 1989 summit weren't met
despite the later emphasis on high standards that emerged from the
1996 summit, is that the ``goals were too high and the standards
had no teeth,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the only
governor to attend all three of the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Setting high standards was enjoyable. Enforcing them ``is the
bad part,'' said President Clinton, who went to the first summit as
governor of Arkansas and the last two as president. He said he
thinks that is why more states have set high standards than have
moved to tie rewards and punishments to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 summit, 14 states had adopted measurable standards,
and 11 used test scores to make decisions on whether to intervene
in a failing schools, or to let children graduate or move up to the
next grade. Today, 49 states have academic standards, but only 16
base high-stakes decisions for schools or students on test results.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas, which have had high-stakes tests the
longest, have had the greatest gains in national comparisons of the
performance of fourth-, eighth- and 12th-graders in several
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has worked and the consequences are good,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have had revolts by parents and business
leaders,'' said Washington Gov. Gary Locke. ``Parents have to
understand that the standards have to be tough in order to get
children ready for the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said that parents of children in strong
school districts are often the most vocal opponents of
state-mandated tests, which create a risk of marring their
college-bound children's high school transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the winners in the system as it now stands,'' said
Joseph Cirasuolo of the American Association of School
Administrators. ``I think some of the folks with kids in better
schools see more kids coming into competition with their kids for
the best (colleges) and best jobs if standards bring up the
performance of the schools that lag behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Using lots of experts and providing enough time and money to
develop valid tests helps undercut the contention that tests are
biased, Thompson said. But he warned his fellow governors to expect
battles with legislators over high-stakes tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Gov. Bob Taft said that Ohio avoided a lot of objections by
concentrating its first pass-fail test for promotion on whether
fourth graders could read well enough to move up to fifth grade.
``All the public would agree that kids could read,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank O'Bannon of Indiana said public outcries dimmed in
his state after state officials, educators and business leaders
``came together'' and developed a campaign to travel around the
state explaining why today's high school graduates need to know
more than those of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and other rewards to schools that show improvement in
their scores, even if they haven't reached the top yet, are being
tried in California, said Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have standards that are not variable, but we try to reward
progress toward meeting those standards,'' Davis said.

 &HT;    Fashion Week trends strap on all the extras
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   PACK A BAG ...
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui accessorized her romantic collection with embroidered
bags in feminine colors. There's no single identifiable bag trend
for spring. Ralph Lauren's models toted oversized gingham bags down
the runway, while Badgley Mischka's and BCBG's mannequins carried
smaller beaded and beribboned purses in feminine colors. Chado
showed purses that resembled mailing tubes outfitted with straps.
</P>
<P>
   PULL ON SHOES MADE FOR WALKING
</P>
<P>
   Strappy sandals with little heels, like those at Rebecca
Taylor's show, ultimately have a leg up on the cowboy
boot/pseudo-galoshes that came prancing down spring's runways.
DKNY's fast-stepping models sported space-age lucite wedges (''for
a look that walks on air''), and Anna Sui relied on embroidered
ballet slippers. But what you'll see most often in Spring 2000?
Colorful sandals with skinny straps.
</P>
<P>
   AND TAKE OFF FOR ... AN AFRICAN SAFARI
</P>
<P>
   Good news for animal-print lovers: They just won't go away.
Leopard prints were used for shirts, such as a magenta halter top
by Nicole Miller, and zebra prints showed up on dresses by Bill
Blass and Michael Kors. Diane Von Furstenberg's show was a
veritable Noah's Ark of prints: giraffe-print skirts,
chameleon-print dresses and embroidered flamingo tops.
</P>
<P>
   A VISIT TO THE OLD WEST
</P>
<P>
   Designers loved the Western look for spring, but they weren't
satisfied with plain 'ol bluejeans. Tommy Hilfiger spangled his
with fields of stars and flames rising from the hems. Jill Stuart
added heart stitching on a demin jacket, and Ralph Lauren dressed
up a pair of black leather pants with swingy fringe from hip to
toe.
</P>
<P>
   A TOUR OF EAST ASIA
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of a Geisha.'' While several designers bowed to
Japanese traditions of dress, Donna Karan based most of her
collection on the kimono, wrapping and re-wrapping her models'
wasp-thin waists in black, white and dark shades of blue. Alexander
McQueen and Cynthia Rowley based shirts on what looked like Asian
designs, and Han Feng shaped her soft, silk styles with colorful
kimono-like belts.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE ON THE EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Anything that can be stitched to a hem will be stitched to a hem
next spring. You won't be able to miss oversized sequins, strands
of tiny beads, ostrich feathers, and fringe long and short. Even
comparatively simple dresses, such as a Calvin Klein number and a
breezy slip from BCBG, don't stop at one hem. ``People are back to
romantic decoration and embellishment of clothes,'' explains Vogue
editor-at-large Andre Leon Talley.
</P>
<P>
   A TROPICAL GETAWAY
</P>
<P>
   Salsa dresses and sarongs and flirty little skirts _ not to
mention a field of florals _ called to mind the tropics on several
runways. Even more designers, from Bill Blass to BCBG, used sunny
island colors. Michael Kors paid kooky tribute to the '70s
glamorous life with a caftan, and Oscar de la Renta strung together
huge shells to create necklaces with as much coverage as some
Versace halter tops.
</P>
<P>
   BON VOYAGE!
</P>
<P>
   Even when seen from behind, shirts and dresses are busy with
extra details such as buttons meant for decoration only and
corset-like laces. This sheer DKNY top borders on the obscene from
the front, and its wraparound snakeskin print and uneven hem clamor
for your attention out back.

   &UR; OUTTAKES FROM BEATTY'S NEWEST GIG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Personals spy who was at  &UR; Warren Beatty &LR; 's maybe-I-am
maybe-I'm-not announcement Wednesday night whispers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lara Flynn Boyle &LR; , 29, and  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; , 52, were looking
``very affectionate'' at the table right in front of podium.
 &UR; Courtney Love &LR; , dressed in her trademark ``appropriately smutty''
fashion, kept stepping outside to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political nature, the event began like a Hollywood
gala, with taped clips of celebrities wishing Beatty well. The
cheerleaders included  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; ,  &UR; Dustin Hoffman &LR; ,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Burton  &LR; and  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; , whose segment was booed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening Beatty ``seemed like a character'' in
one of his movies, overwhelmed and a bit befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife,  &UR; Annette Bening &LR; , was asked whether taking part
in politics was anything like appearing in a political movie, such
as ``The American President,'' she gave a definite ``No. This is
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Real life?  &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger  &LR; says in an interview in
the November issue of Talk that he's thinking about running for
governor of California in 2002. ``The possibility is there,'' he
said, ``because I feel it inside. I feel there are a lot of people
standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his past life, Schwarzenegger said he would come clean.
``What it is is what it is. I inhaled, exhaled. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Upon reading in New York magazine that  &UR; Kevin Costner &LR; 's
frontal nude scenes in ``For Love of the Game'' were cut, said one
Universal official, partly because a test screening audience
``giggled at Kevin's penis,'' reader  &UR; Tom Costner &LR;  comments:
``Clearly Kev comes from the other branch of the Costner family
tree, the phallically challenged one.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Matt Damon &LR;  and  &UR; Ben Affleck &LR;  are turning  &UR; Howard Zinn &LR; 's
book ``A People's History of the United States'' into a movie. Zinn
is a counterculture intellectual famous in the '60s and '70s, and
was mentor to Damon (who quoted him in ``Good Will Hunting''). He
was also mentor to  &UR; Alice Walker &LR;  and  &UR; Marion Wright Edelman &LR; ,
early friend of the Clintons and founder of the Children's Defense
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn will speak about his book at the San Francisco Book
Festival at Fort Mason on October 16; he'll be introduced by
Edelman, who's speaking just before him on her memoir, `Lanterns: A
Memoir of Mentors.''
</P>
<P>
   - The license plate on a car seen in Berkeley by  &UR; E. Doyle &LR; : ``2
MANY US''; its bumper sticker was ``Make love not more.''
</P>
<P>
   - MSNBC says that socialite/fashion designer/flower arranger
 &UR; Carolyne Roehm &LR;  (who used to be married to tycoon &UR; Henry Kravis &LR; ) is
romantically entangled with  &UR; Ed Rollins &LR; , Republican political
consultant who managed  &UR; Michael Huffington &LR; 's campaign (and whose
wife,  &UR; Sherrie Rollins &LR; , dumped him for  &UR; David Westin &LR; , the
president of ABC News).
</P>
<P>
   - The San Francisco Opera having announced that its new general
director is  &UR; Pamela Rosenberg &LR; ,  &UR; Roberto-Juan Gonzalez &LR;  was
reminded of the 1982 movie ``Yes Giorgio,'' in which  &UR; Luciano &LR; 
 &UR; Pavarotti &LR;  fell in love with a woman named Pamela, whereupon he
proclaimed, ``Pamela, you are a thirsty plant and I, Giorgio Fini,
will water you!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMERCIALS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A new TV ad for Dannon yogurt features celebrity volleyball
player  &UR; Gabrielle Reece &LR; , and includes a picture of Reece as a
girl, sitting next to a table on which is a carton of Dannon
yogurt. The ad's line: ``You grew up eating Dannon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is fake. Its original version, without yogurt,
appears in Reece's book, ``Big Girl in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   An ad executive told Advertising Age that the ad wasn't intended
to fool anyone; it was intended to be ironic, ``underscoring the
sardonic tone of the campaign,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - New York cabdrivers are unhappy about a new campaign for the
clothing company French Connection U.K., which features the
company's initials in ads atop the taxis. ``It's clearly
denigrating to the industry,'' said New York Taxi Commissioner
 &UR; Allan Fromberg &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``London is a little more scruffy than New York. But you also
have a lot better showers here, so maybe it's just that people look
a lot cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  -  &LR; Actor  &UR; Rupert Graves &LR;  on fashion in London and New York, in
the menswear daily DNR.

CHARLES A. FEDERER JR., ONCE EDITED SKY &AMP; TELESCOPE MAGAZINE; 90 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Anthony Federer Jr., a self-taught astronomer who
parlayed his avocation into a long career as editor-in-chief of Sky
&AMP; Telescope magazine, died Tuesday in a nursing home in Mystic,
Conn. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Federer was born in St. Louis. He was raised in Connecticut,
where, as a young man he ``studied the stars though an oak tree in
front of our home in Redding, Conn.,'' according to a reminiscence
published in the November 1986 issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming a marine insurance underwriter in New York City,
he continued to pursue his interest in astronomy as a night student
at City College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, he became a founding member the Amateur Astronomers
Association and began conducting classes under the auspices of the
group. In 1934, a year before the Hayden Planetarium was slated to
open in New York City, Mr. Federer quit his insurance job and began
studying full time at City College, where he earned a bachelor's
degree in physics.
</P>
<P>
   When the planetarium opened of Oct. 3, 1935, he was a guest
lecturer in the premiere program at the state-of-the art facility.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Federer soon became editor of the Hayden planetarium
publication, Sky. In 1941, he was invited to merge the magazine
with Telescope, a journal published at the Harvard Observatory. He
moved his operation to Cambridge, Mass. and the first issue of the
merged Sky &AMP; Telescope magazine sold 5,000 copies. The magazine for
amateur and professional astronomers now has a circulation of about
125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Federer retired in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his contributions to the study of the stars were
recognized when the International Astronomical Union named Asteroid
4726 in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Marion Wilcox Korab Federer of Stonington,
Conn.; a son, C. Anthony of Durham, N.H.; a daughter, Barbara
Meredith of London; four grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

ANALYSIS: IN A DIFFERENT CHINA, FEELINGS OF BOTH PRIDE AND REGRET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-ANNIVERSARY, CHINA-REVOLUTION) 
(bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Wang Ruoshui was on Tiananmen Square that electric day
exactly half a century ago Friday when Mao Tse-tung announced,
``The People's Republic of China is founded! From this time on, the
Chinese people have stood up!''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who was an underground Communist as a student and would
become a leading journalist and party theoretician, remembers how
proud he felt. ``We thought we were creating a new history,'' he
said. ``We believed we were creating a new, free, strong,
democratic and prosperous China.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic it is not, but when Chinese people weigh the
revolution that began 50 years ago, they express pride that the
nation is united and finally, as Mao promised, standing up in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   If asked about events they would rather forget, Chinese say that
Mao's unbridled political campaigns _ the economic fantasies that
caused millions of famine deaths, the vicious purges that scarred
generations and brought the nation to a standstill _ were a
terrible mistake. They go on, though, to heap praise on Deng
Xiaoping's economic opening two decades ago that brought prosperity
and more control over their personal lives, if not their political
choices.
</P>
<P>
   But among many in the older generation of Communists, there is
also a sense of loss. Though not all of them have come to share
Wang's belated conviction that democracy is the only answer, many
old revolutionaries wistfully recall a time of idealism, when the
young revolutionaries were uncorrupted and respected. While they
may marvel at today's wealth, these elders lament the widespread
corruption of officials today, and the growing disparities in
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, now 73, rose to be deputy chief editor of the Communist
Party's newspaper, People's Daily, before he was fired in 1983 for
his liberal leanings. Today he rails against corruption like
everyone else. But more than that, he decries the lack of
restraints on party power that facilitates it; and he decries the
lack of political choices and press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   That he is one of the rare Chinese who dares to question the
political order in public is revealing in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current leaders say stability takes precedence over
everything, but what they really mean is the survival of their
regime,'' Wang said. ``China does need stability, but not the kind
that protects corruption. Political reform is the best way to
prevent instability.''
</P>
<P>
   After the savage chaos of the Mao era, which followed decades of
invasions and civil war, a yearning for stability was
understandable. In the late 1970s, after Mao's death, stability was
Deng's prime concern as he laid out a simple strategy for
modernizing the insular and dispirited country: on the political
side, preserve Communist Party dictatorship; on the economic side,
start opening to the world and tapping the power of market
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to the future!,'' Deng exhorted the nation, steering them
away from recriminations that could destroy the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Deng's approach was remarkably successful, yielding two decades
of startling economic growth and social change. And the country,
making a pun on the Chinese word for ``future,'' enthusiastically
transformed his slogan into ``Look to the money!''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers resurfaced their dirt floors with concrete, bought
televisions and often refrigerators. Urban professionals bought
stylish clothes and started saving to buy cars and take foreign
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of memorizing Mao's sayings, students now delve into the
Internet. Once-cowed workers take to the streets when their wages
go unpaid and aggrieved farmers, instead of ``eating bitterness,''
in the Chinese phrase for suffering, are apt to try suing local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the leaders under President Jiang Zemin are still
following Deng's basic prescription _ pursuing deeper changes in
the economy while zealously guarding the party monopoly and holding
``stability'' as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   But the society is vastly more complex and demanding than
before. It is increasingly wired to the unforgiving global market,
and there are signs that the era of easy 10 percent-plus growth
rates has ended.
</P>
<P>
   The central question facing China today, many scholars here and
abroad believe, is whether Deng's aging formula has run its course.
Do Jiang and his colleagues, they ask, need a new political vision
if China is to flourish in the emerging world?
</P>
<P>
   ``Deng's approach turned out to be workable for two decades, and
China made enormous progress,'' said Minxin Pei, a Chinese-born
political scientist with the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace in Washington. ``But now they've got to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a political loosening and far stronger legal checks and
balances, Pei and other critics say, China cannot conquer the
widespread official corruption that even party leaders admit is
corroding their authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In China, practical arguments for democracy are nothing new. But
so far, the country has continued jailing or exiling dissidents who
push too hard. And there are still those, even outside government
circles, who think that the current approach may be the only
realistic one for now.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai Normal University, said he
agreed that as society grows more complex and social interests
diversify, democratic channels must emerge to deal with their
demands. ``But I feel China is not yet at that stage,'' he said.
``It's at the most trying stage of modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   Dali Yang, a Chinese-born political scientist at the University
of Chicago, thinks the leadership deserves more credit than it
gets.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the government is already in the midst of an
ambitious ``rebuilding of the institutional sinews of the state,''
including revamping of the tax, banking, legal and regulatory
systems in addition to the painful pruning of state industries.
Progress with these, Yang argued, ``will eventually allow the
Chinese leadership greater room for political liberalization,''
which he is certain will come.

   &UR; OUTTAKES FROM BEATTY'S NEWEST GIG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Personals spy who was at  &UR; Warren Beatty &LR; 's maybe-I-am
maybe-I'm-not announcement Wednesday night whispers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lara Flynn Boyle &LR; , 29, and  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; , 52, were looking
``very affectionate'' at the table right in front of podium.
 &UR; Courtney Love &LR; , dressed in her trademark ``appropriately smutty''
fashion, kept stepping outside to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political nature, the event began like a Hollywood
gala, with taped clips of celebrities wishing Beatty well. The
cheerleaders included  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; ,  &UR; Dustin Hoffman &LR; ,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Burton  &LR; and  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; , whose segment was booed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening Beatty ``seemed like a character'' in
one of his movies, overwhelmed and a bit befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife,  &UR; Annette Bening &LR; , was asked whether taking part
in politics was anything like appearing in a political movie, such
as ``The American President,'' she gave a definite ``No. This is
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Real life?  &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger  &LR; says in an interview in
the November issue of Talk that he's thinking about running for
governor of California in 2002. ``The possibility is there,'' he
said, ``because I feel it inside. I feel there are a lot of people
standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his past life, Schwarzenegger said he would come clean.
``What it is is what it is. I inhaled, exhaled. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Upon reading in New York magazine that  &UR; Kevin Costner &LR; 's
frontal nude scenes in ``For Love of the Game'' were cut, said one
Universal official, partly because a test screening audience
``giggled at Kevin's penis,'' reader  &UR; Tom Costner &LR;  comments:
``Clearly Kev comes from the other branch of the Costner family
tree, the phallically challenged one.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Matt Damon &LR;  and  &UR; Ben Affleck &LR;  are turning  &UR; Howard Zinn &LR; 's
book ``A People's History of the United States'' into a movie. Zinn
is a counterculture intellectual famous in the '60s and '70s, and
was mentor to Damon (who quoted him in ``Good Will Hunting''). He
was also mentor to  &UR; Alice Walker &LR;  and  &UR; Marion Wright Edelman &LR; ,
early friend of the Clintons and founder of the Children's Defense
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn will speak about his book at the San Francisco Book
Festival at Fort Mason on October 16; he'll be introduced by
Edelman, who's speaking just before him on her memoir, `Lanterns: A
Memoir of Mentors.''
</P>
<P>
   - The license plate on a car seen in Berkeley by  &UR; E. Doyle &LR; : ``2
MANY US''; its bumper sticker was ``Make love not more.''
</P>
<P>
   - MSNBC says that socialite/fashion designer/flower arranger
 &UR; Carolyne Roehm &LR;  (who used to be married to tycoon &UR; Henry Kravis &LR; ) is
romantically entangled with  &UR; Ed Rollins &LR; , Republican political
consultant who managed  &UR; Michael Huffington &LR; 's campaign (and whose
wife,  &UR; Sherrie Rollins &LR; , dumped him for  &UR; David Westin &LR; , the
president of ABC News).
</P>
<P>
   - The San Francisco Opera having announced that its new general
director is  &UR; Pamela Rosenberg &LR; ,  &UR; Roberto-Juan Gonzalez &LR;  was
reminded of the 1982 movie ``Yes Giorgio,'' in which  &UR; Luciano &LR; 
 &UR; Pavarotti &LR;  fell in love with a woman named Pamela, whereupon he
proclaimed, ``Pamela, you are a thirsty plant and I, Giorgio Fini,
will water you!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMERCIALS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A new TV ad for Dannon yogurt features celebrity volleyball
player  &UR; Gabrielle Reece &LR; , and includes a picture of Reece as a
girl, sitting next to a table on which is a carton of Dannon
yogurt. The ad's line: ``You grew up eating Dannon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is fake. Its original version, without yogurt,
appears in Reece's book, ``Big Girl in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   An ad executive told Advertising Age that the ad wasn't intended
to fool anyone; it was intended to be ironic, ``underscoring the
sardonic tone of the campaign,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - New York cabdrivers are unhappy about a new campaign for the
clothing company French Connection U.K., which features the
company's initials in ads atop the taxis. ``It's clearly
denigrating to the industry,'' said New York Taxi Commissioner
 &UR; Allan Fromberg &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``London is a little more scruffy than New York. But you also
have a lot better showers here, so maybe it's just that people look
a lot cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  -  &LR; Actor  &UR; Rupert Graves &LR;  on fashion in London and New York, in
the menswear daily DNR.

 BEIJING: will come.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pei, for his part, predicts rising tensions between citizens and
state. ``We've been waiting for Godot for many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one area where even critics give the government some
credit for articulating change, it is the economy. China's leaders
have put forth serious plans for shaking up bloated state-run
enterprises and creating modern social welfare and pension systems,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   In its bid for membership in the World Trade Organization, China
appears prepared to accept major new jolts of market competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real attempt to produce a second economic
revolution, this time with a more coherent blueprint,'' said
Anthony Saich, professor of international affairs at Harvard
University, who spent the last several years in China. ``But what
kind of society do they want, what kind of politics? These issues
are in limbo because nobody can talk about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from providing an inspired vision of political change, party
leaders seem united above all on the necessity of continued
Communist rule. They appear to fear that any sign of weakness could
cause their power to unravel. That fear is reflected in the
obsessive security surrounding the 50th anniversary parade, whose
aim is to prevent demonstrations or violence by disgruntled
workers, ethnic separatists, democracy activists or members of the
banned Falun Gong spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is using the anniversary celebrations to portray himself
as the next great leader in the mold of Mao and Deng. ``We are
filled with confidence,'' Jiang proclaimed this week before many of
the world's top corporate executives in gleaming Shanghai, vowing
yet again to create ``a wealthy, strong, democratic and civilized
modern socialist country.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mao-style Marxism totally discredited, Jiang constantly
evokes a fuzzy ``Deng Xiaoping theory'' as the nation's guide, and
he often appears to be groping for his own true course.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is a leader who one week can mount the harsh repression of
Falun Gong, including televised recantations right out of Stalin's
book, then another week select a daring modern French design for a
national theater right next to the Great Hall of the People; a
leader who in the same statement can pledge radical economic reform
and call for a stronger role for the party in managing companies.
</P>
<P>
   With or without inspired values, as long as the party leadership
remains united and resolute, its power seems secure for now. But
many scholars think that the brew of slower growth, rising
unemployment, spreading inequality and popular resentment of
corrupt officials will give rise to more turmoil _ whether
demonstrations or riots or erupting spiritual sects.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing authoritarian regimes don't have is residual
legitimacy,'' Saich said. ``People say, if they don't produce the
goods, what's the point?'' He suggested that with a credible
promise of political opening, people might give the party more
leeway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the leaders may have reason to fear that if they give too
much political ground too fast, the Communist edifice could swiftly
crumble _ with what ultimate outcome, no one can foretell.

PORN IN THE U.S.A.: TEENS' T-SHIRTS REFLECT THE TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blake Perez and his friends are pimps and porn stars in
training, and some attend a bastion of higher learning called
Pimptown University, or are breaking into the world of gainful
employment as members of the National Pimp Association.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, one believes their T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for proof of the decline of the current generation
of high-schoolers need look no further than the local Gadzooks
stores. There, one can find shirts with slogans such as ``Porn Star
in Training,'' ``Pimp,'' and ``National Pimp Association,'' the
last of which features a silhouette of a stereotyped '70s pimp, a
guy with platform boots and a wide-brimmed hat, complete with
feather. At local Wherehouse Music locations, kids can buy stickers
that say ``Porn Star in Training,'' ``Pimp Daddy,'' ``Stripper''
and more.
</P>
<P>
   And all those shirts and stickers, according to store employees,
are wildly popular with guys and girls between ages 14 and 17.
Wherehouse employees say they literally cannot keep enough of a
sticker that says ``Skinny Little B-----.''
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is going on here? you ask.
</P>
<P>
   To Perez, an articulate, friendly, home-schooled 16-year-old,
it's part of the game of shock-the-parents-and-impress-your-friends
that's repeated with each new generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fad; it's real in right now,'' he says, pausing in
a Fort Worth mall on a recent Saturday afternoon and adjusting the
safety pins on his bucket hat, which features a Marilyn Manson
American flag. ``Ninety percent of my friends wear these shirts.
It's shock; it's to see what other people will say. We want to be
us. We want to be different, and we'll do anything possible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. David Welsh, a Fort Worth psychologist who
works extensively with adolescents, teens proclaim themselves pimps
and porn stars for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that they simply want to shock Mom and Dad and their
third-period biology teacher; in that sense, he says, ``It's
business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh says the mainstreaming of pornography and hip-hop lyrics
are also playing a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really bothers me; the themes of adolescence have been
ratcheted up to such a degree, in terms of content and images,''
Welsh says. ``Kids will be kids, but it's being taken to a more
disturbing and dangerous level than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   James Scott, the 18-year-old manager of the Gadzooks store at
Hulen Mall in Fort Worth, says the shirts have been around at least
a year and sell as well as shirts without sexual innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, a lot of guys want to say, `Yeah, I can get any
girl I want _ I'm a pimp,' '' Scott says. ``It's to show off, to
brag. When it was time to go back to school, we sold a lot of the
`Porn Star' shirts. About sixty percent of the people that buy the
`Porn Star' T-shirts are guys. A lot of times we get groups of guys
and they all buy the same shirt _ `Pimptown University' or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough; after all, as Perez points out, his parents wore
shirts that espoused more scatological philosophies akin to ``Stuff
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But is something else going on here?
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wherehouse employee who doesn't want to be
identified, the popularity of the shirts and stickers is proof that
``Our culture has gone completely downhill, and kids think it's
cool to be a porn star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid Rock's whole philosophy is, `Get as many girls backstage
as you can' and these kids have to process that somehow,'' she
adds, referring to a popular rock-rap star who celebrates a
hedonistic lifestyle. ``Kids today feel no shame about being a porn
star or a stripper.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vast majority of the teens who wear the shirts
will not end up working in the sex industry. But porn is right
there, all the time, via cable TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times,
adult-film production has increased by 25 percent this year and is
a $4 billion industry, with between 175 and 200 films produced
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is also affecting how teens see male-female
relationships, Welsh says. Top male stars often refer to themselves
as ``pimps'' and ``playas'' and mention a past as a dope dealer to
further their street credibility. The genre also has several female
stars, such as Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim, who refer to themselves as
b------.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, Welsh says, and ``the content of a lot of the
media is more mean-spirited and misogynistic, and kids are
absorbing that. The mainstream acceptance of porn is a new
phenomenon. Kids have more access to porn than ever before, and
guys like Howard Stern have porn stars on as guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are starting to believe porn is legitimate entertainment.
And if you're an insecure adolescent male you start looking at the
portrayal of (the pimp) lifestyle and think, `Yeah, I could do
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The decline of American culture? Evidence that we're sliding
down the slippery slopes to pure decadence?
</P>
<P>
   Blake Perez has to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about society falling apart; we're just trying to
be different,'' he says. ``We want to be remembered and leave our
mark. Girls think it's cute. They want to leave their mark, too. We
all want to believe in our own thing. I just know we're all the
same.''

   ``Bagombo Snuff Box''
</P>
<P>
   By Kurt Vonnegut
</P>
<P>
   Short stories
</P>
<P>
   G.P. Putnam's Sons, $23.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Vonnegut has come unstuck in time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, it was practically a law that college students read
Vonnegut. That was the year ``Slaughterhouse-Five'' was published,
and its message about war, delivered in a
comic/tragic/satiric/pseudo-scientific manner, jibed perfectly with
the anti-Vietnam temperament of the time. Hooked on the wit of that
twisted tale, a youthful audience hungry for more ``discovered''
Vonnegut's earlier writings.
</P>
<P>
   It is 30 years later. Ask a college student today who Vonnegut
is, and you might get a response like, ``He's that dude who wrote
that graduation speech about wearing sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, and wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, not Vonnegut but a Chicago newspaper
columnist who made the pitch for Bain de Soleil. More important,
Vonnegut's writing still has a remarkably contemporary feel, and
Gen X-ers who ignore him are missing out on a great source of
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vonnegut leaps backward five decades to his first days as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time before television stole the minds of America.
During the late '40s and the '50s, there was great demand for short
stories as entertainment. Vonnegut discovered that he could do
better than be a flack for General Electric; he could write amusing
stories for magazines such as ``Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening
Post, Ladies' Home Journal'' and ``Colliers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bagombo Snuff Box'' is a collection of 23 of those early
stories. His other short stories have previously been collected in
``Welcome to the Monkey House.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories in ``Bagombo'' range from silly to serious, although
most have at least some element of comedy. A couple are downright
romantic _ most likely written with a particular magazine's
audience in mind _ but all the others cover topics familiar to fans
of Vonnegut novels. ``Souvenir'' and ``Der Arme Dolmetscher''
reflect the author's World War II experiences. The title story and
``Custom-Made Bride'' deal with people being something other than
what they appear to be. ``The Package'' and ``2BR02B'' look at the
foibles of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Thanosphere'' (written before the first manned space
flight), an astronaut aboard a secretly launched rocket ship
discovers ``others'' out there.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the more lighthearted tales concern high school band
leader George M. Helmholtz, whose dream is as high as, but no
higher than, having the finest marching band on Earth. Vonnegut
could have made this character a buffoon, but he treats him with a
certain respect that lets the reader smile and cheer him on at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was perfectly swell,'' is the opening line of
``2BR02B,'' a chilling tale about one way that society's march
toward conquering disease, aging and other perils might go awry.
</P>
<P>
   An introduction by Vonnegut illuminates his history and is a
welcome addition to the stories. He also offers some advice on
writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or
she will not feel the time was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a
glass of water.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bagombo'' might have been slightly improved by the inclusion
of the magazine and date of original publication for each story.
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript, Vonnegut admits that, while editing stories for
the collection, he felt compelled to rewrite the denouement of
three _ ``The Powder Blue Dragon,'' ``Hal Irwin's Magic Lamp'' and
``The Boy Who Hated Girls.'' As they appear in ``Bagombo,'' these
three stories come to abrupt, harsh endings. It would be nice to
compare them with the original endings, which probably were more
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   But these are small quibbles about a very welcome collection of
clever tales.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers who last read Vonnegut before their hairlines began
to recede should come unstuck in time and take a dip from ``Bagombo
Snuff Box.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those uninitiated Gen X-ers _ Vonnegut would never waste
the time of a total stranger. ( Baby boomer Cathy Frisinger works

NEIMAN CHIEF KOVACH TO STEP DOWN

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Recommending an ``upgrade'' to a leader who
could help navigate technological and economic changes in the media
business, Bill Kovach announced Thursday that he would step down as
curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard spokeswoman said President Neil Rudenstine will choose
a successor to Kovach with the advice of a search committee, to be
named immediately. The foundation, which runs the nation's most
prestigious journalism fellowships and serves as a sort of
journalism think tank, hopes to have a new director by April, in
time to choose the new class of Nieman fellows.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the foundation's advisory board, Kovach cited
``personal and practical reasons'' for stepping down. The changes
in communications technology and the economic hierarchy of
journalism have altered the work of the business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have struggled to keep abreast of this change . . . but I
grow distant from direct experience,'' he wrote. ``It makes me less
able to anticipate or appreciate their practical needs. The
university and future fellows are, as we say these days, ready for
an upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   A former New York Times reporter and editor, Kovach arrived as a
Nieman fellow 11 years ago after resigning as head of the Atlanta
Journal and Constitution in a dispute over editorial independence
from its ownership. He became ``emergency'' curator after the death
of Howard Simons in 1988, and was named to the post officially the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on and step back a little bit,'' Kovach said
Thursday. ``I came here planning on staying six months at most. . .
. This is my tenth Nieman class. And that is a nice round number.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has lost two media heavyweights this year, with Marvin
Kalb already having stepped down as director of the Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at the
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine is considering a long list of people to replace
Kovach, one source said, but there are no firm or final contenders.
The Shorenstein Center has been searching for a leader for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the person who takes over at Nieman and at the
Shorenstein Center are mindful of these tremendous changes (in
journalism) and therefore more determined than ever to stick to
some of the fundamental values, and not to let the marketplace
determine how news is covered,'' said Kalb, now executive director
of the Shorenstein Center, from a new satellite office in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Kovach has been the very model of a curator for the
Nieman Foundation,'' Rudenstine said. ``He commands instant respect
in this country and abroad, and has constantly enhanced the quality
and the reach of the Nieman Fellows program. We will feel his loss
in many, many ways, and it will be far from easy to find a worthy
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovach and his wife, Lynne, plan to move to Washington where he
plans to write several books, including a memoir. He will stay
active with the group he founded, The Committee of Concerned
Journalists. He will complete a two-year term as ombudsman with
Brill's Content in summer 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks closed out a largely negative quarter on a
positive note Thursday, as a rally in the bond market helped to
push major market indexes higher.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also benefited from quarter-end ``window-dressing'' by
mutual fund managers Thursday. In order to shore up their
portfolios, some managers buy shares of companies that have done
well to make end-of-quarter reports look better to their investors.
</P>
<P>
   Led by gains in Hewlett-Packard, General Electric and Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
123.47, or 1.2 percent at the close, to 10,336.95.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a good performance by drug stocks and big
money-center banks helped to push up the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index
by 14.34, or 1.13 percent, to 1282.71.
</P>
<P>
   Gains of two points or more in stocks like Nextel and Comcast
led the NASDAQ composite index up by 15.89 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 2746.16. And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks
jumped 5.79, or 1.4 percent, to 427.31.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a broader context, Thursday's gains failed to mask
what was a disappointing quarter for most investors.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer quarter, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell
each month, and ended up down 6.6 percent from where it stood at
the end of June. It is the first time the index has fallen for
three straight months since the period of August through October
1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which set a new high of 11,326 on Aug. 25, was down 5.8
percent for the quarter. Helped by semiconductor companies, the
NASDAQ was up for the period, but not much: a 2.2 percent advance.
And the Russell 2000 index slumped by 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this period we had profit-taking from the tremendous up
move that took place from last October until April, as well as on
concerns about inflation and the dollar,'' said Peter Canelo, a
U.S.investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``But
in terms of the S&AMP;P, we have really gone nowhere for quite some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, the S&AMP;P index stood at 1286.40, Canelo
noted, less than four points above its closing level Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last three months have been a good time to own
semiconductor, biotechnology, computer software and oil stocks. And
gold mining stocks had a great quarter in a week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a decidedly different story for investment bank and
brokerage stocks, for apparel retailers, airlines and life
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   And those industries were not alone. As many analysts have
noted, most stocks have been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through Wednesday, a dozen of the 63 groups we cover showed
positive performance'' during the quarter, said Douglas Cliggott,
U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ``One other
group was flat. That means 50 sectors were negative. Stock
leadership during the quarter was diverse, but quite narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the breadth of the market's advance Thursday was
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, winners outnumbered losers by a
margin of just under 2-1. The ratio of winners to losers on the
NASDAQ market was much narrower, but still positive.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy. More than 1 billion shares changed hands on
the Big Board. Volume on the NASDAQ market was 1.16 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/2, to 90 3/4. General
Electric was up 2 1/8, to 118 9/16. And 3M gained 2, to 96 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in interest rates helped big bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup gained 1 3/8, to 44. Chase Manhattan was up 2 3/8, to
75 3/8. And BankBoston gained 2 1/16, to 43 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks also had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer was up 1 7/8, to 35 15/16. Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 2,
to 67 1/2. And Schering-Plough gained 2 1/16, to 43 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were not kind to insurance companies after reports
surfaced that trial lawyers were preparing class-action lawsuits on
behalf of managed-care patients.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna fell 10 9/16, to 49 1/8. Cigna was down 9 1/4, to 77 3/4.
And United Healthcare slid 11 13/16, to 48 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is the next quarter will start out pretty much the way
this one finished, with a lot of volatility and a lack of
conviction,'' Canelo said. ``But by the end of the year I think the
market will be doing well. Interest rate worries will be behind us.
Y2K concerns will be over with and I think the dollar will get the
usual strong bid that we have seen at the end of the last four
years. Things look cloudy now, but there will be a Christmas.''

   JERICHO, West Bank _ A leading Palestinian radical, one of the
few renegades who had remained committed to armed struggle against
Israel, returned home from Damascus Thursday after 32 years in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian, Mustafa Zubari, known as Abu Ali Mustafa, also
ended years of estrangement from Yasser Arafat, and entered the
West Bank to a minor hero's welcome from senior officials of the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   After greeting him at the Jordanian border, the officials
accompanied Zubari to a small ceremony, complete with beeping horns
and ululation, at a dusty bus depot in this desert town.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a crackling loudspeaker, Zubari neither
renounced violence nor embraced peace. The officials who greeted
him, however, made it clear that they saw his return as a victory:
the collapse of a stubborn pocket of resistance both to the peace
process and to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not ask him to sign anything, but there is a consensus
that everybody who returns will denounce violence,'' said Tayeb
Abdel Rahmin, secretary general of the Palestinian Authority. ``His
blessed return represents an important turn and a necessary step
for national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubari, 61, is the deputy chief of a Damascus-based radical
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. His group, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is best known for
plane hijackings in the 1960s and '70s. Its leader, George Habash,
a 72-year-old Marxist, is expected to retire soon and pass the
reins to Zubari.
</P>
<P>
   Through private meetings in Cairo and Amman, Arafat negotiated
the return directly with Zubari. It is part of an aggressive
campaign to bring home key rejectionist leaders and consolidate
Arafat's already formidable control over the Palestinian people at
the beginning of final peace talks with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also recently reconciled with Nayef Hawatmeh, the leader
of another Syrian-based Palestinian faction, the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest, Arafat has had some unlikely help from President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a longtime personal rival. Over the summer
Syria, partly in the interest of renewing its peace talks with
Israel, instructed Palestinian dissident groups in Damascus to give
up the armed struggle and remake themselves as political groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also secured help from Israel, which granted permission
for Zubari to enter the West Bank. And he is seeking an entry
permit for Hawatmeh, too. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday
that Israel is considering the Palestinian request because Hawatmeh
has been portrayed as ``joining the camp of supporters of the peace
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel endorses Arafat's drive to tuck the secular radicals back
under his wing, believing it will strengthen the peace effort. The
radicals split from the Palestine Liberation Organization after
Arafat signed the Oslo peace agreement with Israel in 1993; they
saw it as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether this drive will have more than a
symbolic importance: With their leaders abroad, the radical secular
movements of both Zubari and Hawatmeh were long ago marginalized in
the West Bank and Gaza. The radical Islamic movements have
overtaken them as the chief opposition to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secular opposition doesn't have any teeth,'' said Mahdi
Abdul Hadi, the director of the Palestinian Academic Society for
the Study of International Affairs. ``As long as you're in the
diaspora, you have no constituency.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joshua Teitelbaum, an expert on Palestinian politics at the Tel
Aviv University Dayan Center, said Arafat would use the returns as
``a fig leaf to talk about national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll give him a bit more legitimacy: that's he taking in
all the Palestinians, that he's all-encompassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say the return of the dissidents will help
Arafat face down Hamas and Islamic Holy War, the two religious
fundamentalist opposition groups _ especially if the secular
dissidents are allowed some local authority in towns and refugee
camps where they still have support.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials Thursday said that Zubari's group would
not join the Palestinian Authority, but as PLO members would have a
say in the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the symbolic level, both the Palestinian officials and Zubari
made it clear Thursday that his return would be placed in the
context of a major issue on the table in the talks: the right of
return for millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Abu Ali and his return to exercise his legitimate
right to live in his homeland,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
   Zubari, his voice echoing through a large bus station that held
only about 100 supporters, said: ``I am telling you that there are
four million Palestinians who look at Palestine with the desire to
come back. No one or no force can prevent them from dreaming to
return to their land.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanking Arafat for persuading the Israelis to let him enter,
Zubari acknowledged, ``Yes, we are together.''
</P>
<P>
   But his oratory still bore fire. ``We are together to carry the
flag of the Palestinian resistance as far as they resist our hope
for sovereignty in our land. We have the right to exert all
legitimate struggle.''

COHEN CALLS FOR PROBE OF ALLEGED KOREAN WAR MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After first brushing aside a report of a US Army
massacre of civilians in the Korean War, Defense Secretary William
S. Cohen Thursday called for a probe into whether American troops
machine-gunned hundreds of people over three days in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, sparked by a lengthy Associated Press investigation
that cited allegations of survivors and US veterans, will include a
review of the record and interviews with US soldiers about the
shootings near a hamlet called No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the story in Jakarta, where he was traveling, Cohen
said, ``This has been examined on several occasions in the past and
I am unaware that there is any information that would corroborate
or support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the US government would look again at the issue if
there was any substantive new information.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Washington officials made that determination.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton officially asked for an investigation and told
reporters that Cohen ``wants to get to the bottom of this.'' Army
Secretary Louis Caldera, in a separate news conference, said the AP
story ``clearly has raised new information that demanded that it be
looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP story included interviews with a dozen Army veterans and
relatives of victims as well as declassified Army documents that
showed US commanders, fearing North Koreans forces had infiltrated
civilian populations, ordered troops in late July 1950 to shoot
South Korean refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korea survivors group estimates that 300 people were
herded under a railroad bridge and shot dead about 100 miles
southeast of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea officials promised a full investigation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebeom Kim, spokesman for the South Korean Embassy in
Washington, cautioned it was ``too early to determine whether the
facts in the story are true.'' The United States fought on the side
of South Korea in the North-South war.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Caldera, Clinton said, ``This review is important
to the active and retired members of our armed forces, the
confidence of the American people in the finest armed forces in the
world, and our relationship with the people of the Republic of
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said the probe will probably take a year or more. He
said the Army Center for Military History searched this year for
documents related to the alleged massacre and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera, who took just five questions before walking off a
Pentagon podium with reporters shouting for more time with him,
said Thursday the new review will go much further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it would not excuse the alleged acts, history records
that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were very chaotic,''
Caldera said. ``US soldiers, although they fought with great
courage under very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and
ill-equipped to fight because of the large reduction in resources
available to the military for training and equipment following
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Isserman, a history professor at Hamilton College in
Clinton, N.Y., said other reports of US troops killing Korean
civilians surfaced during the war, ``but it was so easily dismissed
as Communist-inspired stories. So I'm not surprised that this other
account of a massacre should take so long to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Isserman doubted there would be much public outcry over the
report because it's ``so far in the past and the Korean War has
just disappeared for most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered about the veterans who talked about their
memories of the killings. ``These guys carried their experiences
around for 50 years and no one wanted to hear it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the veterans, George Preece, 74, of Liberty, Ky., though,
told the Globe Thursday he hasn't been haunted by the
episode.Preece, who served in the Army for 20 years, said US troops
were only returning fire from North Korean soldiers. Civilians, he
said, were caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you supposed to do?'' said Preece, then in charge of
29 soldiers at the site. ``Not shoot back? We realized there were
women and children in those culverts, but what were we going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Preece also expressed misgivings about the Army probe. ``Too
much time has passed,'' he said. ``People have forgotten. Most of
the people involved were my friends, and most are dead by now. What
happened back then couldn't be helped. It couldn't be helped.''

 &HT;    Stability eludes flood's shelter dwellers
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Grief visits in the quiet of the evening,
when the children are asleep and adults grow weary of talking.
</P>
<P>
   While silence is a relief when you're living cheek to jowl with
hundreds of strangers, it also frees the mind to think about
terrible things.
</P>
<P>
   Like having no home, no car, no clothes, and no idea what the
future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, as Rita Tripp tries to find a comfortable position
on her army cot, she feels the grief pushing on her. A victim of
Hurricane Floyd, she has been living in shelters for two weeks. Her
trailer near Pinecrest Mobile Home Park is probably destroyed,
along with all of her possessions and her car.
</P>
<P>
   Losing belongings and living in a shelter is devastating enough:
Add to that feeling like a vagabond. Tripp and most other residents
left homeless by Floyd have had to pack their suddenly-meager stash
of possessions and move three or four times in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp moved for the fourth time Thursday, from Bethel Elementary
School to the Boys &AMP; Girls Club on Fire Tower Road. She was one of
about 440 people the Red Cross transferred from area schools to
three Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs. Classes are set to begin on Monday, so
officials need to ready the schools for the students' return.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, flood victims were moved around because their shelters
were leaky or without power or water. Now, 150 live in the Ayden
club, 65 in Farmville and 225 in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a struggle, getting tossed around so much,''
Tripp said as she waited outside the gymnasium that would be her
new, temporary home. ``We pack and unpack, pack and unpack. We want
to go somewhere permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   National Guardsmen pulled cargo trucks up to the gym and
unloaded possessions and cots. Bedding and clothing and stuffed
animals and coloring books were bundled in black garbage bags with
family names taped to the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's fellow shelter dwellers straggled off school buses and
walked into the 8,000-square-foot gym. They looked long-faced and
tired, and they shuffled like people who have had to get used to
being told where to go. They lined up their cots along the yellow
cinder block walls and sat down heavily, gearing up to unpack _
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this goes on, the more this is hitting them,'' said
Michael Raper, a Red Cross volunteer who has been living in the
shelters with flood victims. ``They thought, 'Oh, I'll take shelter
from the storm and then go home.' Now, it has been two weeks, and
they're finding out their houses are gone. And they're worried:
They don't understand that the Red Cross is not going to leave
anyone with nowhere to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Harry Grubbs, a National Guard chaplain, was on hand
Thursday at the Fire Tower shelter in case anyone needed to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a good place to be _ where people are being
uprooted one more time,'' he said. ``Tempers are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis and Catalina Cruz stood in the sun outside the gym,
watching as their 3-year-old son, Ippolito, darted between their
legs. They're uncomfortable with the lack of privacy in the
shelters, so they've been sleeping in the back of their Taurus
station wagon. Luis, unable to return to his farming job, is
concerned about money. The family's mobile home in Eastwood Country
Estates is ruined, and they are wondering when help will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have promised us mobile homes, but we have not heard
anything,'' he said, referring to the 300 campers the Federal
Emergency Management Agency plans to set up. ``I don't know why it
is taking so long.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA has said it will be at least the weekend before the first
batch of campers on County Home Road are ready to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Several flood victims said Thursday they are pinning their hopes
on being assigned a camper. Some are simply looking for some sense
of permanence, although they are not sure what form that permanence
will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for FEMA to do what they got to do,'' said Chris
Barfield. ``I'm ready to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has no home. His trailer on Old River Road by the airport
has been under water for two weeks. He doubts anything has
survived, but he hasn't been back to check.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us going back because there's a lot of
snakes,'' he said. ``And the power's out, so it's dark, and I'm
scared of snakes. I don't mess with snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barfield and his wife and 3-year-old son have moved three times
since the storm hit, each time loading and unloading their gray
pickup with garbage bags of donated clothes, blankets and pillows.
Tied to the truck by a chain is Corn Bread, the family puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Spot Dog, another family pet, was too big to bring along when
they evacuated in rising flood waters two weeks ago. Barfield
doesn't know if the dog is dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Reatha Phillips, Barfield's wife, tried to focus on the positive
as she sang Gospel songs along with the truck's radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met a lot of nice people, and I hope one day I will
get to repay them,'' she said. ``One woman gave me clothes, and a
man told me when I get back in a home to go see his son at his
electronics store and he will give me a new TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she does all day, she said she tries to stay busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make phone calls, I wash clothes, I read to my son and take
him out to play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said she enjoys talking with her new friends during the
day, and she even finds herself laughing at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty good during the day,'' she said. ``But it's when
you lay down at night that things start to come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew quiet as her eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about this anymore,'' she said. ``We've held it
in a long time, trying to hold up. It's like you wish you could
find a room to go in and just be alone and let it all out.''

THE ROMANCE IN `GUINEVERE' IS BAFFLING, NOT RACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First-time director Audrey Wells (who wrote ``The Truth About
Cats and Dogs'') has written and crafted an enigmatic but gorgeous
film that purports to delve into the forbidden bond between an
older man and a very young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Guinevere'' won raves at the Sundance Film Festival for
what some viewed as a ``racy'' theme, the film is hardly
provocative. It's a surprisingly tame look at how an older artist,
a photographer named Connie (Stephen Rea), who isn't much of a
Lancelot, seduces a Guinevere every few years, uses her as an
assistant in his work and romantically exploits or initiates her
into his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, and especially in its ending, the film is reminiscent
of Bob Fosse's autobiographical 1979 effort, ``All That Jazz,'' in
which a self-destructive choreographer faithlessly uses the women
around him to fuel his art _ even though he makes each of them a
better dancer in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' isn't nearly as interesting. It lacks the
fundamental ruthlessness and brutal truth that made ``All That
Jazz'' so unapologetically original. Instead, it soft soaps and
romanticizes its tale of an older man who easily convinces a young
woman to become little more than his gofer while he undercuts her
substantial power as a muse. The film provides only a glimpse into
why a man twice the age of his young lover is so willing to be with
a person who is, for the most part, unformed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is Rea's character, who is a lost-puppy-dog,
drunken reveler who makes no apologies for his lifestyle. There's
little reason for his latest conquest, Harper (Sarah Polley), to
take a shine to him outside of her own inexperience and perhaps
rebellion against her rich family and the plans they've forged for
her future.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's jaded mother, played by Jean Smart, is the smartest
thing in the film. A confrontational scene between Smart and Rea is
right on in its brittle accusation, but there are far too few of
these moments in the film. Every Guinevere that Connie has ever
seduced still likes the guy no matter how he mistreated her, and
their lives seem to have fallen ridiculously by the wayside after
they leave him. That's a conceit that barely rings true, even to
those of us who may have weathered a mentor relationship early on.
</P>
<P>
   Wells eventually turns Connie into the tragic figure, a noble
fool, despite his behavior, and the focus shifts from Harper to
Connie, who becomes the victim in the end.
</P>
<P>
   We never learn who Wells is siding with, if she's mocking a
lifestyle that seems demeaning or if she's glorifying the fact that
such relationships still exist. That lack of focus ultimately
undoes the film and undercuts, for the first time, the potency of a
performance bu Canadian actress Sarah Polley (``The Sweet
Hereafter'').
</P>
<P>
   Still, you've got to give Wells credit for giving us a
panoramic, visually lustrous and romantic view of San Francisco. If
this screenwriter ever decides to stop writing, she definitely has
a career in directing and in capturing a world full of bohemian,
Edward Hopper-esque flavor that is potentially awe-inducing and
grandly romantic to aspiring artists everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Guinevere. Directed and written by Audrey Wells. Cast: Sarah
Polley, Stephen Rea, Jean Smart, Gina Gershon. Miramax Films. 105
minutes. Rated R for sexual content.

LATEST URANIUM DISASTER MAY BE WORSE THAN THREE MILE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deadly accident at a Japanese uranium processing plant
Thursday can't compare with the disastrous explosion at the
Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986, but it's probably more serious
than the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island that crippled the US
nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   And a similar accident once happened in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That's the early consensus among authorities on nuclear power as
Japanese emergency officials struggled to contain the country's
worst nuclear power accident ever, and President Clinton offered to
do ``whatever we possibly can'' to help the people affected by the
accident 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious nuclear accident,'' said US Energy Secretary
William Richardson, who was touring nuclear facilities in Russia.
``The good news is that it's not a widely contaminated area. It's a
limited area.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident, which exposed at least two workers to potentially
lethal radiation and forced people within six miles to remain
indoors, happened when workers at the JCO Company in Tokaimura
inadvertently set off a powerful nuclear reaction while making fuel
for commercial nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear reaction, the key ingredient for generating nuclear
power, occurs when a high concentration of radioactive elements is
brought together, causing atoms to begin splitting spontaneously,
releasing vast amounts of heat. But, unlike a nuclear reactor that
is sheathed in steel and concrete to contain the reaction when it
``goes critical,'' a nuclear processing plant has no similar
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear reactors are designed to go critical. Fuel processing
facilities are never intended to go critical,'' said Dr. John
Bernard, acting director of the nuclear lab at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. ``There was a human
error where they miscalculated the amount of uranium.''
</P>
<P>
   The three most seriously injured workers at JCO were purifying
the uranium fuel in a bath of nitric acid when they suddenly saw a
blue flash, company officials said, and they were instantly exposed
to radiation levels high enough to induce vomiting and diarrhea.
Plant officials believe they accidentally put up to 35 pounds of
uranium into the tank, far more than the normal limit of eight
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, radiation levels in the densely populated
surrounding areas were thousands of times the normal level and the
Japanese government had called on 310,000 people living within six
miles to remain indoors until emergency workers can stop the
continuing nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities planned to smother the accident in sodium borate, a
chemical used to stop nuclear reactions in nuclear plants by
absorbing the colliding neutrons that keep the chain reaction
going. But they were trying to figure out how to get close enough
to dump the powder onto the radioactive tank, company official
Kohgo Usami said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the accident is still unfolding, both MIT's Bernard and
nuclear engineer David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned
Scientists said the Tokaimura accident isn't nearly as big as the
Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union, where 31 people were
killed immediately and thousands more may have died from radiation
exposure in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   At Chernobyl, they point out, the 190-ton nuclear core exploded,
spewing detectable radiation for thousands of miles. At Tokaimura,
by contrast, the effects are likely to be less farflung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it will be a long-term problem,'' said
Lochbaum. ``This appears to be a local disaster and not a global
one.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bernard of MIT said the Tokaimura accident
has already done more harm than the partial meltdown at the Three
Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. There, he said, ``people
were scared, but no one was harmed physically'' in what is still
regarded as the worst US commercial nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Lochbaum, believe that people died from long term
exposure at Three Mile Island. But Lochbaum agrees that no one at
Three Mile Island got such high immediate radiation doses as the
three workers who are in critical condition in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission were quick to
point out that the seven nuclear fuel processing plants in the
United States follow strict safety procedures to prevent nuclear
reactions by limiting the volume and concentration of uranium
workers handle, and requiring other safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely inspect these plants for criticality control,''
said NRC spokesman Beth Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   However, a ``criticality incident'' quite similar to the
Tokaimura accident has happened at one US commercial processing
facility, the long-closed United Nuclear Corporation plant in
Charlestown, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1964 employee Robert Peabody accidentally set off a
nuclear chain reaction when he poured liquid uranium into a tank.
He died after being exposed to 1,000 times the lethal dose of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents were very similar,'' said Felix Killar,
director of material licensee and insurance issues for the Nuclear
Energy Institute, a US industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports on the Japanese accident suggested that the
Tokaimura plant did not have the safety features of American
plants, and that the nuclear facilities in Tokaimura have had
safety problems in recent years, including a fire that exposed 37
workers to low-level radiation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists said it
is too soon to say whether the Japanese accident is relevant to the
US fabrication plants located in Virginia, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the keystone cops over there. those are highly
dedicated people,'' said Lochbaum. ``For us to say it can't happen
here so quickly without even understanding what happened, to me is
an irresponsible attitude.''

CHINA ORCHESTRATES NATIONAL CELEBRATION OF 50 YEARS OF COMMUNISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China celebrated the 50th anniversary of Communist
rule Friday, orchestrating a nationwide festival of patriotic pride
that presented a seamless-looking display of political unity and
popular happiness.
</P>
<P>
   With a grand parade rolling into central Beijing on Friday
morning, crowned by gleaming new missiles, shiny tanks and gaudy
floats, China's leaders put together a show intended to project a
jubilant manifestation of national strength and harmony. A
temporary state of martial law in much of Beijing ensured that the
event was cheered on by hundreds of thousands of pre-arranged
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's party demonstrated the government's resilient
organizational skills more than any genuine national strength, the
celebration was so huge _ with 500,000 participants _ and was
perceived by the authorities as so critically important that it
became a significant political event in itself.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin presided Friday, and the festivities might
as well have been called ``Jiang's Show.'' After months of
groundwork, Friday's parade crowned Jiang's efforts to lift himself
to the same historical plane as China's two great modern leaders,
Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Among Friday's floats were ones that carried separate portraits
of Mao, Deng and Jiang _ the first time that the latter has been
placed on a par with the two earlier leaders in such a public way.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1 will long be remembered in China for the day 50 years ago
when Mao stood atop Tiananmen _ the imperial Gate of Heavenly Peace
_ and proclaimed that the Chinese people had finally stood up,
after decades of civil war and foreign invasion. The last major
Oct. 1 celebration had been staged on the 35th anniversary, in
1984, to celebrate Deng's rule and his program for economic growth,
and Friday was clearly intended to mark Jiang's turn in the
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 50 years of trials and tribulations, all the people of
the country must unite even more tightly around the Party center
with Jiang Zemin as its core,'' said the Beijing Youth Daily in a
typical hymn to the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many Chinese, Jiang displays no vision or charisma worthy
of Mao or Deng, nor does he even seem to believe in the Communist
ideology that he still talks about in public. He often seems to
symbolize the government's confused stance on its most basic issue:
should China be Communist or capitalist?
</P>
<P>
   For anyone taking the 50th birthday as a time to consider broad
historical trends, China's direction seems clear: Communist
authority is being slowly but inexorably undermined each day by the
twin forces of money and information, the same dynamic powers that
have invaded other countries with a maturing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often remark at the seemingly peaceful coexistence of
Communist Party rule and burgeoning capitalism. Yet a quiet battle
is actually under way all over this country, visible on any street
corner in Beijing where McDonald's restaurants or mobile-phone
stores signal the arrival of hard-to-control entities in China.
</P>
<P>
   It is also evidenced in countless instances where government
officials are forced to confront their gradual loss of control over
many fields, such as the Internet. Recently, Information Industry
Minister Wu Jichuan abruptly announced a ban on foreign investment
in Internet-related companies, a potentially devastating step
backward.
</P>
<P>
   His ministry has spent years building telecommunications
equipment, and the country's leaders have said that they want to
embrace the Internet as a critical tool for Chinese companies and
researchers and students. Yet if it is carried out, China's young
Internet industry, and many of its best entrepreneurs, may feel
forced to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In China's media, the 50th anniversary has been occasion to
release, under the pretense of a consideration of history, long
strings of praise and seemingly mindless slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course of 50 years of struggle tells us that only
socialism can save China,'' said the Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily in an editorial Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The party's claim to national strength and tranquility are
belied by tough limits on freedom of speech or assembly, rights
that are spelled out in China's constitution, particularly about a
political issue as sensitive as Oct. 1 itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told what to print,'' said a Shanghai newspaper
editor, referring to coverage of the Oct. 1 celebrations. ``There
was no discussion, no variation, no room to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Chinese, this editor said he was indifferent to the
holiday, although he was glad that the authorities gave office and
factory workers an entire week off. Few of his friends, the editor
said, were likely to give much thought to whether there is any
deeper meaning in Communist China's 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that the government awarded extra vacation days
appears to have been to compensate many people for troubles
incurred by organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Beijing, for example, was put under martial law
to insure a smooth operation of Friday's proceedings, a reminder of
how anything as basic as freedom of movement is still secondary to
the vanity of the nation's leaders. Leaving little to chance, the
authorities ordered shut every window facing Beijing's main avenue,
and blocked some residents from leaving their homes for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet Information Network, a London-based human rights group,
reported that Tibetans in Lhasa have been told that their pay or
pensions would be cut if they failed to take part in rehearsals for
anniversary celebrations.

COHEN CALLS FOR PROBE OF ALLEGED KOREAN WAR MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After first brushing aside a report of a US Army
massacre of civilians in the Korean War, Defense Secretary William
S. Cohen Thursday called for a probe into whether American troops
machine-gunned hundreds of people over three days in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, sparked by a lengthy Associated Press investigation
that cited allegations of survivors and US veterans, will include a
review of the record and interviews with US soldiers about the
shootings near a hamlet called No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the story in Jakarta, where he was traveling, Cohen
said, ``This has been examined on several occasions in the past and
I am unaware that there is any information that would corroborate
or support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the US government would look again at the issue if
there was any substantive new information.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Washington officials made that determination.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton officially asked for an investigation and told
reporters that Cohen ``wants to get to the bottom of this.'' Army
Secretary Louis Caldera, in a separate news conference, said the AP
story ``clearly has raised new information that demanded that it be
looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP story included interviews with a dozen Army veterans and
relatives of victims as well as declassified Army documents that
showed US commanders, fearing North Koreans forces had infiltrated
civilian populations, ordered troops in late July 1950 to shoot
South Korean refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korea survivors group estimates that 300 people were
herded under a railroad bridge and shot dead about 100 miles
southeast of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea officials promised a full investigation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebeom Kim, spokesman for the South Korean Embassy in
Washington, cautioned it was ``too early to determine whether the
facts in the story are true.'' The United States fought on the side
of South Korea in the North-South war.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Caldera, Clinton said, ``This review is important
to the active and retired members of our armed forces, the
confidence of the American people in the finest armed forces in the
world, and our relationship with the people of the Republic of
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said the probe will probably take a year or more. He
said the Army Center for Military History searched this year for
documents related to the alleged massacre and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera, who took just five questions before walking off a
Pentagon podium with reporters shouting for more time with him,
said Thursday the new review will go much further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it would not excuse the alleged acts, history records
that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were very chaotic,''
Caldera said. ``US soldiers, although they fought with great
courage under very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and
ill-equipped to fight because of the large reduction in resources
available to the military for training and equipment following
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Isserman, a history professor at Hamilton College in
Clinton, N.Y., said other reports of US troops killing Korean
civilians surfaced during the war, ``but it was so easily dismissed
as Communist-inspired stories. So I'm not surprised that this other
account of a massacre should take so long to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Isserman doubted there would be much public outcry over the
report because it's ``so far in the past and the Korean War has
just disappeared for most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered about the veterans who talked about their
memories of the killings. ``These guys carried their experiences
around for 50 years and no one wanted to hear it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the veterans, George Preece, 74, of Liberty, Ky., though,
told the Globe Thursday he hasn't been haunted by the
episode.Preece, who served in the Army for 20 years, said US troops
were only returning fire from North Korean soldiers. Civilians, he
said, were caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you supposed to do?'' said Preece, then in charge of
29 soldiers at the site. ``Not shoot back? We realized there were
women and children in those culverts, but what were we going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Preece also expressed misgivings about the Army probe. ``Too
much time has passed,'' he said. ``People have forgotten. Most of
the people involved were my friends, and most are dead by now. What
happened back then couldn't be helped. It couldn't be helped.''

A STRING QUARTET WORTHY OF ITS PRIZE, NO QUESTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Lawrence A. Johnson writes about music for The Chicago Tribune, The
New Criterion and Opera News.  
 By LAWRENCE A. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the Pulitzer Prize for music was established in 1943, the
awards have provoked as much debate and, often, consternation as
those for fiction and journalism. Some choices have proved astute:
Copland's ``Appalachian Spring,'' Hanson's Symphony No. 4,
Menotti's ``Consul'' and Sessions' Concerto for Orchestra. Others,
from this distance, can only seem mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, has become of Leslie Bassett's Variations for
Orchestra (1966) or Richard Wernick's ``Visions of Wonder and
Terror'' (1977)? And who can fail to be stumped by the 1990 prize
awarded to Mel Powell's ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos and
Orchestra'' over John Corigliano's greatly esteemed (and widely
performed) Symphony No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   But few could disagree with the 1998 Pulitzer Prize awarded to
Aaron Jay Kernis for his String Quartet No. 2, ``Musica
Instrumentalis.'' As performed by the Lark Quartet on a new disk
with Kernis' First Quartet (Arabesque Z6727; CD), ``Musica
Instrumentalis'' is revealed as one of the finest American string
quartets of the last two decades, and perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   If some of his early music betrayed strong influences of Leonard
Bernstein in its jazzy melodic contours and populist inspiration,
as well as an occasional polemical shrillness, his Second Quartet
demonstrates that Kernis, 39, has, in a relatively short time,
evolved into a composer of real mastery and individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned for the Lark Quartet, the work is cast in three
movements. The subtitle reflects the Renaissance inspiration in the
suite of dances in the opening ``Overture.'' Despite the movement's
sharply rhythmic elements, Kernis' capers never lose their
essential geniality.
</P>
<P>
   A canzonetta, offering dainty counterpoint, is followed by a
dark-hued musette, and the individual instrumental lines, often
playing in the highest registers, show great freedom throughout the
movement. The dances are recapitulated in a frenzied conclusion,
which also introduces a striking choralelike theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarabande Double, Sarabande Simple,'' the playful, Brittenian
title of the second movement, belies its scale and expressive
depth. The movement is dedicated to the memory of Bette Snapp, a
supporter of young composers, who died as Kernis was writing this
music. The composer skillfully sustains the 16-minute span of this
understated yet deeply felt movement.
</P>
<P>
   The long-breathed double sarabande starts in the cello and
proceeds to the other instruments, and bursts of frenzied
counterpoint interrupt the still surfaces of the richly spun
lyrical phrases. Yet it is the Tallis-esque calm and elevated
spiritual introspection of this music that are most compelling,
conveying a melting, tender intimacy tempered by a dignified
seriousness of expression.
</P>
<P>
   The final movement, ``Double Triple Gigue Fugue,'' may suggest a
basketball statistic, but here the inspiration comes from the last
movement of Beethoven's Third ``Razumovsky'' Quartet (Op. 59, No.
3). Kernis' finale is as structurally clever as it is satisfying on
a surface level, developing Beethoven's main theme, in a tightly
packed 10 minutes, into his own double and triple fugue. Yet this
music is anything but dryly didactic in its vibrant rush of good
humor and rude vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The composer here delights in his virtuosity, tossing in a
tarantella, gigue and rondo for good measure and, in the process,
offering some of the most life-affirming and refreshingly
unneurotic American chamber music heard in years.
</P>
<P>
   A few atonal burps near the end sound like an ironic nod to the
obligatory modernism of years past. The development has an
irresistible drive and energy, and the false endings and back flips
before the brief coda make for a genuinely witty finale not
unworthy of Beethoven himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kernis' First String Quartet, dating from seven years
earlier, may not be on quite the same level as the Second, it is
still a notable achievement. The vaulting lyricism and dervish
eclecticism of the long first movement are perhaps less indelible,
with a certain predictability to the to-ing and fro-ing between
furious counterpoint and lyrical sections, which are less
interestingly developed.
</P>
<P>
   The brief third and fourth movements are more self-contained.
The scherzo alternates Mahler-hard pizzicatos with frenzied violin
solo flights, and the propulsive finale proves more chaotic than
cumulative.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it is in the slow movement that Kernis' gift for
melody finds its natural voice. Subtitled ``Musica Celestis,'' the
music draws inspiration from Hildegard of Bingen, which it makes
palpable in its rapt mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   As before, the composer explores a vein of concentrated
spirituality, evolving from the monastic stillness of the gentle
opening to a Bernsteinian sweetness and sense of release; the
return to the reflective opening material is most affecting in its
sense of inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Both works are given first-class advocacy by the superb
musicians of the Lark Quartet, itself a prize winner (a Naumburg
Award in 1990). At times, the song of the Lark violins turns a bit
piercing under pressure, but generally the young players make the
strongest possible case for this music, playing with great
unanimity, eloquence and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially adept at exploring the restless, searching
quality of Kernis' slow movements without gilding the lily.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Second Quartet is the more impressive work, both
would repay investigation by chamber ensembles looking for music
that manages to be both communicative and substantive without
hitching yet another ride on the neo-Romantic or
mystical-Minimalist bandwagon. Kernis' fine quartets show both
American chamber music and Kernis himself to be, at least in part,
in robust artistic health.

7.5-STRENGTH QUAKE ROCKS SOUTHERN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A strong earthquake rivalling ones that recently
devastated areas of Taiwan and Turkey rocked southern Mexico
Thursday, killing at least 10 people, toppling church towers and
shaking buildings for hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports, however, gave few casualties and little damage
from the quake, which struck at 11:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   It registered 7.5 on the Richter scale and was centered 275
miles southeast of Mexico City near the Pacific coast of Oaxaca
state, said the US Geological Survey in Golden, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people died in Oaxaca, including two women whose
house collapsed on them, Gov. Jose Murat told the Televisa
television network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some panic here but fortunately there doesn't appear
to be any major problems or damage,'' Murat said two hours after
the quake hit.
</P>
<P>
   Two other victims were killed as they tried to leave their homes
and were hit by falling pieces of cement, Murat added. Television
images showed several partially collapsed buildings in Oaxaca City
and downed utility poles. Another person was killed in the popular
Pacific resort of Puerto Escondido.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca is a largely rural area and one of the country's poorest
states, but a popular tourist destination known for its beaches and
resort hotels in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido.
</P>
<P>
   The quake rippled through most of southern and central Mexico
and reportedly reached as far north as Jalisco state. Emergency
officials said they had not yet surveyed all of the affected rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor was felt strongly in Mexico City, one of the world's
largest and densely populated metropolitan areas with nearly 20
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of office workers fled their buildings and gathered along
avenues. Schools were immediately evacuated but classes resumed in
the afternoon. Many buidlings in the central part of the city
suffered shattered windows and electricity and telephone service
were temporarily interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete high-rise housing the Mexico City prosecutor's
office was cleared out and shut down because of damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer outside than in,'' said Jaime Calderon, 37, who
stood outside his convenience store in the southern neighborhood of
Coyoacan, an area of colonial-era buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One quake-related death was reported in the capital, when a
63-year-old man suffered a fatal heart attack caused by the shock
of the quake. In Veracruz state a 60-year-old woman died of head
injuries after she fell while running out of her house.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo was on a day trip to the central state
of Queretaro when the quake hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially worried about Oaxaca,'' the president told
reporters before cutting short his visit to return to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake marked the second time in less than four months
that the region was rattled by a strong temblor. A 6.7-magnitude
quake, also centered in Oaxaca, killed 15 people and caused minor
damage, most of it in the city of Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention, one of the
country's main earthquake-monitoring agencies, warned of
aftershocks. A minor one was registered a 2 p.m. local time in the
same area of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The US Geological Survey also issued warnings for tsunamis _
large ocean waves caused by earthquakes _ for the Pacific coasts of
Mexico Central America, as well as for Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   With every earthquake that rattles this country, memories and
fears are revived of the deadly temblor that struck on Sept. 19,
1985, which registered 8.1 and killed at least 9,500 people. Many
residents cried again Thursday, expressing a mixture of fear from
the latest quake and pain from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about them everyday,'' said one woman who lost two
aunts and three cousins as she stood outside a supermarket. ``And
when another one hits I worry about the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a 7.6-magnitude quake hit Taiwan, toppling high-rise
buildings and killing more than 2,000 people. A 7.4-magnitude
earthquake in Turkey on August 17 left more than 15,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Except for similarities in strength, there did not appear to be
any connection between Thursday's temblor and those in other parts
of the world, Mexican seismologists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The quake came just days after another national tragedy. Sixty
people were killed in Celaya, Guanajuato, on Sunday when a series
of explosions tore through a crowded marketplace. The blasts were
blamed on an illegal fireworks warehouse.

TRITE THEME OF `DRIVE ME CRAZY' WOULD SEND ANYONE OVER THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much longer will Hollywood insist upon driving us crazy with
insipid romantic comedies about two polar-opposite high school kids
who, after sparring and trying to get each other to change, find
they're perfect together on the eve of the big dance?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That,'' ``Can't Buy Me Love,'' ``10 Things I Hate
About You'' _ you name it, the formula is pretty similar no matter
who's starring in the film. In this case, it's a vehicle to thrust
Melissa Joan Hart, who stars in the TV series ``Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch,'' onto the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Drive Me Crazy,'' she plays Nicole, a popular high school
senior who has a crush on Brad (Gabriel Carpenter), a basketball
star. But Brad finds Nicole's snake of a friend, Alicia (Susan May
Pratt), far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Her next-door neighbor is Chase (Adrien Grenier), an activist
and coffeehouse denizen who dates the equally bohemian Dulcie (Ali
Carter). But Dulcie's ditched him.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole and Chase scheme to make their partners jealous: they'll
pretend to be dating. The usual pitfalls ensue and by the night of
the dance, they discover they like each other.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Drive Me Crazy'' is so badly plotted and
written that it rarely makes much sense, even with the elementary
story line.
</P>
<P>
   Drive Me Crazy. Directed by John Schultz. Written by Rob Thomas.
Cast: Melissa Joan Hart, Adrien Grenier. 20th Century Fox. 91
minutes. Rated PG-13 for language.

NEIMAN CHIEF KOVACH TO STEP DOWN

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Recommending an ``upgrade'' to a leader who
could help navigate technological and economic changes in the media
business, Bill Kovach announced Thursday that he would step down as
curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard spokeswoman said President Neil Rudenstine will choose
a successor to Kovach with the advice of a search committee, to be
named immediately. The foundation, which runs the nation's most
prestigious journalism fellowships and serves as a sort of
journalism think tank, hopes to have a new director by April, in
time to choose the new class of Nieman fellows.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the foundation's advisory board, Kovach cited
``personal and practical reasons'' for stepping down. The changes
in communications technology and the economic hierarchy of
journalism have altered the work of the business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have struggled to keep abreast of this change . . . but I
grow distant from direct experience,'' he wrote. ``It makes me less
able to anticipate or appreciate their practical needs. The
university and future fellows are, as we say these days, ready for
an upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   A former New York Times reporter and editor, Kovach arrived as a
Nieman fellow 11 years ago after resigning as head of the Atlanta
Journal and Constitution in a dispute over editorial independence
from its ownership. He became ``emergency'' curator after the death
of Howard Simons in 1988, and was named to the post officially the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on and step back a little bit,'' Kovach said
Thursday. ``I came here planning on staying six months at most. . .
. This is my tenth Nieman class. And that is a nice round number.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has lost two media heavyweights this year, with Marvin
Kalb already having stepped down as director of the Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at the
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine is considering a long list of people to replace
Kovach, one source said, but there are no firm or final contenders.
The Shorenstein Center has been searching for a leader for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the person who takes over at Nieman and at the
Shorenstein Center are mindful of these tremendous changes (in
journalism) and therefore more determined than ever to stick to
some of the fundamental values, and not to let the marketplace
determine how news is covered,'' said Kalb, now executive director
of the Shorenstein Center, from a new satellite office in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Kovach has been the very model of a curator for the
Nieman Foundation,'' Rudenstine said. ``He commands instant respect
in this country and abroad, and has constantly enhanced the quality
and the reach of the Nieman Fellows program. We will feel his loss
in many, many ways, and it will be far from easy to find a worthy
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovach and his wife, Lynne, plan to move to Washington where he
plans to write several books, including a memoir. He will stay
active with the group he founded, The Committee of Concerned
Journalists. He will complete a two-year term as ombudsman with
Brill's Content in summer 2000.

 &HT;    `Mystery' mix of sex, hugs and bump-and-roll
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As we learn in ``Mystery, Alaska,'' the
two most enjoyable things to do in cold weather are play hockey and
fornicate. Director Jay Roach's quirky little movie is more about
the former than the latter, but is a pleasant enough couple of
hours nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   More so than Roach, the force behind this sports fable is
co-writer/producer David E. Kelley, the prolific creator of a
handful of current television comic-dramas as well as the overtly
oddball former series, ``Picket Fences.'' ``Mystery, Alaska'' seems
to answer a question you probably never posed: What do you get when
you cross a ``Picket Fences'' episode with one from ``Northern
Exposure''?
</P>
<P>
   It's small-town life salted with peculiar, but endearing
characters, a bit of romantic longing, some time spent in
courtrooms, a little pseudo-suspense and lots of ice and snow.
There is enough story here even if you have no interest in hockey,
and more than sufficient if you do.
</P>
<P>
   For Mystery is a hockey-crazy hamlet, with its citizens obsessed
with ''the Saturday game,'' a longstanding local pick-up game
manned by the town sheriff, grocer, delivery boy and the like.
One's social standing and likelihood of getting lucky, sexually
speaking, revolve around the game.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the entire town has gotten lucky when a former
Mysterian writes about the team in Sports Illustrated, boasting
that the squad rivals the best in the National Hockey League on
pure skating ability. Improbably _ but go with it _ the pro league
sees the promotional potential of such a matchup and orders the New
York Rangers to play an exhibition game against these pond hockey
amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone is thrilled, except for Judge Walter Burns
(Burt Reynolds, with a great head of snow white toupee and a Sean
Connery beard). A college player with residual bitterness that he
never made the Saturday team, Burns warns the town to keep its
dignity and its illusions by passing on the Rangers' challenge.
Burns is also busy resenting his hockey-playing son and handling
his precocious daughter, who is eager to go to bed _ or, at least,
to van _ with her boyfriend Stevie.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie has just replaced Sheriff Biebe (Russell Crowe) on the
team after 13 years, a blow which sends Biebe into an early midlife
mope. Nor is his mood helped by the airlifted arrival of the SI
writer (Hank Azaria), who happens to be his wife's high school
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the team stud, who is doing more than rubbing noses
with the mayor's wife. And the town bumpkin lawyer (Maury Chaykin,
in the Fyvush Finkel role), who defends a local for shooting a
sales rep from the dreaded Price World and later goes head-to-head
with New York city slicker attorneys when the big game is
threatened with a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roach handles all of this with a surprisingly light
touch, far better than you might expect from viewing his two claims
to fame, the ``Austin Powers'' yukfests. Surely he is the reason
that Mike Myers shows up in a fun cameo as a fickle TV
sportscaster. Myers is topped, however, by a brief appearance from
Little Richard as the celebrity National Anthem singer who helps
the Mystery team with his tempo.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic hockey game is the least interesting part of
``Mystery, Alaska,'' but by then you are likely to be invested
enough in the players to care a little. Who knows, maybe there's a
director's cut for those who would rather see more of the town's
other prime activity.

 &HT;    Suburban angst delivered in superb fashion
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like a microscope focusing on a toxic
specimen, the camera of ``American Beauty'' swoops down through the
neatly lined trees of a benign suburban street and into the home of
the Burnhams. The gentle motion begins a fasten-your-seat-belts
journey through the armored defenses of a prototypical family, an
organism pulsing with pain and unexpected humor.
</P>
<P>
   With sour sarcasm, Lester Burnham (a bone-weary Kevin Spacey)
narrates the ride, introducing himself, his maniacally driven real
estate agent wife Carolyn (an aptly shrill Annette Bening) and his
acutely insecure teen-age daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Trapped in a
dead-end editorial job and a comatose marriage, 42-year-old Lester
tells us that he will be dead within a year, in a voice at peace
with his imminent demise.
</P>
<P>
   He might as well be dead. Carolyn and Jane both think he is a
loser, and he hasn't the gumption to disagree. But Lester's life is
about to be transformed by the sight of Jane's cheerleader friend
Angela (``American Pie'''s Mena Suvari), a calculating Lolita that
he imagines surrounded by blood red rose petals in one of
first-time director Sam Mendes' several bold fantasy touches.
Lester's life suddenly has meaning, so he quits his job, buys a
sports car and begins pumping iron in anticipation of his conquest
of Angela.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lester's changes are the most obvious, everyone in
``American Beauty'' longs to break out of their unfulfilling
existence. And thanks to Alan Ball's cleverly schematic and
deliciously surprising screenplay _ his first, after toiling in the
formulaic fields of TV's ``Cybill'' _ they each reach out for what
has been missing in their lives. Carolyn, for instance, not only
attains motel intimacy with her Realtor rival (Peter Gallagher),
but finds intermittent inner peace on a pistol range.
</P>
<P>
   If the Burnhams seem normal at a distance, there is no hiding
the aberrance of their new neighbors _ a rigid retired Marine
colonel (Chris Cooper), his catatonic wife (Alison Janney) and
their misfit son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees the world through
the lens of a video camera when he is not selling drugs. Yet there
is a sweetness to Ricky's quickly developed fixation on Jane, a
kindred spirit amid her own parental war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Ball's script, captured with such assurance by Mendes, begins
with an agile balance between the dramatic, the comic and the
horrific. Gradually, it accelerates into bitter melodrama, but even
that feels premeditated and coolly controlled. In its transcendent
final moments, as we reach the burst of violence we've been
promised from the start, ``American Beauty'' brings to mind the
mordancy of another suburban elegy, ``The Ice Storm,'' while still
remaining wholly original.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall, Mendes delivers a
vivid, dreamlike visual style. As his theater background
(``Cabaret,'' ``The Blue Room'') suggests, his real strength is
drawing performances from actors. Spacey is commanding, even in his
lethargy, as Everyman Lester, and his climactic encounter with
Angela will make you stop breathing. Birch goes beyond the usual
teen angst and newcomer Bentley projects an understated
self-confidence that is mesmerizing. Only Bening seems to be
working too hard, pushing Carolyn a little closer to caricature
than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the flaws are minor compared with the insidious achievements
of this Hollywood studio release that feels, looks and satisfies
like a maverick independent film. With ``American Beauty,'' Mendes
and Ball combine for the most unsettling and impressive double
debut in memory.

 &HT;    Gulf War gets anti-war treatment
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every major conflict deserves its own
chaotic, surreal anti-war movie, and now Desert Storm has one. In
case your television was in the shop that month, David O. Russell's
gritty, grungy ``Three Kings'' takes us back to early 1991 to
re-create the bedlam of that media war's final days. It is a
stunning film that scratches its head over what that effort to
repel Iraqi aggression was really about.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one constant in war, it is greed, so Russell
grafts his political cynicism onto a caper tale, as four soldiers
wander off in search of riches once a tenuous cease-fire is
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens, Saddam Hussein's forces have been routed
from Kuwait, and American troops are celebrating the victory, but
there is also a pent-up frustration of never having engaged in
ground combat. With the truce conditions unclear, a soldier
casually asks his pals, ``Are we shooting?'' just before taking aim
and picking off an Iraqi atop a nearby sand mound. If you think
that war is hell, you should see the ravages of peace.
</P>
<P>
   While processing the surrendering enemy _ variously referred to
as ``towel heads'' and ``camel jockeys'' _ a map is found on one of
them. When maverick Special Forces Capt. Archie Gates (a jut-jawed,
gruff George Clooney) recognizes that it indicates the location of
Iraqi-confiscated Kuwaiti gold ingots, he soon commandeers a Humvee
and leads a trio of military misfits on a mercenary mission.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Kelly's Heroes'' for the '90s. Their AWOL odyssey for
riches turns into an eye-opening expedition of incongruous sights
and encounters, which brings them no closer to understanding the
war. Assisted by Newton Thomas Sigel's stunning, bleached-out
photography, director Russell creates a sandscape of surreal
visions and actions. From a mine-strewn desert to skeet-shooting
with football bomb targets to underground caches of such Kuwaiti
treasures as luxury cars, cell phones and plastic forks, it rivals
``Catch-22'' or ``Apocalypse Now'' in absurdist imagery.
</P>
<P>
   As Gates and his makeshift squad bully their way through the
locals en route to the gold, it is hard to tell the Iraqis from the
Kuwaitis, and that just might be the point. Certainly, when the
American soldiers start manhandling the people they have just
liberated, the Kuwaitis have difficulty distinguishing between us
and the oppressive Iraqis. Also left twisting in the arid Middle
Eastern wind are the Iraqi rebels who helped rout Hussein, stymied
by our policy of indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the subject matter, ``Three Kings'' has relatively
little overt violence, though that will not be much consolation to
the cow that gets exploded as target practice. And squeamish
moviegoers are not going to care for Russell's two ventures inside
the human body, one to see the organ damage of a bullet and the
other to view an impromptu lung operation.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney inches closer to movie stardom as Gates, but he seems
content to fit into the ensemble next to Ice Cube as a devoutly
religious Detroit baggage handler and Mark Wahlberg as a family man
who gets captured and tortured by the Iraqis. Spike Jonze will
probably get on your nerves as a dense redneck in way over his
head, but Nora Dunn has some amusing screaming fits as a TV
reporter purposely diverted from the final scraps of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has come a long way from the shaggy dog-story farce of
``Flirting With Disaster,'' adding some gravity to his palette
without abandoning the dark humor. There undoubtedly were some
tales of valor from the Gulf War, but you'd never know it from
``Three Kings.''

BEATTY SPEECH DOESN'T SETTLE `WILL HE, WON'T HE?' QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his taped greeting to the evening's honoree,
comedian Garry Shandling provided some campaign advice,
Hollywood-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you run,'' he suggested, ``make sure you get your name
above the title of the country. `Warren Beatty . . . in the United
States of America.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The soldout crowd _ an amalagam of movie stars, old-time liberal
Democrats and the usual stargazers _ roared at the joke. But
Shandling's advice, as much as Beatty's potential bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination, underscored just how blurry the
line between politics and celebrity has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect conjunction of Washington and Hollywood,
which is what the culture has been striving for for half a
century,'' said Marty Kaplan, a communications professor at the
University of Southern California. ``No one's even sure he's
running, but everyone loves a tease.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 reporters from around the world watching, the
tease continued Wednesday night. In the same ballroom where the
Golden Globe awards are held _ and with Jack Nicholson, Dustin
Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, and Courtney Love, among other celebrities,
looking on _ Beatty outlined the agenda for a liberal candidacy,
but refrained from declaring himself a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he called for an overhaul of the campaign finance
system and for universal health care, he slammed the Democratic
Party for looking Republican and he said both Democratic contenders
were cautious centrists untrue to the party's traditions. Beatty,
accepting an annual award for political activism from the Southern
California chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action,
identified himself as a ``tax-and-spend, bleeding-heart liberal
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty asked in a 40-minute
speech peppered with statistics on homelessness, poverty, and
so-called corporate welfare. ``Have we come to the point where the
Democratic Party needs to have a Republican president before it
finds its voice again?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes sounding like a halting lecturer, often sounding like
the rhythmic, rapping US senator he played in the movie
``Bulworth,'' Beatty said he would not let ``monied, honeyed voices
of ridicule and reaction'' stop him from considering a run for
office. He also made clear that he believes important issues are
going undiscussed.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear, however, was whether he actually intends to
make a longshot bid for the Democratic nomination or whether he
simply hopes to influence the two contenders.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since he was first mentioned as a possible
candidate, Beatty has made no effort to pull together a campaign
organization. But momentum for his candidacy, at least among the
Hollywood liberals who could afford $80 a ticket, was evident at
the Beverly Hills Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I remember `Bulworth,' '' he can shake the whole country
up,'' said Quincy Beaver, president of the California Democratic
Council. ``I think the country is waiting for a politically
progressive move, and Warren Beatty is the one to bring it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the bank of TV cameras and microphones that
lined the entranceway to the ballroom, Dustin Hoffman said, ``The
public knows the professional candidates are not saying what they
feel. Warren always tried to make a good movie. He didn't care how
it opened the first weekend. I'm saying it's the same and the
public knows it in their bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who came out to see Beatty, however, was as
enchanted by his potential candidacy as they were his celebrity or
longtime involvement in political causes. Even producer Norman
Lear, who presented the award to Beatty, stopped short of endorsing
his candidacy. Most of the taped congratulations _ from Barbra
Streisand to Jesse Jackson to Roseanne to George McGovern _ were
encouraging but noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty stressed that the times and what he called the vaccuum in
Democratic leadership demand a new voice, whether his or someone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an unexpected person showed that he or she had that spirit
and the ability to lead and said to me, ``Look there's no liberal
running for president . . . and that serious people of good
judgment are actually talking to that person about running . . . it
wouldn't make any difference to me how that person became well
known. . . . I'd say, `There's no harm in thinking about this,
however unlikely it might be.' ''

 &HT;    McCartney's new CD draws inspiration from a Broad Street
storefront
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul McCartney's new solo album hits stores Tuesday
and both the title song ``Run Devil Run'' and cover photo were
inspired by a chance visit to a drugstore in what the former Beatle
calls the ``funky'' part of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney credits his inspiration to Miller's Rexall Drugs, a
working pharmacy just south of the old Rich's department store at
87 Broad St.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Miller's also has come to specialize in products
designed to ward off Satan and bring the good life. It's a
down-home, laidback store where bottles of demon-chasing bath beads
and floor wash, incense, candles and even lottery-winning guides
fill glass counters and line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The store, located at ground level in a nondescript
stone-and-brick building more than 100 years old, was founded by
Donald Miller, the uncle of current owner Richard Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a grocery store _ Miss Atlanta Supermarket _ in
here, but it had closed, so this space was open,'' Richard Miller
says (his semi-retired uncle works part time at the store). ``This
was the heart of Atlanta as far as shopping for black customers
went at that time and he saw this as having a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The area today hosts a variety of mom-and-pop businesses, having
lost large merchandisers such as Rich's and Kessler's. ``But it's a
pretty vibrant area,'' Miller says, adding that his customers ``are
a wide range of people _ high government officials, lawyers,
janitors, schoolteachers and retired people. We see a lot of
second- and third-generation customers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, 57, discovered the store in January when he was in
town with two of his children. His daughter Heather was unveiling
her household creations at a trade show at the AmericasMart
Atlanta. (McCartney's wife, Linda, died in April 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   McCartney says his son James, 21, ``wanted to visit the funky
side of town. So we went down there and were just wandering around
the block and we came across this sort of voodoo shop selling cures
for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking in the shop window and I saw this bottle of bath
salts called `Run Devil Run,''' McCartney says in a release
accompanying the album. ``I thought that was a good title for a
song. So when I was on holiday after that, I started thinking of
words for it and it came quite easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenblatt, a marketing vice president for Capitol Records
in Los Angeles, said that McCartney had taken ``some snapshots'' of
the store, but later decided he wanted a professional photographer
to shoot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up writing the song `Run Devil Run' for the album and
wanted it (the store) on the album cover,'' Rosenblatt said. The
cover depictions have been altered slightly, with the name
``Miller's'' on the Rexall sign changed to ``Earl's.'' But the rest
of the two storefronts are very similar, right down to the Herbal
Viagra advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Run Devil Run is a merchandise line produced in Birmingham by
Sonny Boy Products. Of the company's prospects for sudden fame,
co-owner Sherry Sexton said, ``We're in a wait-and-see mode, but
we're getting a Web site up Friday (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about McCartney's ``voodoo'' reference, Sexton said, ``We
don't call any of our products voodoo. All our products have
prayers and Bible references.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Whitehead, 37, a regular customer at Miller's who as a
child accompanied his mother to the store, agrees, saying Run Devil
Run and similar products bring ``power to the mind'' and compares
their use to ``taking an aspirin when you're sick.''
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken man, Miller, who lives in Marietta, welcomes any
exposure the CD might bring. ``I have two children in college, so I
could use the extra business.''
</P>
<P>
   Like wholesaler Sexton, Miller, who employs a part-time
pharmacist, says the items are ``spiritual not voodoo,'' but
concedes, ``the difference is connotation ... there's really no
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Miller didn't know of the McCartney connection
until a journalist told him this week. At that point, he recalled
an unusual incident that occurred ``two or three months ago,'' when
a long black limousine stopped in front of the store and three
people jumped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the limo pull up and people pile out in front of my
store, I went out and asked all three of them _ there was a lady, a
photographer and the limo driver _ what they were doing and they
wouldn't tell me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started asking more questions: `Are you from the FBI? Am I
in trouble?' They wouldn't even give me their names. They just told
me they were on assignment for someone overseas with a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller is convinced the party of three was working for
McCartney, and that the former Beatle and leader of the band Wings
may have been along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an average Joe,'' Miller says. ``Maybe guys like Paul
McCartney do hire companies around the world to take pictures for
them, but not in my realm of reality. So I'm thinking Paul was in
the limo. I don't think photographers usually rent stretch limos
for a one-hour shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Miller doesn't expect to hear from McCartney, but
he does have one request. ``I'd like to invite Paul to sign
autographs at the store the next time he's in town.''
</P>
<P>
   McCARTNEY'S NEW ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Devil Run,'' a 15-track roots-rock CD features, in
addition to ``Run Devil Run'' and two other McCartney originals,
up-tempo covers of rock 'n' roll evergreens, including Gene
Vincent's ``Blue Jean Bop,'' Ricky Nelson's ``Lonesome Town,'' Big
Joe Turner's ``Honey Hush,'' Chuck Berry's ``Brown-Eyed Handsome
Man'' and Elvis Presley's ``All Shook Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Devil Run''
</P>
<P>
   (Chorus)
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Devil Run
</P>
<P>
   the angel's having fun
</P>
<P>
   Making winners out of sinners
</P>
<P>
   Better leave before he's done
</P>
<P>
   When he gets through he'll be coming after you
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Flanagan has the key to soul-stirring jazz
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Tommy Flanagan has been playing at the Village
Vanguard, the steadfast Greenwich Village basement club that still
clings hard to its status as a jazz mecca, since 1956. Year in,
year out. Here in Manhattan, where the Detroit native lives,
Flanagan arrives for his periodic engagements as if signaling the
change in the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His picture, framed and hung on the wall just behind the piano
bench, occupies the club's own hall of fame, a gallery of jazz
giants that includes Miles and Mingus and John Coltrane. That's
something most mortals will never accomplish, let alone mortals as
low-key as Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   So the pianist is part of the room's storied past. But on a
recent evening he very much commands its present. There's something
at once avuncular and wonderfully droll about Flanagan, 69, who
will perform Saturday with his trio at Spivey Hall in metro
Atlanta. He's widely, enthusiastically acknowledged as one of the
senior statesmen of the piano _ the consummate sideman who was
essential to Ella Fitzgerald and Sonny Rollins, the man with a
string of sublime trio recordings. But he's also, it turns out,
something of a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just a pianist,'' he begins, in a long aside that
precedes the first tune of the set. ``I'm a jazz poet ... but I'll
let that hang.'' Dressed in a black blazer, black mock turtleneck
and gray slacks that drape generously off the knees, he cuts a
distinguished figure, his silvery goatee and thick-lensed glasses
conspiring with a bald scalp to give him an intellectual cast that
fits well with his deadpan delivery and the elliptical pauses in
his speech. ``I'm not going to say another word tonight,'' he
continues, ``except to tell you what I play if I can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan is such an alchemist that the joy of his performances
isn't what he plays but the way that he plays it. He's the kind of
bandleader who enjoys musical in-jokes, seemingly trivial
commentaries that begin as a tangent and circle back toward a
clever punch line. Introducing a movie theme as his second number
in a set that touches on Monk, Ellington, Bud Powell, Thad Jones
and George Gershwin, Flanagan can't quite recall its composer.
``Maybe it was one of the Newmans,'' he suggests. ``Lionel or
Albert ... well, we know it's not Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sweet in this off-handed way,'' says Karen Bernstein, a
film producer who was introduced to the pianist when he became the
musical consultant on her current project, a documentary on Ella
Fitzgerald. ``He's very soft-spoken. He chooses his words
carefully, beautiful, compact and elegant _ like his piano playing.
He's purposeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan squeezed in a few of those words before his show,
huddled in the narrow hallway behind the bar in the compact club.
Here's what he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been playing piano for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I have been playing a long time. Since I've been 5 years
old I've been playing. Come the millennium, I'll be 70, so that's
65 years of playing. So I know my way around a little bit. But you
never know it all. I mean, just ask one of those big boys, you
know, like Horowitz or Rubenstein. They were practicing all their
lives, just trying to get better, and I'm doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you like in the standards that you decide to play?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, they're the ones that I like and the ones that I think
people like. I make a compromise between them and myself. If I play
my stuff that I like well enough, they'll like it, too. That's what
I hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has your approach to piano evolved over the years?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, well, hardly at all. I still have the quest for being
better. I still like the way a few of my heroes play. Like, you
know, I think Hank Jones and Bud Powell and Teddy Wilson and Nat
Cole and Art Tatum are just the greatest pianists of all time to
me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you take from the experience of playing with John
Coltrane?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not just John Coltrane. My greatest times were with
Coleman Hawkins and Sonny Rollins. I loved playing with John
Coltrane. He was a big challenge. I caught him right in the middle,
when he was changing his style of playing. I was right in the midst
of that. I enjoyed watching him go through it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been with your current trio (bassist Kenny Washington
and drummer Lewis Nash) for 10 years. What's the key to their
staying power?
</P>
<P>
   A: All you have to do is listen to the trio. They're very
sympathetic
</P>

 &HT;    A conversation with ... Vince Gill and Jo Dee Messina
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What goes around does indeed come around.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth country singer and picker Vince Gill holds an Atlanta
distinction. He was the last musical act to perform at the Omni, in
March 1997, before the wrecking ball arrived. Tonight, he's the
first country act to play the tony venue that took its place,
Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Gill, who last week won a Country Music
Association award for best vocal event of the year (with Patty
Loveless), and opening act Jo Dee Messina, who grabbed the Horizon
Award for best new artist, on the road in Allegan, Mich. They
shared their thoughts about their careers, country music and the
changing concert landscape in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill
</P>
<P>
   Q:You closed down the Omni; now you're one of the first acts in
the new Philips Arena. Your thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   A:I really don't know anything about the new place. I loved the
Omni. We played there for years. It was always a great-sounding
arena. I'm kind of sad to see it go. When they built the new arena
in Nashville, I was on the committee to pick the design. And they
built a great arena.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I've read that you are going to take a break after this year.
Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yeah, I'm kind of wrapping things up. I want to get off the
bus for a while. I haven't ever taken the time to stop in 25 years,
and I feel like it's time to take a little bit of a break. I feel
that personally and professionally, it's the right thing to do.
I've been out there all the time for 10 years. Here's another
single and another single. I think maybe the people could use as
much of a break as I could (laughs). I really don't have a plan.
I'm not the type of individual that has to have a deal. I don't
want to have an alter ego and make an aerobic polka record or
something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder who you're referring to? Garth Brooks?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't fault him for doing any of it (the Chris Gaines
project). But it's so foreign to me because I don't possess any of
that thought process.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Your latest album, ``The Key,'' was inspired by the death of
your father. It's very traditional, with a lot of songs that sound
like 1960s Nashville. How did you put it together?
</P>
<P>
   A:What a lot of it was, was me seeing country music walking away
from all those traditional values and feel of those songs. Today,
we basically try to country-up pop songs. We put fiddles and steel
over a Rolling Stones groove and say it's country. At some point,
we've got to look in the mirror and say, ``This is what we are and
what we're doing.'' The bottom line is, we're the ones doing it.
</P>
<P>
   I just missed them, songs that felt like ``The Grand Tour,'' Bob
Wills, Conway Twitty. It's my perception of country music, which is
not necessarily what it is today.
</P>
<P>
   I knew going in I was making a record that went way against the
grain. I thought I was going to do something to get people to
reinvest in the traditional movement, kind of like Randy Travis did
in the '80s. But it did just the opposite. I think it surprised
everybody it was so country from the start to the finish. But I
think it's the best record I ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You recently went through a very public divorce and became the
center of a lot of tabloid gossip linking you with various people.
This is tough to bring up, but on the Internet, there are 53 chat
sites that come up when you type in ``Vince Gill/Amy Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   A:Is that all? (Laughs.) What I think happens with all this is,
people tend to think the worst of people. If anything is offensive
to me, that is. They take the lowest common denominator and go to
that. The ins and outs of friendship are mine. They are not for the
whole world to try to figure out. Whether it's Amy or whoever, I
have a right to be friends with anybody I want to, and I don't have
to defend or deny that. That's been my M.O. all along. I've never
acknowledged the tabloid stuff. None of it. That's the neat thing
about doing an interview. I can either answer the questions or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The other big talk on the Internet is about this duet you have
with Barbra Streisand on her new CD.
</P>
<P>
   A:We did a video of it. It's a Richard Marx song, so it's very
adult-contemporary. It was a blast getting to sing with her. She
was nice to me. The biggest fear I had when we did the video was I
was afraid I was going to have to be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How's life in your 40s?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm the happiest I've ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Dee Messina
</P>
<P>
   Q:You've had quite a year, with four No. 1 records. How does it
feel to be opening for Vince Gill?
</P>
<P>
   A:He is truly someone that I respect. When he asked me to be
part of the tour, it floored me. The fact that I'm here is very
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You nearly went bankrupt between ``Heads Carolina, Tails
California'' and the second album.
</P>
<P>
   A:I was really scared and nervous about it. There are no sure
bets in the music business. No one dreamed it would take so long to
find the right material. We basically vanished for a year. It
wasn't intentional, but the entire team felt we didn't have the
material. We had ``Bye Bye'' cut. We had ``I'm Alright'' cut. The
first album was experimental _ country, rock, blues. This one just
flows from the beginning to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q:To me, ``Stand Beside Me'' really defines your sound and image
_ kind of the tough, independent working gal.
</P>
<P>
   A:There's a great story about that song. Faith Hill was going to
record it, but when she came down to do it, she said, ``This song
is a Jo Dee tune. Why don't you see if she wants this?'' I knew I
loved that song the first time I heard it _ the simplicity of the
intro, the verse, how it builds up and gets huge. The song ended up
doing well, and I owe that to Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Faith's husband, Tim McGraw, is your producer. How has he
helped shape your sound?
</P>
<P>
   A:He's very, very influential. What I owe Tim I couldn't
possibly put into words, his compassion, his understanding. There
was a song for this album that I wasn't excited about. He said,
``If she's not excited, then don't let her cut it. She has to sing
it every single night for the rest of her life.'' He goes to bat
for me that way. It's a great chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Were you shocked to find yourself nominated for both best
female vocalist and the Horizon Award at this year's Country Music
Association Awards?
</P>
<P>
   A:It was very much a shock. I never dreamed I'd be in the female
vocalist category.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What did you think when you saw yourself on the fashion pages
of People magazine?
</P>
<P>
   A:It floored me. I ran to Wal-Mart and bought a copy
immediately. It's wild. At the time, I didn't know anything about
fashion. I had to read up on it, study to find out who is Donna
Karan, Anna Sui, Ralph Lauren. You sit around with a bunch of
stylists who say, ``We have a Richard Tyler-type dress.'' And I was
like, ``What does that mean?'' That's a world I don't live in. I
hate to shop. I order out of catalogs or go to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You were raised in Boston, but you sound so very country. How
come?
</P>
<P>
   A:I was raised outside Boston in a very small town. We had to
drive 40 minutes to the closest McDonald's. I loved that. My dad
had all of Tammy Wynette's records, and I listened to them. What
really got me, though, was when I saw ``Coal Miner's Daughter.'' I
saw it over and over again. I can recite the whole movie for you
word by word. I loved the image, the realism of the songs, the
wholesome family roots down home.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are you getting recognized on the street more now?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yeah, but it's still surprising. I didn't know people even
knew I existed. To think that people like you is a nice thing, a
very warm feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill,
</P>
<P>
   Jo Dee
</P>

WEAKENED CHRISTIAN COALITION STILL DRAWS POLITICAL HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Christian Coalition opens its ``Road to
Victory'' convention with presidential candidates Friday, the
organization will once again put forward its message that a
Republican can't win the White House without focusing on
conservative issues such as opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign so far is hardly what the coalition intended.
Some candidates who adhere closely to the coalition line have
dropped out of the race, while several of the remaining top
candidates have assiduously played down abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is striving to emerge from a near-death experience
during the past year. The organization is in debt, claims only 15
to 20 active state operations, and saw a number of top officials
leave the group. The coalition is run by founder Pat Robertson, who
recently donated $1 million to keep it afloat financially. A widely
discussed plan to create a political action committee that can
donate money to candidates is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in deep trouble,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia professor who has watched the coalition for years. ``They
have gone from being at the peak of Mount Everest to being at about
the level of the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the religious conservatives who make up the bulk of the
coalition say they have the political power to have an impact on
the GOP race, especially in early states such as Iowa, South
Carolina, Virginia, and Michigan. Seven of the eight Republican
candidates are coming to court votes. Senator John McCain of
Arizona declined the invitation to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the coalition returns to financial and political health
in the coming months, its members appear deeply divided over the
candidates. Unless the coalition rallies around one candidate, its
influence might be too diffused during the primaries, although the
organization is likely to be a factor in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for the social conservative movement is to
become a little bit more politically astute and rally behind one
candidate,'' coalition spokesman Mike Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what appears to be a groundswell for George W. Bush
among Republicans, the Texas governor is still viewed suspiciously
by many social conservatives, as was his father in the 1988 and
1992 campaigns. While the younger Bush opposes abortion, he rarely
brings up the subject in speeches and has made clear it isn't a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has focused recently on courting social conservatives,
suggesting that faith-based groups be allowed to run government
social programs. In addition, Bush has suggested that failing
schools could lose federal funds, which then could be used at
private institutions in states that allow such a transfer. And Bush
has met privately with Robertson and hired the former Christian
Coalition executive director, Ralph Reed, as a top adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush has got a real strong affinity with the
conservative grass roots of the party,'' Reed said in an interview.
``He is a person who has a profound faith testimony himself. He
talks about how his faith in God changed his life, and that is a
message that resonates very powerfully with this constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no obvious sign of a rush by coalition
members to the Bush camp, the Texas governor has been helped by the
fact that coalition members haven't rallied around his opponents,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican candidates most closely associated with the
coalition have stumbled. On Monday, for example, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, who was counting on strong support from
coalition members, dropped out of the race due to a lack of funds.
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire has dropped out of the GOP field
to launch an independent bid. And another coalition favorite,
Patrick J. Buchanan, is on the verge of leaving the Republican
Party to seek the nomination of the Reform Party, whose
economic-centered platform purposely excludes any mention of
abortion or other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republican candidates oppose abortion. But a number of
the leading prospects have played down the significance of the
issue. In addition to Bush's rare mention of the issue, former
American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole has said she doesn't
want to be drawn into the ``dead-end debate'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is unpopular with the coalition because his original
campaign finance bill would have required the disclosure of donors
who contribute to political ads that run in the late stages of a
campaign. Although that provision has been stripped from the latest
version of McCain's bill, many coalition members believe the
senator intends to restrict their voice in politics.
</P>
<P>
   That has left four other Republican candidates who strongly
oppose abortion to fight for coalition support: former Reagan aide
Gary Bauer, publisher Steve Forbes, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah,
and talk show host Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fight is between Bauer and Forbes, who have become
bitter enemies this year in their effort to become the favorite of
social conservatives. On Wednesday, Bauer held an extraordinary
news conference to deny rumors he was having an affair with a
campaign aide and implied the stories were being spread by Forbes'
campaign. Forbes denied that his staff had anything to do with the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Forbes has gone to great lengths to portray himself
as a champion of the coalition's causes _ a turnabout from his 1996
campaign. Forbes once called Robertson a ``toothy flake'' and said
in 1996 that he would work mostly to stop late-term abortions. But
after losing that campaign, Forbes has switched strategies, calling
himself ``pro-life'' and hiring many former Christian Coalition
officials.

 &HT;    `Biographer' breathes life into Reagan
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a book a dozen years ago, Garry Wills traced the stamp of
American character on the lives of six presidents, from Washington,
Jefferson and Madison to Kennedy, Nixon and Ronald Reagan. For
Wills, that character had evolved by a kind of natural selection,
our presidents arising as embodiments of the myth and mettle that
sustain us. Evolution had taken us, somehow, from the founders to
Nixon and Reagan, and along the way made a monkey out of Charles
Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   We never quite know what to make of a sitting president. Harry
Truman was something of an embarrassment, a Kansas City rube who
had never been to college, and Dwight Eisenhower an inarticulate
mumbler for whom a press conference was a more formidable
undertaking than the invasion of Normandy. And not even President
Clinton has been lampooned like Lincoln. ``The baboon,'' the
newspapers called him, and sophisticated folk chortled heartily.
</P>
<P>
   They were all sly as foxes, knowing more than they had need to
reveal and happy to play dumb for their inquisitors. The modern
master of the art form was Ronald Reagan, who may really have been
dumb but whose stature posthumously is not shrinking in the way
Jack Kennedy's is.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan no sooner left office than he lost his mind, sealing off
the world and questions with it.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Morris spent 15 years in Reagan's periodic company, and
there are people who wonder if his own faculties aren't a few
marbles short. The book for which Morris signed a $3 million
contract in 1985 has appeared at last, handsomely swaddled in its
dust jacket. But the birthing room, rather than being aglow with
joy, is edgy with concern.
</P>
<P>
   What was to have been a court biography penned by a much-admired
Pulitzer Prize winner suddenly is the subject of debate about
Morris' honesty and forthrightness. The protagonist of ``Dutch: A
Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' is alternately the 40th president and a
fictional Edmund Morris, one who was not alive when he appears in
large portions of the book. Hence the word ``memoir,'' not
``biography,'' in the subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the authorized biography of Ronald Reagan,'' Leon
Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic told The New York
Times, ``I think I'll wait for the unauthorized biography.''
</P>
<P>
   Times columnist Maureen Dowd _ happy, you'd think, to find
something to write about other than the Clintons and their various
dysfunctions _ leaped on it like a hound thrown a sirloin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Morris' batty book is surely destined for commercial
success,'' she writes. ``There's a lot of nostalgia for Reagan and
Reaganism. And we have become a culture of morphing. Entertainment
has overwhelmed truth, and the universities are riddled with
professors who deny that objectivity is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right about some of that, of course. The aesthetic of
postmodernism reduces factuality to the perception of the observer,
with consequences that have made sophistry respectable and nihilism
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But the literary device of an author's inserting himself into
the story is not original with Morris. The first modern biography,
Boswell's ``Life of Johnson,'' is in fact a highly personal account
of a worshipful young Scot's brief time with the literary dictator
of the age. Samuel Johnson was already in his 50s by the time
Boswell met him, and Boswell knew little of the childhood
insecurities that marked Johnson for life. Yet Boswell caught
vividly the essential truth about the man _ not simply his
omnivorous curiosity but an outsize character and unforgettable
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of fact and fiction braided (faction?) spring
readily to mind: Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood''; Gore Vidal's
``Lincoln''; John Berendt's ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil''; Norman Mailer's ``The Executioner's Song.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is always the sterling example of Bob Woodward,
confidant to dying spymasters, eavesdropper in the chambers of
Supreme Court justices, recorder of pillow talk between a president
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is one thing and assertion another, and the argument
for veracity need hardly be made. But it's surprising, even so, to
read that Professor Alan Brinkley of Columbia University had never
heard of fictional devices in biography. ``This is a very
particular genre,'' he told the Times, ``and it has a long
tradition and a very narrow and restricted set of conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, biography is the one genre where the
unconventional is now and then granted a certain license. What
Morris has done, says Hayden White, a professor of comparative
literature at Stanford University, ``is no different from the
practice of those biographers who purport to see the world from the
perspective of their subjects: from inside the mind, spirit or body
of the historical personages whose `lives' they purport to
understand better than those personages themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The biographer's first obligation _ implicit in the word
``biography'' _ is to create a life. Not to invent a life the
subject did not live, but to convey convincingly what T.S. Eliot
called skull beneath the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Research might yield footnotes, piled into the back of the book
in a great slag heap. But the spirit of the life being re-created _
its aspirations and insecurities, its quirks and lasting obsessions
_ too easily slips away. And many a subject has preferred it so,
burning letters and private papers and enjoining family and friends
from cooperating with prospective biographers.
</P>
<P>
   The biographer's art, therefore, is an imaginative and intuitive
one. Ideally, as Marc Pachter, former historian of the National
Portrait Gallery, wrote in ``Telling Lives,'' the biographer
``vanishes into the shadow of his creative achievement.'' But not
always. If the biographer is there, ``he is only there in a certain
way, which is difficult to define. The greater his skill, the finer
his intuition of personality, the less aware we are of him in our
experience of the narrated life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, exceptions exist, and Morris' book is one.
</P>
<P>
   When Morris signed on to write Reagan's biography, Random House
projected publishing the book in 1992. Seven years passed, and
Morris was nowhere close to presenting a manuscript. He had had
frequent access to the president while Reagan was in office, was
allowed to attend White House meetings, had the opportunity to
visit the places Reagan had been, from his Illinois hometown to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Theodore Roosevelt _ Morris' previous subject _
Reagan ``was a man of benign remoteness,'' unfailingly, unflappably
cordial yet without a sense of his own past. He could joke more
than he could reflect.
</P>
<P>
   Morris at different points in the book wonders if the man is an
amiable simpleton or someone whose hidden depths he cannot plumb.
His ambivalence is resolved in an interview to be published in the
November-December issue of American Enterprise magazine, where he
claims that Reagan was a man ``of considerably more deliberation
and philosophical seriousness than he's ever been given credit
for.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little hint of this in ``Dutch.'' The Reagan whom
Morris knew was not given to introspection and had no capacity for
self-analysis, and now he was sinking into senescence. Ever more
desperate as deadline after deadline passed, Morris came to a
realization: He must create dramatis personae for himself and
others, and they _ but mainly he _ would inhabit the world the
Dutch lived but not could not recollect.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the charge of deception. But the Ronald Reagan who
bestrides these pages is believably the Dutch Reagan who had been a
lifeguard while growing up in Illinois, who began his radio career
the year Franklin Roosevelt made his final fireside chat, who
squired starlets at the behest of studio moguls and who saw his own
star power fade in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative risks that Morris undertook are large, and some
would say foolhardy. But the panache with which he has brought
``Dutch'' off is breathtaking. No one reading the book can doubt he
is in Reagan's benignly remote company. Morris has a gift for acute
observation, and nails Reagan's every mannerism _ the husk of the
voice (``breathing around words''), the tilt of the head, the lie
of the hair (``thick and shining as an otter's'') _ and every
reflexive response.
</P>
<P>
   With word pictures he also captures the mood of White House
courtiers who found themselves in trouble. One day in early 1993,
Reagan returned to the White House, ``at the reluctant invitation
of President Bush,'' to receive the Medal of Freedom. Morris
attended, along with 500 others. ``Even (former Treasury Secretary)
Don Regan and (military adviser) John Poindexter showed up,'' he
writes. ``The latter had the gray transparency of someone sucked
dry by legal process, as did (former Defense Secretary) Cap
Weinberger.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, a month after Reagan disclosed to the American
people that doctors had told him he was suffering from degenerative
cognitive dementia, Morris visited him in his office in California:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I entered his office, he was sitting in the same quiet
pose he always assumed during `personal time' at the White House:
glossy head tilted forward, jacket sleeves half on his desk, white
cuffs protruding exactly one inch, his black Parker lying ready on
its own polished leather reflection. He rose with his usual air of
gentle surprise, but I got the feeling that if I had come in
through the window he would have reacted no differently.''
</P>
<P>
   They made small talk, and Reagan wanted to show Morris a
painting someone had given him. Morris thought it would be a
portrait of the five living presidents together, something he knew
Reagan was proud of. Instead it was a watercolor of a scene at the
banks of the Rush River near Tampico, Ill., where he had pulled so
many bobbing heads from the water long ago. Morris had been there:
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized every curve of the oak trees and the long grassy
slope of the meadow.
</P>
<P>
   ```This,' Dutch breathed, ``is where I was a lifeguard ... I
saved 77 lives. And you know, none of 'em ever thanked me!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his only unhesitant speech during our short interview,
a confidence exchanged between strangers. He had long since stopped
recognizing me; now I no longer recognized him. For all the
intimate familiarity of that face and body, and the soft husk of
his voice, I did not feel his presence beside me, only his
absence.''
</P>
<P>
   But what, finally, had been behind that enigmatic presence? A
man practiced at responding on cue, yet not always recognizing a
face in front of him (even, one time, his own son's). A man with no
particular interest in other people, but also without malice. A
responsible, if disengaged, father. A man whose only loves seemed
to have been his wife, Nancy, and his country.
</P>
<P>
   None of his four children would graduate from college and none,
apparently, would provide him with descendants. (Adopted son
Michael has two children, and daughter Maureen has adopted a
child.) ``Whether these derelictions caused him the slightest
regret,'' Morris writes, ``is one of the imponderables buried in
the alabaster depths of Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   And now those depths are beyond mortal reach. Was he impaired
while in office? Morris, reading eight years of graceful,
grammatically correct but unrevelatory diaries, is certain he was
not.
</P>
<P>
   Did he know _ contrary to his protestations _ about the
Iran-Contra affair? Morris thinks it likely that Reagan approved
the diversion of funds. Whether he understood their use is another
imponderable, like the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier biographer, the journalist Lou Cannon, called Reagan
``a mirror of the American people.'' For eight years a sizable
majority of Americans, younger ones included, identified with him.
There is something incalculable in this that neither opinion polls
nor daily journalism can measure. Neither, for that matter, can
biography. It tries only to bring into focus the figure in the
mirror.

 &HT;    Turner's latest TV a bow to the South
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner is going to be a daddy again.
</P>
<P>
   When Turner South flickers to life at 2 p.m. today, the newest
Turner-Time Warner venture will offer cable subscribers in six
states a mix of original series, movies, ``classic'' wrestling,
regional news reports and the Braves, the Hawks and the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky, white-haired billionaire will formally introduce his
18th network, the fourth bearing his name, this afternoon in a
five-minute, pre-taped message also featuring country singer Marty
Stuart and horror novelist Anne Rice, to air in Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and parts of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling 24-hour network initially will be available to
roughly a million households in its coverage area _ over half of
which will be in metro Atlanta, through MediaOne, Prestige and Time
Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're offering viewers and advertisers is something
that's never really been done before; television with a Southern
flair,'' said Bill Burke, president of Turner South, who will be
leaving to head Time Warner's Internet and digital ventures just
days after the launch. TNT and TCM President Brad Siegel will
succeed Burke at the helm of Turner South and TBS. ``We see this as
an opportunity to celebrate everything about the South's unique
culture, and the people who live here,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not everyone is as impressed by the bouncing baby
network's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Ginsberg, a media analyst for BBDO South, has been keeping
tabs on the rollout. He views this latest gambit as a
characteristically shrewd move that will likely lure smaller
advertisers who can't afford to buy time on higher-priced national
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the viewers don't really get anything out of
this. From watching it you probably wouldn't know if it was
regional or local, and I don't know if anybody will really care.
What you have to remember about Turner and Time Warner is that they
have deep pockets and, most importantly, staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Turner South is the first-ever truly regional
entertainment network in the country, but it's following in the
well-worn footsteps of other successful Turner upstarts such as
Turner Classic Movies and the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   Freshening up in the vault
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to build a network around a full slate of
original shows, the bulk of Turner South's programs will be culled
from the company's massive library of film and video properties
that are being repackaged and freshened up for a younger viewers
and insatiably nostalgic baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   It will also include a certain amount of synergy between other
Turner/Time Warner owned ventures such as WCW and Southern Living.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Championship Wrestling Classics,'' for instance, will
feature bouts dating back 20 years, long before Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura was running the state of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrestling before wrestling was cool without all the
glitz and glamour you have today,'' said David Rudolph, Turner
South's director of business development. ``Of course, we're not
going to air this on the same nights as our other live wrestling
shows. We'll put it on nights when people who love wrestling want
to supplement their viewing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Living Presents'' will take the contents of the
glossy lifestyle magazine and spin them off on the air. Just like
its big sister TBS which was created 25 years ago as a vehicle for
the once-hapless Atlanta Braves, sports will also be a staple for
Turner South. And yes, at least one of the teams in every game will
be on the Turner payroll.
</P>
<P>
   After gestating for more than a year in Turner Broadcasting
headquarters on Techwood Drive, the delivery of Turner South wasn't
without some bumps.
</P>
<P>
   New kid on sports block
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports South _ a regional sports-only network which had a
``no compete'' agreement with Turner _ lost a court battle that
otherwise might have have kept Turner South from launching on
schedule, if at all. A district court judge ruled that because
Turner South's programming is more entertainment-oriented, it did
not pose a direct threat to the Fox network. The ruling is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Turner South will telecast 46 Atlanta Thrashers
hockey games this season, 15 Hawks matchups starting Nov. 6 and 35
Braves games next season which otherwise would have aired on WUPA.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South's wrestling and sports programs will likely
convince men to tune in, but Rudolph says women are not being
forsaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stated demographic is adults 25-to-54-year-olds across the
board,'' he said. ``But there are other programs like `Southern
Living' that will focus on food, travel, home decorating and
gardening that we think will have a very strong female skew.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other niche cable networks vying for attention, one of
Turner South's biggest challenges is establishing itself as a
distinctive brand that entices viewers to put away their clickers
and set a spell.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: What the heck is a Southern network and who wants to
watch one anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Tonight Show'' monologue after Turner South was announced
in February, host Jay Leno answered that question by trading on
some unflattering Southern stereotypes. Leno jokingly suggested the
network's lineup might include shows such as ``Everybody Loves
Raymond, Including His Sister,'' and ``Sabrina, the Teenage
Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Few were laughing at Turner South, at least not for long.
However Leno's off-color jibes underscored the task of overcoming
built-in perceptions that the new network would be little more than
a second-rate, cable backwater _ Bubbavision.
</P>
<P>
   What programmers and marketers have devised in some ways are
refreshingly clever. Others are downright corny.
</P>
<P>
   Themes with a twang
</P>
<P>
   The network will feature regular movie franchises with evocative
themes such as ``True Grits'' and ``Kudzu Theater'' (the tagline:
``Movies That Grow on You'').
</P>
<P>
   But only a handful of the second- and third-run movies appearing
in those time slots will have any discernible Southern connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong to imply that Southerners will only watch a
movie if the guy in the lead has a Southern accent,'' Burke said.
``What we're doing is packaging these movies in a way that feels
appropriate for the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner South hopes to convey that down-homey feeling for viewers
in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   During interstitials _ breezy informational segments between
scheduled programs _ the network's catchy black-and-Granny-Smith
green logo will alert viewers to festivals, fairs and community
happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will also feature bluesy banjo riffs and moody
vocals instead of jarring, whiz-bang sound effects that have became
standard issue on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   If the bulk of Turner South's programming invites viewers to
slow down a bit, Burke said other network offerings aim to capture
the quickened pace of life in Sun Belt capitals such as Atlanta and
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Whole World Theater Comedy Improv'' features an
unpredictable Atlanta-based troupe of comics, and the
still-evolving ``College Show'' will give a generation of TV-savvy
coeds at Southern campuses a chance to create their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is that I won't be around to see Turner South
through after flipping the switch,'' Burke said.

 &HT;    Jil Sander a breath of fresh air for buyers
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN _ Sometimes the best critics of a designer's collection
are the people who buy from it at wholesale, and then try selling
the clothes to us at twice that price.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kalinsky, who owns the Jil Sander boutique at Phipps
Plaza, and Kal Ruttenstein, the venerable buyer for Bloomingdale's,
had different agendas entering Sander's spring/summer 2000 runway
preview Thursday, and different reasons for praising it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky was there to select clothes for his ``ladies,'' who
shell out thousands of dollars per Sander outfit. Ruttenstein's job
was to pick out those pieces that would sell well among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ethereal, simple and beautiful,'' Kalinsky said of the
collection, which was bursting with bright white skirts, dresses
and tops that were at once boxy and form-flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was lovely,'' Ruttenstein said. ``I especially
liked the washed-out Hawaiian prints.''
</P>
<P>
   Sander's fabrics were just on the modest side of sheer; for sex
appeal's sake she laid bare the back and the rib cage. She hemmed
skirts and dresses at the knee and offered a slinky new beltless
shorts silhouette that stopped at mid-thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the new shorts,'' Kalinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 35 outfits shown were solid-colored: white, black or
butterscotch. But a handful featured blue, pink and yellow floral
fabrics turned inside-out for a sun-bleached effect.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike virtually every other designer here, who have gone
overboard with ruffles and beadwork, Sander's main decorative
features were wide, flat pleats (both vertical and horizontal) and
three-ply folds of fabric that encircled the torso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the eveningwear idea of nail heads on chiffon,''
Ruttenstein said. ``It looked very young and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jil's clothes never look like what you see at other shows,''
Kalinsky said. ``That's what I like about her; she marches to her
own drumbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bare Market: Just how much sass, sex, glitz and garishness
will the market bear come spring? That's the question Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana pondered when they turned their showroom into an old
Italian street market setting _ replete with fishmongers, gypsies
and greengrocers _ and dressed their models in the most outlandish
and outstandingly creative ensembles seen so far during Milan's
Fashion Week. The combinations of materials, colorations, styles
and embellishments are (truly) too numerous to list. But highlights
of this raucously received collection include: the season's most
intriguing suits (mannish, three-piece numbers in black, gray or
sequins with skinny lapels and high-collared shirts and wallets on
chains); eight-inch skirts rendered in everything from patent
leather to stars-and-stripes sequins; bugle-beaded boots that
actress Salma Hayek said ``looked liked wearing Christmas on your
feet''; and beaded bras worn underneath silk chiffon blouses _ or
nothing but matching chokers _ during the show's grand finale. The
designers foisted mad combinations of styles out onto the runway
like braggarts flaunting their craftsmanship. And no one could
blame them. ``I'd put some of the outfits together a little
differently,'' Hayek confided, ``but otherwise I loved it all.''

LATEST URANIUM DISASTER MAY BE WORSE THAN THREE MILE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deadly accident at a Japanese uranium processing plant
Thursday can't compare with the disastrous explosion at the
Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986, but it's probably more serious
than the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island that crippled the US
nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   And a similar accident once happened in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That's the early consensus among authorities on nuclear power as
Japanese emergency officials struggled to contain the country's
worst nuclear power accident ever, and President Clinton offered to
do ``whatever we possibly can'' to help the people affected by the
accident 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious nuclear accident,'' said US Energy Secretary
William Richardson, who was touring nuclear facilities in Russia.
``The good news is that it's not a widely contaminated area. It's a
limited area.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident, which exposed at least two workers to potentially
lethal radiation and forced people within six miles to remain
indoors, happened when workers at the JCO Company in Tokaimura
inadvertently set off a powerful nuclear reaction while making fuel
for commercial nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear reaction, the key ingredient for generating nuclear
power, occurs when a high concentration of radioactive elements is
brought together, causing atoms to begin splitting spontaneously,
releasing vast amounts of heat. But, unlike a nuclear reactor that
is sheathed in steel and concrete to contain the reaction when it
``goes critical,'' a nuclear processing plant has no similar
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear reactors are designed to go critical. Fuel processing
facilities are never intended to go critical,'' said Dr. John
Bernard, acting director of the nuclear lab at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. ``There was a human
error where they miscalculated the amount of uranium.''
</P>
<P>
   The three most seriously injured workers at JCO were purifying
the uranium fuel in a bath of nitric acid when they suddenly saw a
blue flash, company officials said, and they were instantly exposed
to radiation levels high enough to induce vomiting and diarrhea.
Plant officials believe they accidentally put up to 35 pounds of
uranium into the tank, far more than the normal limit of eight
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, radiation levels in the densely populated
surrounding areas were thousands of times the normal level and the
Japanese government had called on 310,000 people living within six
miles to remain indoors until emergency workers can stop the
continuing nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities planned to smother the accident in sodium borate, a
chemical used to stop nuclear reactions in nuclear plants by
absorbing the colliding neutrons that keep the chain reaction
going. But they were trying to figure out how to get close enough
to dump the powder onto the radioactive tank, company official
Kohgo Usami said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the accident is still unfolding, both MIT's Bernard and
nuclear engineer David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned
Scientists said the Tokaimura accident isn't nearly as big as the
Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union, where 31 people were
killed immediately and thousands more may have died from radiation
exposure in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   At Chernobyl, they point out, the 190-ton nuclear core exploded,
spewing detectable radiation for thousands of miles. At Tokaimura,
by contrast, the effects are likely to be less farflung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it will be a long-term problem,'' said
Lochbaum. ``This appears to be a local disaster and not a global
one.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bernard of MIT said the Tokaimura accident
has already done more harm than the partial meltdown at the Three
Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. There, he said, ``people
were scared, but no one was harmed physically'' in what is still
regarded as the worst US commercial nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Lochbaum, believe that people died from long term
exposure at Three Mile Island. But Lochbaum agrees that no one at
Three Mile Island got such high immediate radiation doses as the
three workers who are in critical condition in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission were quick to
point out that the seven nuclear fuel processing plants in the
United States follow strict safety procedures to prevent nuclear
reactions by limiting the volume and concentration of uranium
workers handle, and requiring other safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely inspect these plants for criticality control,''
said NRC spokesman Beth Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   However, a ``criticality incident'' quite similar to the
Tokaimura accident has happened at one US commercial processing
facility, the long-closed United Nuclear Corporation plant in
Charlestown, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1964 employee Robert Peabody accidentally set off a
nuclear chain reaction when he poured liquid uranium into a tank.
He died after being exposed to 1,000 times the lethal dose of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents were very similar,'' said Felix Killar,
director of material licensee and insurance issues for the Nuclear
Energy Institute, a US industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports on the Japanese accident suggested that the
Tokaimura plant did not have the safety features of American
plants, and that the nuclear facilities in Tokaimura have had
safety problems in recent years, including a fire that exposed 37
workers to low-level radiation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists said it
is too soon to say whether the Japanese accident is relevant to the
US fabrication plants located in Virginia, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the keystone cops over there. those are highly
dedicated people,'' said Lochbaum. ``For us to say it can't happen
here so quickly without even understanding what happened, to me is
an irresponsible attitude.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Booksellers and publishers struggling to
stay alive have a new study that explains why they're struggling to
stay alive. The study informs us that people ages 55 to 64 read for
53 minutes a day compared to those in the 25 to 29 bracket, who
read for only 24 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be logical to focus on that portion of the market
that reads more, that would also mean having to constantly
replenish the said market, which is in the process of dying off.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has always suggested that younger people who
don't read will read more as they age. I don't buy it. Reading is a
habit, not something that comes to you as a Pauline conversion as
you sit in the doctor's office waiting for your cholesterol
results.

   A. Scott Berg, who has a way of writing biographies that render
other books on his subject irrelevant, has chosen his next subject:
Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   It's a puzzlement, although it continues Berg's affinity for
furtive, essentially hidden personalities. Wilson's is a great
story, but one that has been written a dozen times. Barring a cache
of new papers, one wonders what Berg can bring to such a well-known
story beyond his own penetrating lucidity.
</P>
<P>
   As with his Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Lindbergh,'' Putnam will
publish, many years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Amis, who writes good books that get good reviews but
that nobody ever seems to buy, has signed with Talk Miramax, the

father, Kingsley.

LOTT OFFERS TO HOLD HEARINGS ON NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an abrupt but calculated reversal, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott offered Thursday to schedule a quick
vote on a treaty banning nuclear testing, expressing confidence
that Republicans have the votes to defeat one of President
Clinton's top foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Senate Democrats and the administration have
demanded that Lott and his top lieutenants drop their opposition to
the treaty and allow hearings and a floor vote this year. Democrats
threatened this month to tie the Senate in procedural knots if
Republicans refused to relent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lott called the Democrats' bluff, offering 10 hours of
debate and a vote on the pact as early as next Wednesday. It takes
the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes if all 100
senators are present, to ratify a treaty. All 45 Democrats are
likely to back the accord, aides said, but only two Republicans
publicly support it, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James
Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited exchange on the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, objected to Lott's
offer, saying it gave short shrift to a landmark pact. Daschle
requested more time for debate and a later date for the vote. Aides
to both leaders met late Thursday to discuss a compromise, which
Lott said was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Given the alternative of having the Republican-controlled Senate
keep the pact bottled up indefinitely, treaty supporters said they
were willing to take their chances with a vote this fall, even
though they face steep odds of winning ratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the best way to deal with this, but it's better
than nothing,'' Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Biden urged the White House to ``pull out all the stops'' to
lobby for the accord, including having Clinton hold a news
conference and a nationally televised address. A spokesman for the
National Security Council, David C. Leavy, said, ``The president is
fully committed to the treaty. We hope there can be adequate time
for debate and analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser, were discussing strategy
Thursday with Senate Democrats, and Leavy said the White House
would hold several public events to rally support.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty proponents argue that it would lock in American nuclear
superiority achieved in more than 1,000 nuclear tests between 1945
and 1992, when the United States agreed to halt testing. Failure to
ratify, supporters say, could open the door for emerging nuclear
states like India and Pakistan, to conduct more tests, and may also
weaken support for other arms pacts, like the treaty to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The current and four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff support the test ban, which would prohibit underground
nuclear tests. Atmospheric testing is already banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a moral responsibility in the world to lead
on the question of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons,''
Dorgan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the pact say that a test ban would eliminate the
country's ability to test the safety and reliability of its nuclear
arsenal. Moreover, opponents say, the pact is unlikely to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 of the 44 nations whose approval is required for the
treaty to take effect have ratified the pact. Even one holdout
among the 44 so-called nuclear-capable countries, like North Korea,
could prevent the treaty's enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This treaty is bad, bad for the country and dangerous, but if
there is demand that we go forward with it, as I have been hearing
for two years, we are ready to go,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the treaty in 1996, making the United States the
first signatory, and sent it to the Senate for approval a year
later. Since then, the treaty had been stalled in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms of
North Carolina, is locked in a fight with the administration over
two other treaties Helms wanted to kill before addressing the test
ban pact.
</P>
<P>
   Since Helms has refused to hold hearings on the treaty, the
Senate is poised to vote for the first time on a major treaty
without a hearing in its committee of jurisdiction, aides said.
However, the treaty has been discussed in Foreign Relations
Committee hearings on other subjects and in the hearings of other
panels.
</P>
<P>
   With an international conference in Vienna on Oct. 6 set to
discuss ways to bring the treaty into force, Senate Democrats like
Biden and Dorgan stepped up their threats of guerrilla tactics if
the treaty did not move. Lott's offer is pegged to that date.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Senate critics quietly lined up a stable
of national security experts who opposed the treaty to advise
Senate Republicans. The experts included former Defense secretaries
Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld; former national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft; and two former CIA directors under Clinton, R.
James Woolsey Jr. and John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters had little reason to expect Republican
backing. Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, declared his opposition to the pact, based
largely on classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican foreign policy moderates _ like Sen. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, and Sens. Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine _ were either undecided or leaning
against the pact, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never discount the charm or ability of the president
to seduce and flatter members, but there really hasn't been a lot
of work done by the administration or Democrats on this,'' said one
senior Senate Republican aide. ``The field has been fallow. We're
ready to rumble.''

 &HT;    Mead buy of AT-A-GLANCE planned to expand product line
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mead Corp. is buying AT-A-GLANCE Group of Cullman
Ventures Inc., a family-owned calendar and appointment book maker
based near Albany, N.Y., for $550 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced Thursday, is expected to close by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   AT-A-GLANCE makes diaries, calendars, appointment books,
planners and accessories. The company has a 700,000-square-foot
facility in Sidney, N.Y., and is the area's largest employer with
1,800 jobs. Sales, which are about $325 million, have doubled over
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Mead officials declined to disclose how much AT-A-GLANCE might
add to the company's bottom line and said exactly how many jobs may
be lost in the deal is under review.
</P>
<P>
   AT-A-GLANCE will bring two important things to Mead's struggling
School and Office Products Division: an expanded product portfolio
and a way to sell directly to business consumers, company officials
said. AT-A-GLANCE distributes its wares to office product dealers
who sell to offices. Mead sells its notebooks and other products
through retailers such as Kmart and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Mead also announced this week that it bought a license to make
and sell school and office products with the Nike name and swoosh
design for the back-to-school season in 2000. Mead had a Nike
license from 1994 to 1996, but then the sports and fitness apparel
giant backed away from licensing for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Mead School and Office Products Division President Neil
McLachlan said the Nike license and the AT-A-GLANCE deals are
growth engines for his division. Mead's high-profile school and
office products division has seen earnings drop 17.3 percent
between 1997 and 1998 and 38 percent for the first half of 1999.
McLachlan said the division needs new products that consumers will
find useful and retailers see as exciting. Acquisitions are a key
growth strategy for the division, he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT-A-GLANCE owner Lewis Cullman's interest in philanthropy was
beginning to conflict with the business, so he hired Goldman Sachs
to market the company to a buyer, said AT-A-GLANCE President Doug
Willies. Goldman Sachs approached Mead, which had been eyeing the
time management product line for more than two years, McLachlan
said.

ON EVE OF JERUSALEM EXHIBITION, DEBATE FLARES

<P>
   Walt Disney Co.'s exhibition on Jerusalem continued to draw
controversy Thursday, the day before it was to open to the public,
as prominent Jewish and Arab-American organizations complained that
it portrayed a Jerusalem shorn of what they said was crucial
political context.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said he ``was disappointed, saddened, a little bit
offended and at times angry'' at the absence of any mention in the
exhibition that Israel considers Jerusalem its capital. Foxman
toured the exhibition at Disney World on Wednesday, among several
hundred guests on a long-planned visit arranged by Israel's Foreign
Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem exhibition, partly paid for with $1.8 million from
the Israeli government, lies within the Millennium Village, which
includes exhibitions of other nations, at the Orlando, Fla., theme
park. Although that area opens Friday, the question of what the
Jerusalem exhibition says, or does not say, about Jerusalem's
political status has proved a headache for Disney for weeks. The
entertainment giant has had to deal with controversy among Jewish
and Arab organizations in this country and also among governments
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the United Arab Emirates, which like other Arab
nations insists that Israel has occupied East Jerusalem illegally,
threatened to call for a boycott of Disney products if the
exhibition portrayed an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has not said whether the exhibition ever identified
Jerusalem as such or whether the company altered the exhibition at
some point. On Sept. 17, Disney released a statement simply saying
that the exhibition contained ``no reference to Jerusalem as
capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said what he saw ``was a sanitized Jerusalem, a Jerusalem
unconnected to anywhere.'' He added: ``I guess if Disney would
permit me and I had the funds, I would love to do an exit poll,
asking kids, `Where is Jerusalem?' I'm not sure what kind of an
answer we would get.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also continues to be controversial among
Arab-American organizations. Hanna Maksoud, president of the
Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, who toured the
exhibition on Sept. 15, said Thursday that the exhibition was
unsatisfactory because it did not distinguish East Jerusalem from
the larger metropolis. As a result, she said, the exhibition
implicitly portrays all of Jerusalem as Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maksoud said an Arab-American delegation would visit the
exhibition Friday and hold a news conference afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Warren, a Disney spokesman, declined to comment on the
exhibition's history, saying information about ``the development
process'' was ``proprietary, out of courtesy to the clients we work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always intended to be an exhibit that celebrates the
culture and people of Israel,'' Warren said. ``Certainly, everyone
that sees it will form their own opinion, and we respect that.''

GORE AND BRADLEY ARE SET TO BEGIN EARLY SERIES OF DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley are poised to begin an unusually early and intense series
of debates in the run-up to the primary season next year. As a
start, their campaigns said Thursday they have agreed to take part
in a nationally televised town meeting four weeks from now in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Gore's advisers said, they had been reluctant to
agree to early debates because they feared it would elevate the
stature of Bradley and give him millions of dollars worth of free
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bradley has emerged as a threat for the Democratic
presidential nomination, the vice president's advisers said they
were willing to risk giving heightened exposure to a rival who Gore
had virtually ignored for months. Instead, their hope now is to
capitalize on what they consider to be Gore's adroit debating
skills. .
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the campaign released a letter from Tony Coelho,
Gore's campaign chairman, to Douglas Berman, his counterpart in the
Bradley campaign, calling for a series of debates beginning as soon
as next weekend. ``Al Gore sincerely believes that the American
people deserve to know and understand both the similarities and
differences between himself and Senator Bill Bradley,'' Coelho
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bradley campaign has not responded specifically to the
letter, Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director, said her
candidate has long been eager to engage the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's willingness to debate Bradley is yet another indication
of how competitive the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination has become in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Gore announced
he was paring down his campaign organization and moving his
headquarters from Washington to Nashville in his home state of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, new financial reports indicated that Bradley
had raised more money in the past three months than the vice
president and had more cash on hand as the primary season
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two Democratic presidential contenders seem to be
rushing toward head-to-head confrontations, the Republican
frontrunner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has declined to debate
his rivals until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Bush is so far ahead in the polls that his advisers
said there was nothing for him to gain by participating. And,
unlike Gore, Bush has had far less experience in debates and, by
his own admission, is still being schooled by his advisers about
many national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers conceded that Bradley knows the issues but noted
that the vice president was far more experienced in national
debates. ``I'm going to present my own vision for what this nation
needs to do in the future,'' Gore said Wednesday night in an
interview on CNN. ``And I can't think of a better way to do that
than have a good, spirited debate about the future of America with
somebody who I know well, Bill Bradley. And I hope that he will
accept my challenge to a series of debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's debate challenge, Bradley, campaigning in San
Diego on Wednesday, said, ``That's an abrupt strategy shift _ this
time yesterday they were ignoring me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore won much praise in debates in 1996 for his
dispatching of Ross Perot, the Reform Party presidential candidate,
and Jack F. Kemp, the Republican vice presidential contender, he
did not draw such reviews for how he handled a debate in 1992 with
Vice President Dan Quayle. Gore was criticized then for not
defending his running mate, Bill Clinton, from Quayle's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley have agreed to appear at a Democratic
dinner in Des Moines on Oct. 9, where both are scheduled to speak
but not debate. Some news organizations have scheduled debates in
New Hampshire in January and in California in early March, but so
far the only actual forum that both sides have agreed to is an
hour-long session sponsored jointly by CNN and WMUR, a local
television station in Manchester, N.H., on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors described the format as more a town meeting at
Dartmouth College than a debate because the candidates, while
appearing side-by-side on stage, will take questions from ordinary
citizens and not spar directly with each other.

   ``We're not billing this as a debate,'' said Tom Hannon, CNN's
political director. ``It may be a semantic difference, but there
will be no panel of journalist questioners, there will be no point,
counter-point or rebuttal except if one candidate personally
attacks another the moderator will give them a chance to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN, WMUR, which is an an affiliate of ABC, and the Fox network
, are sponsoring a similar event the next day _ this one 90 minutes
_ among six confirmed Republican contenders, but Bush has said he
will not participate. Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for Bush, said the
only such event he has thus far agreed to is a debate in Iowa on
Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking forward to debating next year when people are
paying attention,'' Ms. Tucker said.

 &HT;    Stocks' dismal quarter ends on positive note
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investors gladly put a dismal third-quarter
performance behind them and started looking forward to the next
round of profit reports they hope will rally the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The fact stocks ended the quarter Thursday with surprisingly
strong, broad-based gains was small consolation to investors whose
portfolios had followed the market's indexes down as much as 10
percent from recent highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in a correction since late April,'' said Alfred
Goldman, strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``In April it was up
46 percent from last October's lows. The market obviously went too
far, too fast, and a correction was inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman compared conditions to torture that ``wears everybody
down and out'' but added that the sell-off is probably coming to an
end due to its length.
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential Securities, technical analyst Ralph Acampora said
he adjusted his Dow forecast downward after the blue chip index
dropped below a key support level last week but also said he is
``bullish long term.''
</P>
<P>
   He now looks for the Dow to hit 12,000 next year instead of in
1999, which was his earlier forecast. The Dow's record is
11,326.04, set Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora called the current correction ``a great opportunity to
buy, once we experience a selling climax such as the one we
experienced in (October) 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   From here on, analysts said, the market will be driven by the
outlook for interest rates and the strength of third-quarter
profits. Rising rates could put a damper on trading, while upbeat
profit growth could propel the market to new highs, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-makers meet Tuesday to act on short-term
interest rates. An increase would be the third since June. Analysts
are divided on prospects of a rate change. Some think an increase
is unlikely now because of fresh news of slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in stock prices due to the correction also makes a rate
boost unlikely, some analysts contend. They cite Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's concern about the role of stock market wealth in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Thursday that gross domestic product, the
broadest measure of the economy, grew at an annual rate of 1.6
percent in the second quarter, revised from the earlier 1.8 percent
estimate. First-quarter GDP growth was an annualized 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market took heart with the GDP news despite a strong
August housing report. The result was that the yield on the 30-year
Treasury moved lower.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, a Fed rate increase would not necessarily
harm the market, since Wall Street already anticipates another one.
The absence of a rate rise Tuesday would probably boost buying, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for third-quarter profits, analysts look for year-over-year
gains of about 16 percent, slightly better than the second-quarter
performance.

COMMENTARY: PLANNING FOR AND COMMUNICATING ABOUT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Oct. 7) 
(bl) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was her wish that her ashes be scattered and she meant that
in a global way, so a woman named Woody is landing in many places.
She is in a public garden. She is next to a Buddha statue in a
friend's back yard. Her cousin delivered his portion to a special
tree that grows out of a rock in the Sierra. She is by her home in
the apple orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Her son says, ``My mom wanted to be part of everything and go
everywhere.'' And so Woody is getting her wish.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to Campobello, FDR's vacation home. She is in a
flower pot on the third floor balcony of an apartment in Los
Angeles. She is scheduled to go to Tonga. And there will be more.
Close to 100 containers of Woody's ashes were given out at her
memorial picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Woody's way may not be everybody's choice, but it's part of a
trend that's changing the American way of formula funerals and
starting new family traditions. People are planning their exit
ahead of time, not leaving things to chance or to a grieving and
overwhelmed relative to second guess their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut writer, Lynn McPhelimy, came up with a way to
encourage people to discuss and write down all the pertinent
details ahead of time just as she did with her own parents. Her
workbook, called ``In the Checklist of Life: A Working Book to Help
You Live &AMP; Leave This Life,'' has pages for writing down special
memories _ what time was supper every night? _ to personal requests
_ what music do you want at your funeral?
</P>
<P>
   Lynn wrote it after her parents died within months of each other
from cancer and after talking frankly and intimately to her about
their deaths. Her mother wanted to wear her yellow suit and be in a
closed casket with a single rose on top. Her father wanted to wear
his gardening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   There were also practical things that had to be shared. Lynn's
father drew her a map to the septic tank so the next time it needed
pumping she wouldn't have to dig up the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about it all, says Lynn. What is the special meaning of
certain books, old Christmas ornaments. Who do we call to get the
garbage stopped? How often do you feed the roses?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to do any of that you have to get past the giant
taboo subject. Children don't want to talk about the fact that
their parents will not always be around, and parents aren't too
wild about the inevitability either.
</P>
<P>
   But, talking about death doesn't hasten it any more than hiding
from the subject keeps it away. While ``How do you feel about
dying?'' isn't a popular conversation starter, once broached, the
subject has endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you not want speaking about your life at your funeral? Do
you want to be cremated or buried? Can I have the tea pot with the
red handle?
</P>
<P>
   A friend, who promises not to die for a long time, and I
recently got on the subject of multiple scattering. She would like
to have half of her ashes delivered back east to be buried next to
her husband, but she wants the other half sprinkled into the
Pacific. I said I was thinking about the Atlantic, the Pacific and
maybe some place in France.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn McPhelimy published her book herself after 15 publishing
houses wrinkled their noises. She's sold over 100,000 copies, has
been on Oprah and The Today Show and is impressed by how
enthusiastic people get once the subject is out.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it turns them back on to living. There's a section in
the book that asks what you wished you had done in life. A
74-year-old woman wrote down white-water rafting, then decided she
still had time and scheduled six days on the Colorado River.

ZENGA OUT A REVOLUTION COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY _ Walter Zenga is leaving the Revolution as abruptly
as he was hired. Zenga, who was named coach of the team after
arriving for a tribute game Aug. 22, 1998, was fired Thursday with
the Revolution in a desperate fight to qualify for the Major League
Soccer playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nicol, a former star defender with Liverpool and
Scotland's national team, will coach the Revolution in Saturday's
game against the MetroStars at Foxboro Stadium and the
regular-season finale at D.C. United Oct. 9. Nicol, who was
player-assistant coach with the Boston Bulldogs this season, has
been scouting in El Salvador and will join the Revolution at
practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 39, conducted a training session at Babson College
Thursday morning, then met with general manager Brian O'Donovan.
During a meeting that lasted about five minutes, Zenga asked
O'Donovan to confirm him for next season, according to sources.
O'Donovan refused and instead fired Zenga, who as goalie also was
one of the team's most important players. Zenga's hand-picked
assistant, Giuseppe Galderisi, also was let go.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Zenga publicly campaigned to remain in charge of the
Revolution. O'Donovan stated at the time that no decision would be
made until after the regular season. The Revolution then lost, 1-0,
to Dallas, assuring that the team will have its worst record in
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution are only a point behind fourth-place Miami
and have a significant lead in the goal-differential tiebreaker in
the Eastern Conference. The fourth-place team will meet D.C. United
in the playoffs starting Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting in the coaches' locker room, Zenga said: ``I
have nothing to say now, but I will talk (Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donovan said a press release would be issued, but did not
reveal the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden dismissal of their coach astonished Revolution
players, most of whom had departed from the locker room unaware of
the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised by the timing of the change,'' defender Dan
Calichman said. ``We assumed the season would be finished and,
hopefully, we would make the playoffs, then everyone would be
evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga led the Revolution to their only playoff berth as a
goalkeeper in 1997 but retired after the season. He returned last
year as a replacement for coach Thomas Rongen and guided the
Revolution to three victories in the final six games by emphasizing
defense-first tactics. The Revolution seemed comfortable with this
identity, and Zenga brought in Calichman to reinforce the defense,
plus John Harkes to provide leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution struggled during preseason training and some
players seemed dissatisfied with the team's extended stay in Italy
during training camp. Yet, the Revolution earned 18 points and
climbed as high as third place in the first half of the season. But
the team since has collapsed and has a 1-12-1 record in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised about the team's tactics after it switched
to a 3-5-2 alignment, and doubts were raised in July when the
Revolution added striker Ariel Graziani instead of Ghanaian
defender Joseph Addo, who had been preferred by Zenga and
Galderisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly understand that Walter and Beppe must have options
out there, certainly in Italy, and they want to know where they
stand,'' Calichman said. ``I respect that, but I understand both
sides here. If someone doesn't like the way I play, I get traded.
I'm sorry to see it happen. People being fired is always the
hardest part about this business. On a personal level, I'm sad to
see them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicol, 37, started his professional career with Ayr United in
Scotland and was part of some of the most glorious and tragic times
in Liverpool history, playing for the 1984 European Champions Cup
winners in Rome and the runners-up in the 1985 violence-plagued
final at Heysel Stadium in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what he's done as a player but I don't know him,''
captain Mike Burns said of Nicol. ``He's in a no-lose situation, an
interim situation in which, hopefully, we'll make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit unusual for a coach to be fired with two games left
in the season. We were caught off guard. We expected the entire
organization to be evaluated at the end of the season. There is
always tension, and we've had it for four years in this situation.
They have tension in D.C., but it's a different kind. When you lose
a number of consecutive games, everything is magnified. But to use
Walter as a scapegoat, I don't think that is fair.''

CLINTON SIGNS TEMPORARY SPENDING MEASURE, BLASTS GOP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed a temporary spending
measure Thursday to keep the government operating and accused
Republicans of using ``gimmicks and gamesmanship'' to conceal
dipping into the Social Security surplus to fund the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned Republicans that he would vetotheir plan to
delay Earned Income Tax Credit refund payments to the poor, one of
their gimmicks, he said, to come up with a spending plan that does
not break legislated spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   He urged them to get to work on a realistic fiscal 2000 budget
before the temporary spending measure expires.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 fiscal year began Friday with no budget agreement in
sight, and the White House and GOP majority in Congress found
themselves in a familiar position _ a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid shutting down the government, Congress passed and the
president signed the continuing resolution extending funding for
all government agencies until Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, trying to keep the heat on the GOP,
suggested there would be little support for another lengthy stopgap
spending resolution and raised the prospect of another budgetary
train wreck this year.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders countered that it was Clinton who has yet to get
serious about the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything all year on it,'' said House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``Now he comes along and says, `Look,
if you guys don't finish this thing in three weeks I'm going to
shut down the government.' I mean I don't understand that kind of
presidential behavior,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that months ago the administration submitted its
budget proposal that would have raised taxes on tobacco companies,
corporate polluters and closed corporate tax loopholes while also
spending more on education, setting aside the surplus for Social
Security and beginning to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of making difficult choices to finish their work and
crafting a responsible budget, they've resorted to gimmicks and
gamesmanship like using two sets of books and designating the fully
predictable census, for example, as emergency spending,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said most troubling to him was the Republican effort to
``disguise the fact that they are spending the Social Security
surplus'' by delaying Earned Income Tax Credit payments to nearly
20 million poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, under consideration by the House Appropriations
Committee, would save more than $8 billion for fiscal year 2000 by
making monthly EITC payments to families in the $20,000-$30,000
income range instead of paying in a lump sum. The savings would
come from pushing some of the payments, based on 1999 earnings,
into fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed that plan as ``an effective tax increase on
the most hard-pressed working Americans'' at a time when they are
trying to lift themselves out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let me be clear. I will not sign a bill that turns its back
on these hardworking families. I don't think we ought to be putting
more roadblocks in their way,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The EITC ensures a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service
to the lowest income taxpayers, even those who might owe no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing a new Census Bureau report on income, contends
the EITC has helped double the number of people coming out of
poverty in the past five years. The annual Census report showed
dropping poverty rates, especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied they were making the change to hide use of
Social Security surplus money in their spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Army said the Republican attempt to alter the EITC payment is
``good policy'' and a ``good management tool.'' He equated the tax
credit to a welfare program and suggested it should conform to
other welfare programs by being paid out on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said the program needed
reform because ``the working poor don't need help with their annual
budget, what they need help with is their monthly budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush distanced
himself from the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they ought to balance the budget on the backs of
the poor,'' Bush said in California.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has completed work on five of 13 spending measures to
fund the government. Clinton has signed two of them into law,
vetoed one and has threatened to veto four others still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have urged from the very beginning that we sit down and
negotiate these things together to be able to avoid completely any
prospect of shutting down the government,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., the Senate minority leader.``They're on the road to doing
so if they aren't careful. We don't want that to happen. They say
they don't want that to happen, but they're actions speak a lot
louder than their words,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, the president's budget chief, also said there would be
little appetite for another lengthy resolution after Oct. 21.
``They (Republicans) shouldn't have any illusions about lots of
long extensions,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also blasted Republicans for launching a new political
advertising campaign Wednesday that blames Democrats for wanting to
spend Social Security money. The Republicans' own Congressional
Budget Office reported the GOP would be spending $18 billion from
the surplus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help noting that these are the same people who told us
they could spend all this money and cut taxes $792 billion and
never touch the Social Security surplus,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the GOP's 10-year $792 billion tax cut last week.
Republicans, in turn, said they would not agree to Clinton's
spending increases or tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole budget position we're taking now...is we're going to
stop this raid on Social Security money,'' Armey said, disputing
the CBO report as a ``misrepresentation.''

FLEET-BANKBOSTON MERGER CLEARS FINAL HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State officials gave a final nod Thursday to Fleet
Financial Group Inc.'s proposed acquisition of BankBoston Corp.,
eliminating the last regulatory hurdle to a deal that creates New
England's dominant bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation unanimously
endorsed the $16 billion transaction, which the two banks expect to
formally close Friday. The agency's sign-off is the final green
light for the two Boston-based companies to forge ahead in the
arduous task of melding two different cultures into the nation's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies declined to comment on what two
industry sources said Thursday was new consideration in recent days
by Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray to call the holding
company of the new bank Fleet Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's current ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange,
FLT, would remain for the new company, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported earlier this week that Murray has insisted
that the main retail bank _ the core of the new company _ bear the
Fleet name only. The Globe, citing sources familiar with the
matter, also reported that certain BankBoston portions of the new
company _ the Latin American franchise and San-Francisco investment
bank Robertson Stephens _ would retain their current names, though
the latter would drop its BankBoston prefix.
</P>
<P>
   The banks expect to announce a new, 22-person board next week,
Fleet spokesman James Mahoney said. The board is scheduled to hold
its first meeting in the third week of October.
</P>
<P>
   Since New England's largest bank deal was announced in March,
industry analysts on Wall Street and elsewhere have wondered how
two companies widely viewed as different would work together to
meld their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, in a brief telephone interview Thursday, said his
relationship with his BankBoston counterpart, Charles K. Gifford,
was ``professional, collaborative, and in the spirit of getting the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he and Gifford made decisions, Murray replied:
``We go one way (on one matter), then next time we try to yield to
the other person.'' Murray is chairman and chief executive of the
new company, with Gifford in the number two position of president
and chief operating officer. Gifford is scheduled to take the top
post at the end of 2001, when Murray will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a merger of equals,'' Murray said, repeating a
phrase often pronounced by Gifford. Some industry analysts have
said that so-called mergers of equals end up as transactions in
which the culture and ethos of the acquiring company dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Fleet-BankBoston merger won support Thursday
from Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who had
opposed the deal. While Blumenthal has no regulatory power over the
transaction, his office could have filed lawsuits designed to delay
or block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad, stark fact is that an antitrust lawsuit was
critically undercut by two key federal agency approvals,''
Blumenthal said in a statement, referring to recent approvals by
the Justice Department and Federal Reserve for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint press release with the Connecticut treasurer,
Blumenthal said Fleet had agreed to divest an additional seven
Connecticut branches and invest an additional $700 million, or
total $2.9 billion, in state community projects. Fleet also agreed
to set aside two branches previously sold to Wyomissing, Pa.-based
Sovereign Bancorp for purchase by a minority-owned bank.
</P>
<P>
   A local banking source said Thursday that Boston Bank of
Commerce, a leading minority-owned bank, planned to bid on the two
Connecticut branches. BBOC is also trying to buy five Boston-based
branches, but negotiations with Fleet have stalled over price
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, under a major divestiture of assets, Sovereign
bought more than 270 Fleet and BankBoston branches, with nearly $13
billion in deposits. Murray said Sovereign would employ 900 people
more than expected, and that job cuts from the merger would be less
than 2,500. An equal number of positions will be eliminated through
attrition.

   PHOENIX - The Nissan Frontier Crew Cab is not a graceful
vehicle, but it's a useful one. Combining the benefits of a
sport-utility vehicle with an open-bed pickup truck, it becomes
something else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It's a compromise, to be sure. The back seat is not really where
you'd want to be for a cross-country journey, and the pickup bed is
at least a foot shorter than those on most pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Crew Cab answers the need of many families who want the
convenience of a small pickup and still have enough room for junior
and the twins. It can haul, it can tow and it can boondock, and it
can take everybody along.
</P>
<P>
   There have been full-size crew-cab trucks for decades, usually
for commercial or construction applications but increasingly for
personal use. The compact Crew Cab is a new development, at least
for the United States, although in such places as Africa and
Australia, the design is old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is the first to come to market, although Ford is
developing one off the Explorer, and other automakers are readying
their own. Ford has coined a nickname for its version that is sure
to stick as a generic term: Sport Truck.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew Cab benefits from Nissan's well-engineered Frontier
chassis, which also can be had in standard-issue pickup form or
King Cab. Nissan also has used the Frontier as the basis for the
new Xterra sport-utility vehicle, which has been a huge hit,
especially among younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew Cab is considerably roomier than the King Cab, with a
full-width back seat. It also has the advantage of real,
full-functioning rear doors instead of the clamshell doors on King
Cab or other makers' stretch-cab pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier is a good driving truck with a rugged feel and,
with the V-6 engine, enough power and torque to perform most truck
duties. Both the two- and four-wheel-drive versions of the crew cab
are built on the sturdy four-wheeler chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The test truck was an upgraded four-wheel-drive SE model with a
nicely equipped interior and a decent stereo system. It came with
automatic transmission, and a five-speed manual is available. With
the automatic, towing capacity is 5,000 pounds; 3,500 pounds with
stick.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the SE includes aluminum alloy 16-inch wheels,
step rails and mud flaps, chrome bumpers and fog lamps. The only
option was a power package for windows, locks and mirrors, remote
door locks and security system, and cruise control, all for $1,080
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Crew Cab also can be had with a flexible roof rack that can be
equipped to tote bikes, skis, kayaks or luggage. A sunroof also is
available.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find the 54-inch-long cargo bed too small for
practical purposes, Nissan offers an interesting tubular bed
extender that mounts on the lowered tailgate, effectively
increasing the length by 16.5 inches. When the tailgate is up, the
extender can be moved forward in the bed to create a storage area
for smaller items. The bed extender can be used on any of the
Frontier pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that short bed will be a sticking point for many pickup
users, especially those who use the trucks for business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the four-door configuration makes the Crew Cab more
flexible, it's still no substitute for a passenger car. The front
bucket seats are comfortable enough, but the back on the rear seat
is nearly upright, and legroom is marginal. Few full-size adults
would be happy back there for very long.
</P>
<P>
   The rear doors, although preferable to the clamshells on
stretch-cab pickups, are a lot narrower than the doors on a
four-door car or sport-utility vehicle. For an extra-tall guy like
me, getting in and out is a strenuous piece of contortionism, and I
think it would be the same story for anybody even approaching 6
feet in height.
</P>
<P>
   For those more accustomed to the cushy rides of today's luxury
SUVs, the Crew Cab may feel harsh. Handling is improved, however,
because of the stiff suspension and reduced body sway.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the Crew Cab appears clunky to some eyes, oddly cut
off behind the rear doors, with a boxy cabin and disproportionately
short bed. To others, however, it's strikingly macho and
purposeful, helped no doubt by the aggressive stance, beefy tires
and broad fender flares.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's California design studio penned the look, and the Crew
Cab is built in the Japanese automaker's Smyrna, Tenn., factory.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew Cab gets a love-it or hate-it reaction wherever it
goes, but Nissan should be able to sell as many of these as it can
pump out. The four-door is available in the same sort of funky
colors available for the Xterra, included bright yellow. &QL;

BELL MANAGERS QUESTION MOVE TO CASH-BALANCE PENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following an earlier change of heart at International Business
Machines Corp. about converting longtime employees' traditional
pensions to cash-balance accounts, Bell Atlantic Corp. managers
have petitioned a US Senate panel to investigate whether a similar
move by their employer was discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The petition, filed on behalf of 250 managers from
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York, was
delivered last week to Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy for
consideration as his Senate committee, where Kennedy is the ranking
Democrat, considers hearings on cash-balance accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic stood by its plan Thursday and denied any bias. It
said it went out of its way to ensure that older managers with
significant years of service would receive more money in their cash
balance accounts, thereby reducing the impact of the conversion
from a traditional defined benefits pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rosel &UR;  &LR; Patton, 47, a manager in the company's engineering design
center in Marlborough, Mass. who delivered the petition last week,
called the Bell Atlantic move ``very disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton said the conversion of her pension in 1997 will lead to a
33 1/4 percent reduction in benefits from her previous, traditional
pension plan, when she reaches 30 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had been done properly I would have had an opening
balance of about $210,000, but I only had $129,000 in the
account,'' Patton, a telephone employee for 28 years, said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic managers Arthur Callahan and Arthur Huse, who work
in Burlington, Mass., believe their pensions will be reduced 29 and
21 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman in New York, Steven Marcus, said the
conversion took employees' experience and age into account. ``When
we established an opening balance in their accounts, we put in
extra money using a formula based on age and length of service,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under most cash balance accounts, a company contributes 2
percent. Our contribution ranges from 4 percent to 7 percent,
depending on age. The contribution for older employers is 7
percent. So, our plan does not discriminate based on age,'' Marcus
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for allegations that early retirement penalties were charged,
Marcus said he was unaware of such assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic implemented its cash balance pension program in
two stages, beginning in December 1995 at sites in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the
District of Columbia. In 1997, the pensions of former Nynex Corp.
managers were converted from conventional defined benefits plans to
cash balance accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic managers' petition was filed less than a week
after IBM, under political pressure, agreed to allow employees 40
and older with at least 10 years on the job to choose between the
new cash balance account and a traditional defined benefits pension
plan. Under the latter, long-term employees accrue more benefits
during the last decade of work. Under cash balance accounts, by
contrast, benefits accrue at the same rate yearly, giving younger
workers the chance to earn more earlier in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, two Bell Atlantic managers from Massachusetts have
filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
alleging age discrimination. In interviews Thursday, they claimed
the company added early retirement penalties to the formula it used
to calculate the managers' cash balance accounts, even though they
have not yet retired.
</P>
<P>
   To support their position in the cash-balance pension fund
fight, other Bell Atlantic employees meanwhile launched a Bell
Atlantic employee pension site on the World Wide Web, similar to
pension club sites created earlier by employees at IBM and other
companies where conversions have become controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Huse, a former Nynex employee, had 29 years of service with the
New England Telephone Co. and Nynex Corp. before Nynex merged with
Bell Atlantic in 1997. He has been with Bell Atlantic two years.
``As more people become aware, the furor is beginning to foment.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton last July filed a complaint about the Bell Atlantic
conversion with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
alleging age discrimination. The EEOC has since said it plans to
investigate the legality of cash balance accounts.

FED SEEN LEAVING INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The economy is still growing at a rapid clip.
Commodity prices are rising. With unemployment low, workers are
demanding and getting higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   But for every signal suggesting that inflation might be lurking
just over the horizon, there are others indicating that price
increases are well under control and that whatever inflationary
pressures might be building will dissipate in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Federal Reserve is likely to leave interest
rates unchanged when its policy committee meets on Tuesday,
analysts and economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials have hinted as much in their public statements
over the last few weeks, saying that they see prices as stable and
the economy's ability to grow without inflation benefiting from
huge investments in productivity-enhancing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, typically gives financial
markets a clear warning when he is seriously considering a rate
increase, but in a speech Thursday night in Minnesota, he did not
mention current economic conditions or monetary policy. Instead, he
warned about the dangers of trade protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is whether the Fed will feel compelled to nudge rates
up at its subsequent meeting, in mid-November. If the economy does
not show clear signs of cooling off somewhat over the next six
weeks, analysts said, there is a good chance that the central bank
will nudge its benchmark rate up by a quarter of a percentage point
by the end of the year. The clearest clue to the Fed's intentions
will be whether it adopts a formal tilt toward higher rates at its
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their rhetoric of late, the Fed is going to stay on hold
at the Oct. 5 meeting,'' said Paul Kasriel, an economist at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``There is a distinct possibility
that they could issue a directive biased toward tightening, which
would put us on a rate-hike watch for the Nov. 16 meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point
increments, most recently on Aug. 24 when it increased its federal
funds target rate to 5.25 percent. At the same time, the central
bank said inflation risks had been markedly diminished, a sign of
its confidence that growth would slow to a non-inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that the economy grew at a
revised annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, down from
4.3 percent in the first quarter. The government had previously
estimated growth at 1.8 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Growth has subsequently rebounded considerably, however, and
most economists are now forecasting that the economy expanded about
4 percent in the quarter that ended Thursday and will maintain
something close to that pace for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's maybe a little more rapid than the Fed wants, but there
are some indications that things are slowing down a bit,'' said
Stephen Slifer, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of new homes rose 2.9 percent in August, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But other interest-rate-sensitive
activity suggests that the general upward trend in interest rates
over the last several months is beginning to work its way through
the economy. Mortgage refinancing, for example, which has put
additional cash in the pockets of many consumers, has slowed
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in the stock market is also likely to diminish any
fears among Fed officials that the economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   But the strongest case for holding rates steady may be that
there are almost no signs of consumer price inflation. Core
inflation _ excluding volatile energy and food prices _ rose just
1.9 percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that isn't price stability, I don't know what is,'' William
McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation so well behaved, Fed officials are talking more
openly about the possibility that their traditional models for
predicting inflation are no longer worth much. As a result, they
seem less inclined to raise rates before they are sure that
inflation is threatening the long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose, like now, we're uncertain about the underlying model
of the economy,'' Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech on Monday. ``In that case,
pre-emptive policy can lead to the wrong action. When there's a
high degree of uncertainty about forecasts, it could be best for
policy to be more cautious _ in the extreme, to wait until
inflation actually starts to rise before acting to tighten.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are enough signs of persistently strong demand and
inflation-warning signals that the Fed is sure to remain vigilant
in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for durable goods unexpectedly rose again in August after
a big surge in July. Consumer confidence, while dipping, remains
high, and job creation remains strong even as the supply of
available workers is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for oil and other commodities are rising. Demand for
American goods from abroad is picking up, and the dollar's long
rally appears to be coming to an end, creating the risk of higher
import prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a strong economic performance, probably stronger
than most at the Fed think is sustainable,'' said Kenneth Mayland,
an economist at KeyCorp in Cleveland. ``More and more evidence is
coming in that there has been a change in the inflation
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this year, economists speculated that the Fed would
be unlikely to raise interest rates during the last two months of
1999 because of fears that the computer problems associated with
the end of the century might wreak havoc with the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But as government officials and corporate executives have grown
more confident that the United States will escape any serious
problems, analysts have changed their minds and now think the Fed
would be willing to tighten policy in November if economic data
justify higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K situation is going so smoothly now that it's much less
of a constraint on Nov. 16 policy action if deemed necessary,''
Mayland said.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola denies it shredded documents
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The attorneys representing the plaintiffs in a racial
discrimination suit irresponsibly accused Coca-Cola of shredding
documents and should be punished by the court, the company said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the company said that employees once discussed the
possibility of using shredders in a data collection room, Coca-Cola
said the idea was ``immediately vetoed'' and it has never shredded
any documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs' latest motion is at best reckless and
disingenuous, and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead the
court and manipulate public opinion through demonstrably false and
inflammatory allegations,'' Coca-Cola said in its formal challenge
to the plaintiffs' accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging 35-page brief, the Atlanta-based beverage company
repeatedly condemned the plaintiffs' attorneys, saying they are
``apparently unconstrained by any obligation even to attempt to
verify'' the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But Cyrus Mehri, one of the plaintiffs' lead attorneys,
discounted the company's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defense is the equivalent of `I smoked pot but didn't
inhale,''' Mehri said. He added that the plaintiffs will now file a
formal reply to the company's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed a motion alleging
that Coca-Cola shredded documents and should be punished by U.S.
District Court Judge Richard Story for making misleading statements
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said affidavits and pre-trial depositions showed
that employees asked that shredders be placed in a special room
that was set up by the company to collect employment documents and
data for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also alleged that eyewitnesses have seen
shredders in the room and that a custodian has removed bags of
shredded material left outside the room.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Coca-Cola said that on May 26 its employees
discussed putting shredders in the data collection room. But, the
company said, ``the idea of using shredders was immediately vetoed.
Coca-Cola instead decided to use two confidential refuse bins for
any miscopies or extra copies of confidential documents. ...
Moreover, all trash created during the data collection process,
other than personal trash such as used food containers and coffee
cups, still exists in the confidential refuse bins ... No documents
or data have been shredded, discarded or otherwise destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said the one person who said he saw two shredders in
the room has been contradicted by 17 other eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While the company denies the existence of any shredder in its
data collection room, one of its attorneys said he purchased a
shredder for his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did so because I knew there would be a large volume of
confidential, legally privileged documentation generated by this
litigation that I would want to discard,'' company attorney Robert
Boas said in an affidavit. Boas said he was concerned about
employees who were potential ``litigation opponents'' gaining
access to his office, where he kept internal strategy memos on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time since I purchased a paper shredder for my office
have I (or anyone else at my direction) used it to dispose of any
documentation to which plaintiffs in this litigation would even
arguably be entitled,'' Boas said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the plaintiffs' attorneys have failed to
conduct a reasonable investigation before making their ``malicious
accusations.'' It called the plaintiffs' motion a ``calculated
effort to damage the goodwill and good name of the Coca-Cola Co. in
their continuing effort to coerce a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Coca-Cola asked the judge to punish the
plaintiffs' attorneys ``for actions that are not only abusive and
reprehensible, but an affront to the judicial system itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in April by four current and former
employees. It alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against
African-American employees in pay, promotions and performance
evaluations. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they
can represent 1,500 other black salaried employees in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has strongly denied the suit's allegations.

   ``We're amassing as much reach as we can, and the plan is to
derive as much revenue from those page views better than anyone
else,'' said Bill White, CMGI executive vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CMGI said it plans to issue stock worth about $500
million to buy AdForce Inc., an advertising broker; also last week,
CMGI-controlled research firm Engage Technologies Inc. said it will
use $193 million in stock to buy AdKnowledge Inc., a
marketing-management service.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's efforts come at a time of high expectations that the
Internet will develop into a major marketing channel, and have set
up CMGI to compete head-to-head with traditional market leader
DoubleClick Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies aim to develop sophisticated programs that show
consumers only those on-line ads likely to interest them, based on
their demographics and past surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such ads should also command higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   The total market for such on-line material is variously
estimated to reach around $7 billion by 2002, from around $1.5
billion last year, according to survey firm NUA of Dublin. In the
first quarter of this year $693 million was spent on such content,
according to the Internet Advertising Bureau in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the expected boom, the effectiveness of on-line
marketing so far is a still an open question, particularly in the
area of what are called ``banner ads,'' or small boxed messages
that often appear on Web sites hosted by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   For most banners, a click-through rate of less than one-half of
1 percent is considered strong, compared to a response rate several
times that for ads in magazine or newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Web goes, we're still in the game of trying to
figure out what works,'' said Jay Kim, of the Paul Kagan Associates
consulting firm in Carmel, Calif. Flycast chief executive George
Carrick concurred. For many advertising buyers, he said, ``The cost
equation versus the benefit equation still has to sort itself
out.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI wouldn't discuss how the Flycast deal will impact its
operating results, or describe how its new push into advertising
relates to its plans for the AltaVista search engine, most of which
CMGI bought from Compaq Computer Corp. earlier this year and plans
to take public.
</P>
<P>
   But financial analysts said the Flycast agreement puts CMGI in a
position to link its various ad-related technologies. For example,
banner ads gathered by Flycast and AdSmart could be sorted through
servers hosted by Engage, then targeted to specific consumers using
AdForce-built programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more or less done, in terms of enabling themselves to
target the ads closely,'' said First Albany Corp. analyst Ullas
Naik. ``In theory, sophisticated targeting can drive the
click-through rates pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's acquisition spree is made possible by its strong share
price, which closed at 102 1/2 Thursday, more than 10 times its
value of a year ago. Like other technology stocks, however, CMGI
shares have fallen lately: the company reached a high of 165 in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996, Flycast lost $9.3 million in 1998 on sales of
$8 million; some analysts had expected the company to become
profitable by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast is known for its partnerships with about 1,200
small-to-midsize Web site companies, complementing CMGI's AdSmart
service, aimed at providing content from larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast's roughly 140 employees will remain in San Francisco
under chief executive George Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for CMGI to exchange 0.4728 of its shares for
each of Flycast's 15.26 million shares outstanding, giving the deal
a total value of $741 million based on CMGI's closing price
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast shares rose 7 1/2 to 45 1/2 apiece after the agreement
was announced Thursday; the purchase represents a premium of 27
percent over company's market value Wednesday, before the agreement
was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is scheduled to be completed in January, pending
approvals from regulators and Flycast shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast's Carrick said he held talks with two other companies
before settling on the deal with CMGI, but he declined to name them
or discuss whether a breakup fee would be paid to investment
bankers should the a rival suitor emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Should a counterbid succeed, the agreement gives CMGI the option
of buying up to 19.9 percent of Flycast. Major Flycast investors
include venture-capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo
Park, Calif.; Charles River Ventures of Waltham; and St. Paul
Ventures of St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Other major holders of Flycast stock include BellSouth Corp., US
West Inc., and SBC Communications Inc.

ADVERTISING: DIGITAL SLEIGHT OF HAND CAN PUT ADS ANYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new form of advertising is rewriting an old saying to declare:
Now you don't see it, now you do.
</P>
<P>
   The magic now, though, is supplied by computers, in the form of
digital technology that inserts electronic images like signs, brand
logos and even product packages into live and previously taped
television programs. The computer-generated ads are sufficiently
lifelike that viewers see them as real even though they are
anything but.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual advertising,'' as this trickery is known, is ``the
Harry Houdini of the media business,'' said David Verklin, chief
executive at Carat North America in New York, which buys commercial
time and ad space for marketers. ``It's the most astonishing kind
of advertising technology I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual advertising has so far been a novelty feature of live
sports, where football players tackle each other in front of
make-believe billboards and soccer players run across plausibly
real trademarks. For example, the games of three Major League
Baseball teams _ the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies
and San Diego Padres _ include virtual ads this season.
</P>
<P>
   But now, virtual advertising is breaking through into
entertainment, with programs being subtly changed to benefit
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the first glimpse of the future of
advertising,'' said Verklin of Carat, a unit of Aegis Group PLC,
``where the product and the program are integrated in a fashion
that's more seamless than we ever could have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the big American networks are shunning the practice
in entertainment programming for now, TV series in countries like
Canada, Mexico and Spain are regularly augmented with virtual
product placements; marketers are paying fees _ usually in the low
four figures _ to have images of their goods and services inserted
after production is completed. (With sports events, the ads are
inserted live as the game or match is played.)
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of virtual ads in entertainment programs give several
reasons for preferring that approach to simply placing products in
a show before it is shot. For one thing, virtual products can be
readily changed, so a different sponsor can be sold a placement
each time a program runs.
</P>
<P>
   The placements can also be changed by geography: Viewers in the
East might get a glimpse of Wise potato chips, while those in the
West would see Laura Scudder's. And while agreements to place real
products in programs can often take months or years to negotiate,
the placement of virtual ads can be negotiated after the fact _ and
theoretically far more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, what is believed to be the first use ever
of virtual advertising outside sports came in March, when images
for advertisers like Blockbuster, Coca-Cola, Evian and fashion
retailer Kenneth Cole were superimposed in an episode of ``Seven
Days,'' a prime-time series on the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   Those virtual products _ inserted at no cost to the sponsors as
part of an experiment _ were indistinguishable from other
background objects. In one scene, shopping bags bearing the Cole
logo were placed in a hotel lobby. In another, bottles of Evian
were added next to a water carafe and glasses. In a third, a
videotape box bearing the Blockbuster logo was inserted onto a
desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental appeal'' for advertisers ``is the idea that
advertising in the show, in the game, is significantly more
impactful than in the breaks,'' said Dennis Wilkinson, president
and chief executive at Princeton Video Image Inc. in Lawrenceville,
N.J., which handled the test for UPN and is a leader in video
insertion services.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay more attention'' during a show than during a
commercial, he added, making virtual advertising a powerful selling
tool.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual ads are also capable of fighting commercial flight: the
instant the sales spiels begin, ad-weary viewers leave the room or
grab their remotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the networks increasing their commercial loads,'' said
Steve Saldano, partner and media services director at the Deutsch
Inc. ad agency in New York, ``I'd like to have virtual advertising
as a choice when I think, `How else can I get my brand in front of
the consumer?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the digital future in some cases precludes
commercials,'' he added, as wealthier viewers _ ``the most valuable
consumers'' _ buy machines to delete them from programs, ``virtual
advertising might work just fine in order to reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of virtual advertising is a sign of the
never-ending efforts of marketers to blanket consumers in a
continuous fog of sponsored pitches. Their goal is to elude
consumer resistance to traditional forms of advertising like
commercials and print advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, ads have intruded onto the floors of stores and the
sides of blimps, airport baggage carousels and school hallways,
coffee cups and stadium names, bathroom walls and hot dog cart
umbrellas. So it seems inevitable that someday Madison Avenue will
introduce its own version of a Zen koan and interpolate ads where
there isn't anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual advertising ``is one of the first little gremlins to
come out of the box of digitalization,'' said Alec Gerster,
chairman at Mediacom in New York, the media buying unit of Grey
Advertising. ``It just begins to highlight that a lot of people in
the future will be able to touch content _ and change it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the outrage years ago when people altered
black-and-white movies by colorizing them?'' Gerster asked. ``This
makes colorization a mere drop in the bucket.''

   WTO-SECURITY (Seattle) _ Fire trucks will be strategically
placed downtown. Ambulances will be ready. Dogs will sniff for
bombs. And in buildings near the convention center, officers in
riot gear will be waiting, watching and hoping they are not called.
If they are, something has gone wrong. Seattle is gearing up for
the World Trade Organization conference.

   By Paul Nyhan. (Story will move in the ``f'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-KINGS (Undated) _ Every so often a film comes along that's
as entertaining as it is a viable, political message destined to
make viewers rethink their stance about war. The '70s films
``MASH'' and ``Catch 22'' are prime examples of satires that had an
impact because of their conscience and comedic irreverence. ``Three
Kings'' is certainly a welcome addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SUGARTOWN (Undated) _ ``Sugar Town'' is a surprisingly
innocuous, rather shapeless comedy that is enjoyable to watch and
often quite clever with its barbs. But we don't get to know any of
the characters _ there are too many to focus upon intently in a
90-minute running time _ and by the final frames it doesn't resolve
itself or its issues and, in truth, doesn't have much to say.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MYSTERY (Undated) _ This feel-good sports story, set in
snowy Mystery, Alaska, boasts a terrific cast. But as directed by
``Austin Powers'' helmer, Jay Roach, and co-written by TV boy
wonder David E. Kelley, the film never reaches much more than a TV
movie of the week mentality.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ELMO (Undated) _ ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland''
is certainly an improvement on the last installment of Muppet
mayhem, ``Muppets From Space.'' And better, the film is geared
specifically to toddlers and small kids and retains the essence of
the TV show, ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PLUNKETT (Undated) _ ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' almost
convinces us it's a little different because of its breathtaking
production design and costuming. But don't be fooled. Beneath its
extraordinary exterior coat of paint is a less-than-ordinary film.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-GUINEVERE (Undated) _ ``Guinevere'' is a gorgeous film that
purports to delve into the forbidden bond between an older man and
a very young woman.Though it won raves at the Sundance Film
Festival for what some viewed as a ``racy'' theme, the film is
hardly provocative. It's a surprisingly tame look at how an older
artist, who isn't much of a Lancelot, seduces a Guinevere every few
years, uses her as an assistant in his work and romantically
exploits or initiates her into his life.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CRAZY (Undated) _ ``Drive Me Crazy'' is so badly plotted
and written that it rarely makes much sense, even with the
elementary story line. And just how much longer will Hollywood
insist upon driving us crazy with insipid romantic comedies about
two polar-opposite high school kids who, after sparring and trying
to get each other to change, find they're perfect together on the
eve of the big dance?
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-ANIMALFARM (Undated) _ Delivering the message is where TNT's
``Animal Farm'' falters. With astonishing animatronics and
computer-generated imagery, the film is a technological triumph on
the order of ``Babe.'' But even with ``Babe'' director John
Stephenson behind the camera, ``Animal Farm'' misses several beats
because it's not quite long enough.

 UNDATED: the bucket.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, critics of the increasing encroachment of commercial
elements are responding with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one way television is up to its neck in
commercialism, and it's getting worse by the day,'' said Gary
Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert, an organization in Washington
founded last year by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being bombarded with ever-craftier ways of getting
them to desire products,'' he said. ``It's another good reason they
ought to be giving up their TV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual advertising is by no means the first digital
manipulation done for commercial purposes. Many TV spots already
feature dogs that ``talk'' and babies who ``sing.'' In one
hair-raising stunt, a new commercial for Mercedes-Benz by Merkley
Newman Harty in New York, part of Omnicom Group, brings Telly
Savalas back as a hirsute Kojak.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more media become digital, people are more aware
reality is being tampered with,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, media
director at the New York office of FCB Worldwide, an ad agency
owned by True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people who have grown up with digital editing in movies
are less bothered than a generation who might complain, `Hey,
they're messing with my reality,''' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, computers are constantly being used to change images in
print advertising. For example, the trade publication Advertising
Age reported this week about the doctoring of a photograph of the
volleyball player Gabrielle Reece for an ad by Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising in New York. The ad is part of a campaign that cheekily
links athletic prowess to childhood consumption of Dannon yogurt,
so a carton of the product is inserted into the photo, which shows
Ms. Reece at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the dominant role television plays in American
marketing, the growing presence of virtual ads _ in new shows and
even in reruns of old ones _ is focusing fresh attention on the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works best in sports,'' said Paul Schulman, president at
Schulman/Advanswers NY, a unit of Omnicom in New York that buys
commercial time for advertisers. ``In entertainment programs, I
believe advertisers may be getting a little too excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the impression of having a product in a scene,''
he added, ``is as strong as the impression made with a solid
30-second commercial in a program with high attention levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Wilkinson at Princeton Video Image disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   While ``it's clearly fair to say the sports applications have
caught on faster than the entertainment applications,'' he said,
``the opportunity to place advertisements where without a doubt
they have to be noticed'' means that it is only a matter of time
before virtual advertising becomes widespread in first-run and
syndicated series.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's done in good taste, as if it's part of the
program and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb,'' he added,
``people will accept it, embrace it, because it will pay for the
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual ads, however, face some real obstacles, particularly in
entertainment programming. One is the vexatious issue of rights,
particularly how to reimburse the creators and producers of series
if their work is changed. Even though virtual ads represent a new
source of revenue for the Hollywood studios that produce TV
programming, many describe the rights issue as a drawback that will
impede the widespread appearance of virtual ads.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle is the difficulty in determining if and when a
virtual ad is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Drew Carey were shown wearing designer clothes,'' said Ms.
Oppenheim, referring to the comedian whose persona as a regular guy
forms the basis for his ABC sitcom, ``there might be a credibility
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   And if virtual products were placed in, say, ``I Love Lucy,''
would they need to be in black and white because the series is? And
would the products need to look the way they did in the 1950s to
prevent viewers from being puzzled?
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ABC, CBS and NBC have decided against accepting
virtual ads for entertainment programs. At UPN _ the network
jointly owned by Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom Inc., which
tested virtual product placements in ``Seven Days'' _ ``it's still
under review,'' said spokesman Paul McGuire. ``There aren't any
plans at the moment to do it on another show.''
</P>
<P>
   So where might the entertainment breakthrough occur? Perhaps a
network will become more open-minded about considering it.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox Broadcasting Co., spokesman Jeff De Rome said that ``at
the moment, it's not allowed, because we're purists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do not rule out all future applications,'' he added.
``We're not Luddites.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steven Reddicliffe, editor in chief at TV Guide magazine in
New York, said: ``People may find it objectionable in a situation
comedy or an hourlong drama. But maybe not in a concert, a special,
an awards show, if it's subtle and consistent with the content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance it will come,'' he added, ``and faster
than we imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, changing the look of TV may simply come down to
changing attitudes among consumers as they become more accepting of
_ though still skeptical about _ the commercialization of content.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say to the viewer, `This detracts from the integrity of
advertising,''' said Ms. Oppenheim at FCB, ``the viewer is going to
say `Excuse me, there's integrity in advertising?'''

AMERICANS' INCOME UP 3.5 PERCENT IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Household incomes rose for a fourth consecutive year in 1998,
but disparities between the top- and lowest-paid Americans widened
at a time the nation is enjoying its longest peacetime economic
expansion, according to a US Census Bureau report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The median income of Americans rose 3.5 percent last year,
reaching a record high of $38,885, up from $37,581 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's income level was one dollar higher than the previous
record of $37,884 _ in inflation-adjusted dollars _ reached in 1989
before the nation went into a deep slump in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' median income, however, has not yet returned to
the levels hit during the late-1980s boom, Census data show. Median
income is not the average income but the income level at which half
of all Americans earn more and half earn less.
</P>
<P>
   While incomes nationwide rose, the number of Americans living in
poverty fell last year by 1.1 million, to 34.5 million poor in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That brings the nation's poverty rate back to about the same
level, statistically speaking, as the 13.1 percent low of 1989.
Declining poverty levels were led by the South, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best news is that these gains finally are being shared
with all groups, from the wealthiest to the poorest,'' President
Clinton said at a White House news conference after the bureau
released its annual income and poverty report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Census Bureau's report wasn't all rosy.
</P>
<P>
   The data show that US income inequality was little changed from
1997 and has steadily widened since 1980, providing yet more
evidence of what some economists contend is a growing economy of
haves and have-nots that has developed during the nation's long
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid 5 percent of Americans earned $132,199 or more;
the bottom 20 percent earned $16,116 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Americans with incomes in the top 5 percent
earn at least 8.20 times more than Americans in the bottom 20
percent _ an insignificant change from 8.22 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's income disparity is far bigger than that which
existed in 1980, when the top-paid group earned 6.8 percent more
than the bottom group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how much income inequality has grown over the last
two decades,'' said Jim St. George, executive director of the Tax
Equity Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   St. George noted the data does not include capital gains earned
from real estate or stock market portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the alliance said the median income of the
state's residents was $42,344 in 1998, slightly below the 1997
income of $42,678.
</P>
<P>
   And although national incomes have caught up with income levels
reached a decade ago, Massachusetts' incomes have not:
Massachusetts' median income last year was 10.8 percent below the
1989 level of $47,436, inflation adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Also dramatic was the drop in the number of poor Americans under
18 years of age. Their numbers fell to 13.5 million, or 18.9
percent, down from 19.9 percent in 1997. It was the first time the
poverty rate for children had been below 20 percent by a
statistically significant margin since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate among Hispanic Americans fell to 25.6 percent
from 27.1 percent, and for whites fell to 8.2 percent from 8.6
percent. The poverty rate for blacks stayed about the same in 1998,
holding at a record low of 26.1 percent reached last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate in the South fell to a record low of 13.7
percent in 1998 from 14.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between men's and women's earnings did not change
much either, with women earning 73 cents for every dollar earned by
men, compared to 74 cents in 1997. Women with a professional degree
faced the biggest pay gap, earning only 61 cents on the dollar
compared to men with a similar education.
</P>
<P>
   Median income rose in all four regions of the country. The
biggest increase was in the Midwest, where incomes climbed 4.4
percent to $40,600. Incomes increased 3 percent to $41,000 in the
West; 2.8 percent, to $40,600, in the Northeast; and 2.6 percent,
to $35,800, in the South.

COMMENTARY: INTRODUCING CAMPAIGN Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The millennium was at hand _ only three months away and
counting. Everywhere Americans turned, they saw harbingers of great
change. There was flooding in North Carolina, pestilence in New
York. The first sex controversy of the 2000 presidential race
turned out to involve Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes. The first great
issues debate centered on the advisability of getting into World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, in his new identity as Underdog, became the first vice
president ever to run away from home. Donald Trump described
himself as a natural candidate for ``the working men and women in
the center.'' Warren Beatty declared he was the Democratic Party's
liberal conscience, and also possibly a drum majorette. In Iowa,
unconfirmed reports held that it was raining toads.
</P>
<P>
   People, who said this was going to be a boring election?
</P>
<P>
   Jump-starting a candidacy that has already been remade more
times than ``A Star Is Born,'' Gore came to Manhattan to announce
that he has finally figured out how to run for president. He has
begun, he said, ``hearing the music of the campaign.'' He failed to
provide any details about exactly what his campaign sounded like _
something by John Cage? Nine Inch Nails? But he was very clear on
the new form, which would be all about ``grass roots'' and hearing
``the heartbeat of America.'' In a word, the vice president is
planning to reinvent the Listening Tour. ``I'm going to spend my
time from now on having open meetings with voters, talking about
their hopes and dreams,'' he said spunkily.
</P>
<P>
   With his overstuffed campaign hemorrhaging cash, Gore fled our
nation's capital, hoping that at least some of his expensive
consultants would be unable to track him down in his new Nashville
headquarters, particularly if he refused to pay moving expenses. He
was going to keep his ear to those grass roots, hang out at the
local Kmart, and try to figure out where all his money went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the polls count for much,'' said the man who,
until recently, employed at least five different polling
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a calf was born with two heads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Bradley was roaming around the country,
unveiling a health care proposal even more ambitious than Gore's
and calling for drastic campaign finance reform. He advocated the
licensing of all handguns and repeatedly discussed the centrality
of racial justice to his campaign. All this inspired Warren Beatty
to suggest that he might be forced to run for president because
there were no liberals in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In a much-anticipated speech this week, Beatty began to give
advice to an imaginary majorette, who was apparently a stand-in for
a 62-year-old actor torn between a desire to run for president and
a dislike of actually meeting the public or press. ``Look, drum
majorette,'' he lectured himself, ``there's no harm in thinking
about this _ however unlikely it might be. But whatever you do, go
ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people nobody speaks up for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, graves opened and statues wept real tears.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Republican side, Gary Bauer, the family values
candidate, dragged his own spouse and children to a press
conference so they could stand next to him while he announced that
he was not an adulterer. ``I have not had any physical contact with
anyone in my campaign or out of my campaign other than my wife,''
he informed the 99.999999 percent of the population that had no
inkling his monogamy had ever been called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's followers say he was forced into this humiliating
display by gossip spread by supporters of Steve Forbes. You do not
want to hear all the details of this argument. But the crux of the
squabble was that Bauer has been having unsupervised talks with a
female aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a post-Clinton-Lewinsky world, pro-family leaders cannot be
spending hour after hour after hour with young women staffers
behind closed doors,'' said Charles Jarvis, who used to be Bauer's
national campaign chairman. Jarvis quit recently and went to work
for Forbes as an unpaid adviser, thus becoming one of the few
unpaid people within a mile of the Forbes organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about Steve Forbes,'' said Jarvis, ``is that
he will never be alone with a woman. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the Mississippi River began running backward.
Babies began to speak in tongues.  &QL;

FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BLAST CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TRADE
STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heads of five major environmental organizations
Thursday blasted the Clinton administration for allegedly
abandoning environmental concerns as it prepares for this fall's
meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups that spoke out yesterday, including the
Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation and Friends of the
Earth, all claim to support global trade. But they warned that in
the interests of opening markets to American companies, the Clinton
administration is sacrificing core American values of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outraged about the behavior of the Clinton
administration in pushing trade at all costs,'' said Brent
Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the groups alleged that the United States has been
forced to weaken its protection for endangered sea turtles as a
result of WTO membership and that the United States is now
preparing to support changes to the WTO that could lead to
unfettered logging of third-world countries. They alleged that the
United States has changed clean air and endangered species laws to
comply with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until trade rules incorporate core democratic values like
environmental stewardship, new trade agreements do not deserve and
will not garner public support, and right now the Administration is
doing little to change that,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of
the National Wildlife Federation. ``The environmental agenda that
has been set forth so far for the upcoming ministerial is
inadequate, and unless it is improved and improved soon, public
skepticism will deepen.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, coming from mainstream environmental groups that
work closely with the Clinton administration on many issues, gave a
boost to the credibility of some of the more radical groups
threatening to disrupt Seattle during the WTO meeting starting Nov.
30. The environmental leaders yesterday declined an opportunity to
distance themselves from any of the organizations or any of the
disruptive tactics being threatened by groups considering the use
of civil disobedience to hinder the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forthcoming WTO summit is shaping up to be probably the
most tense confrontation between the American government and its
people perhaps since the '70s,'' said Carl Pope, executive director
of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups, who also included Defenders of
Wildlife and the Center for International Law, want the Clinton
administration to fight against WTO oversight of forestry and
fisheries, to call for an assessment of the environmental impact of
previous WTO agreements, and to alter trade rules so there is more
deference to national environmental and health standards.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky's office, which
increasingly is garnering criticism for failing to respond to
concerns about the WTO, did not return several calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the U.S. Trade Representative's web site, Barshefsky
denies that the WTO is harmful to environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each WTO member remains free to set its own appropriate levels
of environment, health and safety protections, and the United
States is committed to maintaining high levels of such
protection,'' says a document called ``America and the World Trade
Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO Agreements simply provide that the environment,
health, and safety standards chosen by governments be fair and
transparent, and not be used as disguised barriers to trade.''

APPELLATE COURT RULES STUDENTS MAY NOT BE COMPELLED TO REPORT
HAZING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In what is called the first ruling of its kind, a
Houston appellate court said Thursday that students who may have
participated in a hazing incident may not be compelled to report it
to school authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 14th Court of Appeals upheld a Brazos
County court at law that dismissed criminal charges against two
Texas A&AMP;M University students for not reporting hazing in a
precision rifle drill team.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion said forcing students to report hazing incidents in
which they may have participated violates their right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate opinion did not say anything about the specific
hazing incident or the alleged role of the two students, Dusty Hugh
Boyd and Javier Chapa.
</P>
<P>
   Brazos County Attorney James Kuboviak said he could not comment
because he considers the case ongoing. He declined to elaborate,
saying only that the incident was connected to the Fish Drill Team
disbanded in 1997 after a member complained that upperclassmen beat
him and forced him to cut his shoulder with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sinder, a legal assistant to Chapa's father, Jose, who
represented his son in the appeal, said he did ``not remember'' the
specific allegations against the two students. Jose Chapa practices
in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the boys were charged with is failure to report
themselves; in essence they are charged with a failure to
confess,'' Sinder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was the first time an appellate court examined the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A state law designed to stop hazing says it is a misdemeanor for
anyone who has ``firsthand knowledge'' of the planning or
occurrence of a hazing incident at an educational institution to
not alert authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Chapa were initially indicted on charges of
participating in the alleged hazing and assault and not reporting
the incident. Prosecutors only pursued the not reporting charge.
</P>
<P>
   Eight students were charged, but information was not available
Thursday on disposition of these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court is unable to reasonably construe (the reporting
requirement) in a manner that is not repugnant to the
constitutional protections regarding self-incrimination,'' said the
appellate opinion authored by Justice J. Harvey Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The state law has a provision that could grant immunity to those
reporting hazings, but the appellate court said this would not
provide adequate protection, since it would be up to a judge
whether to grant the immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Sinder said students should be required to report hazing if they
have no fear of being charged with participating in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the law itself was drawn up for good purposes,'' he
said. ``If you're in a fraternity and you're a pledge, and you see
several people get injured, you ought to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinder said he is not familiar with the history of the
anti-hazing law.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M officials said they did not have time Thursday to look
up the incident, but that confidentiality laws would likely prevent
their discussing the roles of particular students.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Paul Murphy and John Anderson concurred in the opinion.

STUDY SHOWS NO LINK BETWEEN WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS AND HEART DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mass.)  (th) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, doctors at the Mayo Clinic reported that 24 women
who had taken the combination of diet drugs called fen-phen had
highly unusual and grave heart valve damage. In response, the
manufacturers withdrew two of the drugs from the market, and
thousands of patients sued, asserting that the drugs had damaged
their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, scientists in Boston are publishing a study of 226
patients at a weight-loss clinic that fails to show a correlation
between fen-phen and severe heart damage. Other scientists,
however, said that the study was small and that the results were
not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Dr. Andrew J. Burger and colleagues at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, involved obese patients who had taken the
drugs as part of an investigation of their effects on weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, the drugs, phentermine combined with either
fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, were taken by an estimated six
million Americans for weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   When they learned of the Mayo Clinic findings in 1997, Burger
and his colleagues said, they felt an obligation to test all of the
patients in the weight-loss study for possible heart damage.
Although they contacted all 591 patients, only 226 returned for
echocardiograms.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, 18, or 8 percent, had leaky heart valves. Fifteen of
the 18 had leaky aortic valves, and three had leaky mitral valves.
Doctors found that the leaks had produced no symptoms and did not
require medical precautions or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Boston then found that according to a study of
more than 3,000 people, the Framingham Heart Study, heart valve
abnormalities occurred in the general population at about the same
rate as the patients in their weight-loss study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad valve disease suggested by the Mayo group has not been
found,'' Burger said. ``Maybe there is less of an association
between fen-phen and valve disease than we thought previously.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study, published in the Friday issue of The Journal of
the American College of Cardiology, could not answer the question
at the center of the fen-phen lawsuits: Did the valve damage occur
after patients took the diet drugs or was it there all along?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Devereux, a cardiologist and expert on valve disease
at Weill College of Medicine of Cornell University, said that other
studies had suggested that in some cases the damage had nothing to
do with fen-phen but that estimates had varied as to how great that
proportion is.
</P>
<P>
   Devereux, who was not involved in the Boston study, called the
research ``just one tile in the mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reassuring news to some extent to people who've taken
fen-phen,'' Devereux said. ``It should reassure them that their
heart valves aren't going to be totally blown away by this stuff.
It fits very well with my sense of things that this is not a
devastating drug that's caused serious harm to a large number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said several other researchers had also found that the drugs
seemed to have less effect on the heart than initially suspected.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp., the maker of fenfluramine, has
offered to pay more than $4 billion to settle lawsuits filed by
consumers, and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
dexfenfluramine, has offered $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, the ``phen'' part of the drug regimen, has not been
associated with health problems and remains on the market. A
spokeswoman for American Home Products said the company had no
comment on the Boston study.

UNION HEAD IS SAID TO AGREE TO RESIGN AND ADMIT FRAUD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Arthur Coia, the president of the laborers' union, one of the
nation's largest building trades unions, has agreed to resign in
October and plead guilty to fraud charges as part of a deal with
federal prosecutors, government officials said Thursday
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Coia would step down in the next few weeks
and would soon after plead guilty to charges involving his purchase
of a $450,000 Ferrari from a supplier to the 750,000-member union,
the Laborers International Union of North America. The plea
agreement, one government official said, would not result in a
prison term but would bar Coia from any future contacts with the
union.
</P>
<P>
   David Roscow, a union spokesman, denied that Coia was resigning,
insisting that Coia was the victim of leaks from government
officials out to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Coia is not resigning, he has not been indicted, and there
is no agreement,'' Roscow said. ``For the past four years, certain
law-enforcement officials have engaged in irresponsible leaks
designed to pursue their own agenda and tarnish the union and Mr.
Coia.''
</P>
<P>
   One government official said Coia might still pull out of the
plea agreement out of concern that he would be stepping down under
a cloud. Numerous times in the past, union officials said, Coia was
about to resign in the face of possible charges, but then decided
to dig in and battle the accusations against him, to help preserve
his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, some aides also hinted that Coia could
retire at any time because he has been fighting prostate cancer for
three years, although his health has improved in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The deal said to have been reached between Coia and the
government follows an anti-corruption investigation that the union
conducted under an earlier agreement with the government. In March,
the three-year investigation cleared Coia of accusations that he
had associated with members of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the union's hearing officer, Peter Vaira,
fined Coia $100,000 for a conflict of interest over the purchase of
the Ferrari. The union's in-house prosecutor, Robert D. Luskin,
discovered that Coia had bought the sports car with the help of a
Rhode Island company that leased cars to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Luskin found that Coia bought the car while the car-leasing
company continued to hold the title, letting Coia avoid more than
$40,000 in luxury taxes. This also enabled Coia to resell the
Ferrari, a limited edition model, as a new vehicle three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When Vaira fined Coia, the laborers' in-house investigators
turned over evidence about the car purchase to the U.S. attorney's
office in Boston. Coia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing
regarding the car.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Martin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in Boston,
declined to comment Thursday. Luskin also declined to comment about
Coia's plea deal, which was reported Thursday by The Daily Labor
Report published by the Bureau of National Affairs, a private
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's father, Arthur E. Coia, was secretary-treasurer of the
union, which used to be considered one of the nation's most
corrupt. Prosecutors say the elder Coia associated closely with
Raymond Patriarca Jr., New England's long-time crime boss.

 Seymour Topping, former managing editor of The New York Times, was
a reporter for The Associated Press in China in 1949.

 By SEYMOUR TOPPING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 22, 1949, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist capital,
Nanjing, lay prostrate before Communist troops swarming across the
Yangtze River in their climactic offensive of the Chinese civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the preceding months, the former imperial capital of
Beiping (today known as Beijing) had surrendered to the Communists.
Chiang had retreated to Taiwan, taking with him the government
reserve of gold and silver bullion, national art treasures, his
elite army divisions and air force units.
</P>
<P>
   As the Communist troops approached Nanjing, where I was a
reporter for The Associated Press, it was in pandemonium. At the
airfield, frenzied Nationalist officials and the wealthy fought to
get aboard the last planes out.
</P>
<P>
   I watched in disbelief as a Nationalist general shouted orders
to soldiers to load his piano and other furniture abroad a military
plane. Mayor Teng Chieh, trying to escape with a car loaded with
300 million yuan from the city's treasury, was beaten by his
chauffeur and bodyguards, and his legs broken.
</P>
<P>
   As looters ravaged the city and time bombs left behind by the
Nationalists exploded at key installations, apprehensive diplomats
huddled in their barricaded embassies. A Peace Preservation
Committee of leading citizens and Communist underground workers
sought unsuccessfully to restrain the mobs as shooting broke out
and dead lay on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The palatial residences of Nationalist officials were the main
targets of thousands of poor who had swarmed up from the city's
slums. An old woman, her gray hair pulled back into a bun, wearing
a ragged black tunic and hobbling on tiny feet bound in the old
custom, happily carried off four elaborately embroidered cushions.
A grinning soldier, throwing away his rifle, gingerly made off with
a lamp in each hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hours of April 23, the massive gates of the walled
city of 1.2 million were ajar, looters continued to roam the
streets and flames reddened the skies.
</P>
<P>
   The city had been abandoned by its army garrison. The municipal
police had fled. At the dingy Cairo Hotel, the Peace Preservation
Committee headquarters, I learned that the Communists were expected
to enter through the Northwest Gate.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 a.m., accompanied by Bill Kuan, a Chinese reporter for
Agence France-Presse, I drove my jeep north along the Zhongshan Lu
thoroughfare toward the gate. Suddenly there was a shout of
``Stop!'' and two Communist soldiers with rifles converged on us
from the sides of the road. They were the advance patrol of the
column that was to enter Nanjing. They led us back to the gate, and
there I watched as the first Communist troops entered the capital.
</P>
<P>
   A Communist officer, who was urging his exhausted troops
forward, impatiently ordered me and Kuan to drive back into the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Gratefully I drove to the telegraph office, where, moments
before the cables were cut off, I was able to file a 60-word
bulletin to The Associated Press on the Communist troops' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Calm was not restored until Communist troops, welcomed by
banner-waving university students, completed their takeover of the
city and planted their flag atop Chiang Kai-shek's Taiping Palace.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, thousands of Communist troops in their yellow-brown
uniforms and flat peaked caps sat in orderly lines along the
sidewalks, listening to talks by political commissars and singing
revolutionary songs. People from nearby houses brought hot water
and tea for them to drink.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon three Nationalist bombers, in the first of many
raids over the next months, strafed the airfield, trying
unsuccessfully to detonate fuel and ammunition dumps.
</P>
<P>
   My second encounter with the Communist troops that day went less
well. Soldiers entered the Associated Press compound and became
excited at finding me at a typewriter beside a shortwave radio. For
the next two days, I was confined to the compound, with soldiers
posted at the gate. But then they disappeared and I, like the few
other Western reporters remaining in Nanjing, was free to move
about and file articles.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the prices of daily necessities stabilized. Most
shops reopened, as did dance halls. Beggars disappeared from the
streets. Censorship was imposed on the local newspapers and radio.
</P>
<P>
   University students, enthusiastic about the new government,
gathered in public assemblies to sing songs that commissars had
taught them, with lines like, ``Reactionaries who exploit the
people deserve to be cut into thousands of pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, the U.S. ambassador, J. Leighton Stuart, left Nanjing
after the State Department rebuffed Mao Tse-tung's overtures for
diplomatic recognition, declaring that the United States would
retain ties with the Nationalist government on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And it was also in August that people began grumbling about the
new Communist administration. Taxes had risen sharply even as the
city's commercial life withered. The local press reported of
sabotage and assassination of Communist officials in the
surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Ideological strictures on the universities and other spheres of
intellectual life tightened. In schools, factories and municipal
offices, study groups were formed to discuss Maoist theory and
participants were required to confess ideological sins. As the
``re-education'' campaign intensified, there was a decided change
in the private attitudes of many liberal intellectuals who had at
first welcomed the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   This change was visible in the attitude of J.C. Jao, my Chinese
assistant in the AP office. Jao, a graduate of the University of
Missouri journalism school in his late 40s, had taught at
universities and been editor of The Tsingtao Herald. Like many of
his liberal friends, he was impressed by the good conduct of the
victorious Communist troops and caught up in the talk of China's
``liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time I left Nanjing for Shanghai in September,
leaving him in charge of the office, he had become distrustful of
the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Beiping, now renamed Beijing (or northern
capital), was restored as China's capital, and it was there that
Mao, on Oct. 1, proclaimed the establishment of a People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Some months later, Jao said that he had been interrogated and
sent on an indoctrination course. He said that he was resisting
taking a job with the Communists writing anti-American propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1951 the Communists mounted a campaign for ``the
punishment of counterrevolutionary offenses.'' It led to the
executions over the next two years of an estimated 1 million to 3
million people. Jao was among the first to be shot.

 &HT;    6 bodies pulled from Ala. river
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lamar Junior Stackhouse paid $3,000 for his burgundy,
1986 Chevrolet Caprice with chrome custom rims. He bought it on a
Friday, his father recalls. The seller drove nearly 150 miles from
Tallahassee, Fla., to Stackhouse's home in Enterprise, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Stackhouse picked up five friends. They drove 25
miles west, mostly on Ala. 134, across Ballard's Bridge, and into
the town of Opp for an evening at the Hideaway nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   They left the Hideaway in the wee hours Sunday morning _ then
vanished into the pre-dawn darkness of rural south Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   That was in May. There was no trace. Stackhouse was still
missing on his birthday, Sept. 3, when he would have turned 26.
Some residents speculated that the six black men and women had been
abducted as part of a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the NAACP urged a more aggressive search. On the
group's national hotline, a spokeswoman read a statement attributed
to NAACP President Kweisi Mfume that said, ``An investigation by
the FBI is certainly warranted because of the circumstances
surrounding this case, and Alabama's history of civil rights
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investigators found the four-door Caprice
submerged in 9 feet of water in the Pea River near Ballard's
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Myron Williams, chief sheriff's deputy for Coffee
County, Ala., said, ``The evidence looks to be just an accident.
Just went off the road and into the river.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Alabama Bureau of Investigation said
Thursday that initial forensic tests show no evidence of foul play
and that the wrecked car displays signs ``consistent with an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that is of comfort to Woodrow Stackhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after his son disappeared, he rode up and down Ala.
134 searching for an accident site.
</P>
<P>
   He found tire tracks under Ballard's Bridge, four feet from the
river. No skid marks. Just tracks. Stackhouse said he went to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine how I feel, knowing it was there for four
months?'' Stackhouse said Thursday. ``It was hard. It was real
hard. I feel bad that I was there three days after the accident.''
The driver failed to handle a turn just before the bridge and
rolled down a steep embankment, killing everyone, Sheriff Ben
Moates said.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow Ballard's Bridge, which does not meet current
standards, will be replaced, Gov. Don Siegelman announced last week
at the Pea River. Four people died last year on a crash on the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, divers and cadaver-searching dogs searched the same
area but found nothing. The water was 10 feet higher and moving
more swiftly at the time. At least three other times, divers
searched nearby rivers while other officials flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back over the bridge hundreds of times,'' Williams
said. ``We were just starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers went back into the Pea River on Wednesday and spotted a
Chevy with wide tires. A wrecker was called. It took more than
three hours to pull the car up a 20-foot embankment. Four bodies
were found in the car. Groans and prayers filled the air as the car
creeped up the river bank.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, divers found two more bodies in the river.
Investigators are analyzing dental records.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends anguished for months over the missing:
Stackhouse, Eula Jossett Lee, 27, and Angela Roberts Young, 26, all
of Enterprise; Valerie Jones McCoy, 27, of Level Plains; James
Anthony Reynolds, 28, of Webb; and Tamara Monique Ward, 22, of
Ozark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's closure but it's heartbreaking,'' said Cliff
Johnson, whose wife is the aunt of one of the missing. ``It's been
a mental strain the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Johnson was a cousin of two of the missing women.
``The girls taught us to make peanut butter cookies,'' she said.
Despite signs of an accident, Woodrow Stackhouse wonders if
something worse happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone did something to him,'' Stackhouse said. ``My
son just bought that car. Maybe someone was after who had owned the
car'' before.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Mobile Register, which cited legal records,
Lamar Junior Stackhouse was unemployed and had an extensive
criminal history and had been convicted of dealing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But Stackhouse said he didn't think his son's past had anything
to with his death. In recent weeks, Lamar Stackhouse talked about
returning to junior college to learn about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a nice, fun-loving person,'' Stackhouse said.
``And now, a part of me is gone.''

SEATTLE GEARS UP TO DEAL WITH ANTICIPATED WTO PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fire trucks will be strategically placed downtown.
Ambulances will be ready. Dogs will sniff for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And in buildings near the convention center, officers in riot
gear will be waiting, watching and hoping they are not called.
</P>
<P>
   If they are, something has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The security plan for the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle is still a work in progress, and officials, of course, are
reluctant to release specifics.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is known: The city will spend $6 million on
security during the WTO conference. Eighty percent of Seattle's
police force _ virtually any officer who might come in contact with
protesters _ will go through nine hours of training. And several
downtown streets will be blocked off during some of the busiest
shopping days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The city's police and fire departments, the State Patrol and a
dozen federal agencies _ from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to the State Department's Diplomatic Security Division _
have been working on the security plan for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that time has been spent looking at what happened at
other WTO conferences. During a 1998 meeting in Geneva, for
example, the Jamaican ambassador's car was overturned and several
blocks of the city were damaged during a riot.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, organized labor, angry over WTO treaties it says has
taken away union jobs, has rented the Kingdome for a Nov. 30
protest. Environmentalists, decrying the organization's
environmental policies, plan rallies, too.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO conference runs from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3 and will be the
largest trade conference held on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   So there is a plan, exquisitely detailed with pages of ``What
ifs?'' and ``What thens?'' It deals with riots and chemical or
biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sitting in on some of the meetings,'' said Greg
Petersen, with the city's budget office. ``And with some of the
contingencies they're planning on, I don't know how these guys
sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are inevitable, so police are trying to reach them
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to talk to them beforehand,'' said Seattle Police
Capt. Brent Wingstrand, who is helping coordinate the department's
WTO plans. ``We'd like to see if we can accommodate them _ do they
want a photo opportunity? _ in a way that no one goes to jail and
everyday citizens' lives aren't disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the crowds, Seattle will shift officers in its
patrol division to 12-hour days. And patrol will ``borrow'' from
other units, such as burglary and vice. Detectives will be put back
in uniform for the duration of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies will see their resources stretched by the
conference, too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each dignitary requires a motorcycle escort. That
means all of Seattle's motorcycle officers, all of King County's
motorcycle officers and all of the State Patrol's local motorcycle
officers will be busy. And they have contingency agreements with
other municipalities to provide more motorcycles and officers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Police and State Patrol drivers have undergone Secret
Service and FBI training learning how to defend a motorcade from
attack. And there will be more State Patrol officers on area
highways.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can compete with Tukwila, which has to provide
security for a Nov. 30 dinner at the Museum of Flight at Boeing
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff's department, which is responsible for
security at Boeing Field, will lend a hand, but Tukwila will be
taking the brunt of the museum's security.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seattle, Tukwila's 75-officer department will convert its
follow-up units to uniform patrol to augment security at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to use everybody,'' Tukwila Police Capt.
Doug Patrlow said. ``We're still in the planning stages, but I
think you'll find us looking for support from the other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The security for the Museum of Flight gala underscores the
workings between federal and local law enforcement agencies, and it
provides a glimpse of the potential threats each side must deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   Local police will primarily face protesters. The federal
agencies are concerned about terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, a federal explosives team will sweep the
venue before the gala. After they pronounce the area secure, the
local police _ King County and Tukwila _ will then try to make sure
nothing happens at the event.
</P>
<P>
   If the gala's attendees are heads of state _ perhaps President
Clinton or Cuban President Fidel Castro, as has been rumored _ the
Secret Service will have protective details working.
</P>
<P>
   If the attendees are lower than heads of state but still
sufficiently high-ranking, agents from the State Department's
Diplomatic Security division will provide security.
</P>
<P>
   And some delegations, such as South Korea and Japan, will
probably bring their own security forces with them.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around during the conference won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where many of the
delegates are coming in, will be especially busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to encourage delegates not to engage in media
opportunities on the premises,'' Port of Seattle spokesman Bob
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get everyone involved through the airport as fast
possible to make as few problems as we can for our regular airport
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing the convention center means snarling Seattle's
endemically bad traffic. It means blocking off streets and manning
the tunnel beneath the convention center to make sure no one parks
an explosive-filled truck there.
</P>
<P>
   The event will stretch the city's emergency services, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at downtown as a `city-within-a-city,''' said
Assistant Fire Chief A.D. Vickery. ``So we added more fire and EMS
staff there.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional fire and rescue equipment will be stationed
within a set radius _ the exact distance is yet to be determined _
of the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The units, staffed by otherwise off-duty personnel, will be
mobile, and they form the heart of the fire department's part of
the security plan: The Incident Response Team.
</P>
<P>
   The fire department will set up a 24-hour command center near
the conference, in part to monitor fire alarm boards at the hotels
where dignitaries are staying.
</P>
<P>
   Scaled-down versions of the department's hazardous-material and
technical-rescue teams will in the area, too, and the department
will keep two trailers full of specialized rescue and firefighting
equipment close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   How much will all of this cost?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $6 million the city will spend, the county
sheriff's department will have to ask the King County Council for
between $600,000 and $1 million to cover expenses, said John
Urquhart, a sheriff's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope the federal government might reimburse the city
and county for some of the expenses. The Seattle Host Committee _
which brought the conference here in the first place _ has already
committed $1.5 million to reimburse various agencies their public
safety costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't hope to get everything back,'' said Roger
Ramsey, the fire department's assistant chief for special
operations. ``It's like when you throw a party and invite the
neighbors, you have to pay for some punch and chips to serve
them.''

</P>
<P>
   by Frank McCourt
</P>
<P>
   Personal history
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, $26
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, a young Irish immigrant earned his degree from New York
University and landed a teaching job at McKee Vocational and
Technical High School on Staten Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   His students were not scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teacher, ain'tcha gonna take the attendance?'' was Frank
McCourt's welcome to his first class. He inherited his charges
midterm, after their instructor, one Miss Mudd, abruptly resigned
the instant she glimpsed freedom in the person of her successor and
offered her parting advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a good view of New York Harbor from here, and Monday
morning if these kids aren't driving you crazy you'll see a big
ship sailing by and that'll be me on the deck, waving and smiling,
because there's two things I never want to see again in my life,
with God's help, Staten Island and kids. Monsters, monsters. Look
at 'em. You'd be better off working with chimpanzees in the Bronx
Zoo. What's this? Nineteen and fifty-eight. How did I ever last?
You'd need to be Joe Louis. So, good luck, son. You're gonna need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The luck is his students'. Before he is promoted to the city's
elite public high school, he has thrown out the official curriculum
and the kids are reading Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But luck is hardly for McCourt. Anyone familiar with ``Angela's
Ashes,'' McCourt's 1996 memoir, could tell you that. His first
volume, which won the Pulitzer Prize, recounted his birth in
Brooklyn to Irish immigrants and his hardscrabble childhood back
amid the streets of Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to have read McCourt's previous volume to
enjoy `` 'Tis'' _ only to enjoy a life recited in rhythm, employing
language from both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As if building one of the stone walls found on his rocky Irish
native land, McCourt piles word after word, end on end, one atop
another. In the end, the structure is so honest and tangible, so
finely crafted, that you feel every rough edge and smooth, rounded
surface and know that they are real.
</P>
<P>
   This telling commences in 1949, aboard the HMS Irish Oak out of
Cork.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were to be 14 passengers on the ship but one canceled
and we had to sail with an unlucky number. The first night out the
captain stood up at dinner and welcomed us. He laughed and said he
wasn't superstitious over the number of passengers but since there
was a priest among us wouldn't it be lovely if His Reverence would
say a prayer to come between us and all harm. The priest was a
plump little man, born in Ireland, but so long in his Los Angeles
parish he had no trace of an Irish accent. When he got up to say a
prayer and blessed himself four passengers kept their hands in
their laps and that told me they were Protestants. My mother used
to say you could spot Protestants a mile away by their reserved
manner. The priest asked Our Lord to look down on us with pity and
love, that whatever happened on these stormy seas we were ready to
be enfolded forever in His Divine Bosom.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon disembarking, McCourt seeks work. A worldly priest steers
him to the local Democratic Party headquarters _ (''another vote
for the party if the kid here ever votes,'' his benefactor
explains), where he receives a reference to the Palm Court Hotel.
With his Irish brogue, his appalling, inflamed eyes and cursory
schooling, his prospects are limited to a notch above the kitchen
jobs destined for Puerto Ricans. But his boss, Mr. Carey, tells
McCourt that his future is unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells me keep my eye on the ball, don't forget to take a
shower every day, this is America, stay sober, stick with your own
kind of people, you can't go wrong with the Irish, go easy with the
drink, and in a year I might rise to the rank of porter or busboy
and make tips and, who knows, rise up to be a waiter and wouldn't
that be the end of all my worries. He says anything is possible in
America. Look at me, I have four suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Carey is pretty much right.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the Army, McCourt decides to enroll at New York
University. Despite never attending high school, he promotes
himself as college material because he has read ``Crime and
Punishment'' and ``Moby-Dick.'' He is approved for two courses, a
light load that allows him to keep working in meat warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in heaven, and the first thing to do is buy the required
textbooks, cover them with the purple and white NYU book jackets so
that people in the subway will look at me admiringly.''
</P>
<P>
   College is more like purgatory. It's easy to forget that McCourt
wasn't far removed from that time and place when signs declared
``No Irish Need Apply.'' A literature professor spots his
so-obvious Irish name and humiliates him for confessing a love for
the writing of Jonathan Swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he tells the class that my essay is a perfect example of a
simplistic approach to literature, that while `Gulliver's Travels'
may be enjoyed as a children's story it is important in English
literature, not Irish, ladies and gentlemen, for its satiric
brilliance.'' As class ends we slink with McCourt down six flights
of stairs ``so I don't have to be in the elevator with students who
might despise me for enjoying `Gulliver's Travels' for the wrong
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   We revel with him when later he earns praise for the same
undisguised appreciation of great storytelling. And again when, at
their first chance meeting, his future wife (an Episcopalian)
``passes and gives me a little smile that I wonder why God is so
kind to me that He lets me have a smile from the loveliest girl in
all of NYU.'' And we want to throttle him when his irresponsible
drinking threatens to wreck the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt provokes that range of emotions the only way a writer
can: with stories that carry the ring of truth. The pealing seems
likely to call as many readers to this volume as responded to his
first installment.

 &HT;    Babbitt praises Ga. governor on environment
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Standing on the bank of the Chattahoochee River in
Atlanta on Thursday, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called Gov.
Roy Barnes' efforts to protect Georgia's green space a ``model for
all over this land.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also urged support for federal legislation that would
provide millions of dollars to build new parks and protect more
land in Georgia and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is calling for counties to protect at least 20 percent of
their land from development and is pushing for a 180-mile-long
greenway on each side of the Chattahoochee from Helen to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Barnes on Thursday on the river's edge, Babbitt
said he expects green space protection will be a major issue in
next year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   He said securing full funding of the so-called Land and Water
Conservation Fund by Congress this year is one of his top
priorities. The fund, created in 1965, includes money from the sale
of federal offshore oil and gas leases. Most of the fund was
intended for preserving the nation's natural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   If the fund were fully operational, Georgia would receive almost
$10.3 million a year. Since 1965, Georgia has received $66.5
million from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of the Land and Water Conservation Fund has never
been fully kept,'' Babbitt said. ``It was to provide almost $1
billion a year through direct federal purchase and through grants
to states that could then be used to protect land and open space.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress has usually approved less than one-third of
the money available. One reason is that some legislators,
particularly those from Western states, have objected to the
government's acquiring more land.
</P>
<P>
   Full funding of the fund is a major component of the ``Lands
Legacy'' initiative proposed in January by President Clinton. His
initiative would provide almost $1 billion a year in federal money
to protect a variety of sites, historic spaces and open lands
across the nation. It also would make available more funds for
parks and for wildlife conservation and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills now pending in Congress would increase funds for
preservation and conservation. One bill, the so-called Conservation
and Reinvestment Act of 1999, would provide about $22 million a
year to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislators will hammer out a final version from the
various bills.

</P>
<P>
   NY-JAZZ-MUSICIANS (New York) _ In the last few years, the New
York downtown music scene has undergone a startling mutation,
albeit one not immediately audible to the innocent ear. Clubs like
the Knitting Factory and Tonic stillfeature many of the usual
musicians, some of them now approaching 50. The music has largely
retained its brash, collage-driven spirit. But beneath the
appearance of continuity, a paradigm shift has emerged. Once known
for their rootless cosmopolitanism, downtown musicians are now
passionately searching for roots _ not necessarily their own. By
Adam Shatz. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TERENCE-STAMP-FILMS (subslug) (London) _ At the age of 60,
white-haired and soft-spoken, Terence Stamp has evidently come to
terms with that other Terence Stamp who became an overnight star in
Peter Ustinov's 1962 movie version of ``Billy Budd,'' that
high-living younger self who was a fixture in English tabloids as
an icon of the Swinging '60s. But he still can't help wondering
why, when the 1970s arrived, he vanished from the screen. Now, in
Steven Soderbergh's new movie, ``The Limey,'' which opens in New
York on Friday, the young and the old Terence Stamps have been
brought together in a novel way. ``The Limey,'' which is slang for
a Briton, has Stamp playing Dave Wilson, a tough Cockney ex-con who
travels to Los Angeles to avenge what he believes is the covered-up
murder of his daughter, Jennifer. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOYS-DON'T-CRY-FILM (Undated) _ Most actresses know that their
careers are largely dependent on their looks. But last year, Hilary
Swank had to worry about her appearance both as actress and actor.
``Its absolutely amazing what happens when a woman chops her hair
off,'' said Ms. Swank, who cut hers to play a woman passing as a
young man in the film ``Boys Don't Cry.'' The movie, opening on
Friday, tells the tale of Teena Brandon, a young woman from
Nebraska who abandoned her identty to embark on a new life as
Branda Teena. A true story that ended in 1993 when she was murdered
by two male friends enraged by the deception. By Ted Loos.

   DREAM-OF-LIFE-VIDEO (subslug) (Undated) _ ``Sergei, you are a
true Bolshevik,'' Joseph Stalin is said to have exclaimed to Sergei
Eisenstein, clapping him on the back, after viewing ``Alexander
Nevsky.'' In the late 1930s one appreciated that kind of reaction
from Stalin, and it certainly was opportune for a director whose
prior lack of enthusiasm for the state and the Communist revolution
had stalled his career for almost 10 years. With ``Alexander
Nevsky,'' his first film with sound, Eisenstein climbed back into
official favor. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).

<P>
   DAME-EDNA-THEATER (New York) _ In previews at the Booth Theater,
where it opens on Oct. 17, ``Dame Edna'': The Royal Tour,'' is the
Broadway debut of a cross-dressing character whose ``natural
wisteria'' hair color, and penchant for gladioli and calling her
audience possums are more famous in Britain and her homeland of
Australia than the drag queen Ru Paul is here. Although less
well-known in America than in any other English-speaking part of
the world, Dame Edna Everage has had no trouble so far drawing a
celebrated audience. By Frank DeCaro. (Moved).

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS-DANCING (New York) _ In the last couple of seasons, the
musical theater, both in New York (``Fosse,'' ``Footloose'') and in
London (``Oklahoma!,'' ``Swan Lake'') seems to have rediscovered
dancing _ not as an ornament or a practical interlude to entertain
the audience while the actors or singers change costume, but as a
resource in itself that can help advance the themes or story of a
show, or, in the cases of ``Fosse'' and ``Swan Lake,'' embody them
fully. By Mindy Aloff. (Moved). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LIMON-DANCE (New York) _ As a dance student at the Juilliard
School in the 1960s, Carla Maxwell studied with both Jose Limon and
Antony Tudor, two of the century's seminal choreographers. Aside
from their Juilliard connection, the two _ the first a pillar of
midcentury American modern dance, the other a master of subtle,
psychologically astute classical ballets _ were not likely to find
their paths crossing. But they will now. Works by these
choreographers will share a program when the Limon Dance Company,
of which Ms. Maxwell is the artistic director, comes to the Joyce
Theater starting Tuesday for a two-week season. The troupe will
perform Tudor's 1937 masterwork ``Dark Elegies'' alongside Limon's
``There Is a Time,'' from 1956. By Susan Reiter. (Moved).

<P>
   KERNIS-MUSIC-AWARD (Undated) _ The track record of some of the
Pulitzer Prize awards for music in recent years seems destined to
guarantee even greater bafflement for future auditors. Even now,
who can fail to be stumped by the 1990 prize awarded to Mel
Powell's ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra''
over John Corigliano's greatly esteemed (and widely performed)
Symphony No. 1? Notwithstanding the occasional inscrutable
decisions, few could disagree with the 1998 Pulitzer Prize awarded
to Aaron Jay Kernis for his String Quartet No. 2 ``musica
instrumentalis''. As performed by the Lark Quartet on a recent
Arabesque disc (Z6727) coupling the award-winning work with its
predecessor, Kernis's String Quartet No. 2 is revealed as one of
the finest American string quartets written in the last two
decades, and, perhaps, much longer than that. By Lawrence A.
Johnson. (Moved).

   JAMMESES-PHOTOGS (Paris) _ After a series of gifts and sales of
their treasures to the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Musee d'Orsay
in Paris as well as to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Santa Monica,
Calif. (now in Los Angeles), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, Andre Jammes and his wife, Marie-Therese have sent to
auction much of what is left of their ``magnificent obsession,''
said Philippe Garner, the director of the photography department at
Sotheby's in London. Thirty of the most important photographs and
albums are on exhibit through Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York. The
sale of the collection, 2,000 images in 280 lots, will take place
on Oct. 27 in London. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ One of the pleasures of the
relatively young field of photographic history is that discoveries
are still possible and neglected areas can be filled in. Right now
New York is playing host to three shows of the photography of Daido
Moriyama, born in 1938 and one of Japan's most respected and
influential contemporary photographers. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ARISTOCRATS (Undated) _ The ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater''
version of ``Aristocrats'' is (a three-part production beginning
next Sunday night on PBS). An era of powdered wigs, corsets,
bustles and towering plumed headdresses may seem an unlikely place
to discover strong, intelligent women taking charge of their lives,

NASA BLAMES DESTRUCTION OF MARS PROBE ON MEASUREMENT MIX-UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An embarrassing mix-up with its aerospace contractor over the
use of English and metric units of measurement led to the
navigational errors that caused last week's loss of the $125
million Mars Climate Orbiter, NASA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials believe the probe broke apart or overheated in
the atmosphere Sept. 23 as it was maneuvering into orbit around
Mars after a near 10-month journey from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Errors that crept into maneuvering commands, based on
discrepancies from the two systems of measurement, allowed the
spacecraft to sweep within 37 miles of the Martian surface rather
the intended 93 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The errors were repeated throughout four major maneuvers and
other smaller steerings during the Climate Orbiter's journey, which
began with a Dec. 11, 1998, liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Previously, NASA had believed a one-time error in the last of the
major maneuvers, Sept. 15, was responsible for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's disclosure, the space agency embraced
responsibility for the mistake, rather than haggle over sharing
blame with Lockheed Martin Astronautics, the Denver-based aerospace
company that builds its Mars probes and furnishes mission support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have caught this,'' said Carl Pilcher, NASA's
Washington-based chief scientist for solar system exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to recognize and correct this simple error has
had major implications,'' said Edward Stone, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, the Pasadena, Calif.-based facility that
developed the spacecraft and served as its mission control.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Mars Polar Lander, a companion spacecraft
similarly launched Jan. 3, depends on a close working relationship.
Polar Lander is in the home stretch of a voyage to soft land at the
planet's South Pole and dig for signs of frozen water in the
subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the space agency could not rule out the prospect of
a similar failure to convert the English metric units provided by
Lockheed Martin Astronautics  &UR;  &LR; into the metric units used by JPL to
communicate with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our highest priority. We are checking it out as
aggressively as humanly possible,'' Pilcher said. ``You can correct
a navigational error almost at any time until you arrive at your
target. So if there has been any error made in the Mars Polar
Lander, we have plenty of time between now and arrival at Mars to
correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin did not respond to requests for comment, but
acknowledged a role in the loss late Thursday in comments to The
Associated Press. ``We should have had them in metric units,'' said
Noel Hinners, the company's vice president for flight systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the space agency, the mix-up was over Lockheed
Martin's use of pounds of force, an English unit used in the U.S.
corporate aerospace community, to calculate steering commands for
the Climate Orbiter, and JPL's use of Newtons of force, a metric
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the two facilities managed to work successfully to
steer the Mars Global Surveyor successfully into orbit around the
Red Planet in 1997. Global Surveyor's cameras are currently
photographing the rugged Martian terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigative panels at JPL and a third independent review
panel, which NASA administrator Dan Goldin will soon name, will
determine to uncover the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same people, the same contractor,'' said Pilcher.
``It worked flawlessly. So why didn't it work here.? We don't
know.``
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We have a good track record for success, and the
reason is not because people don't make mistakes. It's because we
have all the systems, processing and software for checks and
balances. All of that stuff is designed to detect human error, to
correct it before it does any harm. What happened in this case is
that all of those checks and balances and systems failed us. We
didn't recognize the error, and we didn't correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has invested $356 million in the Climate
Orbiter and Polar Lander missions as part of a longer term,
multiprobe effort to determine whether the cold, arid climate of
Mars was once warm and wet enough to host even primitive life.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter was to function as a weather satellite
measuring cloud, dust, temperature and wind speed changes in the
atmosphere throughout a full Martian year. It was also to serve as
the primary communications relay between the Polar Lander and the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander, however, is equipped to communicate directly
with the Earth or through the already orbiting Global Surveyor.

 &HT;    Courts' rulings influence admissions policies across nation
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ University of Georgia President Michael Adams plunged
UGA into the unfriendly waters of the federal court system with his
decision Thursday to continue using race in the school's admissions
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently
struck down racial preference programs involving government
contracting and hiring. And the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in an influential ruling in 1996, rejected racial preferences in
admissions at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to consider the University of Texas'
appeal in the case filed by white plaintiff Cheryl Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have referred to the ``Hopwood effect'' as
universities across the country altered, or abandoned, race-based
admissions policies. Even though the 5th Circuit has no
jurisdiction over Georgia, former state Attorney General Michael
Bowers had asked the university system to treat the ruling as a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 21 years since the Supreme Court directly addressed
a challenge to racial preferences in college admissions. In 1978, a
deeply divided court ruled as unlawful a racial quota system used
by the University of California-Davis medical school. The school
had reserved certain entrance slots for minorities, a program
challenged by rejected applicant Allan Bakke, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   But the late Justice Lewis Powell, writing for a 5-4 majority,
said that ``some'' consideration could be given to race to help
achieve a diverse campus.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in his speech Thursday to the University Council, seized
on that precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As was held by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Bakke case ... we
believe that using race as a factor in admissions, but not as a
sole determining factor, is a legitimate approach in Georgia,'' the
UGA president said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Bolden of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said he believes
UGA's admissions program would survive a Bakke legal test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is certainly a program that is fully consistent
with the law out there today,'' he said. ``This is an affirmative
action program which is carefully crafted and specifically drawn to
provide opportunities to have a diverse campus.''
</P>
<P>
   UGA's admissions program is not a quota, Bolden maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ensures that the school obtains highly qualified students
of all races,'' he said. ``And given the history of this
institution and given the significance of having an
African-American presence at this institution, the admissions
program is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``history'' is the fact that UGA did not admit black
students until January 1961, when Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne
Hunter-Gault integrated the school, under court order.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Levey, director of legal and public affairs for the
Washington-based Center for Individual Rights, noted that the
philosophical composition of the Supreme Court has changed greatly
since the Bakke decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a decision like Bakke is the best the liberals can
hope for,'' he said. ``And I don't even think they would get
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Individual Rights represents white plaintiffs who
are suing the University of Michigan's race-based admissions
policies. A trial is not expected until next year. Lee Parks, the
Atlanta lawyer heading the case against UGA, said the university's
admission policies create racial set-asides that courts have
consistently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Avant Edenfield, who is presiding over the
case, already has strongly criticized UGA's racial preference
policy. Any appeals of Edenfield's eventual ruling would go to the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and, possibly, to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been to both of those places,'' said Parks, who has
successfully argued reverse discrimination voting rights cases
before both courts. ``These courts are not sympathetic to this
issue. They call it racial balancing, that's their buzzword. And if
UGA's plan can be reduced to a racial balancing approach, and I
believe it can, then it's out.''

 U.S. TO REVISIT ACCUSATIONS OF A MASSACRE BY G.I.s IN '50

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretary of defense ordered the Army on
Thursday to undertake a new and thorough review of reports that
U.S. soldiers killed Korean civilians at the beginning of the
Korean War nearly 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an account published on Wednesday by The Associated Press, a
dozen American veterans confirmed accusations by Korean villagers
that in July 1950, hundreds of refugees were killed by U.S. gunfire
under a bridge near No Gun Ri in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen wrote to Louis Caldera, the
secretary of the Army, asking him to ``devote whatever resources
are appropriate to accomplish this review as thoroughly and as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing, Caldera said Thursday that the AP
investigation provided ``new information that demanded that it be
looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These reports are of course very disturbing,'' Caldera said.
``Earlier this year our Army center for military history did a
search and found nothing in the official records that substantiates
the claims that U.S. Army soldiers perpetrated such massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he appreciated that Cohen had instructed
the Army to examine all the available information and evidence, and
``get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of South Korea announced Thursday that it would
start its own investigation, said Hebeom Kim, a spokesman at the
Korean Embassy here. He said South Korea might ask the United
States for declassified military documents.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said that the new review would take at least one year
and would encompass all historical records, including those at the
National Archives, which were the source of much of the new
evidence uncovered by the AP, as well as interviews with U.S.
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it would not excuse the alleged acts, history records
that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were very chaotic,''
Caldera said. ``U.S. soldiers, although they fought with great
courage under very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and
ill-equipped to fight because of the large reduction in resources
available to the military for training and equipment following
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 30 South Korean survivors and relatives of the victims
filed a suit asking for compensation for the incident, but the suit
was rejected on a technicality. The claimants had described a
three-day period of killing, saying that U.S. planes had strafed
hundreds of refugees who were fleeing from North Korean troops,
leaving about 100 people dead. The survivors fled under the bridge,
where they said they were pinned by U.S. troops who shot and killed
almost all the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, some of the U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri
said they had been ordered to fire on the refugees because their
commanders believed that North Korean troops, disguised as
peasants, had infiltrated the refugee column and were shooting at
the Americans.

COMMENTARY: ST. JOSEPH'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beginning of the amateur video shows the first day of
worship in the handsome new church _ the congregation taking
communion from the Catholic priests. The film is dated Feb. 14,
1999.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then it flows without a break into a section filmed April 27,
1999. The film lurches as the person with the camera, sometimes
hiding in a building across the street, struggles to show what
remains of the church.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A metal dinosaur appears. Its huge black iron head tears out
windows, smashes great holes into walls. What's that continuing
thump-thump in the background? No explanation until laborers are
seen with sledgehammers pounding floors into splinters. The head
continuously crashes itself into what had been St. Joseph's Roman
Catholic Church, in Fuzhou, province of Fujian, People's Republic
of China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built over five years with the muscle and love of the
worshipers, and dollars and coins of their relatives in America,
the church in one day has become rubble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I got and saw the film on Wednesday, while hundreds of top
American and European business executives were attending a Shanghai
``economic forum,'' sponsored by Fortune and its owner, Time
Warner, with the blessing and manipulation of the Politburo, to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Mao's victory, and the decades of
despotism by massacre that followed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything pertinent to trade was on the agenda, except the
rights of Chinese. The CEOs and company presidents, and Fortune and
Time Warner, either judged these rights to have no value in any
balance sheet, were foot-kissing the Politburo, or both. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My disgust turned to shame for America when I read Seth Faison's
story in The New York Times about how the head of Time Warner,
which also owns CNN, gave the Chinese president a bust of Lincoln
and praised him for his parlor trick of reciting the Gettysburg
Address!  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the American International Group, an insurance
giant, said it was not human rights China needed, but food. Chinese
do have enough food, but I invite the insurance man to a dinner
that will include a dish sometimes served to Chinese political
prisoners _ rice in a toilet bucket.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would give each executive a cassette of the murder of St.
Joseph's. But I promised not to show it around, because Chinese
police could identify congregants who walked sorrowfully in the
rubble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the foreign executives know what is going on, how
Chinese Catholics and Protestants are arrested and beaten if they
do not say the right prayers in government-registered churches
under government-approved bishops. St. Joseph's would not register
with the Communist Religious Affairs Bureau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even without the cassette, the executives know, they know. They
just do not give a damn.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am asked why I write often about religious persecution of
Christians, since I am a Jew, and not even religiously educated.
One simple reason is sufficient: sufferings of the religious are as
painful as of the secular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there is another _ neither religious nor secular freedoms
will flourish where one is denied. Only if religious and secular
Americans grasp that will a human rights movement exist in America
that can protect them all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people buoyed me when I wrote, particularly Cardinal John
O'Connor. He sustains all who struggle for freedom, sometimes
without the enthusiasm of his peers. Among Catholic, Protestant and
Jewish clergy in America, some speak up against religious
persecution abroad _ and some look away.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I was an apprentice reporter covering sermons for $3 a
Sunday, I did not appreciate assignment to St. Patrick's, now
O'Connor's seat. Two collection plates were presented, one before
you could get down the aisle. But I will never again duck two
collections, not at St. Patrick's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's was destroyed because its congregation and priests
refused to submit themselves to Communist domination. And so were
16 other churches in and near Fujian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No film has surfaced except of St. Joseph's. Some views are
shown at www.freechurchforchina.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day there will be cameras, lots, when St. Joseph's and the
others reopen in freedom. Cardinal O'Connor will be there;
guaranteed. So will other Americans who understand that Chinese
really want more than rice and chains.

BRADLEY RAISES MORE MONEY THAN GORE IN LATEST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another sign that his bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination is gaining strength, former Sen. Bill
Bradley has raised more money than Vice President Al Gore in the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who on Thursday reported raising $6.7 million to Gore's
$6.5 million, has also spent substantially less than the vice
president and has more cash in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising juggernaut of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
meanwhile, continued to vacuum up donations at a record pace and
now has $37 million cash on hand. That is more than Gore, Bradley
and all of Bush's Republican rivals combined.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cemented his commanding financial position by raising $19
million in the period from July through September, bringing his
total for the first nine months of the year to more than $56
million. He has already announced that he will forgo federal
matching funds, freeing him to spend as much as he can raise
between now and the national nominating conventions next August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose fund-raising prowess was once viewed as a critical
advantage over Bradley, had anticipated Thursday's bad news. On
Wednesday, the vice president announced that he was trimming his
staff and relocating his campaign headquarters from the K Street
lobbying corridor of Washington to Nashville in an effort to slow
spending and move his campaign closer to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the vice president will continue to live in Washington,
the move reflected the urgency of the campaign's need to conserve
money as much as a symbolic distancing of Gore from the Clinton
White House and the world of Washington insiders.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's campaign raised what aides said was a
disappointing $6.5 million in the third quarter and spent nearly
all of it. Gore has been forced to increase his fund-raising
targets for the rest of the year and has acknowledged that he will
have to continue to prospect for contributions early next year even
as he campaigns full time in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has raised $24.2 million this year and spent more than $14
million, leaving him currently with $9.7 million to $10 million in
the bank, Gore advisers said. Nearly half of his total spending has
been on fund-raising costs, including hiring professional
solicitors, direct-mail appeals and money-raising events like
dinners and receptions. The rest has gone to pay for a staff of
high-priced consultants, travel, overhead and organizations in
early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised $18.4 million since starting his exploratory
committee last December. In the past three months, he raised $6.7
million and spent slightly less than $4.2 million. His campaign
reported that he now has about $10 million cash on hand, enough to
remain competitive with the vice president deep into the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on track to raise what we believed we needed to raise
for a competitive campaign,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's chief
campaign adviser. ``We're very encouraged by the fact that in this
third quarter we have seen a surge in the number of small
donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has kept his expenses down by traveling light and
keeping his campaign organization relatively small. Costs are now
rising, Ms. Dunn said, as the campaign opens offices in New
Hampshire and Iowa and builds a full-time staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides and advisers put a brave face on what appears to be
a grave situation for an incumbent who just a few months ago was
expected to have an easy path to the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has all the resources he needs to be able to take his
message to the people of Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, California
and beyond,'' said Chris Lehane, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Gore adviser said the vice president would be
pressed for resources after the compressed primary season this
winter. He acknowledged that there would be little money left to
spend after April, and added, ``First we have to survive until
April.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican hopefuls, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
reported raising $3 million in the last three months, bringing his
total to $7 million for the year. Gary Bauer raised about $2
million, for a total this year of $5.4 million, most of it in small
donations that will qualify for federal matching money. Bauer has
$300,000 cash on hand, said Frank Cannon, his campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Elizabeth Dole, Kathleen Harrington, said Mrs. Dole's
campaign had raised about $1.5 million in the past three months and
$5 million this year. Ms. Harrington asserted, ``We're making
history'' by raising a majority of funds from women contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who is now running as a Republican but flirting
with the idea of seeking the Reform Party's presidential
nomination, raised $1.6 million in the third quarter and has taken
in $4 million for the year. His campaign has about $250,000 in the
bank, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah has brought in $1.2 million since
announcing his long-shot bid for the White House this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, heir to a magazine publishing fortune, is
financing his own campaign and is therefore not dependent on
federal matching money or subject to federal election spending
rules. His campaign did not respond to a request for figures on his
spending to date.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's figures are unofficial estimates provided by the
campaigns. Final figures are due to be reported to the Federal
Election Commission on Oct. 15.

RIOT POLICE CONFRONT ANTI-MILOSEVIC DEMONSTRATORS FOR SECOND
NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Riot police stopped a march of
anti-government demonstrators for the second consecutive night,
clubbing opposition leaders without provocation and stampeding
thousands of people back toward the center of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   After the clash Wednesday night, when demonstrators had tried
marching toward the suburb where President Slobodan Milosevic and
other leaders live, opposition leaders thought they had chosen a
noncontroversial destination, across the Sava River to New
Belgrade. But at least 300 police in riot gear moved quickly to
block the march on the Brankov bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The police action for the second night running made it clear
that Milosevic's government has decided to try to intimidate the
demonstrators and keep them hemmed in to central Belgrade, where
their nightly rallies have been authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the financial police shut down the printing plant of
Glas Javnosti, an independent newspaper that has been printing the
daily bulletin of the opposition parties in the Alliance for
Change. Plainclothes policemen also surrounded the headquarters of
the opposition Alliance for Change, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Milosevic's determination to use force, if
necessary, to prevent a popular uprising, leaders of the opposition
Alliance for Change faced their own stark choice: to push for
confrontation now, when the number of protesters remains relatively
small, or to try to avoid street battles and seek change through
larger demonstrations or early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Milosevic is prepared to use violence to
protect himself,'' Milan Protic, an opposition leader, said late
Thursday night. ``It's definite now that Milosevic is ready to do
anything, and we have to adapt our tactics. We don't want innocent
people to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, when about 20,000 demonstrators tried to march
to Dedinje, where Milosevic lives, police stopped the march and
appeared to seek confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   That encouraged opposition leaders to call for more
demonstrators to come Thursday night, when they promised to try to
reach Dedinje again, and Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic
said he hoped as many as 100,000 would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, no more demonstrators came out to march Thursday
night, one reason Djindjic and the other Alliance leaders decided
to go instead to New Belgrade. Recent polls indicate that up to 70
percent of Serbs are afraid to participate in demonstrations,
fearing violence or the loss of their jobs, compared to only 40
percent in 1996, when Belgrade saw 88 days of pro-democracy
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Police were in no mood for negotiations Thursday night.
Djindjic, walking with other leaders at the head of the march,
stepped forward to talk with the policemen at the head of the
cordon blocking the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot go ahead,'' the police commander said to Djindjic.
``You are taking full responsibility if you go any farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Djindjic could say a word, policemen clubbed him on the
shoulder with a baton and also clubbed his aide, Cedomir Jankovic,
and then pressed forward, forcing the marchers to reverse course
off the bridge, whacking demonstrators with batons, arresting those
who taunted them and clubbing a woman who had fallen to the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at St. Sava Clinic said Thursday night that at least 15
people were brought to the hospital with light wounds and at least
one person was admitted with a severe concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Governing parties issued statements accusing the demonstrators
of instigating Wednesday night's violence _ which was untrue _ in
order to boost the poor turnout at the rallies. They also accused
the opposition of being in the pay of NATO and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday night, police seemed particularly angered
by demonstrators' taunts that they should ``go to Kosovo,'' a
reprise of a taunt from the 1996-97 demonstrations. But Thursday
night, one policeman shouted back, ``And where were you?''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have painted Djindjic, who fled to Montenegro
during the bombing and spent much time in NATO countries then, as a
tool of NATO, trying to finish ``the aggression by other means'' by
overthrowing Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a speech to a few thousand protesters who gathered in
the Square of the Republic after the march was broken up, Djindjic
vowed to keep up his campaign against Milosevic, saying it was the
duty of his generation to bring ``the dictator down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one life, but it must be worth living,'' he said.
``We must fight for that life, and if we must give victims for
that, then we must give them.'' He said that ``we are for
nonviolent methods.'' However, asked in an interview about the
pacifist Gandhi, he said that this was the Balkans, not India,
``and our enemy is not the British, but Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance leaders asked demonstrators to return to Dedinje Friday
night, but in cars, busses and trucks, instead of on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts began Thursday to bring all opposition parties together
on a common set of demands for free, early elections, as the main
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic,
has been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has criticized these rallies as counterproductive and
repeated Thursday that the only effective method to produce
political change is by elections, not street protests.
</P>
<P>
   His party praised the negotiations as a step toward Draskovic's
platform, and Djindjic said the talks had begun well. But Alliance
officials said that street pressure would be vital to get Milosevic
to agree to any early elections, let alone to resign.

   ``Finding My Voice''
</P>
<P>
   by Diane Rehm
</P>
<P>
   Memoir
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $24
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the ``Diane Rehm Show'' on National Public Radio is
a constant in the lives of many baby boomers. The same folks who
progressed from hard rock to rock, to oldies rock, have forgone all
rock to listen to Rehm's talk show. She's a morning delight. She is
well-informed. Her listeners, no matter how mighty, show her great
respect. She manages her call-in, no matter how contrary, with
great aplomb. She talks to both sides of controversial issues in a
soft, slow, quavery voice that echoes decades of living. Although
we never see her, we know she is old, she is wise, she is a
wrinkle-ravaged crone.
</P>
<P>
   Listener, hold the phone while we take this commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm's new book, ``Finding My Voice,'' is now on bookstore
shelves. There on the cover is Rehm, and Rehm is a babe _ a
blond-fluff bunny, with a big swirl of cotton candy hair, and a
pretty, hyperaccessorized, femmed-out personal style. She's not a
crone, not at all. And ... she's never been to college.
</P>
<P>
   No way, you say? Yes, way. She comes from an Arab family whose
members believed that college was unnecessary for girls. That's
another shock. We thought she was a Southern belle.
</P>
<P>
   That tremulous voice is not real either. Well, it's hers, but it
is not her natural voice. As her radio show went nationwide four
years ago, she began a battle with spasmodic dysphonia, a movement
disorder affecting the muscles that control speech. The cause is
unknown, there is no cure, but she is undergoing regular
treatments. Her voice is getting better.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Finding My Voice,'' Rehm details her odd childhood with a
mother who wielded psychological abuse as a disciplinary tool. To
escape, Rehm married young and divorced soon thereafter. She
married again; this union was rocky, as well. She dodged the
frustrations of home and family by running into the radio booth.
Then, just as she was finding her niche, accepting success and
managing her marriage, she began to lose her voice. At this exact
moment, Diane Rehm was introduced to America.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she struck a chord and began gathering a huge audience,
she was riddled with anxiety and constant self-criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm is not the wise woman we believed her to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is her writing style as graceful as her interviewing
techniques. When the conversation becomes one-sided, with Rehm
alone on the page, she natters on much longer than she would ever
allow a guest to do. She tells us in excruciating, chronological
detail about all her jobs in radio. She wants us to meet every
doctor she met, and to share all the incorrect diagnoses. We must
turn page after page while she dithers about treatment. Rehm, it
seems, is the relative you don't want to sit next to at the
Thanksgiving dinner table. She has interviewed heads of state,
authors, activists and stars, and all she wants to write about is
how mean her mother was and her most recent doctor's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Within one chapter of the book is what the bottom-feeding minds
want to know: How do you handle the telephone jerks? She has a
lever she can use to fade out the long-winded, and a button to zap
hostile or abusive callers. What happens if a caller or guest uses
inappropriate words? Rehm is broadcast on a seven-second delay, so
she or her engineers can do a quick edit.
</P>
<P>
   Who were terrible guests? Tom Clancy, who mumbled
monosyllabically until listeners chastised him into good behavior.
Then there was septuagenarian actor Tony Randall, who, with a new
bride and new child, suggested that they should talk about the size
of his paternity equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the perfect guests? Hillary Clinton and Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   What we'd like from her book is more dish and less detail. But
that is not what Rehm is about. Mindless blather can be found on
any of a number of other stations; just push the button and listen
to the rock jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding My Voice'' exposes Rehm as a fraud. She is not a
wonderful, revered crone. She is more human than ever imagined. She
is an insecure, hard-working woman with a troublesome husband, who
has the ear of thousands because she does her homework and she
listens well.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Rehm has to say about what she does best:
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me the other day whether talking with some of
the world's outstanding figures didn't leave me starstruck. I
acknowledge that my place behind the microphone affords me an
opportunity few people in this world enjoy, this is, to spend an
hour _ alone _ with people like these. I know how fortunate I've
been to have had that opportunity and to have had the vast majority
of guests, no matter how extraordinary, treat me with simple
kindness and respect. Which brings me to a point in which I believe
very strongly: You get what you give in this business. If you treat
guests, listeners and colleagues with respect, they will almost
without exception treat you in the same way. There have been many
times on the air when I could have responded angrily to the
comments of a guest or caller, and believe me, there have been many
times when I've wanted to. Perhaps that kind of outburst might have
been entertaining, and numerous talk-show hosts around the country
do use their guests as foils for their aggressive humor. I've
chosen to move in a different direction. I have a hard time
listening to that kind of harshness on the air, which is no doubt
why it's not part of my approach to broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Rehm is not the woman we thought she was. In print, at
least, she's more interesting by far, at least when she focuses on
what readers really want to know. Now, welcome back to the show.

   TOKYO _ In the worst accident in Japan's troubled history with
nuclear power, an out-of-control chain reaction at a fuel
fabrication plant near Tokyo spewed high levels of radiation into
the air beginning Thursday morning. Thirty-five people were
exposed, three of whom were seriously injured, and 300,000 local
residents were ordered to stay indoors. The reaction was brought
under control early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the reaction was set off when workers
accidentally poured 35 pounds of uranium into a purification tank
containing nitric acid, instead of the 5.2 pounds normally used.
</P>
<P>
   This mistake reportedly caused a flash of blue light inside the
plant, owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Scientists said the flash
may have been the result of a fast chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. rushed 880 pounds of sodium borate to
the plant, but the authorities said they had no way of getting
close enough to the processing tank to dump the radiation-absorbing
powder onto it.
</P>
<P>
   When initial efforts to stop the reaction failed, the government
ordered the residents of nearby areas to stay indoors. A primary
school, a kindergarten, a number of shops and several homes were
all located within the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day Thursday, the government made little fuss
about the accident, closing off a three-mile perimeter around the
area and warning residents to keep their windows shut. By late
Thursday evening, the East Japan Railway, which serves the area,
suspended train traffic to the immediate region of the accident.
Major highways into the town were also closed, and electronic signs
were posted on small roads warning motorists to avoid the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was scheduled to name a new
cabinet Friday but was forced by the incident to postpone the
change in government, apologized tacitly for the slow official
reaction. ``We must obtain decisions from scientists, technicians
and experts'' to assess such accidents, the prime minister told
reporters at his residence, according to the Kyodo news agency,
adding ``if they were slow in making decisions, we must make sure
that that never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Japan has compounded other nuclear accidents with
similarly slow, and often misleading, information given to the
public. Commentators here are already predicting a strong backlash
in public opinion against the industry and perhaps too against a
deeply embarrassed government.

 &HT;    President? Beatty won't try for part
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Although he hinted he won't be running
for president any time soon, actor Warren Beatty on Tuesday gave a
glimpse of what a Beatty campaign might look like: loads of
Tinseltown glamour, a strong measure of big government liberalism
and plenty of laugh lines.
</P>
<P>
   More than 160 members of the media from around the world, along
with 1,000 guests, crowded into the opulently decorated ballroom at
the Beverly Hilton _ the site of the annual Golden Globe Awards _
to hear what Beatty might or might not say about his political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those ambitions became fodder for speculation six weeks ago when
political commentators began talking about a Beatty candidacy for
president, and some of Beatty's closest friends urged him to run.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty ridiculed the ``grand mentioners in the media'' who kept
fueling the speculation even after he had described a presidential
bid as ``highly improbable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on a listening tour of my house for the past six
weeks,'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he was happily married to a woman ``half my age''
(actress Annette Bening), with three children and expecting a
fourth soon.
</P>
<P>
   And while he did not rule out a presidential bid, he did say,
``I like my day job, I like making movies, and I want to keep on
making them.''
</P>
<P>
   What Beatty really had on his mind, it turned out, was to chide
the Democratic Party for drifting to the right.
</P>
<P>
   He called both Vice President Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley well-meaning centrists who had abandoned Democratic
principles. Beatty railed against the influence of money in
politics and called for universal health care coverage for all
Americans and an end to ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the value of social programs,'' said Beatty, to
loud applause. ``I believe in the safety net, I believe in
regulation, I believe in activist government.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was sponsored by Americans for Democratic Action, a
liberal group that advocates steep defense cuts, campaign finance
reform and gun control. Beatty was honored with ADA's Eleanor
Roosevelt award. Vietnam activist Tom Hayden was in the audience,
along with pornography publisher Larry Flint, actress Courtney Love
and some of Beatty's closest Hollywood friends. Some guests sported
computer-made stickers that read ``Beatty 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Hollywood celebrities also appeared on video to
praise Beatty or joke about his potential bid for president. ``I
want to be your running mate,'' said director Rob Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, actress Roseanne Barr said she wanted to run
against Beatty in 2000 on the platform of free plastic surgery for
everyone. The video reel also replayed some of Beatty's movies,
such as ``Reds,'' and, of course, the political satire
``Bullworth,'' which featured Beatty as a senator running for
president and speaking out about many of the same social themes he
mentioned Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd vote for him in a second,'' said Raoul O'Connell, 29, a
film director who conceded he knew about Beatty's politics only
through ``Bullworth.''
</P>
<P>
   In some places the idea of a movie star running for president
might seem far-fetched. But this is Hollywood, where a successful
acting career launched onetime actor Ronald Reagan into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some of the celebrity guests marveled at the
prospect of a once notorious ladies' man occupying the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a single man a long time,'' said director Penny
Marshall, whose credits include ``A League of Their Own.'' ``The
girls would come out of the woodwork'' if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's friends also hastened to describe him as a lifelong
political activist who was committed to liberal ideas, noting that
he once took a year off to work on George McGovern's failed
presidential bid in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous intelligence and craggy, tough integrity,''
said actress Faye Dunaway, who starred with Beatty in ``Bonnie and
Clyde.'' ``Just don't underestimate him,'' she added emphat-
ically.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hoffman, who is supporting Bradley, described Beatty as a
passionate idealist who was ``frustrated that the system has a
hammerlock on the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren represents us,'' said Hoffman. ``He can say anything he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Hoffman couldn't resist a joke. Asked whom Beatty
should choose as a running mate if he should win the Democratic
nomination, Hoffman said, ``Now that's a good question. Who should
be his running mate? Susan Sarandon?''

 U.S. TO REVISIT ACCUSATIONS OF A MASSACRE BY GIs IN '50  
(js) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretary of defense ordered the Army on
Thursday to undertake a new and thorough review of reports that
U.S. soldiers killed Korean civilians at the beginning of the
Korean War nearly 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an account published on Wednesday by The Associated Press, a
dozen American veterans confirmed accusations by Korean villagers
that in July 1950, hundreds of refugees were killed by U.S. gunfire
under a bridge near No Gun Ri in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen wrote to Louis Caldera, the
secretary of the Army, asking him to ``devote whatever resources
are appropriate to accomplish this review as thoroughly and as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing, Caldera said Thursday that the AP
investigation provided ``new information that demanded that it be
looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These reports are of course very disturbing,'' Caldera said.
``Earlier this year our Army center for military history did a
search and found nothing in the official records that substantiates
the claims that U.S. Army soldiers perpetrated such massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he appreciated that Cohen had instructed
the Army to examine all the available information and evidence, and
``get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of South Korea announced Thursday that it would
start its own investigation, said Hebeom Kim, a spokesman at the
Korean Embassy here. He said South Korea might ask the United
States for declassified military documents.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said that the new review would take at least one year
and would encompass all historical records, including those at the
National Archives, which were the source of much of the new
evidence uncovered by the AP, as well as interviews with U.S.
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it would not excuse the alleged acts, history records
that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were very chaotic,''
Caldera said. ``U.S. soldiers, although they fought with great
courage under very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and
ill-equipped to fight because of the large reduction in resources
available to the military for training and equipment following
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 30 South Korean survivors and relatives of the victims
filed a suit asking for compensation for the incident, but the suit
was rejected on a technicality. The claimants had described a
three-day period of killing, saying that U.S. planes had strafed
hundreds of refugees who were fleeing from North Korean troops,
leaving about 100 people dead. The survivors fled under the bridge,
where they said they were pinned by U.S. troops who shot and killed
almost all the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, some of the U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri
said they had been ordered to fire on the refugees because their
commanders believed that North Korean troops, disguised as
peasants, had infiltrated the refugee column and were shooting at
the Americans.

COMPANY'S VALUE GOES FROM $17 MILLION TO $550 MILLION IN 9 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one knows how many billions of dollars in market value have
been created by the Internet. But whatever the number is, it is
comforting to know that one can still get in and get rich fast.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Scandinavia Co. In just nine months, its market value
has risen from $17 million to $550 million. In the quarter just
ended, its share price went up more than 400 percent, making it the
best performing stock in America. Moreover, it has done this with
an investment of only a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Before explaining just how this good fortune fell on Scandinavia
_ a company registered in the Cayman Islands and run by a man who
lives in Connecticut _ a look at its history may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavia used to be a closed-end fund, traded on the American
Stock Exchange. In February 1989 it was taken over by the Vik
family, which made a business of taking over such funds that were
trading below net asset value. Alexander Vik of Greenwich, Conn.,
now 44, was installed as the chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Viks decided to convert Scandinavia into an operating
company, but, sad to say, success was slow in arriving. In 10 years
of Vik management, the share price fell 30 percent while no
dividends were paid. As 1999 began, its principal asset was a hotel
in the Canary Islands. There were weeks when no shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the first hint that something might be up came
early last year, around the time the company began putting money
into an infant Internet company called Mirror Image. It did not
disclose that investment then, but the board voted to give the Viks
options on a million more shares _ more than the total shares in
public hands. (Adjusted for a split that took effect in September,
the options are good for 1.5 million shares.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 1 this year, the company said it had bought a
majority stake in Mirror Image. A few months later, it disclosed
that it had paid $6 million for that stake and had bought 32
percent more from an investor who chose to get out. The price it
will pay for that additional stake will be based on a future
appraisal of Mirror Image's value. If the appraisal reflects
Scandinavia's current stock price, it is going to be a very
expensive purchase.
</P>
<P>
   What is Mirror Image? It is a company that is developing a
network it says will help move Internet data much faster. Through
June 30, its sales were negligible. Vik, in a telephone interview
Thursday, said revenues now ``are growing, but they are not very
large.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing the network will take ``tens of millions of
dollars,'' Vik said, and Scandinavia has invested more money in
Mirror Image. But he would not say how much.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock price climbed, Scandinavia ballyhooed contracts
that call for it to buy computers from Sun Microsystems and
software from Oracle. It may also have set a record by announcing a
new stock split only nine days after the previous one took effect.
That announcement Thursday sent the shares up $13, to $68, on
volume of 219,200, or more than a quarter of the shares in public
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Why two splits? ``The board wanted to give people the
opportunity to pick up some shares,'' explained a company
spokesman, Ethan Rasiel of Edelman PR Worldwide. ``There has been
such explosive demand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That demand, it may be noted, has come without any disclosure of
how much money Mirror Image has taken in from customers. Just think
how much the stock will go up when investors actually have some
information.

COY ON CANDIDACY, BEATTY KEEPS HIS OPTIONS OPEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He didn't say he would and he didn't say he
wouldn't. But Warren Beatty held an enthusiastic crowd of
Hollywood's liberal elite in the palm of his hand for half an hour
Wednesday night as he denounced the influence of money in politics
and the rightward drift of the Democratic Party, and insisted that
its presidential candidates not forget society's least fortunate,
whether or not he runs himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty asked after receiving
the annual Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the Southern California
Chapter of Americans for Democratic Action. ``Have we come to the
point where the Democratic Party needs to have a Republican
president before it finds its voice again? A rising tide is not
lifting all boats.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an evening that blended the goofy glamour of a Dean
Martin celebrity roast with the earnest speechifying of a liberal
caucus on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Celebrities like Jack
Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway and Beatty's wife, Annette
Bening, crowded into the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
along with about 150 journalists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's speech, delivered in his trademark halting and
epigrammatic style, touched on topics from diplomatic recognition
for Cuba (he's for it) to the inequities of the emerging global
economy. Addressing an audience of multimillionaires, he rattled
off reams of statistics to condemn the disparities between wealth
and poverty, and called for universal health care, public campaign
financing, and tough new approaches to controlling child labor,
sweatshops and environmental problems in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty singled out campaign finance for special criticism,
saying: ``The primary cancer in this sick system, the big money in
politics, has so metastasized into every area of government that we
can't afford any longer to ignore that the life of the patient,
American democracy, is in mortal danger of expiring on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing date for the New Hampshire primary is only about a
month away, and despite suggestions that he run by some supporters
in both parties, Beatty emphasized that he liked his day job of
making movies. But he suggested that he would keep speaking out, by
insisting that ``if an unexpected person'' with spirit and ability
decided to run for president, it would not matter ``whether that
person became well known as a basketball player or a businessman or
wrestler or a grocery store clerk or a drum majorette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, look drum majorette, there's no harm in thinking
about this, however unlikely it may be,'' Beatty said. ``But
whatever you do, go ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people
nobody speaks up for. If you speak up well, maybe you'll influence
the party, maybe you'll influence the candidates that are running.
And who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And remember, drum majorette, don't delude yourself into
thinking that it's got an awful lot to do with you; it doesn't.
It's the time that you're living in, and a temporary vacuum that
that allows you the privilege of being heard. And one more thing,
drum majorette. When those plutocrats start with you, when you
start hearing those moneyed, honeyed voices of ridicule and
reaction, let them call you coy, let them call you flirtatious, but
keep talking.''

RESISTING JUDGE, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA TO CONTINUE AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Disregarding the strongly worded advice of a federal
judge, the University of Georgia announced Thursday that it would
continue to use race as a factor in admitting up to 20 percent of
its freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by university president Michael Adams on an
issue that has been the subject of intense debate for months puts
the school on a collision course with U.S. District Court Judge B.
Avant Edenfield, who has been hearing a series of challenges to the
university's admissions policy. In a non-binding opinion attached
to a related ruling in July, Edenfield said the university ``cannot
constitutionally justify'' the use of race in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Because at least one new court case challenging the policy has
already been assigned to Edenfield, it is likely that he will have
a fresh opportunity to issue a formal ruling against the school
soon. But Adams made it clear the university was reluctantly
willing to accept a prolonged legal fight and a series of appeals
in order to preserve the diversity of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that all of us have a responsibility to deal with
the legacy of segregation as an issue in both academe and
government,'' Adams said, in a speech that received a standing
ovation from the University Council, an advisory body of faculty,
administrators and students. ``My commitment to providing
opportunity to all is fundamental, and under my leadership the
University of Georgia will remain committed to this basic right.''
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly conservative legal climate, when other
schools have been backing away from their affirmative action
policies, Thursday's decision makes the University of Georgia one
of the most prominent schools to voice full-throated support for
racial preferences, particularly in the South. Hoping to banish the
memory of the school's all-white past, most of the state's
establishment has supported the admissions policy, including Gov.
Roy Barnes and even state Senate Republican Minority Leader Eric
Johnson.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Those who argue that the only fair method is a statistical
ranking of applicants' academic records miss an important point,''
Adams said. ``True fairness also includes a professional assessment
of unique family situations, the schools the student has attended,
the community he or she came from, and whether applicants had to
overcome economic hardships to build a record of academic
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students are admitted to the university without any
consideration of race. Between 80 and 90 percent of each incoming
class are admitted solely on the basis of their test scores and
high-school grades. The remaining 10 to 20 percent can have a
slightly lower academic record, but their chances are boosted if
they are non-white, or are the child of an alumnus, or the first in
a family to attend college, or if they have unusual talents and
civic accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the policy, only about 6 percent of this year's freshman
class of 4,200 students is African-American, compared with 30
percent of the state as a whole. About 15 percent of the class is
non-white. But even this modest use of race as a factor was enough
to prompt a lawsuit from A. Lee Parks Jr., an Atlanta attorney who
often represents clients trying to end affirmative action programs.
Parks on Thursday accused Adams of caving into pressure from
faculty members, and predicted extended new rounds of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a wonderful opportunity to base their admissions on
socio-economic factors that really demonstrated need, but instead
they've taken the same old road,'' said Parks. ``We'll be seeking
an immediate temporary injunction against this policy, and now the
litigation will come to a final head.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials, who clearly do not want black enrollment
to drop, are now taking a firm stand on the fairly shaky foundation
of the 1978 Bakke decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled
that race could be one factor used in admitting students, as long
as a quota system was not employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the legal landscape has become uncertain and
confusing since then,'' said Dan Coenen, a constitutional law
professor at the university's law school. ``But until the Supreme
Court speaks again, it's still the law of the land, and this
admissions policy is entirely acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams made it clear in an interview Thursday that a ruling by
the high court would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unsettled legal area,'' he said, ``and we might all be
better served in the long term if it could be made more clear.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nibbling shrimp and baby lobster tails, talking on
cell phones and solemnly contemplating such works of art as a sink
and plumbing nestled in what looked like a musician's case lined in
red velvet, New York's culturati gathered proudly Thursday night at
the Brooklyn Museum of Art in defiance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
bruised esthetic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a gift from the mayor to provide this enormous
publicity,'' said Peter Norton, who developed the anti-virus
computer program that bears his name and is now a major collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hubbub is a lot of nonsense, but you can't buy that kind
of publicity,'' Norton said. ``I said they'd have to open five new
ticket tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, of course, gathered in front of the now-famous
painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' which is festooned with
elephant dung and has become the centerpiece of the dispute between
the city and the museum. Almost unnoticed in a corner was the work
that stirred protest in London: a large portrait of Myra Handle, a
child murderess done in a Pointilist style of tiny children's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, for one, was quite taken with the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at how pretty, how lyrical, how sympathetic it
is,'' he said. ``If you get beyond the knee-jerk reaction, it's not
offensive. It has the glowing quality of Cloissonne or terrazo.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a sea of dark suits, a few worn daringly without
ties, and lots and lots of little black dresses. Many people seemed
to get stuck around the art in the rotunda, filled with Rodin
sculpture, arguably the best work on view.
</P>
<P>
   Listening in on conversations, it seemed the reviews of
``Sensation'' were mixed. Some people said they loved that shark in
the formaldehyde, while others said they didn't think the cow cut
in 12 sections worked as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant, the actor, strolled by all but unnoticed with the
artist Sam Taylor-Wood, whose painting ``Wrecked'' is a take on the
Last Supper with the central Christlike figure a topless woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some pieces that I liked, some pieces I don't like,''
said Michael Bloomberg, the business-news mogul. ``I don't
understand why there is a fuss about this. To me there is nothing
sacrilegious about the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the civil libertarian, was among those present
already bubbling over with plans for a protest rally on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the buzz in the museum,'' he said. ``You hear a lot of
people saying, `What's the big deal,' and maybe they're being
sensitized to the increasing authoritarianism in the city. Maybe
there's a silver lining in the way New York City is being tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn Thursday, seeking to evict the museum. The suit contends
that the museum violated its lease by imposing a special $9.75 fee
for admission to the exhibition and by promoting the commercial
interests of the private collector who owns the artwork in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers also appeared at a routine hearing in
Brooklyn federal court Thursday, where the museum has filed suit
against the city, saying it was violating the museum's First
Amendment rights.

 &HT;    Christian Coalition blessings sought
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though the Christian Coalition has been beset by
turmoil, most of the Republican presidential candidates will flock
to its Road to Victory '99 conference, which begins here today.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will try to show that he can appeal
to socially conservative Republicans, even though his more centrist
campaign has downplayed abortion and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is skipping the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The event is especially important to Steve Forbes, who once
belittled coalition founder Pat Robertson as a ``toothy flake'' and
asserted that the group did not speak for most Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes has become increasingly outspoken on social issues,
promoting what he calls ``the right to be born'' and criticizing
court decisions against school prayer and vouchers for private
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Following his one-note 1996 campaign devoted to a proposed
single tax rate on income, Forbes has assiduously courted the
religious right, hoping to emerge as the choice of conservative
Republican primary voters who object to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said this week, for instance, that he would like his
first act as president to be signing into law a ban on
partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes, now that he's been converted, has all the things the
social conservatives like to see in a candidate,'' said James Guth,
an expert on Christian conservatives who teaches at Furman
University in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' effort, as well as his considerable wealth, has
attracted about a dozen former state or regional officials of the
Christian Coalition and the Eagle Forum, another group of
conservative activists.
</P>
<P>
   That group includes Jerry Keen, former chairman of the Christian
Coalition in Georgia, and Christian activists in Iowa, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, Louisiana and Washington _ states with
early primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Forbes can turn this newfound support into a serious
challenge to Bush remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Keen warns that if Christian conservatives do
not rally around one candidate, ``it almost guarantees another
establishment candidate'' will be the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Keen is serving as Forbes' coalitions director. Pleased with
Forbes' second-place finish in the Iowa straw poll, which Bush won,
Keen said the campaign showed its ability to turn out its
supporters. ``We've got grass-roots people and activists. They turn
out bodies,'' he said. ``Bush has Pat (Roberston) and Ralph (Reed,
the coalition's former executive director.)''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has spoken highly of Bush, but has not endorsed him.
Reed is a paid adviser to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that all the candidates, except for Bush, have the
same goal: ``Play the applause-meter game and emerge as the
proprietary candidate of grass-roots conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of most of the candidates in Washington indicates
that, despite the Christian Coalition's money troubles and staff
shake-up this year, ``evangelical Protestants represent a very
important constituency in the Republican party,'' Guth said.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, those voters make up a third of the
participants in the Iowa caucus, a quarter of the electorate in New
Hampshire and 40 percent in South Carolina. Those are the first
three significant Republican contests next year.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign for the presidency began in earnest this year,
a half dozen candidates were vying for the votes of social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the field has narrowed considerably since then. Vice
President Dan Quayle withdrew from the race this week. Sen. Bob
Smith (R-N.H.) quit the Republican party to mull a third-party
candidacy, calling the GOP insufficently conservative. Pat
Buchanan, lagging in the polls, is considering taking his campaign
to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Forbes and Gary Bauer, former president of the Family
Research Council, are the chief competitors in the Republicans'
race within a race. Radio commentator and former diplomat Alan
Keyes also is a candidate for the support of conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   And events of recent days have seemed to benefit Forbes. Several
prominent Buchanan backers have moved to Forbes in protest of
Buchanan's flirtation with the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jarvis, Bauer's national campaign chairman, also
defected to Forbes, saying he does not believe Bauer can win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis also acknowledged this week that another factor in his
decision was his concern that Bauer was spending too much time with
a female campaign aide. Jarvis called the situation
``inappropriate.'' Bauer firmly denied having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer and his campaign staff have accused Forbes' campaign
of spreading the rumors of an affair, a charge the Forbes camp
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's conference, which will include speeches by Bauer, Bush,
Elizabeth Dole and Republican congressional leaders, could mark a
new, contentious turn in the jockeying between Bauer and Forbes.
Forbes is scheduled to speak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former domestic policy aide to Ronald Reagan, has a
strong claim on Christian conservatives, combining years of
opposition to abortion rights with his concern about religious
persecution in China, the Sudan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the contest between Bauer and Forbes will not matter
if Bush continues his march to the Republican nomination. Forbes is
a strong second to Bush in recent polls in Iowa, but in New
Hampshire and nationally, he and Bauer fare poorly in polls.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor, while waging a centrist campaign that
plays down abortion and other social issues, has not simply
forfeited his claim to the votes of social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas, with Bush's assent, recently joined an
appeal to the Supreme Court in support of organized prayer at
public high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to be in a good position to make an appeal,'' Guth
said.

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET RULING OCT. 8
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet will learn next week whether he will be
sent to Spain to stand trial on torture charges. Deputy Chief
Magistrate Ronald Bartle ended four days of hearings at Bow Street
magistrates court saying he would issue his decision on Oct. 8. The
former Chilean dictator, 83, is supposed to be present for the

   Backing off of a pledge made by Prime Minister Tony Blair, the

   FRANCE: STUDENTS TAKE TO STREETS
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students demonstrated across France in a second day
of anti-government protests. They want more teachers, better
equipment, less crowded classrooms and changes in study programs to
make them more suited to the job market. After large protests a
year ago, the minister of education promised reforms. But the
students said the government had done too little.

</P>
<P>
   The French arrested three suspected members of the Basque

in a house near Pau, not far from the Spanish border. The police
said the cache may be part of the 8 tons of dynamite stolen when
gunmen broke into a warehouse in western France.

   At a gala ceremony punctuated with 17th-century-style fireworks
that matched the Baroque architecture, Pope John Paul II blessed
the newly restored facade of St. Peter's. ``We easily understand
our pleasure in this restored masterpiece,'' the pope said. ``But
it cannot only be esthetic; it must open itself to the inner appeal

   In the first of a series of promised reforms, the new executive
commission of the European Union has begun by curtailing tax
privileges for itself. Neil Kinnock of Britain, commissioner in
charge of reforms, said senior officials would no longer enjoy
tax-free alcohol, tobacco and gasoline for personal use. The
changes are a result of a crisis in March, when the last commission
resigned after reports of cronyism and mismanagement.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first day of his retooled campaign, Vice
President Al Gore spent a day much like any other. He addressed
corporate officials in New York City, walked the streets of a
depressed, upstate town, and returned to the city to meet with
reporters and then financial contributors for his second
fund-raiser in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked Gore's first foray outside Washington after
announcing his plans on Wednesday to revitalize his presidential
campaign by moving his headquarters from Washington to Tennessee
and by holding smaller, more intimate events that would, as he put
it, get him closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that theme Thursday morning, saying he would take
his campaign ``from K Street in Washington to the aisles of K-Mart
in Nashville.'' Chris Lahane, his press secretary, said Gore did
not mean to imply he would be running a cut-rate campaign, only
that he would be spending more time with ``real'' people and less
time with Washington insiders.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of frugality was an important message to convey as it
became clear Thursday that Gore had raised less money in the last
three months and had less cash on hand than his sole Democratic
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little Thursday to indicate that Gore had pared
down his campaign. He still traveled in a lengthy motorcade. And he
made his comment about K-Mart on the 56th floor of a Park Avenue
office tower to about 200 chief executives, a group that would
probably be more comfortable in the offices of lobbyists on
Washington's K Street than in K-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   And except for his stroll around a couple of blocks of
Amsterdam, N.Y., where he shook hands with unemployed residents in
the shadow of a closed toy factory, Gore stuck to traditional
venues and sounded his traditional themes of universal child care,
stronger public education and spreading economic prosperity to all
corners of the country..
</P>
<P>
   The formats that he chose generated little of the fanfare that
often accompanies presidential campaigns. That was especially true
of his visit to Amsterdam, a town of old rug mills that converted
to making toys and then went out of business, where he met with
residents and then led an hourlong forum on reviving depressed
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along Grand Street and First Avenue in Amsterdam, he
stopped and chatted with residents who had come out on their front
stoops.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Choat, 26, a laid-off worker from a nearby plant, said of
Gore: ``I earned a lot of respect for him because he talked to
us.'' Dave Passafiume, 33, who is unemployed and finds Amsterdam
``dead,'' was less enthusiastic. ``I can't find a job,'' he said,
adding that he thought few politicians could really make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo accompanied
Gore and announced grants of $300,000 to help Amsterdam. Cuomo said
later that the purpose of their visit _ trying to spark economic
revitalization _ did not lend itself to typical campaign
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad-news topic, the upstate economy,'' Cuomo said.
``The basic message is, `We have a real problem to deal with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those who met Gore were pleased nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right to us, and that makes a significant
difference,'' said Elizabeth DeBella, 36, a nurse from nearby
Schenectady.

   Earlier in the day, the New Yorkers who met Gore had a good
impression of him as well. Leon Wagner, an investment banker, saw
him at the Sky Club on Park Avenue. ``He is so much better in
person,'' Wagner said.
</P>

   ``The reason that myself and friends are going to get behind the
vice president now is _ I work on Wall Street _ it's a little like
getting behind a stock that's a little soft,'' Wagner said. ``The
perception is that Bradley is on an uptick, but the fact is the
vice president has experience. And frankly, I'm not willing to vote
against the prosperity that we have.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those given to class envy, the current crop of megadollar
sport utilities and luxury sedans could easily cause a rise of the
proletarian gorge. But workers of the world, take heart.
</P>
<P>
   New cars and trucks are actually at their most affordable level
in 19 years, said David L. Littman, chief economist for Comerica
Bank in Detroit. Littman's affordability index compares the average
price of a new vehicle ($20,802 in the second quarter) with median
annual family income ($45,835). A new-vehicle purchase requires
23.6 weeks of income before taxes _ comparable with the 23.5-week
figure of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in affordability have come largely because family
income has risen more than 5 percent in the last year. But they
also reflect long-term price stability in the auto market, Littman
said, as well as downward price pressure from auto makers'
incentive programs, rebates and discount financing.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers are getting far more vehicle for each dollar
spent. After a period of de-contenting that followed the sharp rise
of the Japanese yen in the mid-'90s, manufacturers are engaged in a
game of content brinkmanship, loading even economy cars with
standard features that were once luxury options.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the much more advanced engineering and improved
reliability of budget cars, and it is clear that there has never
been a better time to be a driver of modest means. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the Mitsubishi Mirage Coupe LS. If you went
looking for an average economy car, you could do a lot worse than
the Mirage. The compact coupe (the sedan, too) is in the middle of
its life span _ neither on the cutting edge like the new Ford
Focus, nor nearing extinction like the current Saturn S-Series. It
has average performance, average looks, average build quality.
</P>
<P>
   But average is by no means unappealing, particularly if you
judge by what cars offered for the money just a few years ago. The
test vehicle, priced at $16,062, was flush with standard amenities,
including air-conditioning, power windows and doors, a CD player
with respectable amplification, cruise control and a brace of
convenience lighting. The $1,030 sport package rolled in a spoiler,
fog lights, 14-inch alloy wheels and other sporting livery.
</P>
<P>
   Where once an economy car was a Savonarola-like exercise in
privation, the Mirage is a surprisingly comfortable and convenient
place to go about the business of commuting. The seat height is
easily adjustable with a side-mounted lever; the steering wheel
height adjusts, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Power exterior mirrors are standard on the LS model. White
gauges spruce up the function-first interior of muted grays and
black vinyl. The Focus may establish a new benchmark for flashy
small-car interiors, but the Mirage upholds the rationale for
simple, intuitive organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood is Mitsubishi's 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, a
113-horsepower stalwart that has seen service for several years.
Nowhere is technological creep more evident than in power plants.
And yet, this engine remains one of the thriftiest in the class,
turning in EPA ratings of 28 miles per gallon in town and 36 on the
highway. Only a few years ago, those kinds of numbers could be
achieved only by breathless three-cylinder vehicles. Now, that
level of economy is simply expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirage's driving dynamics benefit from the raised bar of
expectations across the economy car field. It rides on a four-wheel
independent suspension _ some front-wheel-drive competitors still
use a less sophisticated beam axle in the rear _ as well as
power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and vented disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Mitsubishi does not offer anti-lock brakes on the
Mirage, a choice that seems like a clear vote of the efficacy of
such systems (and the backlash of the insurance industry against
ABS).
</P>
<P>
   The Mirage is a lively, competent car that can be thrashed with
its five-speed manual transmission to 60 mph in about 9 seconds and
happily hurled down country roads. Naturally, the car has a lot of
understeer dialed into the suspension, so it readily plows ahead
when cornering forces exceed the grip of the 185/65 14-inch radial
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one ought to bear in mind that this middling commuter
appliance would beat the tweed britches off a typical British
sports car of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirage comes with Mitsubishi's 60 month/60,000-mile
powertrain and 36/36,000 basic warranty (once almost unthinkable
except in the luxury class). Sales of the Mirage coupe were up 41
percent through August from a year earlier, to 10,614.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that improvement has come with an increase in browsers
in Mitsubishi showrooms; many buyers stopped in to look at the
sporty new Eclipse, the restyled Galant sedan and the Montero sport
utility.
</P>
<P>
   Few who buy the Mirage _ an Everyman of the cheap-car segment _
are likely to stop and appreciate just how far such cars have come.
It is easy to take the current level of indubitable reliability,
thorough engineering and plentiful equipment for granted. You need
only take a stroll through a used-car lot to cure your
ingratitude. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Gloriously average.

 WIRES  
 Compaq's Ousted CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer Resurfaces  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Eckhard Pfeiffer, the ousted chief executive of Compaq Computer
Corp., is resurfacing on Monday as chairman of the board of
Intershop, a San Francisco firm that helps clients build electronic
storefronts on the Web.
<P>
   The high-profile Pfeiffer had almost completely retreated from
public view since he departed Compaq about five months ago. He lead
the company for eight years before being forced to resign by
Compaq's board after a series of financial disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the last five months determining my next steps,''
Pfeiffer said in an interview yesterday. ``I've fielded more than
100 proposals, from joining a board to becoming a CEO to taking on
a venture capital role.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who will officially join Intershop on Monday, will not
be committed full time to the company. ``I didn't want to lock
myself into a CEO position where you just keep going for 16 hours a
day.'' he said. He will continue to live in Houston, where Compaq
is based, and explore other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born executive serves on the boards of several major
companies, including General Motors and Bell Atlantic. Two months
ago, he also became chairman of Ricardo, a Internet auction firm
based in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said he also is exploring some venture capital deals
and has given cursory thought to starting his own Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   So what attracted Pfeiffer to Intershop, a little-known company
that was founded in Germany seven years ago and last year lost
$17.3 million on sales of $20.4 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenge of growing small companies into big
global companies,'' he said. ``I think I can bring a lot to
Intershop in terms of industry contacts. I believe this is a truly
outstanding company in the e-commerce space.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said he first became aware of the company last year,
when it went public on the German stock exchange and quickly soared
in value. Intershop, which is not listed in the United States, has
a market capitalization of about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though he refused to disclose how much he is being paid by
Intershop, Pfeiffer said he has made a large personal investment in
the company. ``It's important I make the company grow for all
shareholders as well as myself,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer is already a rich man. He received a $9.8 million
serverance check plus options for 13.5 million Compaq shares, now
valued at about $310 million, when he left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Intershop chief executive Stephan Schambach said Pfeiffer will
help open new doors for the company, especially as it transitions
away from its small and midmarket focus and begins to target
Fortune 1,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a still a young company and don't have the authority to
deal with major accounts,'' he said. ``Eckhard gives us instant
credibility with potential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said his role with Intershop will be hands-on. ``This
is more than just running the board meetings,'' he said. ``I will
participate in the strategy process and engage to a large extend
with customers and partners.''
</P>
<P>
   David Truog, an analyst with Forrester Research, believes that
the seasoned Pfeiffer can help Intershop garner attention and
all-important buzz in its market. Right now, Intershop is not
mentioned in the same breath with competitors such as Broadvision
and Open Market, but Truog said that is likely to change.
``Intershop will make a splash with Pfeiffer, but the real impact
is yet to be seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his days at Compaq and his bitter ouster, Pfeiffer says
he does not hold a grudge against his old company, nor does he take
pleasure in watching its struggles of late. ``That is water under
the bridge,'' he said. ``I'm the largest individual shareholder in
Compaq, so I hope it grows and grows.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the average new car selling for more than $20,000, at a
time when even subcompacts flash gold badges and flaunt fancy CD
players, the thrifty consumer searching for bare-bones
transportation would seem forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the penny-pinching customer who has disappeared _ gone
the way of the shade-tree mechanic, the front-door vent window and
spinner hubcaps? There no longer seems to be any demand for
Spartan, stripped-down cars.
</P>
<P>
   Such automobiles, known as price leaders, were once common at
dealerships. Even if few were sold, they could be advertised at
rock-bottom prices that brought shoppers onto the lot. Once there,
browsers might be talked into buying a ``loaded'' model.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, the plain-jane cars ultimately found
buyers, too, since they appealed to thrifty motorists who counted
their pennies and considered extra-cost add-ons _ like power
steering and radios, even heaters and electric clocks _ to be
unnecessary gadgets that would eventually break and have to be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   All the lower-priced car lines offered budget models like the
Chevrolet Biscayne, and Studebaker even sold the plainer-than-plain
Scotsman _ the name played on a stereotype of thrift in the
politically incorrect '50s.
</P>
<P>
   The price leader has all but disappeared for several reasons.
The Depression-era mindset of pinching pennies and saving for a
rainy day, common among the parents and grandparents of baby
boomers, gave way to self-indulgence and conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, our clients expect the base price of our cars to
represent a well-equipped vehicle,'' said Dave Schembri, general
manager of the New York region for Mercedes-Benz USA.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment once viewed as frivolous extras _ power steering,
stereo systems and air-conditioning _ is now seen as essential, and
comes on virtually every car sold in North America. Other items,
like air bags, are mandated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the biggest forces for change have come in the way
cars are built by manufacturers and acquired by the public.
</P>
<P>
   While car companies once offered buyers dozens of options and
hundreds of possible combinations of color, trim and equipment,
they now place a premium on standardization. By limiting the number
of combinations, a company streamlines the manufacturing process in
factories where, increasingly, vehicles are assembled from modules,
like finished dashboards, that were put together elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It may be cheaper to include, say, power windows, than to build
the occasional car without them. So manufacturers are grouping
popular features into packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Option packages are not only a good deal for manufacturers and
consumers, but they help dealers to manage inventories,'' said Wade
Hoyt, a spokesman for Toyota. ``By ordering cars and trucks with
packages of popular options, the dealer is likely to have a vehicle
on the lot that the customer wants, avoiding delivery delays and
the chance the customer will shop elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasing is also changing the way cars are equipped. A high
residual value _ the amount the car is expected to be worth at the
end of the lease _ lowers the payments. So the options valued by
used-car shoppers _ leather seats or keyless entry systems _ may
increase the monthly payments by little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Blitzer, co-owner of Devan Acura, of Norwalk, Conn., said
shoppers often came in to lease an Integra LS for $219 a month. But
when they see that for just $40 a month more they can move up to an
Integra GS, many agree to pay more. Or consider a standard 36-month
lease on a Chevrolet Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   The base model runs $266 a month, and the LS _ with a V6 engine,
power features, keyless entry, upgraded sound system and aluminum
wheels _ is $299.
</P>
<P>
   Martyn Schorr of PMPR Inc., a Closter, N.J., public relations
firm that works for clients including Buick, suggests that today's
strippers are pickup trucks. Although not many are sold, bare-bones
pickups still show up on dealer lots with rubber floor coverings
and roll-up windows. The two-wheel-drive Ford Ranger starts at
$12,295; a fully equipped Ranger tops $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Champagne Jr., of Champagne Chevrolet in Mansfield, Conn.,
says he has attracted little business by advertising price leaders.
He gets much better results, he says, by advertising cars with
popular equipment. Most consumers today are not looking for the
cheapest vehicle, but for the best value, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Schorr said that today's buyers were more sophisticated than
those taken in by bait-and-switch tactics once used by unscrupulous
dealers. Attracted by an advertisement promising rock-bottom
prices, the prospective customer would be told that ``we just sold
the last'' of the advertised car. For a few dollars more, though, a
better model could be had, and isn't that what you really want?
</P>
<P>
   Bait-and-switch selling suffered a blow from the disappearance
of stripped-down cars, but a bigger factor in its decline may have
been consumer protection laws. Now, many states require that an
advertised car be available in reasonable quantities to meet
reasonable demand. What is ``reasonable'' is determined on a
case-by-case basis, according to the Connecticut Consumer Agency. &QL;

   Last week, the Greenlining Institute released a statement
raising the specter that Minneapolis's U.S. Bancorp, the nation's
13th-largest bank, might take over San Francisco's Union, the
second-largest bank based in California.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlining issued its broadside as part of a campaign to force
the Minnesota bank to increase the money it channels to
California's low-income and minority communities, an amount the
group charges falls short of what the bank should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp will have more than $6 billion in assets and 125
branches in the Golden State when it completes two pending
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are in the midst of examining U.S. Bancorp's
community lending record as part of the process of reviewing the
bank's application to buy Western Bank, a community bank based in
Newport Beach (Orange County). By playing the Union Bank card,
Greenlining sharply raised the stakes of the review, since Union is
10 ten  &LR; times bigger than Western.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlining is asking regulators to postpone action on the
application until a study of the lending records of U.S. Bancorp
and Western is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a minor matter,'' said Robert Gnaizda,
Greenlining's policy director, in an interview. ``U.S. Bancorp
intends to be a major player. Within a year, they could be the
third-largest bank in California.``
</P>
<P>
   Gnaizda said his belief that U.S. Bancorp will try to buy Union
is based on a telephone conversation he had several months ago with
U.S. Bancorp chief executive Chief Executive  &LR; Jack Grundhofer, who
acknowledged an earlier bid.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that Union isn't interested in selling,
according to people close to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which owns just under
two-thirds of Union's stock, wants to keep a highly profitable
operation that turned out to be the crown jewel of its overseas
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Grundhofer told Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi executives that he was
interested in buying Union during a July 1998 trip to Japan. But
they never followed up, people familiar with the matter said.
Instead, U.S. Bancorp started buying up smaller California banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, U.S. Bancorp is interested in expanding its presence
in the state,'' said Joseph Morford, an analyst with the brokerage
Dain Rauscher Wessels. ``But Union's Japanese owners appear
committed to their investment in America.``
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on Greenlining's release, the San-Diego Union
Tribune reported yesterday that U.S. Bancorp might be eyeing
another bid for Union.
</P>
<P>
   The story was picked up by financial wire services, triggering a
brief surge in Union's stock. Union's shares ended up falling
$2.06, to $36.25, after an unidentified institutional stockholder
sold off a big stake.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Union and U.S. Bancorp declined to comment on
a possible takeover bid. U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman Marika
Cronin-Rose noted that the bank has pledged $2 billion for
California community lending programs and that federal regulators
have given the bank's community programs a satisfactory rating.

 &HT;    Leonard rides vibes to 67
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ By all reasonable logic, Justin Leonard
should have spent a numb post-Ryder Cup week, content to shake
hands as he returned to the PGA Tour but not likely to contend.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that might not be the case. Leonard trails leader Bob
Friend by two shots at the Buick Challenge, but a 5-under-par 67
Thursday has indicated something more than a ceremonial role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm surprised, but I'm very pleased,'' he
said. ``I think by playing a good round today, it will make it
easier for me to focus the rest of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend, who has reworked his swing this year and stands 164th on
the money list after a 1998 playoff loss to Billy Andrade in the
Canadian Open, had everything working Thursday. But it's a tough
week to steal attention away from a player on the cover of numerous
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Or his Ryder Cup teammates, for that matter. Steve Pate is a
stroke behind Leonard at 68. Davis Love III was at 70, with Jeff
Maggert at 73.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to individual goals again, Leonard almost has to
remind people that he's earned $1.7 million this year without
winning a PGA Tour event. Last week pushed him into golf history,
but not into next year's season-opening Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten any hardware and I'm not in Kapalua yet,''
Leonard said, ``but that's probably the only thing lacking. I'm
still trying to win a golf tournament. But if I don't win a
tournament . . . it's still been a wonderful year.''
</P>
<P>
   With perfect weather and the Mountain View course in typically
superb condition, the scoring went low for a lot of players. Tied
with Leonard at 67 were Trinidad's Stephen Ames, tour school rookie
Cameron Beckman, Harrison Frazar, Scott Gump, Frank Nobilo and
Frank Lickliter. Columbus' Larry Mize was in the group at 68.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ropes, things were different for Leonard. Indeed,
nearly almost as many people had found the way on the 17th green at
Brookline on Sunday as were following him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday pretty much prepared us for that,'' he said. ``There
were two people following us for four holes and we were all alone
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend had seven birdies and no bogeys. He is hoping that the
week might prevent a return trip to PGA Tour Qualifying School and
put an end to a ``pretty trying year''. At $159,149, he probably
needs another $200,000.

 CMGI Hooks Ad Firm Flycast  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the third time in two weeks, CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., has
snapped up a Bay Area business in its aggressive bid to dominate
the Internet advertising sector.
<P>
   Flycast Communications Corp., a San Francisco company that sells
advertising space on small and midsize Web sites, was yesterday's
target. CMGI is paying about $741 million in stock for Flycast.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CMGI said it would buy AdForce, a Cupertino ad
server, and CMGI's Engage Technologies Inc. agreed to purchase
Adknowledge, a Palo Alto ad manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really shaping up as a battle of the titans _ CMGI
versus DoubleClick,'' said Marcia Kadanoff, chief marketing officer
for IQ.com, a Saratoga company.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick is a New York Web ad manager that serves 11 billion
impressions _ or ad views _ per month. With the addition of
Flycast, which serves 1.4 billion ad impressions per month, CMGI
will serve more than 20 billion monthly impressions.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick could not be reached for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary rate of consolidation in the industry
``validates what we've always thought, which is that one year in
the Internet space is worth seven anywhere else,'' said Kadanoff, a
former Flycastexecutive.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast's unique technology measures the number of clicks
generated by specific ads on its network of 1,200 sites and
redirects ads according to where they receive the most attention
from surfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of opportunity for synergy''
between Flycast and other CMGI properties, said Lyn Chitow Oakes,
Flycast's chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Flycast complements CMGI's AdSmart unit, which uses a different
model, serving ads to big, name-brand sites, executives said. CMGI
will also look for efficiencies between Flycast and AdForce; the
two use different technologies to serve ads. And Flycast is
expected to dip into Engage's database of anonymous surfer profiles
to target its ads.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, which owns about 50 independently operated companies, will
issue .4738 of a share for each share of Flycast outstanding when
the deal closes, probably in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our 15th acquisition this year and the seventh in the
last three weeks,'' said David Wetherell, chief executive of CMGI,
in a conference call yesterday. ``Five of those have been in the
interactive marketing and advertising space. ... We have many more
acquisitions to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The media business is about scale and media moguls,'' said one
person close to yesterday's deal who did not want to be identified.
``The bigger you are, the more money you make. The more sites you
have in your network, the more ads you can attract.''
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Flycast announced its third-quarter revenues
will beat forecasts and its loss would be smaller than expected.
Shares of Flycast jumped $7.50, to $45.50. CMGI shares rose $2.19
yesterday to close at $102.50.

   SAROV, Russia _ The United States and Russia have quietly
resolved a long-simmering dispute over the illegal sale of
sophisticated IBM computers to Russia's leading nuclear weapons
lab, American officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the process both sides have helped open to cyberspace what
was once one of the most secret installations of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the 16 computers, now fully licensed and operational,
will be on display as part of the ``open computing center'' that
the American Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is to inaugurate at
the lab that developed Russia's hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The center is a joint project of the Energy Department and
Minatom, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, to which Washington
contributed $2.3 million. It is intended to help find jobs outside
the weapons industry for thousands of scientists, engineers and
technicians at this remote nuclear city and its premier lab.
</P>
<P>
   In quiet talks for more than two years Washington had insisted
that the computers, which IBM sold to Russia in 1996 without the
required export license, either be returned or openly dedicated to
nonweapons work. Russia initially refused, but earlier this year,
negotiators agreed that the computers would be incorporated into
the computer center, which is expected to create 80 technology jobs
in its first year and as many as 650 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The center is one of five projects planned here under the
Nuclear Cities Initiative, which Richardson began last year. It is
aimed at converting Russia's 10 closed nuclear cities to peaceful
work. But Congress severely cut the administration's request
earlier this week, granting the ambitious undertaking only $7
million of the $30 million sought.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson defended the initiative in an interview, saying he
hoped to use money from other weapons conversion programs to help
scientists here and at Snezhinsk and Zheleznogorsk, two other
nuclear cities, to convert to peaceful work. ``We are all concerned
that scientists might be forced by economic necessity to seek
employment in rogue states or among terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarov, some 250 miles southeast of Moscow, is the Russian
equivalent of Los Alamos National Laboratory, where America's
nuclear bombs were designed. But in addition to designing bombs,
this complex, roughly the size of Washington, D.C., still
engineers, fabricates and assembles nuclear weapons warheads and
components.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Soviet Union's effort to mimic the Manhattan
Project, Stalin established a nuclear complex here in 1946 and
closed the city. It takes its name from a monastery held sacred by
the Russian Orthodox for its link to one of the most revered
Russian saints, Seraphim of Sarov.
</P>
<P>
   The walled monastery became the site of the first Soviet nuclear
program under Stalin. The remote city was renamed Arzamas-16, which
appeared on no Soviet maps and was accessible to few. Not until
1990 did the Soviets acknowledge its existence. Russia restored the
city's historic name in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rady Ilkayev, director of the Russian lab and a prominent
physicist, talked Thursday about the institute's 30,000 employees,
and their struggle to survive the downsizing of the nuclear weapons
industry in this now impoverished city of 80,000. Ilkayev said the
institute's staff had shrunk almost in half, to 18,000 employees
from 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the institute once controlled virtually all of the
city's vital infrastructure, he said that 40 percent of Sarov's
transport, 90 percent of its medical infrastructure and 70 percent
of its sports arenas had now been transferred to the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of the lab's employees now work in the civilian
sector, but Ilkayev said he hoped to increase that proportion to 29
percent by 2002. He said this could be achieved partly by expanding
the institute's diamond-cutting business, its oil and gas
enterprises, and its production of hydraulic drives and medical
isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States provides some 86 percent of the $8
million that the institute receives each year in aid from foreign
governments and labs, Ilkayev called the United States his main
partner. He said that American support had helped ``prevent
critical leakage'' of key scientists with nuclear weapons
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that his institute would need $40 million over
three years to restructure the lab. With Russian bank interest
rates exceeding 50 percent, raising that amount of investment
capital domestically is impossible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had evaded American export laws by buying the IBM
computers in 1996 through Moscow-based middlemen. IBM installed
them here. Though a federal grand jury investigated the transfer,
no charges were brought against IBM.  &QL;

TIPS FOR CHECKING REFERENCES 
 &HT;     BY SAM MCMANIS

 _ SF CHRON   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Lyn Taylor, vice president at Robert Half International, a San
Francisco employment agency, says there are ways to get reluctant
supervisors and human resource workers to give information and
voice opinions about former employees. Among her recommendations:
<P>
   _Make reference calls yourself, rather than farm it out to
checking services. ``References are more willing to open up with
peers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _Make clear to the candidate that you will make a thorough
reference check and enlist his or her help in getting references to
be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   _If possible, get a candidate to sign a release protecting
former employers from liability.
</P>
<P>
   _Start at the bottom of a candidate's reference list and work
upward, because the candidate often lists the most flattering
reference first.
</P>
<P>
   _Start with basic questions when interviewing a candidate's
former employer, then gradually introduce subjective questions.
</P>
<P>
   _If a former employer is not forthcoming, read back to the
former employer that part of the candidate's resume that describes
the former job. ``If there's dishonesty or exaggeration, they may
feel compelled to set the record straight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _If a reference seems receptive, ask for more names of persons
in the organization who know the candidate.

MOVE BY OLIVETTI BACKFIRES WITH STOCK TRADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The head of Olivetti SpA struggled Thursday to reverse
the most serious trouble he has faced since gaining control in May
of Telecom Italia. The chief executive, Roberto Colaninno, said he
would meet with institutional investors next Tuesday in Milan and
on Wednesday and Thursday in London in an effort to halt a flight
of investment capital from the Italian telecommunications giant.
</P>
<P>
   The market damage has been caused by the decision announced on
Tuesday to strip Telecom Italia of its most-valued asset, its
highly profitable cellular phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, and
transfer it to Tecnost, the Olivetti subsidiary used by Colaninno
to purchase control of Telecom Italia. The move was intended to
help Tecnost pay back the debt it took on to finance the $33
billion acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by what they apparently saw as a rude surprise, stock
investors punished the companies Thursday for the second
consecutive day, driving down the price of Olivetti shares 3.7
percent, after a 7 percent drop on Wednesday; Tecnost shares fell
4.4 percent, after an 11.4 percent loss Wednesday. The stock of
Telecom Italia gave up nearly 3 percent. The only market gainer was
the cellular phone unit in flux, Telecom Italia Mobile, whose
shares rose 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Colaninno's move put him in an awkward position,
one that contrasted sharply with the triumph he enjoyed in May,
when Olivetti, a former typewriter maker, succeeded in acquiring a
company more than five times its size.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the defection of key Telecom Italia shareholders to
Olivetti's side helped Colaninno overcome a rival bid for Telecom
Italia by Deutsche Telekom and win the biggest hostile-takeover
battle in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno has insisted that the move to strip Telecom Italia's
mobile phone unit _ transferring Telecom Italia's 60 percent stake
in that company to Tecnost and compensating Telecom Italia's
minority shareholders with Tecnost shares _ is part of an
industrial plan, and not purely a financial maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter published Thursday in The Financial Times, Colaninno
said the transfer would ``facilitate the efficient servicing of our
debt,'' but also give the companies the flexibility needed for
``value-enhancing alliances'' and tools to help overcome a legacy
of inefficiency at Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors apparently hoped that the Italian government,
which holds a 3.95 percent share in Telecom Italia, enabling it to
veto major changes, would intervene to block the plan. But Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema said Thursday that the government could
only intervene if Telecom Italia asked it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who spoke in a radio interview, is under pressure from
political opponents, who fear the dismemberment of the former state
telephone monopoly. But there is also concern that a loss of
investor confidence in the Italian capital markets will hurt the
planned sale of nearly $7.5 billion of shares in the Italian state
energy utility, Enel SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno's plan has also come under attack in Italy by groups
representing Telecom Italia employees and by consumer
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Giuliano Amato, the minister of the treasury, which
effectively controls the government's shares in Telecom Italia, is
expected to face questioning by the nation's Senate about the plan.
Amato has supported the position of nonintervention taken Thursday
by D'Alema.

BUSH PUSHES TEXAS CLOSER TO FEDERAL WELFARE CAP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, in a move that sparked
protests from key state lawmakers, is taking steps to permanently
cut parents and children off of welfare sooner than state law
requires, his office confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a document heading to Washington on Friday, the Bush
administration is effectively opting for Texas to adopt the federal
welfare reform law's five-year, lifetime cap on cash welfare
benefits. Under the 1996 federal law, parents and children can be
permanently barred from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
when a parent hits the five-year limit.
</P>
<P>
   The tough federal law was set to replace the state's more
generous welfare reform law in 2002, but Bush's move speeds up the
process by retroactively applying the five-year limit in most
cases. That means the clock would have begun ticking on benefits in
1996 instead of in 2002. From the governor's point of view, the
federal law doesn't contradict state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because state law does not address maximum benefit limits, the
state falls under federal law that limits lifetime benefits to five
years,'' said Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrville Republican Rep. Harvey Hilderbran, the House sponsor
of the state's landmark 1995 welfare reforms, said he always
assumed the federal clock was ticking anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were silent on that. In my point of view there's not a
conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Democrat Sen. Judith Zaffirini, who carried the
legislation in the Texas Senate and chairs that chamber's Human
Services Committee, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really shocked. I'm shocked at this move, shocked at this
action because it's inconsistent with legislative intent as I
perceive it,'' she said, adding that several measures to place
lifetime caps on welfare benefits have repeatedly been rejected by
state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always worried about the children and made sure that
the children don't pay for the sins of the parents,'' she added.
``Our legislation does not impose lifetime benefit cuts and that
issue was debated. It was considered. We did not support it, and we
knowingly did not support it, willingly did not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Elliott Naishtat, chairman of the House Human
Services Committee, complained that until this week the governor
had cut legislators ``out of the loop'' on the welfare plan. Bush's
action ``smells of politics,'' said Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston,
and a co-sponsor of the state welfare reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon a Naishtat aide checked recorded tapes of
last-minute wrangling on the state welfare bill and reported that
lawmakers were not silent on the issue of lifetime benefit cuts in
1995. The House had agreed to them, but the Senate had rejected the
idea. When the bill was reconciled between the chambers, lawmakers
chose a five-year ``freeze out'' from benefits instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To retroactively penalize children for the sins of their
parents would be unconscionable,'' said Coleman. ``We made a choice
in 1995 to exempt children from any time limits, and now the
governor wants to change the rules in the middle of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 children will be cut from welfare benefits
one year earlier and up to 300 more children two years earlier
under the governor's plan, Naishtat said. Roughly 5,500 adults
would be permanently severed from benefits one to three years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health and Human Services Commissioner Don Gilbert said
Thursday that the impact on children is not as great as some seem
to think. Under state law, a parent is forced off of welfare after
one to three years and then is ``frozen out'' from benefits for
another five years. If the parent is not working during that freeze
out, the child is still eligible for welfare benefits. It is not
until the parent returns to welfare and uses up the rest of the
five years, that the child falls permanently off the rolls as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the earliest a Texas child will first be forced
off the rolls will already be in their teens in the year 2006,
Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coleman and Naishtat complain that the governor is
attempting to accomplish bureaucratically a major welfare policy
change that the state Legislature again failed to adopt last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Bush is taking advantage of a federal rule that
requires states operating under welfare waivers to list
inconsistencies between their state laws and the federal one.
Friday is the deadline for doing so. The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services has some jurisdiction over the issue because the
vast majority of welfare money comes from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush points out no inconsistencies on the issue, the federal
government will automatically assume the federal provisions apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair. Our state law should stand. If the law is
supposed to be the law, then no one has the right to do something
differently than the law,'' Coleman said. ``The reality is on its
face, it's inconsistent. That's why in my opinion it's so egregious
to reinterpret something to meet your ends.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 21 memo to the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission, which must submit the document at Bush's behest, a
welfare official at the Texas Workforce Commission suggested
exactly that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The federal certification process provides ``an unprecedented
opportunity'' for Bush, wrote Larry E. Temple, director of welfare
reform initiatives. He said the governor could now ensure that the
state's welfare reform effort ``remains on the philosophical track
that complements his vision for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple also noted that his own agency ``recognizes that an
inconsistency does exist with federal law'' in the sense that state
law only applies time limits to adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWC believes that the governor should not certify this
inconsistency,'' Temple wrote. ``The result of claiming this
inconsistency would prolong the time that families are on welfare
and be in conflict with the goals set forth in the governor's
five-point welfare reform plan.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas Department of Human Services, however, Commissioner
Eric Bost recommended against that policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients have been informed by DHS that the federal time limit
may apply, but they have not been informed that it does apply,'' he
said. ``As a matter of fairness, a reasonable notice to clients at
the beginning of the maximum lifetime federal time limit should be
provided.''

 &HT;    Crew chief: Over and out
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The successful duo of Jeff Gordon and Ray Evernham is
history, but not the team's place in NASCAR's history books.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the driver, and Evernham, the crew chief, formed one of
the greatest combinations in the sport's modern era, winning three
Winston Cup championships. The twosome, which had the circuit's
longest-running working relationship, parted ways this week.
Evernham was given a provisional release, effective immediately,
from his duties as crew chief from Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were probably the all-time best,'' Team Sabco
owner Felix Sabates said. ``Jeff and Ray seemed to have special
chemistry. They respected each other and worked together very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt and Kirk Shelmerdine teamed together to win four
Cup championships, one of the few crew-chief-driver combinations to
rival the success of Gordon and Evernham in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about Jeff Gordon's talent,'' said H.A.
``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte.
``With Jeff and Ray Evernham together, though, they were virtually
unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Gordon has been in NASCAR, Evernham, who makes all
race-day calls, has been the voice in his ear during races. Gordon
was named Busch Series rookie of the year in 1991 and moved up to
the top circuit on a full-time basis two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham was with Gordon every step of the way during the
meteoric rise of the No. 24 team. They won Cup championships in
three of the last four seasons and posted 47 career victories,
including five this year to tie Jeff Burton for the series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is one of the most talented guys we've ever had in racing,
and he certainly has been an instrumental part in everything Jeff
Gordon has accomplished,'' Wheeler said. ``Evernham's real forte
has always been in the handling of the car. It's almost like a
black magic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ray Evernham is one of the brightest, most ingenious
and skilled people who has been involved in Winston Cup racing,''
owner Jack Roush said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was official, Cup points leader Dale Jarrett compared
the departure of Evernham with other heralded breakups in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's forever,'' Jarrett said, ``as good as things seem
that they may be. It's not just this sport; you see it everywhere.
You wonder why things get broken up, why everybody on the Chicago
Bulls wanted to go in a different direction when they had the world
beat. The Dallas Cowboys have everything going their way, and
everybody starts doing different things, and it creates problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different goals and ideas, and whenever you reach
those goals sometimes you want to do something a little different.
Once that happens, though, it starts creating a problem within the
team, and it's hard to get that back, no matter how hard you try.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon admitted that the speculation surrounding Evernham was a
distraction for the team. The No. 24 car finished 17th last weekend
at Dover. Now, it will be interesting to see what effect it will
have. Hendrick mechanic Brian Whitesell will replace Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Ray has done a great job, and as (the No. 24) team
goes forward, they will have trouble re-creating the same level of
communication, efficiency and end results,'' Roush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Sabates said, ``the drivers are the
ones driving the race. I am a firm believer that you take Jeff
Gordon in my car, and he probably wins as many races for me as he
did for Hendrick. He may not win 10 one year, but he probably wins
eight. But if I put Evernham to be crew chief for one of my cars,
he may not win but one race. I think the driver makes 80 percent of
the race team.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Resume Fairy Tales Have Companies on Guard  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Resume fibbing has been around since, well, resumes. After Adam was
expelled from the garden for biting into the apple, an old business
joke goes, he put down ``quality control supervisor, Eden Produce''
on his resume.
<P>
   Laughter abruptly stops, however, when seemingly innocuous
fibbing turns into gross exaggeration or out-and-out lying. Often,
the results are far from harmless for the employee, who loses his
job and reputation, and the company, which bears the cost of
replacing the employee and might lose prestige.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, several high-profile people have had lies,
omissions or excessive resume puffery come back to haunt their
careers in embarrassing public flaps:
</P>
<P>
   _In August, E. Michael Campbell, a renowed Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory physicist heading the $1.2 billion National Ignition
Facility project, resigned after it was revealed that he never
earned his doctorate from Princeton University, as he had stated.
</P>
<P>
   _Also in August, Buddy Tate Choy admitted that he lied about
earning a clinical social worker's license to get his job as social
services director for the San Francisco Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1996, it was revealed that San Francisco Police Chief Fred
Lau never finished his undergraduate degree at San Francisco State
University, despite saying so on his resume. Lau remains in office,
and Mayor Willie Brown told The Chronicle, ``I don't know anyone
who doesn't lie on their resume.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of resume fabrication in the public and private
sectors may not be as all-inclusive as Brown states, but it is
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association recently reported that 67
percent of all job seekers fabricate or embellish their managerial
or supervisory duties on resumes. A 1998 survey by the Society of
Human Resources Management showed that 90 percent of respondents
who checked candidates' past job titles, employment length and
salary histories reported some falsification. And Personnel Journal
reports that more than 500,000 people are claiming a bogus college
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls don't show such a high degree of deception. Edward
C. Andler, who runs the Certified Reference Checking Company out of
St. Louis, says 36 percent of all resumes contain some form of
untruth, an increase of 24 percent since he first polled
corporations in 1979. Robert Half International, the San Francisco
employment agency, polled executives from Fortune 1,000 companies
and found that 30 percent of job candidates lie on resumes.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you stand by the aphorism, ``There are three types
of lies: Lies, damned lies and statistics,'' the numbers suggest
that there is as much fiction being pawned off by job applicants as
there is fact.
</P>
<P>
   Many large and midsize midsized  &LR; corporations do in-house
reference and criminal checking on applicants, and about 50
reference-checking firms &UR;  &LR; in the nation offer services ranging from
routine checking of college transcripts to verifying claims of
sales awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business 20 years, and (resume lying) has
significantly increased the last 10 or so years,'' said P. Anthony
Price, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, a San
Francisco executive search firm. ``But there also is much more
diligence by many companies in reference checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you look at all the startups on the Peninsula and,
you know, many don't give a hoot what education credentials some
people have if they have the intellect and accomplishments. On the
executive level, though, I and my colleagues have interviewed at
least four or five alumni from Reebok, and each of those
individuals claimed singular responsibility for having invented the
`pump' shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Many hiring directors can regale listeners with yarns of
fabulous fabrications from resumes that quickly were run through
the shredder.
</P>
<P>
   There's the tale of the applicant who claimed CFO experience in
the restaurant industry when he actually worked the cash register
at Taco Bell. There's the guy who covered a three-month stint in
the county jail as a ``sabbatical'' from his job.
</P>
<P>
   There's the now-infamous story of M. Larry Lawrence, former U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland who got the appointment partly because he
said he was a war hero who suffered a head injury when a German
torpedo struck his merchant marine ship in 1945. Truth was,
Lawrence was attending a junior college in Chicago at the time. In
1997, when that fact was revealed, Lawrence's body was exhumed from
Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly
everything on the resume of Jeffrey Papows, president of IBM's
Lotus Development Corp., was fabricated, from his daring Marine
exploits as an aviator (he never flew) to his Ph.D. from Pepperdine
University (it actually was from an unaccredited correspondence
school), from his black belt in tae kwon do (he has a
less-impressive red belt) to his hardship as an orphan (his
parents, very much alive, live in Massachusetts).
</P>
<P>
   Whoppers like that aside, the best lies, the really plausible
and elaborately detailed ones, sometimes enable the cheater to
prosper and climb the corporate ladder _ at least until the truth
comes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing more instances of lying exposed because
(companies) are checking more,'' said Andler, author of ``The
Complete Reference Checking Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started my business 12 years ago,'' he said, ``it was
just missionary work, trying to convince companies that they needed
to check. Now, it's become a full-fledged industry. But the job
seekers still are lying. I think people are either careless or
bold.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the boldness _ and bald-faced lying _ comes from
applicants conferring a college degree upon themselves, according
to Roger D. Sommer, a vice president with Interim Career Consulting
in Los Angeles and chairman of the employment committee for the
Society of Human Resources Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a Ph.D. candidate will lie and say he's got a
doctorate, like the physicist in Livermore, but most of the time,
it's more blatant,'' Sommer said. ``I had a human resources friend
of mine who was going to just invent a degree from UCLA, and she'd
never been there. We talked her out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bridgeport, Conn., man made a living selling phony college
degrees and transcripts on the Internet, complete with
authentic-looking diplomas. The business, Prestigious Images, was
forced to close in 1998 after threats of trademark infringement
from top universities.
</P>
<P>
   Lying about education is most prevalent, experts say, because
many job announcements have specific degree qualifications. Many
applicants also know that many large corporations scan thousands of
resumes into a database and then type in keywords such as Ph.D. or
M.B.A. to weed out the underqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer screening is a problem for companies,'' Andler said.
``They waste a lot of time interviewing people with fabricated
credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto receives as many as 3,000
resumes a day, but it does not do complete reference checking until
late in the hiring process, said workforce planning manager Susan
Lovegren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put our candidates through any of that until they've
been made an offer,'' Lovegren said. ``But we really don't rely
much on the resume. We have prospective employees fill out and sign
a pre-employment questionnaire that's seven pages long, verifying
education, criminal background, previous employment, personal
references. It's been very effective in catching those kind of
(lies).''
</P>
<P>
   Other common fabrications include inflating salary history,
puffing up job titles, plugging gaps in employment histories and
embellishing achievements on projects.
</P>
<P>
   To many hiring executives, an applicant who omits a brief,
unpleasant stint with companies also is perceived as deceptive. But
some believe otherwise, including Gerry Crispin, vice president of
staffing at Shaker Advertising Agency in East Brunswick, N.J., and
vice president of the Society of Human Resources Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resume is an obsolete document that essentially is a
letter of introduction,'' Crispin said. ``From the job seeker's
point of view, it should be a marketing tool that tells the best
truths about that individual. That's it. Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a resume is to demonstrate that discussion
should continue. If you are a felon, do you put `I am a felon' on
your resume? Of course not. Now, does the signed job application
require that? In most cases, yes. So that's when the prison guy
should hand over his application and say, `There's something on the
application we need to talk about.' But on his resume, the things
that gets him in the door? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Sommer: ``Yes, it's a marketing document, but it
doesn't give you license to lie. You should put down all your
employment history that's relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies often do not have the resources to do thorough
reference checking. Andler, whose reference-checking company
handles business of medium to large companies, says there are 48
reference-checking firms in the United States, most relatively new.
Cost for checking a resume runs from $12 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   One specializing in helping smaller businesses is Credentials
LLC, an Illinois firm that runs the Internet service
 &LR; www.degreechk.com/  &LR; which signs contracts with most major
universities to tap into the school's database to glean the basic
information about students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small businesses really need help,'' said Jack Weber,
executive vice president of Degreechk.com. ``I worked for a small
manufacturer for 15 years, employing 150 people, and we never once
verified a resume. In a small company, if you're interviewing a
person who looks presentable, can carry on a decent conversation
and knows basically what he's talking about, you're more than
likely going to hire him. Our basic, same-day degree checking costs
$12.50, and employers can find out right then if the person's
telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Half International released survey results last year
showing that only 63 percent of Fortune 1,000 executives polled are
honest in their assessments of former staff members when contacted
by reference checkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, companies only give you name, rank and serial
number,'' said Taylor of Robert Half International, ``because if
you say something positive about someone and it doesn't pan out,
you could be sued. If it's negative, you can be sued. If it's no
comment, sometimes you can be sued. But if you get five references
from (an applicant) that can't give you anything but name, rank and
serial number, it could be a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Mathiason, an employment law specialist with Littler
Mendelson in San Francisco, said that since 1938, cq &LR; California has
had criminal and civil laws prohibiting a prior employer from
giving false information about an ex-employee in a reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, you've got general concern by companies that if
you give information about an employee, that the information will
be libelous or slanderous even though they believe it to be true,''
Mathiason said. ``There's a limited exception carved into
(California's) defamation statute where if giving information is
done in a business purpose and it is provided in good faith, it
would not qualify for slander or defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathiason said companies need to be vigilant in reference
checking to avoid negligent-hiring suits.
</P>
<P>
   There have been cases, experts say, in which longtime employees
caught in a resume lie have sued for wrongful termination even
though they admit to the fabrication. They point to their years of
service on the job and positive performance reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of E. Michael Campbell, the Lawrence Livermore
physicist who withheld that he never finished his doctorate, many
hiring professionals say Campbell's track record as one of the
world's leading experts in high-energy lasers should hold more
weight than a lie told when he joined Lawrence Livermore in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell stepped down as head of the lab's laser project and is
on personal leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you don't fire somebody like that,'' said Pierre
Mornell, a Mill Valley hiring consultant and author of ``45
Effective Ways of Hiring Smart.'' ``They've proven themselves.
We're living in real life here. You talk to them about it. You tell
them they aren't going to be fired, based on their track record.
But you sure do ask them why they did it.''

FORD WILL REPORTEDLY SHED PARTS UNIT AND GIVE GUARANTEES TO
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. plans to spin off its giant auto parts
division directly to shareholders and give wage and job guarantees
to the division's factory workers in a contract under negotiation
with the United Automobile Workers union, said people familiar with
the company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The parts division's future has been a major problem for Ford as
it tries to hammer out a new labor contract. The company had
considered selling the unit, called Visteon Automotive Systems, to
either Lear Corp. or to Delphi Automotive Systems Inc., which was
itself spun off in May from General Motors Corp. the people said.
</P>
<P>
   But labor issues along with tax considerations have instead
convinced Ford to spin off Visteon, which had $17.8 billion in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, GM reached tentative agreement with the UAW
union on a four-year contract that included annual raises of 3
percent a year on top of inflation adjustments, plus increased
pension benefits and a $1,350 signing bonus. Delphi, with $28.5
billion in revenue and 48,000 UAW workers, also reached an
agreement Tuesday with the union on a separate labor contract with
nearly identical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Those agreements included a promise to allow Delphi workers who
retire by the end of 1999 to be covered by GM's pension plan,
effectively a three-month extension of a promise given when Delphi
was spun off to GM shareholders. After that point, they would be
covered by a similar Delphi pension plan. The factory workers have
lobbied for coverage under the parent company because they worry
that the parts company may be less financially solid.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Delphi has reached a deal with the union on how its
workers will be treated, the union is expected to allow Ford to
follow the same pattern for Visteon's 23,500 workers, according to
a person close to the union, making a tax-free spinoff of Visteon
to shareholders more attractive. After the spinoff, Visteon would
agree to a four-year contract with the same wage, benefit and job
protections contained in the Ford pact.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Labor contracts for the 400,000 factory workers at GM, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler were to expire Sept. 14, but have been extended as
the union negotiates new contracts. DaimlerChrysler was the first
to reach agreement, and the union has demanded that the other
automakers accept the pattern of wages and benefits laid out in the
DaimlerChrysler contract.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Visteon factories had opposed a sale or spinoff,
worrying that their wages and pensions would not be as stable at
Visteon as they would be at Ford. In recent weeks, some of
Visteon's salaried employees have sent e-mail messages to
management, protesting plans to sell the unit to another auto parts
maker, fearing that their jobs would be eliminated because of
overlap with the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Senior company officials exploring the sale of Visteon ran into
tax roadblocks. They could not devise favorable tax treatments for
selling Visteon to another auto parts maker, an executive close to
the planning said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had worried that an agreement attached to DaimlerChrysler's
labor contract that designed to limit asset sales would hinder
Ford's ability to sell Visteon. However, union and Ford officials
said that they expect the union to allow Ford to shed Visteon as
long as it follows the pattern set by Delphi earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, a spinoff of Visteon seems
appealingly simple to Ford. Union and company officials anticipate
they will agree on a labor contract covering Ford's 101,033
unionized workers as soon as the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   While the labor situation is fluid, and Ford could always change
its plans for Visteon if a buyer offered a higher price for it, a
person familiar with the company's plans said, Ford expected to
announce within a month its intention to spin off Visteon to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had been discussing a sale of Visteon to Lear for several
months, but the possibility of Delphi buying Visteon has not been
previously reported. In a surprising move, Richard Shoemaker, a
union vice president in charge of relations with GM, suggested in
closed-door meetings that Delphi consider buying Visteon, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   A Delphi spokesman, Peter Rowe, said Thursday, ``we've evaluated
pieces of Visteon's business over the years, as we would any
supplier.'' But he denied that discussions had gone beyond that
point.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford spokesman, Jim Cain, declined to discuss the company's
plans for Visteon. But Ford has told Wall Street analysts in the
past that shedding Visteon would make sense only if the transaction
were tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said antitrust concerns would have
complicated, but probably not scuttled, the merger of any big auto
parts companies by forcing the divestiture of certain product
lines. Early last year, when Federal-Mogul Corp. bought T&AMP;N PLC, of
Britain, the Federal Trade Commission determined that the combined
company had too high a share in the thin-wall engine bearing
business, and forced Federal-Mogul to sell T&AMP;N's global
engine-bearing business to Dana Corp.

   WASHINGTON _ Lifted by the strong economy, American households
are climbing out of the income stagnation that has plagued them for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rising incomes brought 1.1 million poor Americans out of poverty
last year and the percentage of people still below the official
poverty line fell to the lowest level since 1989, the Census Bureau
reported on Thursday. While blacks failed to increase their incomes
or lower their numbers living in poverty, as they had in 1997, they
held onto the gains that have come to them as a result of the boom
that began four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat annual report on trends in American wages issued by
the Census Bureau suggested that the strong economy and the lowest
unemployment rate in 30 years have played big roles in improving
the lot of millions of American households.
</P>
<P>
   ``You raise wages in the short run by tightening the labor
market, but that has its limits,'' said Frank Levy, a labor
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``You
cannot make the unemployment rate much lower than it already is,
and if wages are to continue to rise, that depends on the
productivity of workers and their bargaining clout with
management.''
</P>
<P>
   The most troubling aspect of the Census Bureau report concerned
income inequality. Although incomes rose last year for most
households, the spreads between the rich and the poor, and the rich
and middle-income Americans, have failed to narrow in the
prosperous late 1990s. And 1998 was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes were another matter. The income of the median household,
meaning that half the nation's households earn more and half less,
recovered the ground that had been lost in the 1990s, and a bit
more. The median rose by 3.5 percent, the biggest jump in 13 years,
to $38,885, finally edging past the 1989 figure of $37,997,
adjusted for inflation. Households both above and below the median
also enjoyed roughly similar improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But income inequality has been resistant to the economic boom. A
high-end household, with an annual income of $133,000, for example,
still earns eight times more than a family at the poverty line of
$16,655 for a four-person household. That has been the ratio since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton saw a glass half full in the failure to
shrink income inequality. Noting that the gaps had widened during
the 1980s economic expansion, he argued that economic growth in the
1990s has been powerful enough to halt the process. ``Finally we
have stemmed the tide of rising inequality,'' he said, ``and this
new report documents the strong income growth among all groups of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less sanguine. After six years of recession or weak
expansion, they note, a period of unusually strong economic growth
kicked in four years ago. Unemployment, at 4.5 percent last year,
was at its lowest level in decades. Wages have risen for tens of
millions of Americans, even after allowing for inflation. The
economy is indeed lifting many boats, but a rising economy, the
critics argue, has not yet been sufficient to reduce income
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the strongest economy in 30 years is unable to ameliorate
this serious economic and social problem, there is a strong
rationale for public policy that addresses these concerns,'' said
Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy
Institute, which favors a higher minimum wage and laws that would
strengthen unions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now considering a proposal to raise the minimum wage
to $6.15 in two annual installments of 50 cents each.
Administration officials argued on Thursday that the earned income
tax credit, by rebating money to low-income households, has played
a role in reducing poverty and preventing the income gap from
widening. Citing this view, Clinton criticized Republicans on
Thursday for a proposal now before Congress to defer some of those
tax rebates.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year since 1994, more than a million Americans
rose above the official poverty line. The percentage of the
population still in poverty fell to 12.7 percent, or 34.5 million
people, from 13.3 percent, the lowest level since 1989. The rate
among blacks, 26.1 percent, is the lowest level on record, though
it is still a striking 2.5 times greater than the rate for whites.
But for the first time since 1993, there was no noticeable change
from the previous year. Hispanics, on the other hand, dropped their
poverty rate by nearly 1.5 percentage points, to 25.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, American workers accomplished this feat in part
by working longer hours, but in 1998 time spent on the job leveled
off at 3,149 hours a year _ roughly 60 a week _ barely changed from
the 3,139 hours in 1997, according to an analysis of the Census
data by the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But other comparisons made the 1998 numbers seem less
impressive. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called
attention to the fact that the poverty rate, for all its decline in
recent years, is still above the rate for any year in the 1970s.
Similarly, poverty rates among children, which are higher in the
United States than in Canada or Western Europe, fell a full
percentage point, to 18.9 percent. But that level is well above the
rate in the 1970s.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then, too, the decline in the poverty rate came almost entirely
as a result of a sharp drop in the South. Everywhere else, there
was no change to speak of, the Census Bureau said. The South, in
fact, has shrunk the percentage of people in poverty throughout the
decade _ partly because many companies have moved operations there,
generating millions of jobs, and partly because a big percentage of
the population earns the minimum wage and thus benefited from
increases in that minimum in 1997 and 1998. Poverty in the West, by
contrast, has risen during the decade, partly because of an
unusually large influx of immigrants, some economists say.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau, in its annual report, highlights household
income, because that includes virtually every American, including
unmarried young people living alone or with friends. Family income
is also calculated and that showed a similar improvement in 1998,
the median level rising to $46,737 in 1998 from $45,262.

 NEW YORK: amendment rights. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The museum's lawyer, Floyd Abrams, was asking Judge Nina Gershon
to schedule a hearing when Michael Hess, the city's corporation
counsel, announced that the city had filed its own suit.
</P>
<P>
   Hess contended that since the city had brought suit in state
court, the federal suit filed by the museum should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon said she would consider the city's request, and
told both sides to submit papers by Oct. 4 on all the issues in the
case, including on whether she should dismiss it. The judge will
hold another hearing on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's most widely discussed work, Chris Ofili's
``Holy Virgin Mary,'' was ensconced behind a Plexiglas shield in a
small alcove, with a guard posted nearby, in an apparent effort to
forestall any overt acts of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Four more of Ofili's works, all executed in his favored medium,
elephant dung, are also on view. All display his hallmark technique
of supporting the main body of work on two footlike pedestals of
dried pachyderm product, which is said by collectors to lose its
smell after it has aired out for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also contains several pieces by Damien Hirst, who
works mostly in dead fish and animals. These include a shark, a
sliced-up cow, a lamb and a bisected pig in formaldehyde-filled
cases, and a Rube Goldberg-like device in which maggots feed on a
dead cow's head and give rise to flies, which are eventually zapped
by an electrical device called an ``insect-o-cutor.'' This last is
said to be a meditation on mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the publicity that the controversy has generated, the
museum played host to hundreds of reporters and photographers
Thursday morning for a first look at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to see so many members of the press interested in
art,'' Arnold Lehman, the museum's director, said dryly, welcoming
the unaccustomed horde.
</P>
<P>
   But the embattled curator quickly turned serious, saying:
``Public funding of the arts is an investment in the values and the
ideals embodied in the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution. I hope that people will choose to see this
exhibition. I also hope they have the right to choose not to see
this exhibition. That is what democracy in America is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's something else I'd like to say,'' he added. ``The
Brooklyn Museum is more than just one work of art that incorporates
animal dung.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman staunchly defended Ofili's choice of artistic
material, saying that the use of animal dung is venerated in many
African cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they tell us is not a story of blasphemy, but of
reverence,'' he said. ``But it is in a language that is foreign to
many of us raised in the tradition of Western culture. Having these
sacred objects in our museums teach us lessons of tolerance,
understanding and diversity. If people do not make the effort to
understand, if people do not exercise tolerance and mutual respect,
then we all suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani continued to fulminate against the exhibition
Thursday from Bakersfield, Calif., where he was on a political
fund-raising jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the motivation is commercial
motivation. You'd have to be a fool not to see that,'' the mayor
said of the dispute that he himself stirred up. ``This is
essentially what you do to promote some kind of commercial
enterprise.''

PLUGGING THE DIKE AT WORK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Fla.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

   Every once in a while, a worker's absence, for vacation or
whatever other reason, brings a request for a colleague to take on
new or unfamiliar duties. It's the old sink-or-swim situation.
Sometimes it's a near-drowning experience, but it can also offer
buoyant memories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, George Zucker of Haverford, Pa., was working
at a small radio station in Savannah, Ga., and pursuing his dream
of becoming a disk jockey. When the Sunday morning D.J. went on
vacation, Zucker was asked to work his shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had to do was sign the station on and play
easy-listening music until the remote broadcast from the Taliaferro
Baptist Church,'' Zucker writes. ``As the church announcer, my job
was to introduce the pastor, then fade-in the chorus. Taliaferro
was pronounced `toliver,' and I learned it wasn't the only language
that needed watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I turned up the chorus that first Sunday morning, there was
only silence. Fearing the remote feed was lost, I uttered an
unchurchly expletive, a strong sibilant, which wafted into the
homes of all awaiting the holy word. The mike was open, which is
why I didn't hear the chorus in my earphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the pastor and his flock heard me loud and clear,
blessedly no one complained to the station.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Barbara S. Arion of Queens, N.Y., was a
teen-ager, she worked in the summer for the department store in a
small city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two women who worked in the stationery
department,'' she writes. ``One was on vacation, and the other
became ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arion and another teen-ager were assigned to fill their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was priced, as these two ladies had worked for the
store for years and knew every piece of their merchandise,'' she
says. ``We young people knew nothing of Crane and Eaton stationery,
as we could not afford these items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, for the two weeks that we worked in the department, we
sold everything at the only pricing we knew _ Woolworth's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management never knew the difference. They thanked us for our
effort, as we had worked diligently and kept the stock neat and the
counter attractive. This type of problem would not exist today
because of the UPC code and computerization.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1986, and the place was Khartoum, the Sudan. Most
Americans had been evacuated after a terrorist incident in which a
United States embassy employee was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Louise M. Jones, now of Sebring, Fla., was the embassy's
procurement agent. A reduction in staff prompted by the incident
meant that everyone took on extra tasks, ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones soon found herself adding the duties of the personnel
officer, then the refugee affairs officer. At the same time, she
and her husband, Tim, an Army warrant officer attached to the
embassy, assumed unofficial but vital duties as hosts of occasional
gatherings in their home to help the morale of the remaining,
fearful staff.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Ms. Jones's services were volunteered to replace
the consular officer in charge of issuing visas. Then she found
herself dealing with the complaints of two Sudanese employees who
said they were overwhelmed by problems involving landlords,
contractors and suppliers, along with impatient visa applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I realized I was having equal difficulty in coping with
the sheer quantity of clients as well as with the confusion of
switching hats several times within an hour,'' Ms. Jones said. ``I
gave notice that I was going on strike and relinquishing
administrative duties within a week and would also be taking time
off to prepare for our scheduled departure from the Sudan in the
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones continues: ``I don't claim to have done it all well,
but I did do it all, as did my colleagues. I realized how unique
was my situation when, one day, I found myself in the health unit,
as the only American woman available on site, to be present during
the gynecological exam of a patient by the male physician's
assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   During the exam, she said, ``I sat absorbing information in a
catalogue about specifications for septic tanks for the homes of
embassy personnel and had to be stirred from my reverie to be told
the exam was over and that I could leave.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican strategy to help finance the party's
spending plans by delaying federal tax breaks for working-class
families appeared doomed Thursday by opposition from the party's
senators and its leading presidential candidate, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strongly criticized the Republican plan, which calls for
delaying payments of the earned-income tax credit, a tax break for
20 million working-class Americans. The proposal was the brainchild
of his fellow Texas Republican, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs
of the poor,'' Bush said. It was the first major policy dispute
between Bush and Republicans in Congress, and it erupted despite
his pledge in June to refrain from criticizing them.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay responded by saying of Bush, ``He obviously doesn't
understand how Congress works.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fiscal year came to an end at midnight Thursday night
without a coherent budget from Congress, President Clinton signed a
measure keeping the government running for three weeks, while
warning Republicans to lay off ``gimmicks and gamesmanship'' in
their spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed that continuing spending bill not because I wanted
to,'' Clinton said, ``but because it was the only way to prevent
another government shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line at the end of the fiscal year was that
Republicans, having pledged repeatedly and passionately to write a
budget that would not use Social Security funds, now find
themselves billions of dollars shy of that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to do it,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But to fail after making such fervent promises, many Republicans
believe, would be a political nightmare, unless they can
convincingly blame Clinton for the failure.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republican leaders, including Hastert, brandished
copies of a letter from the Congressional Budget Office that they
said proved that they could complete the year's spending bills
without dipping into the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter, one paragraph long and without supporting data,
was based on a plan to limit spending to $592 billion. The House
Republicans' own figures, circulated among members on Wednesday,
show them spending at least $600 billion, which would require a
$7.6 billion dip into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' plan was to cover that cost by delaying
payments of the earned-income tax credit. By breaking the payments
to the 20 million workers into monthly disbursements instead of
making them in annual lump sums as in the past, the Republicans
would push $8.7 billion of the payments into the fiscal year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   With a few other spending and savings adjustments, they would
bring their budget in $400 million shy of the need to spend Social
Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working people don't need help with their annual budget,''
DeLay argued Thursday. ``They need help with their monthly
budget.'' Hastert defended the idea as ``good policy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, DeLay single-handedly pushed an amendment
delaying the tax credit payments into the $85 billion spending bill
financing the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services
departments, winning a party-line vote in the House Appropriations
Committee. That means the idea is likely to come to a vote on the
House floor in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea, the heart and soul of the House Republicans' plan
to avoid spending Social Security funds, appeared to suffer fatal
political damage from Bush's opposition. Even if it survives a vote
in the full House, senior Republican senators strongly oppose it
and Clinton said Thursday he would never sign a spending bill
including the provision.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay learned of Bush's opposition while pushing the plan in the
Appropriations Committee hearing. Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the
ranking Democrat on the committee, read Bush's comments aloud from
a news service article. The news left DeLay in stony silence.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said his amendment had been approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that vote, Congress made little visible progress in
completing its work on government appropriations for the fiscal
year 2000, which begins at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 13 spending bills remain unfinished. Four have been
signed into law by Clinton, and one, financing the District of
Columbia, has been vetoed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest works in progress _ bills financing the military,
labor programs, education, health and human services, agriculture
and transportation _ have been bogged down in bitter disputes over
political priorities and complicated by some of the most complex
accounting devices veteran members of Congress could recall.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of all _ the Pentagon spending bill, nearly $270
billion _ has been held up by a dispute over financing for the
first models of the Air Force's F-22 jet, the most expensive
fighter aircraft in history. House and Senate negotiators have
agreed on the outlines of a deal that would block the Air Force
from building combat-ready aircraft in 2000, but allow production
of test models.
</P>
<P>
   As another example of the creative accounting devices the
Republican Congress is using, the Pentagon bill has also been
temporarily stripped of more than $8 billion, which will be
transferred to finance domestic programs, and then replaced by the
declaration of a spending ``emergency'' _ although no one is sure
exactly where the emergency money is supposed to come from.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring spending an emergency means that it technically does
not count against the spending limits, or caps, imposed by Congress
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate took $8 billion out of our bill,'' said Rep. John
Murtha of Pennsylvania, a veteran Democratic military appropriator.
``Where the hell are we going to get the $8 billion?''

CRITICS SAY GOP MOVE UNDERCUTS HMO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of a comprehensive House bill to
regulate managed care are accusing the Republican leadership of
trying to scuttle the legislation by tying it to a separate bill
that contains tax credits that Democrats strongly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The House next week will debate several health-care bills
focusing on patients' rights under managed care. The bill most
likely to pass, sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., enlarges the right to sue health
maintenance organizations and insures that people in HMOs have
access to emergency room care and to medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   But Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and other House
Republican leaders are trying to limit patients' ability to sue,
and have sought to mobilize their narrow majority behind another
bill that would siphon support away from the bipartisan
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hastert and other House Republicans introduced a
bill that aims to broaden health-care coverage to 43 million
uninsured Americans. Some ideas in it, like expanding tax
deductions for self-employed people, enjoy broad bipartisan
support. But Democrats oppose other provisions, like tax-free
medical savings accounts, saying such accounts would draw the
healthiest and wealthiest people out of the insurance pool,
increasing premiums for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for the floor debate next week will not be worked out
until Monday. But Hastert and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the
majority leader, have said the House would vote separately on the
new insurance access bill, which is likely to pass, and then on the
Dingell-Norwood bill and other managed-care bills. The results
would be combined into one bill for purposes of negotiating with
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this, supporters of the Dingell-Norwood bill said,
would be to drain Democratic votes away from their legislation
because even if it passed, it would be blended with a measure
riddled with what they called ``poison pills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a serious attempt to address the problems of 43
million Americans with no health insurance,'' Norwood said in a
statement. ``It is an attempt to defeat managed-care reform through
parliamentary maneuvering.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were equally biting in their criticism. Dingell called
the bill ``a compendium of diversionary and obfuscatory mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said it
was too costly and represented ``a cynical, desperate, last-minute
attempt to stave off a bipartisan managed-care bill on the verge of
passage, not a genuine effort to pass legislation to benefit
uninsured Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican aides say it is necessary to combine the
managed-care and access bills because the Senate's health-care
bill, approved in July, did not include any tax breaks. But Senate
Republican aides say their bill provides $13 billion in new tax
breaks, including medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill offered this week, sponsored by Reps. John
Shadegg of Arizona and James Talent of Missouri, both Republicans,
includes more than $40 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that
were part of the tax-cut bill that President Clinton vetoed
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have focused on these incentives because their
polling shows that Americans are more concerned about the uninsured
than regulating the managed-care industry. The bill would also
allow small businesses to use pooled bargaining power to negotiate
cheaper insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow the uninsured, especially families, greater
affordability when purchasing health care,'' Shadegg said.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care issue has been a political minefield for
Hastert. The original bill he promoted resembled the Senate
legislation, which sharply limited the ability of patients to sue
health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   But several House Republicans, including many who are doctors or
dentists, like Norwood, a dentist, objected that the bill was not
helpful to patients, and they forged an alliance with the Democrats
backing the Dingell-Norwood bill. At least 40 of the 222 House
Republicans and almost all 211 House Democrats favor some form of
HMO liability proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert sought to broker a compromise, sponsored by Shadegg and
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. Their version, unlike the bipartisan plan,
does not include a right to sue in state court. Instead, it allows
the right to sue in federal district court only after a patient has
gone through a thorough appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   The Coburn-Shadegg bill, along with legislation sponsored by
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, that limits liability even further, will
vie with the Dingell-Norwood bill next week.

RESISTANCE TO GRAVITY FUTILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As little interest as you think you may have
watching NBC's version of a packaged extreme sports show called the
Gravity Games, producer David Michaels had even less interest in
working on it when he was approached a while back by NBC Sports
chief Dick Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ebersol asked me to `dust off my skateboard' and do this,
I really didn't want to,'' admits Michaels, taking a break from a
special editing facility set up for him in Santa Monica. ``I didn't
think any of it was legit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he watched tapes of the X Games produced over the last few
years by ESPN and ``I was bored to tears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which hardly explains why the 49-year-old, better known at the
network for his award-winning efforts on Olympic gymnastics and
figure skating, was so pumped up this week while watching the final
edits on NBC's first of five two-hour shows that airs Sunday (1-3
p.m.) and will run amok for five straight weeks by the network
devoid of NFL programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as fired up about this as anything else I've ever done
because, even though ESPN tried to do this, it's really unchartered
territory,'' Michaels says now after working on the project for the
past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's been ESPN's franchise for awhile, but what they've
done is old school. They did it when it was a novelty. Now it's
gone to another level. I think we've brought some dignity to the
sport. We tapped into the essence of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Michaels could tap into his two sons who attend
Agoura High _ namely Andrew, a 17-year-old junior who went with his
dad to the recent X Games in San Francisco to do some scouting, and
Jake, a 14-year-old freshman who helped select the music to use in
the shows.
</P>
<P>
   David Michaels' Olympic expertise, and the fact he began
professional career by coordinating light shows for rock concerts
in the late '60s and producing John Tesh concerts for PBS, also
converged here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we ended up doing was taking our Olympic production teams
and saying, `Let's cover this as if it's the Olympics of these
extreme sports,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So with that rail cam that kept up with Michael Johnson during
the last 200 meters of his Olympic race in Atlanta three years ago,
you'll see dirt bikes. And cameras on cables that swooped across
the slopes with the downhill skiiers will follow the street lugers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gravity Games took place Sept. 5-12 in Providence, R.I., so
for NBC, they'll already have that Olympic feel since it'll all be
on tape. ESPN has staged its extreme games since 1995, but aired
its shows on tape within hours of it taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's first NBC installment focuses on downhill
skateboarding, which started as a Southern California event in the
1960s and '70s, and includes a feature on the youngest Games
competitor, 14-year-old Andre Ellison from Riverside who's trying
to make the top 10 in the dirt bike competition.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying to all channels: This year, it won't be any easier to
keep track of which network has what first-round, best-of-five
baseball playoff games. Today, NBC and Fox make known their picks
of the games they want for prime-time Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday. ESPN gets the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the caboose, unfortunately, but a very formidable
caboose each night,'' said ESPN's Chris Berman, one of three
play-by-play men on call. ``The first year of this, I did three
games from three series and thought my head exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   For analyst Joe Morgan, it's even more complicated since he
dances between ESPN (with Jon Miller) and NBC (with Bob Costas).
Forgive him if he momentarily lapses during a broadcast and forgets
not only where he is but who he's stepping on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd rather have one series at a time _ I only know where
I'll be Tuesday but not Wednesday, Thursday or Friday,'' said
Morgan. ``But for me, it's a fun time of year doing the best games
and watching the best teams. I think I could do a better job if I
knew my schedule, but I'll watch all the games I'm not doing and
read up on the plane rides about what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ESPN's coordinating baseball producer Tim Scanlan has
enough potential problems trying to get production trucks to
destinations throughout the country that can do a ``Sunday Night
Baseball''-quality broadcast, he said at least the network can
always rely on the quality of the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a success in division play coverage because of those
guys, who we really lean on,'' said Scanlan. ``They have to be up
on all the teams all season and it pays dividends this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect what Fox and NBC does, and we're all friends
despite what others may have you think. All this (jumping around)
is done for the baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Keith Olbermann, who will host his network's studio show
the first week before going to the American League Championships
Series site as a reporter, doesn't think channel-hopping for the
playoffs is all that difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to belittle the inconvenience, but what are the
options? It's either channels 4 or 11 or ESPN. Even most baseball
executives can handle that number of choices. It's not the NBA
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   To mop up the regular season, FX has claimed tonight's
Cubs-Cardinals clubfest at 4:30 p.m., Fox Channel 11 takes
Saturday's Dodgers-Astros game at 1 p.m. (with KTLA Channel 5
showing L.A. that series finale and possibly the last game at the
Astrodome Sunday at 11:30 a.m.), while ESPN2 hasn't anything that
means anything Sunday. In the event of a one-game playoff (from the
NL Central), that'll land at ESPN on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling puckish: The new ESPN/ABC five-year deal for the NHL
begins tonight with the cable giant carrying Wayne Gretzky's number
retirement ceremony from Edmonton (4:30 p.m.) followed by the
championship banner raising in Dallas before the Stars face
Pittsburgh (5 p.m.)....
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' opener Saturday in Nashville is caught in a Fox trap
of college football, meaning it's not only been moved from its
usual Fox Sports West home to Fox Sports West 2, but it's delayed
two hours to 7 p.m. The live 5 p.m. start is fine for the team's
KRLA-AM (1110) flagship radio station along with its eight
affiliates that include KHJJ-AM (1380) in Palmdale/Lancaster,
KBET-AM (1220) in Santa Clarita and KTRO-AM (1400) in Ventura. Nick
Nickson starts his 19th season with the team, working with Daryl
Evans going fulltime as the analyst. He replaces Cammi Granato,
who's back to fulltime training with the U.S. women's hockey team.
On the tube, Bob Miller begins his 27th season on play-by-play. Jim
Fox, in his 10th season, will now have been a TV analyst longer
than he was a player with the Kings....
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks start over on the radio side with XTRA-690 as the
flagship, using someone named Steve Carroll on play-by-play. Mike
Greenlay, whose NHL experience consists of playing two games with
Edmonton in 1990, is the analyst. The Ducks' opener Saturday at
Dallas (5:05 p.m.) has been farmed out to San Diego station KOGO-AM
(600) because XTRA has USC football. On TV, it's back to Channel 9
(for the opener) and FSW2 with Chris Madsen and Brian Hayward. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_The education of !racepay!Derrick Hall!off!. AM-1150's morning
man, who came over to radio after eight years in the Dodgers
organization, interviewed fired Dodgers president !racepay!Bob
Graziano!off! Wednesday morning. But there was a history between
them _ Graziano used to be Hall's boss not long ago, and Graziano
had been talking about hiring him back. In the interview, Hall said
he didn't want to get Graziano into bashing the Fox hierarchy or
asking if he was set up for a fall _ but Hall, to his credit,
eventually did ask that, showing he has separated himself enough to
do the proper interview. ``There's a story there and I know most of
it,'' Hall admitted Thursday. ``If the Lakers fire their president,
then maybe my questions are more generic. But knowing so much about
promises made to him and his goals, we got below the surface. Over
time, it's been easier (to ask these questions to Dodgers
officials). At first, I think I was careful not to put down the
team. But I have a responsibility to the listeners. I realized I'm
not hurting (the Dodgers), I'm telling the story.'' &QL; 
_Not to get obnoxious about it, but NBC has proclaimed unbelievable
Ryder Cup ratings victories. Sunday's finale (6.3 overnight rating
and a 15 share) and Saturday's second day (4.9/14) were the two
highest-rated Ryder telecasts ever despite going on for nearly 17{
hours combined. The Sunday rating is a 62 percent jump from '97. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Last call for loitering mall rats at the Glendale Galleria because
after today, ESPN The Store is no more. To clear space, a final
75-percent-off-everything-left sale will probably only net you a
decent price on a lovely ESPN logo twill sweater that for some
reason never left the rack at $78. We offered 50 cents for the
!racepay!Charley Steiner!off! cutout from the huge wall display,
but the exasperated register clerk (by the way, wearing a Disney
Store nametag) wouldn't bite. &QL; 
_ESPN2's four-hour block of fitness shows will move back three
hours beginning Monday. Which means, to see !racepay!Kiana Tom!off!
and friends in the pacifying Pacific Time Zone, you'll have to tune
in from 3 to 7 a.m. Seems the easy way would be just to stay up
late the night before _ and have something nice to watch before
nite-nite. &QL; 
_NBC airs an NBA Entertainment production of the Basketball Hall of
Fame induction ceremonies Saturday from Springfield, Mass., which,
coincidentally, will include !racepay!Bob Costas!off! receiving the
Curt Gowdy Media Award. So you're telling us Costas and
!racepay!Chick Hearn!off! are on the national wall of recognition
(that's all it really is, by the way) for bringing basketball to
the masses?

GUNMAN'S HOUSE CLEARED FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MAHLBURG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Three weeks before Larry Gene Ashbrook went
on a murderous rampage at Wedgwood Baptist Church, a judge issued
an order upholding his father's will and clearing the way for the
sale of Ashbrook's home.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends and neighbors say Ashbrook may have been distraught
because he feared losing his home in Forest Hill, a Fort Worth
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ashbrook's father, Jack Ashbrook, left the
house to all four children. That typically means that the house
will be sold, said Fort Worth attorney David Lobinger, who handled
the will of Larry Ashbrook's mother 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up selling the house and dividing the proceeds in
equal shares,'' Lobinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard R. Swarb, the attorney who handled Jack Ashbrook's will
in court, said he doesn't know what was planned for the house. But
he said that the judge had issued a final order and that steps to
dispose of property, such as selling a house are the job of the
executor of the estate, in this case Ashbrook's brother, Aaron
Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth police Lt. Mark Krey, who is leading the Wedgwood
investigation, called the idea that Ashbrook feared losing his home
``plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' Krey said. But ``... the person who could
give us answers is not here to give us answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Sept. 15 shooting, when seven people were
fatally shot and seven were wounded before Ashbrook killed himself,
the gunman trashed his modest single-story house. He smashed holes
in the walls, poured concrete in the toilets, overturned furniture
and used a shovel to hack large family portraits.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Mary Thomason, knew the family since Larry Ashbrook
was a boy. She said Ashbrook feared that the house was being sold
out from under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was what made him snap, because his income was
cut off when his dad died and he thought they were going to sell
the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax records show that the three-bedroom, two-bath home was
valued at $23,000. The family always had modest means but was
well-respected, Thomason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wonderful people, but their son went wrong,''
Thomason said. ``They were churchgoers, and they were just good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Ashbrook family, said she
was unaware of legal moves involving the will.
</P>
<P>
   Lobinger, an assistant district attorney, said he only vaguely
remembers handling Ashbrook's mother's will 10 years ago. Like the
father's will, it was a standard document, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When their wills were drawn up in 1981, both parents listed
Larry Ashbrook as their last choice of the four children to handle
their affairs. Under the wills, Larry Ashbrook was to be executor
only if all three other children were ``unable or unwilling'' to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The job of handling an estate is generally given to the child
perceived as the most responsible and with ``the best business
sense,'' Lobinger said. It is fair to assume that neither parent
viewed Larry Ashbrook in that role, he said.

GERMANY TRIES TO TELL CIA TO STOP SPY OPERATIONS THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major ally has sent another signal to the United
States that the Cold War is over and that it is time to stop
playing spy games on NATO turf.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, German officials asked a CIA officer to leave the
country for the first time since the Cold War turned Germany into a
battleground for American and Soviet spies. Now, the CIA has been
forced to withdraw three additional officers from Germany,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials played down the incident, saying it was a
result of friction between the chief of the German internal
security service and the CIA. Those officials stressed that the
move was not a result of a dramatic shift in policy toward the CIA
by Gerhard Schroeder's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the incident does seem to be part of a larger trend by
allied countries to tell Washington quietly that it is time to
scale back espionage operations. And it suggests that CIA efforts
to find new missions _ including economic espionage against trading
partners _ are meeting resistance.
</P>
<P>
   German television reported this week that German officials had
asked a married couple employed by the CIA, along with a superior
from Munich, to leave after the internal security service had
compromised their espionage operation. They were not listed as
official diplomats, but rather appear to be what the CIA calls
``nonofficial cover'' officers who pose as executives or use other
civilian covers to conduct espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The agency refused to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Germans pressured the agency to withdraw an officer
from Bonn who was involved in economic espionage. That move
represented a significant shift in relations between the CIA and
the German security service.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the CIA had acted as if West Germany was its home
turf and had set up bases throughout the country. The agency has
long had a base in Munich, in part to conduct liaison activities
with the German foreign intelligence service, which is
headquartered there.
</P>
<P>
   But after the reunification in 1990 and the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991, German officials began to send quiet messages
to the United States that it was time to cut back. Disputes over
the issue were still not resolved by the time the German government
took action in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is hardly the lone allied country to show impatience
with the agency's post-Cold War presence. In 1995, France moved
against its station in Paris, forcing the withdrawal of several
officers after they had been caught conducting trade-related
espionage. The agency temporarily shut the station and froze
operations in the country until the furor died down.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had similar problems in India and Italy.

 &HT;    Ohio State aims to buck comeback trend
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Come-from-behind victories can be exciting and
inspirational, but they also can be a sign of a problem _
especially if they're coming against lesser opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last three weeks, No. 12 Ohio State has had
to overcome early deficits to earn victories over relatively
nonthreatening, nonconference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Buckeyes kick off their Big Ten season against
Rose Bowl champion Wisconsin (2-2), and they realize another slow
start might not be so easy to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 3-1 and happy to be there, fortunate to be there,'' OSU
coach John Cooper said. ``I'm not over here singing the blues, but
we have to improve. I don't want to make (comebacks) a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   To get ahead early, Cooper said his team must eliminate the
``stupid mistakes'' they've been prone to recently: off-side and
illegal motion penalties; mismatched defenses; fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to come out smoking and get (Wisconsin) down and get
'em out of their game plan and out of their rhythm,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   OSU has shown it has the firepower to score early and often;
it's just that lately, it's taken a quarter or two to get the
offense going. Against UCLA three weeks ago, OSU fell behind 10-0
before quarterback Steve Bellisari sparked a comeback. Against Ohio
University, the Buckeyes trailed by 7 before their offense kicked
into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   And last week against Cincinnati, their deficit reached 14
before a couple of big plays bailed them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember last year we used to go down the field on the first
series and score 7 points,'' OSU co-captain and senior fullback
Matt Keller said. ``That's something we haven't done this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let teams get out in front of you with the teams we
have coming up (Wisconsin, Purdue, Penn State, Michigan). They'll
put you away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellisari said coaches have been encouraging him to run with the
ball when he has an opening, something he failed to do much against
Cincinnati. Instead, he relied on a couple of bombs to receiver
Ken-Yon Rambo, who caught three passes for 164 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big plays aren't always gonna be there. You want to try to
sustain a drive,'' Bellisari said.
</P>
<P>
   OSU had trouble doing that against the Bearcats. UC had the ball
for nearly 35 minutes while OSU had it for 24. UC also racked up 26
first downs; Ohio State had 19.
</P>
<P>
   The return of backup tailback Jonathan Wells and Keller, both of
whom missed the past two games because of ankle sprains, should
help OSU's running game. The Buckeyes already know Wisconsin, with
tailback Ron Dayne and a beefy offensive line, will be tough to
stop on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin is a big, physical football team that will run it
down our throats unless we stop them,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Michigan was successful in defeating the Badgers, 21-16,
last week largely because the Wolverines shut down Dayne in the
second half (8 carries, 0 yards). He had 88 yards on 14 carries in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   With UM ahead 21-9 in the third quarter, Wisconsin was forced to
go to the air. Dayne didn't carry the ball in the last 10 minutes
of the game. Cooper knows Dayne will be forced out of the game
again if the Buckeyes can gain and maintain a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tackle Ron Dayne enough Saturday, we'll win,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting free safety and leading tackler Gary Berry is doubtful
to start Saturday against Wisconsin because of a neck injury he
sustained last week against Cincinnati, according to Cooper. Senior
Percy King will replace him.

 &HT;    Tennessee fans: ESPN's out to get us
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They call it The ESPN Conspiracy in Knoxville, Tenn.
In the hearts and minds of Tennessee football fans it's back _
bigger and stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of many Volunteers fans, it's not a
coincidence that ESPN's SportsCenter broke the story Sunday night
alleging possible academic fraud involving Tennessee football
players and their tutors. They see it as a cold, calculated attempt
by the network to ``get'' Tennessee, the defending national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have not been bashful about expressing that opinion on
radio talk shows and in other forms of communication. The Knoxville
News-Sentinel ran a cartoon Thursday morning that depicted an
unflattering portrayal of an ESPN reporter in a trench coat. And in
an Internet poll by the newspaper this week, 75 percent of those
responding said ESPN was trying to hurt Tennessee with its
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fans are convinced that this is ESPN's way of getting
back at Tennessee,'' said Jimmy Hyams, a former reporter with the
News-Sentinel who hosts a daily sports talk show on WNOX radio. ``I
disagree with the idea that there is a conspiracy and have argued
with a lot of people about it. But these people will not be
swayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would ESPN be out to get Tennessee? From the perspective of
Volunteers fans, the fight goes back two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ It began on Dec. 13, 1997, at the Downtown Athletic Club in
New York. Quarterback Peyton Manning, perhaps the most revered
player in Tennessee history, finished second in the Heisman Trophy
voting to Michigan defensive back Charles Woodson. Tennessee fans
blamed ESPN and its parent company, ABC, citing excessive promotion
of Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN offices are hit with angry telephone calls, letters and
faxes. Chris Fowler, the host of ESPN's College Game Day show and
the most visible college football personality at the network,
receives a FedEx box filled with manure.
</P>
<P>
   _ A few days later, during a radio appearance with Nanci
Donnellan on her show ``The Fabulous Sports Babe,'' Fowler was
asked about the emotional reaction of the Tennessee fans and made a
reference to a ``trailer-park frenzy.'' Fowler has apologized
several times for the remark.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 2, 1998, ESPN took its ``College Game Day'' show to
Miami, where Tennessee faced Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. The
Tennessee crowd around the set became so unruly that extra security
had to be brought in. Fowler again apologized, but it fell on deaf
ears.
</P>
<P>
   _ At January's Fiesta Bowl, center Spencer Riley was asked about
the school's relationship with ESPN. Riley said, ``They've stuck it
to us ever since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   The story about alleged academic fraud, some Tennessee fans
thought this week, was ESPN's way of evening the score for the
Peyton Manning fallout. That was the opinion Thursday at the Old
College Inn, a popular hangout near the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people up here still think they (ESPN) are the reason
Peyton didn't win the Heisman and they've never gotten over it,''
said Tom Clark, a former Tennessee student. ``And now this.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN officials deny any hidden agenda in their reporting of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Barry Sacks,
the senior coordinator producer for ``College Game Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically dealing with two issues. One is a bad comment
made by an announcer. The apologies have been made and the issues
have been dealt with,'' Sacks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other is a journalistic story _ a story that has also
occurred at Missouri, Notre Dame and other schools. Our people
received information, they followed up on it and reported it.
That's what news organizations do. These are not personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee story was written by Tom Farrey, a reporter who
works for ESPN.com, the organization's Web site, and was based on
copies of internal memos from athletic department memos. The story
was handled by the news division of ``SportsCenter,'' which is an
entirely separate division from ``College Game Day'' or the remote
operations that, ironically, will carry Saturday's game with Auburn
and the Oct. 9 game with Georgia.

 &HT;    Sanks' promise shows
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's Jasper Sanks is second in the SEC in
rushing with 326 yards in three games. But the sophomore running
back knows all too well he should have at least one more yard.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks had the longest run from scrimmage of his career _ 54
yards _ against Central Florida last Saturday. But that's not what
people were talking about after the game. They were talking about
how Sanks got caught from behind at the 1 by a defensive back who
came from the other side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks was looking back at his pursuer rather than accelerating
to the end zone. But Georgia coach Jim Donnan didn't scold Sanks
for the error. He didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took plenty of grief from his teammates on that,'' Donnan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Sanks said. ``I got phone calls, messages on my
answering machine. My roommmate (Tyrone Robertson) was the worst.
He'd act like he was on the radio: `Sanks could go all the _ oh, no
_ he's down at the 1-foot line!'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanks can joke about it now. Georgia needed three plays to do it
but got into the end zone, and the Bulldogs held on for a 24-23
win.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanks' solid work this season was not obscured by that
lapse. The 6-foot, 216-pound native of Columbus has answered
Georgia's call for a dependable running back. He has rushed for 130
and 147 yards in his last two games. With a 100-yard effort against
LSU on Saturday, he could become the first Georgia back since
Garrison Hearst in 1992 to get 100 in three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with Jasper,'' Donnan said. ``Jasper's doing a good
job. He needs to keep working on his pass blocking and catching the
ball. Otherwise, he's doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Once considered Georgia's next great back, Sanks for a time last
year was considered its biggest bust of the 1990s. The Bulldogs
recruited Sanks over Tennessee's Jamal Lewis. But Sanks was at Fork
Union Military Academy trying to gain his eligibility while Lewis
was rushing for 1,364 yards and seven touchdowns as a freshman in
1997. Last year, Sanks struggled, finishing with 65 yards on 10
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Since last season, Sanks has recovered from hernia surgery and
lost 18 pounds. Now he's resembling the back recruiting analysts
gushed about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Told that he is ahead of Lewis in the latest SEC statistical
rankings, Sanks said with a grin, ``That's good to know. He's about
the only one I keep up with.''

 &HT;    Falcons desperate to discover playmaker
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jamal Anderson made his daily visit to Falcons
headquarters Thursday morning. He did his pre-surgical knee
rehabilitation and then, after busting the chops of some teammates,
went away.
</P>
<P>
   Was that the Falcons' security blanket walking out the door? It
depends.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is out for the season, and quarterback Chris Chandler
almost certainly will not play Sunday against Baltimore (1-2)
because of a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Falcons (0-3) have the talent to win without
Anderson and Chandler, they have to convince themselves that they
can. Easier said than done. Anderson was second in the NFL last
season with 1,846 rushing yards. He and Chandler, the team's two
Pro Bowl offensive players, were the cornerstones of the league's
fourth-most prolific scoring offense last season.
</P>
<P>
   Their absences leave large voids, both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson declined an interview Thursday before shopping for a
house, but he said that he believes in his teammates. He also said
he wasn't in St. Louis on Sunday because he didn't want to be a
distraction. He almost certainly will be at Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, center Robbie Tobeck joked about missing Anderson's
antics in the locker room. On the field, his absence is no joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing about missing Jamal and Chris,'' fullback
Bob Christian said, ``is we got to relying on Jamal to make a play
or Chris to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian said, ``Now, we don't have those guys, and it's like
everybody is looking around for somebody else to make a play,
instead of each of us saying, `Hey, I'm going to make a play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went through the same process last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 season, the team was 0-6 in games Chandler missed or
didn't finish because of injury and 7-3 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he missed the Oct. 25 game against the Jets, but
only after the game, a 28-3 loss on the road, did players and
coaches admit the degree of doubt with which they played.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, last season went so well that, after they won
a couple of games that Chandler left with an injury, the Falcons
gained confidence, went to St. Louis and won 21-10 on Nov. 29
without him. The Falcons were 4-1 in games Chandler missed or left
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was . . . a hurdle last year, but I think we're past
that,'' Tony Graziani said. ``Now, (Chandler) has been in there
twice and we haven't won. We know it's not him being gone that is
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've had so many bad things happen that our
confidence is shook,'' he said. ``We need to believe . . . in the
11 guys on the field. We need to make some big plays. If we put
together some drives, and create some excitement, I think our
confidence will be back.''

 &HT;    Season of change: NHL drops the puck
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Gretzky is gone, and Atlanta is back. It would
be hard to find a hockey fan outside of Georgia who would call that
a fair tradeoff, especially anyone in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL begins its 83rd season full of change and concerned
about who will be its big drawing card now that the Great One has
retired at age 38 after 20 glorious seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, hockey's all-time leading scorer, will be honored
tonight when his last NHL team _ the New York Rangers _ plays his
first _ the Oilers. The tribute, carried by ESPN at 7:30 p.m., will
be a final Edmonton sendoff for No. 99, who led the Oilers to four
Stanley Cup titles in five seasons during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically took the league and carried it on his back for 20
years,'' Vancouver's Mark Messier said of his former teammate in
Edmonton and New York. ``Obviously, the onus now goes on a lot of
the younger players, to learn from what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other game tonight has the Dallas Stars _ the first
Stanley Cup winner from the Sun Belt _ unfurling the championship
banner before hosting Pittsburgh on ESPN at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, rescued out of bankruptcy court by former star
Mario Lemieux, are led by Jaromir Jagr _ Gretzky's most likely heir
apparent. Jagr, 27, led the NHL in scoring last season with 127
points. The right wing from the Czech Republic had 44 goals and 83
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody dominates this league now,'' Jagr said. ``Guys like
Mario, Gretzky or Bobby Orr _ they were 20 years ahead of everyone
else when they played.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky played Year 2000 hockey in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas became the fourth consecutive Western Conference team to
win the Stanley Cup. The Stars beat Buffalo in six games when Brett
Hull scored a controversial goal in triple overtime. Hull had his
left skate in the crease before he put the puck past Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, the most dominant goalie in hockey for most of the 1990s,
announced during the summer that this season will be his last.
``I've played long enough,'' the 34-year-old Czech said. ``I want a
new life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek will be in goal Saturday when the Sabres open the season
at Detroit. The Red Wings won two Stanley Cups in a row before
losing to Colorado in the Western Conference semifinals last
season. Scotty Bowman will try again to win his record ninth Cup as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers are the seventh expansion team to join the NHL in
the '90s, increasing the league total of teams to 28. Minnesota and
Columbus will join the league next season. The NHL had 21 teams in
1979-80, the Flames' last season in Atlanta before they moved to
Calgary. That was Gretzky's rookie year in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to replace Gretzky, the Rangers went on a spending spree
in the offseason, signing Theo Fleury and four other free agents.
But most teams tried to hold the line on skyrocketing salaries. The
average team payroll in 1988-89 was $5.3 million. Last season it
was $31 million per team. This season, the Rangers' payroll will be
about $67 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is still in a salary standoff with goalie Byron Dafoe,
who led the NHL with 10 shutouts last season, and the Bruins
dropped forward Dmitri Khristich when he won his arbitration
hearing. Other players who will not be on the ice when the season
starts due to contract squabbles include Keith Primeau, Joe Juneau,
Bill Guerin, Ulf Samuelsson, Mark Tinordi, Ray Sheppard and Joe
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's board of governors made several rule changes,
including going to four-on-four play in overtime. The use of video
replays has been limited, and the foot-in-the-crease rule was
revised. Two referees will be used in 50 games per team.
</P>
<P>
   Some defending Stanley Cup champs have adopted the attitude that
the seven-month regular season is only a tuneup for the playoffs.
But coach Ken Hitchcock thinks that Dallas must strive to have the
league's best record for a third consecutive season for a shot at a
second Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake anyone can make is not worrying about your
daily performance,'' Hitchcock said. ``You can't think, 'Oh, well,
don't worry about it today. We'll get it tomorrow.' If you decide
you're going to drop your level of play in the regular season,
it'll drop in the playoffs. It's just natural.''

SEVERAL PLANT WORKERS COULD DIE FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
 (With JAPAN-NUKE) 
(bl) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minor doses of radiation released in the nuclear accident at the
Tokaimura uranium processing plant are likely to have mild medical
effects, but the worst amounts, affecting a few workers at the
plant, could prove fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The two workers who were most exposed received a dose equivalent
to about 800 rads (a measure of radiation), according to estimates
by a Japanese radiologist based on their blood count and overall
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are bad numbers,'' said Dr. Eugene Saenger, a retired
professor at the University of Cincinnati and a leading authority
on radiation medicine. ``I would predict the dose would be lethal
without some miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious injury from radiation is caused by doses of 100 or so
rads and upward, and at 400 to 600 rads, half of those infected may
die.
</P>
<P>
   Workers exposed to doses of 100 or more may face crises to the
gastrointestinal tract and to the bone marrow. The constantly
dividing cells of both are prone to radiation damage.
</P>
<P>
   There is no specific treatment for radiation damage to the
stomach lining, Saenger said, other than to replace the body fluids
lost through bleeding. But damaged bone marrow can be treated with
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   People exposed to doses of less than 300 rads would be expected
to recover spontaneously, Saenger said, though they would often be
given supportive therapy in the form of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities reported that radiation around the plant
was 10,000 or more times higher than normal, a figure that Saenger
calculated was roughly equal to 10 rads. This is far higher than
conventional exposures, such as medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Radioactive gases are said to have escaped from the plant, and
these would present a variety of hazards. The most dangerous,
Saenger said, would be iodine-131, a radioactive element with an
eight-day half-life that is created in fission of uranium atoms.
All forms of iodine are quickly taken up by the thyroid gland and
radioactive iodine will damage it, with a risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One safeguard is iodine pills, based on the principle that
normal iodine will get to the thyroid first and block the
radioactive iodine. The pills must be given as soon as possible,
certainly within 24 hours of exposure, Saenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women are at particular risk from iodine-131 because of
damage to the fetus. Little is known about the doses that will
cause genetic abnormalities in the fetus.

OUTTAKES FROM BEATTY'S NEWEST GIG

announcement Wednesday night whispers:

   &UR; Lara Flynn Boyle &LR; , 29, and  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; , 52, were looking

cheerleaders included  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; ,  &UR; Dustin Hoffman &LR; ,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Burton  &LR; and  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; , whose segment was booed.
</P>

<P>
   P.S. Real life?  &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger  &LR; says in an interview in
the November issue of Talk that he's thinking about running for

said, ``because I feel it inside. I feel there are a lot of people
standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum.''

JUDGE APPROVES $15 MILLION BOEING BIAS SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A federal judge approved a $15 million settlement of
charges of racial discimination at The Boeing Co. Thursday,
blessing the biggest resolution of racial bias in the history of
the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Coughenour approved a plan that calls
on Boeing to pay $6.65 million to 3,600 employees and to alter its
promotion policies. He rejected the challenge of a group of African
American workers who charge it won't resolve the company's racial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Cougenhour said both the payment and the internal changes
could help address complaints of discrimination at the world's
largest commercial airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of information about promotion opportunities
will be improved, changes will be made in the procedure for
resolving discrimination related complaints, and free legal advice
will be available,'' Coughenour wrote in a 14-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision is an attempt to finally resolve two
class-action lawsuits that alleged a racially hostile environment
existed in the halls and on the manufacturing floors of Boeing. The
suits said blacks were subjected to slurs, crude drawings and
intimidations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Boeing promised to improve the way it hires
and promotes workers; adopt a new system for handling complaints of
discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and hire a consultant to
assess how well the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's efforts, and the judge's decision, however, aren't
enough, according to some African American employees. They
challenged the way the funds would be distributed and whether
Boeing would be held accountable if it didn't make the promised
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing these workers were mulling whether to take
the next step: to appeal the decision to the 9th Circuit U.S Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either appeal or nothing, there are no other options,''
said Martin Garfinkel, a partner at the law firm of Frank, Rosen,
Freed, Garfinkel &AMP; Roberts, who represented employees that objected
to the decree.
</P>
<P>
   They have 30 days to decide. Some workers, however, have already
made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not through,'' said Dennis Harris, a 33-year Boeing
employee, who works in Long Beach, Calif. ``This is
heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge warned workers upset with the settlement that they
could face an uphill battle if they challenge Boeing in open court.
Boeing has faced a series of race discrimination charges in recent
years and it has won every time, according to Cougenhour.
</P>
<P>
   ``...Discrimination cases are notoriously difficult to prove,
particularly when they are based on failure to promote or other
discretionary practices,'' he wrote. ``There is also some risk that
the class certified by the court would not survive a challenge by
Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cougenhour also dismissed charges that the lawyers who
negotiated the settlement, Oscar Desper III, Bruce Harrell and
others, failed their clients. For example, some workers complained
bitterly of being left in the dark as the settlement moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion that this result displays anything less than
excellent legal ability or unwavering committment to the plaintiffs
is unsupportable,'' Cougenhour wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also won approval of their compensation _ $3.1
million to settle the charges and $750,000 to monitor its
implementation. In addition, lawyers representing workers in
Philadelphia are to receive $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22, Boeing attempted to resolve the charges by
announcing a $15-million settlement, brokered with the help of
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. Originally, 43 Boeing workers
sued Boeing. Workers for Boeing in Philadelphia and in Wichita,
Kan., joined in the suit. Eventually, a second suit also was
started.
</P>
<P>
   Cougenhour cited Jackson's involvement as proof of the
agreement's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court considers his meeting with Boeing officials and
subsequent endorsement of the decree to be a very strong indication
that Boeing is sincere in its response,'' Cougenhour wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing offficials promised to honor the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boeing Co. is fully committed to implementating all the
changes as outlined in the consent decree,'' said Jim Dagnon, a
senior vice president.

CHARITY BEGINS IN THE HOME PC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the Boston Tea Party? If my high school history teacher
is to be believed, the colonists' complaint was about taxation
without representation.
</P>
<P>
   That very phrase stuck in my mind when I read the announcement
by the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, that his foundation would
provide $1 billion in college scholarships for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the move is well intended, and surely it will warm the
hearts of Windows users everywhere. Maybe it will even melt away
some of the fear and loathing that Microsoft seems to inspire from
Silicon Valley to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult not to view this outburst of altruism in the
light of Microsoft's extraordinary grip on the personal computer
revolution. Microsoft owes its great success, after all, to
Windows, the operating system that people love to hate but are more
or less forced to use.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to buy a PC without Windows, and Microsoft's
huge power in this respect is handy when it comes to pricing the
program. The company profits further by selling application
programs that coincidentally work extremely well in the Windows
environment.
</P>
<P>
   From a certain perspective, then, some part of the price of
Windows amounts to a tax on personal computers _ a regressive one,
since a struggling inner-city high school student pays the same as
a multimedia tycoon. Gates has aggregated some of the proceeds from
these and millions of other computer users to create what is now,
at $17 billion, the largest philanthropic foundation in America.
</P>
<P>
   I like donating money to charity, and if my computer cost less
(and was easier to use, so I could spend more time making money), I
might give even more. Unfortunately, Gates puts users of Windows in
the position of financing his philanthropic enterprises whether we
like them or not.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I do not favor race-based initiatives like the
foundation's scholarship plan, so I direct my giving elsewhere.
Others who disagree, of course, are free to give accordingly. But
as the father of boys, I am more concerned that there are only 6.4
million men enrolled in college versus 8.5 million women; the
Education Department projects that this extraordinary gender gap
will grow. Neither the Gates Foundation nor anyone else seems much
perturbed by it, so right now the only scholarships I intend to
provide are for my sons.
</P>
<P>
   When the government does something I don't like, I can complain
to my elected officials, give money in the cause of their defeat
and vote against those whose policies I oppose. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, on the other hand, doesn't care what I
think. So I find myself in the same position as those early
colonists who turned Boston Harbor into a giant teapot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gates is not the first tycoon to don the mantle of
charity after amassing a fortune. Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford and
others did likewise. But by now, the roots of their wealth are well
buried. The Gates Foundation is undertaking a wholesale
redistribution among the living. (I can't complain about being left
out; I was a consultant on a Microsoft Web venture, and I write
occasionally for Slate, Microsoft's online magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a compromise that could satisfy the Gates
family's charitable urges while doing more for society than any of
the foundation's current initiatives. It would work like this:
Gates, give away that software. Set Windows free. It would be the
simplest way to use the wealth of Microsoft for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the consequences: computer prices would fall,
making the machines more accessible to the poorest users; other
software companies, heartened by Microsoft's ritual slaughter of
its cash cow, would be emboldened to resume innovating, and PC
sales would grow, giving Microsoft more chances to sell
applications software. The public relations value of such a gift
cannot even be calculated.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd gladly pledge the cost of my next copy of Windows to
some worthy cause. I can think of several. Funny thing is, I won't
need any help from the Gates family in making up my mind.  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Lara Flynn Boyle &LR; , 29, and  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; , 52, were looking
``very affectionate'' at the table right in front of podium.
 &UR; Courtney Love &LR; , dressed in her trademark ``appropriately smutty''
fashion, kept stepping outside to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political nature, the event began like a Hollywood
gala, with taped clips of celebrities wishing Beatty well. The
cheerleaders included  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; ,  &UR; Dustin Hoffman &LR; ,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Burton  &LR; and  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; , whose segment was booed.

PIZZA HUT TO PUT LOGO ON RUSSIAN ROCKET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pizza Hut Inc., the all-American fast-food purveyor, announced
Thursday that it will pay the Russians to place its new logo on the
rocket that launches the crew module for the international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based company would not disclose the amount it will
pay for the fleeting advertisement nor whether it has contracted
with the Russian Space Agency or a private contractor for the
unusual display.
</P>
<P>
   However, company president Mike Rawlings estimated the cost at
half that of a 30-second television spot for January's NFL Super
Bowl. The Wall Street Journal reported the half-minute spot to be
between $1.9 million and $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement will span about 30 feet of the 200-foot tall
Proton rocket that will be launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan. The colorful rocket will carry the Russian service
module, which includes living quarters for three station residents.
</P>
<P>
   The module is 17 months late because of Russian financial
difficulties, and it is still undergoing ground tests. The National
Aeronatical and Space Administration and Russia, though, have said
it will lift off no sooner than Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Pizza Hut saw an opportunity to make a statement to
consumers and competitors as the 41-year-old company undergoes a
$500 million makeover, including changes to its 10,000 restaurants
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do something that will capture the world's
attention,'' said Pizza Hut spokesman Jay Allison. The company
symbol will be visible for several minutes as NASA television and
news organizations train their cameras on the launch pad and the
rising rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have flirted with commercial advertisers in space
before, including Pepsi, which produced an inflatable soft drink
can for cosmonauts to display.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, too, has begun to make overtures to prospective commercial
partners, including advertisers. Its current interest is a
corporate venture willing to help it build a large inflatable crew
module that could be launched to the new international station in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut may be interested in additional space investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to be the first restaurant in space,'' said Allison.

COACHES' FATE HAS TO WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although Los Angeles Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone and manager Davey Johnson have spoken periodically
about the future of the coaching staff, they won't decide the fate
of the coaches until the season concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season, I don't think it's the time,'' Malone said.
``We have to finish up 1999. For 2000, I'll meet after the season
with Davey and then meet with the new president or (Fox Sports
Enterprises president) Rick Welts and tell them the direction we
want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Malone and Johnson were going to meet during the
road trip, but decided not to, partly because of the firing of
Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   First-base coach John Shelby and third-base coach Glenn Hoffman
joined the Dodgers staff last season. Hoffman replaced the fired
Bill Russell as manager; Shelby joined the staff when Russell's
assistants were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Jim Tracy, batting coach Rick Down and bullpen coach
Rick Dempsey are in their first full season with the organization.
Pitching coach Claude Osteen joined the staff when Charlie Hough
was fired May 26.
</P>
<P>
   The front-office brain trust met with the coaches and Johnson
for seven hours Wednesday to evaluate the Dodgers' roster and
players in the National League. They'll meet again today in Houston
to discuss American League players before Malone heads back to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Debating Dreifort's role: Darren Dreifort's recent shoulder
ailment, which ended his season Sept. 15 against Montreal, has
brought back the debate of whether the right-hander is better
suited to start or relieve. It's a topic the Dodgers will discuss
during the offseason and address in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Johnson said Dreifort needed to prove his worth.
A few weeks ago, Johnson said Dreifort proved it, but then the
former first-round pick was beset by tightness in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the issue is durability. Dreifort's two seasons as a
starter ended with arm weariness. He threw a career-high 180
innings last season, but didn't throw after Sept. 4 because of
soreness in his pitching shoulder. This year, he was shut down
after 1782/3 innings. He was 13-13 with a 4.79 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing real serious has been discussed yet,'' Malone said.
``It's always been considered an option. He's pitched well. He was
a closer in college. He's still developing as a starter. You don't
just pitch 250 innings. You build up to that. The more innings you
get, the more experience you have.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Raul Mondesi's four-RBI day gives the Dodgers a chance to
have three players with 100 RBI for the time since 1955. Eric
Karros has 112, Gary Sheffield has 98 and Mondesi has 97 with three
games left. Duke Snider (136), Roy Campanella (107) and Gil Hodges
(102) were the last Dodgers trio to accomplish the feat....
Sheffield walked three times to raise his total to 101. He also had
a hit and is batting .299 with 33 homers and 100 runs scored. If he
drives in two more runs and maintains his average, he'll join
Snider as the only Dodgers to bat .300, hit 30 homers and reach the
century mark in RBI, runs scored and walks.

 &HT;    More return home as roads open

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILE, N.C. _ No, Frances Jollie is not having a yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous piles of bookcases, appliances, books, clothing and
dressers in Jollie's front yard and garage are what is left of her
home. The house was inundated with about 5 feet of water from the
Tar River, which runs behind her residence.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Jollie sat amid her belongings in a folding
chair, one of the remaining Greenville residents waiting for her
home to be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``A yard sale? Sure, take whatever you want, it's free,'' Jollie
quipped. ``I'm not worried about someone stealing anything because
they can have it. Everything is ruined. I try to put some fun in it
and joke about it to keep from going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials expect to finish their inspections of flooded
homes by noon today, and will notify residents by phone when they
can pick up their house keys, said Katie Veilleux, public
information officer for the city.
</P>
<P>
   When residents pick up their keys, they can use the Greene
Street bridge because it's open after being closed more than a
week. The bridge was opened Wednesday because high water north of
the bridge subsided enough for cars to travel on the road, Veilleux
said. The bridge was the last artery leading north of the Tar River
to open.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk's office will be open Monday through Saturday 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Veilleux was unsure how many homes still need to be
inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some spotty areas on the north side and random
areas that were inaccessible because of water,'' Veilleux said.
``It's hard to say how many there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are still under way to shelter residents who don't have
homes they can return to. About 440 people moved from shelters at
area schools to Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs in Ayden, Greenville and
Farmville, according to the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Emergency Management Agency workers are still waiting
for the ground to dry enough to set up trailers on County Home Road
for shelter residents to move into, said Rudy Hernandez, FEMA
public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are about 8 feet by 30 feet and accommodate four
to six people. The County Home Road site will house more than 200
people. About 100 trailers will also be put in Grifton and more
will be placed north of the Tar River.
</P>
<P>
   County officials still must inspect about 2,000 homes, but have
been hampered by high water, said county spokesman Arlen Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather were to hold and the water were to recede
quickly enough, they might be able to get done by the beginning of
next week,'' Holt said. ``We're going back and trying to take care
of some of the things we couldn't get done right away. There are
still a number of areas we couldn't get into.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt said about three-quarters of the homes already inspected
require some kind of repair before the power can be turned on. He
said the damage estimates are not complete but remain at more than
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the county, two roads with restricted access have
opened. Pitt County Sheriff Mac Manning said a checkpoint at Clarks
Neck Road was removed Friday morning. A checkpoint at U.S. 264 and
Old Pactolus Road will be removed Saturday. Sunnyside Road and
River Road checkpoints will remain in place indefinitely, Manning
said.
</P>
<P>
   Areas will be re-evaluated every day and opened as flood waters
recede completely and residents can get back in and secure all
their belongings. Intense patrols including officers from other
counties and cities will continue countywide.
</P>
<P>
   With many roads damaged, under repair or closed, Department of
Transportation officials cautioned drivers to be careful while
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited access to many parts of the county is creating
bumper-to-bumper traffic congestion during different times of
day,'' a department news release said. ``Pitt County urges citizens
to remain cautious, be patient and drive defensively ... drivers
should anticipate traffic congestion and remain patient when
operating a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bell Arthur, officials said it is not necessary for Bell
Arthur Water Corporation customers to boil their water.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, executive director of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, told about 50 people at Philippi
Church of Christ on Thursday that he would begin work to mobilize
national organizations to come down and help the people of
Greenville and eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to continue to raise the issue of this
devastation,'' said King, son of slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. ``There are still some people who are not being
appropriately provided for.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that upon his return to Atlanta, he will contact and
meet with, among others, leaders of the National Baptist Convention
and the National Conference of Mayors to create dialogue and come
up with ways to aid eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs the nation's attention,'' said King, adding that he
will return in about a week with national leaders. ``People will
help as long as it is on the front pages of the newspapers, but
once it moves to the back, the nation does not respond as well. We
need to keep this out front.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the worst accident in Japan's troubled history with
nuclear power, an out-of-control chain reaction at a fuel
fabrication plant near Tokyo spewed high levels of radiation into
the air beginning Thursday morning. Thirty-five people were
exposed, three of whom were seriously injured, and 300,000 local
residents were ordered to stay indoors. The reaction was brought
under control early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the reaction was set off when workers
accidentally poured 35 pounds of uranium into a purification tank
containing nitric acid, instead of the 5.2 pounds normally used.
</P>
<P>
   This mistake reportedly caused a flash of blue light inside the
plant, owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Scientists said the flash
may have been the result of a fast chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. rushed 880 pounds of sodium borate to
the plant, but the authorities said they had no way of getting
close enough to the processing tank to dump the radiation-absorbing
powder onto it.
</P>
<P>
   When initial efforts to stop the reaction failed, the government
ordered residents of areas near the plant, in the town of
Tokaimura, to stay indoors. A primary school, a kindergarten, a
number of shops and several homes were all located within the
affected area.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day Thursday, the government made little fuss
about the accident, closing off a three-mile perimeter around the
area and warning residents to keep their windows shut. By late
Thursday evening, the East Japan Railway, which serves the area,
suspended train traffic to the immediate region of the accident.
Major highways into the town were also closed, and electronic signs
were posted on small roads warning motorists to avoid the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was scheduled to name a new
cabinet Friday but was forced by the incident to postpone the
change in government, apologized tacitly for the slow official
reaction. ``We must obtain decisions from scientists, technicians
and experts'' to assess such accidents, the prime minister told
reporters at his residence, according to the Kyodo news agency,
adding ``if they were slow in making decisions, we must make sure
that that never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Japan has compounded other nuclear accidents with
similarly slow, and often misleading, information given to the
public. Commentators here are already predicting a strong backlash
in public opinion against the industry and perhaps too against a
deeply embarrassed government.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The confused emergency response has been matched by a confused
political one, with rival agencies alternately seeking to dismiss
concerns about Japan's vast nuclear energy program, or calling for
a sweeping reevaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, the chief of the government's Natural Resources
and Energy Agency, Hirobumi Kawano, still ruled out the idea that a
``criticality,'' or uncontrolled reaction, could occur at a nuclear
power plant in Japan, and told reporters that he did not intend to
instruct power companies to re-examine their safety measures, Kyodo
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A top official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, however, said the accident was serious enough to lead
Japan to reconsider its nuclear power policy. Japan operates 51
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials requested the assistance of U.S. military forces in
Japan to handle the accident. According to the Japan Self-Defense
Agency, the government was informed that U.S. forces here are not
equipped to deal with nuclear accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese television network NHK said early Friday morning
that after repeated failed attempts to drain the tank by remote
control, emergency workers deliberately broke pipes leading to the
purification chamber, allowing it to cool. Workers were attempting
to insert hoses into the contaminated area to drench it with
special chemicals to absorb the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that the accident was being brought under
control Friday, Japanese television said that at 6:30 a.m., the
Science and Technology Agency reported that no radiation could be
detected at 14 monitoring sites around the plant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute,
measurements of radiation levels at the plant were reported to have
been from 10,000 to 20,000 times the normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an intense situation in which there is concern over the
continued effects of radiation,'' Obuchi told an emergency task
force named late Thursday to oversee handling of the accident. ``We
must make certain to prioritize the safety of the residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, said Thursday
night that units of Japan's Self-Defense Forces chemical warfare
unit were being dispatched to the site of the fuel fabrication
plant at Tokaimura, 87 miles northwest of Tokyo, but said that
Japan was ``not capable of dealing with this kind of nuclear
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonaka called the runaway reaction, known as a ``criticality
event'' in the jargon of the nuclear power industry, ``something
that Japan has never experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were meeting on the matter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports said that only three workers had been injured at
the site, and had been taken by helicopter to a hospital that
specialized in nuclear-related illnesses in Chiba prefecture to the
east of Tokyo. Later, two of the workers were reported to be in
serious condition, and a doctor involved in their treatment said
that all three of those initially reported injured had been exposed
to ``a quite substantial amount of radiation.'' One is in critical
condition and has not recovered consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As it became apparent late Thursday that the accident had still
not been brought under control, more and more reports of
radiation-related injuries trickled in. By dawn, authorities said,
at least 35 people had been contaminated, including workers at a
neighboring site, and the paramedics who helped evacuate the three
workers who were initially injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major accident resulting in a radioactive leak has
happened,'' said Koji Kitani, president of the JCO Co. ``We
apologize from the bottoms of our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of about 33,000 resident where the accident occurred,
Tokaimura, is home to more than a dozen nuclear-type plants, and
was the site of Japan's worst previous nuclear accident, in 1997.
In that incident, 37 workers were exposed to radiation after a fire
in one of the plants was improperly extinguished and caused a small
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking domestic petroleum resources, Japan heavily pushed the
development of nuclear energy in the 1970s, following the oil
shocks of that decade. The result is that the country is now
dependent upon nuclear power for about one-third of its electricity
needs, among the highest of any country. The fuel made at the plant
where the accident occurred is used in nuclear reactors nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This familiarity with nuclear power has not allowed Japan to
avoid accidents, however, and in recent years, nuclear safety has
increasingly become a major political issue for the public.
</P>
<P>
   In July, radiation estimated to be 11,500 times higher than
normal levels leaked out of faulty pipes in a nuclear reactor in
the town of Tsuruga, about 200 miles west of Tokyo. During that
accident, a reactor owned by Japan Atomic Power Co. was forced to
shut down after losing 51 tons of its radioactive water coolant.
The Tsuruga plant remains closed for repairs. During that accident,
a reactor owned by Japan Atomic Power Co. was forced to shut down
after losing 51 tons of its radioactive water coolant. The Tsuruga
plant remains closed for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's issue of Mainichi Shimbun quoted outraged members of
the government's Nuclear Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Kenji Sumida said, ``I know that this is difficult to believe,
but I think that we have no choice but to recognize this accident
as having been critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Kazuo Sato, speaking of the reports of employee
error, said, ``If they had done their job as they were supposed to,
there is no way something like this could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Chihiro Kamisawa, an anti-nuclear activist, told the Associated
Press, ``So much has been made of Japan's sophisticated technology
that supposedly makes nuclear energy safe. The accident proves
that's absolutely not true.''  &QL;

TWO FOREIGN RIVALS, ONE HUNGRY MARKET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Once a forbidden pleasure denounced by
Soviet officialdom, chewing gum has become entrenched in Russian
pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer demand for gum has led to a $180 million market _ and,
over the last two years, has brought investments of more than $170
million by international manufacturers in Russian operations.
</P>
<P>
   The William Wrigley Jr. Co. of Chicago, the world's largest
chewing-gum company with global sales of $1.8 billion last year,
has captured about 60 percent of the Russian market, according to
A.C. Nielsen, the market research company.
</P>
<P>
   But in the battle for shelf space in Russian stores, kiosks and
cafes, Wrigley has been dogged by an upstart from Denmark, a
family-owned company named Dandy, maker of the Stimorol and Dirol
brands, with $300 million in worldwide sales. Although its figure
does not jibe with the Nielsen number for Wrigley, Dandy claims 45
percent of the Russian market.
</P>
<P>
   While younger consumers can hardly remember life without gum,
those in their late 20s and older have a different story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, my swimming coach would tell us that
foreigners put needles in chewing gum to hurt Russian children,''
recalled Anastasia Vasilevskaya, 28, now deputy director of a
British-owned real estate company in St. Petersburg. ``This was
their way to keep us from chewing gum,'' she said, adding, ``I
often chew it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Voronkov, a sociologist in St. Petersburg, said, ``Thanks
to the efforts of Soviet propaganda, there existed a stereotype of
the uncultured American chomping on gum in the most disgusting
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why chewing gum?'' he added. ``Well, it was just an accidental
symbol of the American way of life, which was labeled antagonistic
to the Soviet life style.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia embracing a market economy, many young people are
buying gum, even though the average monthly salary is only 1,000
rubles, or about $40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confectionery is one of the first to rebound after any crisis
since prices are relatively low and affordable to the general
population,'' said Philip Wegh, director of the new Dandy factory.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Iskyam, a consumer goods analyst at Renaissance Capital, a
Moscow-based investment bank, said Wrigley and Dandy ``are
interested in Russia because it is a large market that is still in
its infancy, being relatively unsaturated.'' Renaissance Capital is
part of Sputnik Holdings, owned by the Russian-American financier
Boris Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Russian financial crisis of August 1998, the ruble has
fallen from around 6 to the dollar to a little over 25, sharply
raising the cost of most domestic goods as well as imports. Wrigley
and Dandy, because of their intense rivalry, have not raised prices
as much as most manufacturers, though a packet of chewing gum has
climbed to 6 or 7 rubles, from 3 before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the battle can be seen on television, where Russians
are bombarded by advertising for Dandy's Dirol and Wrigley's
Doublemint, Juicy Fruit and Orbit, a brand popular in Europe though
virtually unknown in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Wrigley's testimonial ads, young Russians praise Wrigley's
``amazingly long-lasting flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both companies are emphasizing what they call
``dental positioning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirol is functional chewing gum, and in our ads we try to
communicate the benefits of chewing it in the fight against tooth
decay,'' said Stanislav Cherkasov, Dandy's media and public
relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   An even stronger indication of the foreign companies' commitment
to the Russian market is the money spent building plants here. The
$70 million Wrigley plant in St. Petersburg began production in
late winter and will produce 15,000 tons of gum annually, not only
for Russia, which Wrigley says is one of its top 10 markets, but
also for export to Europe. Such exports would be important in case
of persistent economic difficulties in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Dandy built a $95 million plant in Veliky Novgorod, 112 miles
southwest of St. Petersburg, where it will make 7,000 tons of
Stimorol and Dirol a year. Lars Funder, general director of Dandy,
said it was ``100 percent committed to the Russian market.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley executives were also upbeat. ``Our sales last year in
Russia were around $100 million,'' said Stefan Pfander, Wrigley
vice president for Europe. ``Despite the economic difficulties''
last year, he added, ``we are here for the long haul.''

WHEN SAVINGS BONDS SPUTTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Ill.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last May, Richard P. Drury, 74, a retired civilian employee of
the Army who lives in Hilton Head, S.C., was reading a newspaper
article that led him to a startling discovery: 15 United States
savings bonds held by him and his wife, Carol _ worth a total of
$3,707.90 _ had not been earning any interest for at least three
years.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately cashed in these Series E bonds, which he had
acquired for $562.50 through a payroll deduction savings plan, and
stuck the money in a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Before reading the article, Drury had no idea that the
government changed its rules about such bonds in 1965. Under that
revision, Series E bonds issued through November 1965 earn interest
for 40 years; those issued in December 1965 and later earn interest
for just 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew that,'' Drury said. ``All the information I had
been reading was printed prior to 1965 and it said 40 years. Can
you image the number of drawers or safety deposit boxes throughout
this country that are just salted up with bonds like these?''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Pederson, a former supervisor of the Savings Bond
Division of the Federal Reserve Bank and the author of ``Savings
Bonds: When to Hold, When to Fold and Everything in Between'' (Sage
Creek Press, fourth edition, $19.95), has calculated that there are
more than $6.5 billion in savings bonds that have stopped earning
interest and never been cashed in. Some people tuck savings bonds
away and forget about them; other mistakenly think the bonds will
earn interest as long as they hold them.
</P>
<P>
   Savings bonds are popular, especially with older investors. Over
all, 55 million people hold a total of $180 billion of savings
bonds of all types.
</P>
<P>
   People like the bonds because they are easy to buy and, though
their various interest rates may be modest, their safety is rock
solid. And because you don't get the interest until you cash in the
bonds, taxes can be deferred until then, too.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Series EE bonds, the successors to Series E, can be
bought for as little as $25 each and have a face value of $50; the
most expensive are $5,000, with a face value of $10,000. Bonds
reach ``original maturity'' when they are worth their face value;
they continue to earn interest until they expire, but at differing
rates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, figuring out when to cash in a bond can be tricky,
Pederson points out. It can make sense to redeem a bond that is
paying a particularly low rate, but the problem is identifying it _
not a simple task.
</P>
<P>
   Because banks make virtually no money from savings bonds they
sell and redeem, have little incentive to train employees in the
details of savings bond management. And because savings bonds are a
do-it-yourself investment, Uncle Sam, despite switching the rules
from time to time, will never send you a statement outlining your
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure of the status of a bond, look first at the
issue date in the upper right corner. Any bonds issued from 1941
through October 1959 have stopped paying interest, as have bonds
issued from December 1965 through October 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds, which were first issued in 1980, earn interest
30 years from the issue date. The same is true for the new Series I
bond, whose return is linked to the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates depend on when a bond was bought. Newly purchased
Series EE bonds earn a market-based rate equal to 90 percent of the
average of Treasury issues with five years left to maturity. The
rate, currently 4.31 percent, is reset every six months.
Inflation-protected Series I bonds now pay 5.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each bond needs to be looked at as an individual investment,''
Pederson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for most bond holders to even calculate how much
interest they have accumulated _ and how much their bonds are
therefore worth. Pederson's company, the Savings Bond Informer in
Detroit (800-927-1901), appraises savings bonds for clients based
on a sliding scale. For 1 to 10 bonds, for example, the fee is $15;
for 700 bonds, it is $119.
</P>
<P>
   A report analyzes each bond for a number of factors, including
the current rate it is earning, and offers advice on the best time
to sell it. The Savings Bond Informer also has a Web site
(www.bondhelp.com). The government offers a somewhat similar but
less extensive service free on the Web (www.savingsbonds.gov). It
requires downloading and installing a program called the Savings
Bond Wizard on your personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   After his discovery, Drury had some of his older bonds appraised
by Pederson's company. So did Walter H. Smorowski, 79, who lives in
Des Plaines, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Also alerted by a newspaper article, Smorowski realized that he
had about $6,000 of Series E bonds that were no longer paying
interest. Before cashing them in, he got a report from the Savings
Bond Informer that told him exactly how much they were worth. It
was a good thing, he said, because his bank at first wanted to give
him $1,000 less. The bank quickly corrected its error.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't gotten that report, I probably would have just
taken what they offered me,'' Smorowski said.

<P>
   Tim Allen may be best known as a stand-up comedian, the star of
the television show ``Home Improvement'' and the voice of the hero
Buzz Lightyear in the animated film ``Toy Story.'' But he hopes to
become as trusted and honored a name in tools as Paul Newman is in
food _ with similar benefits for charity.
</P>
<P>
   However, Allen, as well as others delving into nonprofit
businesses, is finding that it isn't as easy as Newman's brand,
Newman's Own, makes it look.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's vision was to cash in on his fixated-with-tools comic
persona by making high-quality hammers, drills and other tools, and
giving the profits to the Tim Allen and Laura Diebel Foundation.
(Ms. Diebel is his wife.) The foundation donates to a variety of
causes, including the Target House in Memphis. But during the first
few years, Allen said, the company has lost money, though he would
not specify how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company cost us a mint to get going,'' he said, adding for
comic effect, ``It couldn't be something that is simple like _
pardon me, Paul Newman _ salad dressing.'' Allen has gone into his
own pocket to make sure the company could make some charitable
donations each year.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, like others, is finding that it is easier to raise money
for charity than to earn money for charity. Yet, the most exciting
trend in the charity world is to establish businesses that generate
a somewhat predictable stream of income for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the sizzle is,'' said James E. Thalhuber,
president and chief executive of the National Center for Social
Entrepreneurs, in Minneapolis, which advises nonprofit groups _
some linked to celebrities, some not _ that are planning to
establish businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sizzle is the glamour that giving-minded celebrities
have brought to these ventures _ like Robert Redford's Sundance
Institute, in Utah, which backs film makers, but is supported by a
resort, a film festival and a catalogue of priceycowboy-style
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Or Don Imus' Imus Ranch, which is being built near Santa Fe,
N.M., and is intended as a retreat for children with cancer. The
ranch may be supported in part by Imus products that he pitches on
the radio and that reportedly take in $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of celebrities are lending their fame to products with
charity ties. In cereals alone, the quarterback Doug Flutie has
Flutie Flakes, while baseball's Cal Ripken has Cal's Classic O's.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has helped to introduce Keeper Springs'
Mountain Spring water, proceeds from which are intended to protect
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Most groups that come to Thalhuber aren't prepared to make the
leap from fund-raising to sales. Thalhuber's organization has
developed a risk-assessment kit to help charities decide if they
are ready for business. ``We will ask them, how much do they
understand market forces, their understanding of the competition.
Do they have strategic planning and financial processes? What is
driving them? Is this the right timing? Are they willing to act?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says he is prepared to hone his business skills as he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, through a friend, the race car driver Michael
Andretti, who drives for the Newman/Haas race team, Allen arranged
for an introduction to executives at Newman's Own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best I could do was to get information about how to avoid
pitfalls,'' he said, ``and that you have to fail a bit to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's Own, which gives all its aftertax profits to charity,
has certainly claimed success. It projects sales of $100 million of
food products like salad dressings, popcorn and lemonade in 1999,
and said it had given $100 million to charity since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Allen wanted to include the kind of pricey features
that professionals appreciate but homeowners don't notice. ``People
didn't care that I used a high-density plastic, and better-feeling
switches, and better ball bearings, and an all-metal chuck,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The current drill, at about $40, is comparable in price and
quality to its direct competitors, he said. It still features
touches like a built-in bubble level to let homeowners know if the
hole they are drilling is straight. His tools _ hammers, drills,
knives, screwdrivers and tool kits _ are mostly made by the
Japanese company Ryobi Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   While celebrities bring attention to any business, that
visibility can have pitfalls. A marketing misstep can hurt a
celebrity's primary profession. ``In my career it's not advisable
to be doing infomercials,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities worry that their charitable efforts may be seen as
career-boosting publicity stunts. The talent agency Creative
Artists has established a foundation to give its artists and
corporate clients an avenue into charity work, mostly through
volunteering their skills or fame, yet the group's efforts have
been behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Morgan Binswanger, who runs the foundation, is
``to avoid the cynicism that is always out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Reibstein, a marketing professor at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that celebrity sponsorship
``is usually done by less than superstars, and it could taint them
a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be seen as an endorser,'' he added, ``and that's what
you do when you are hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of being perceived as publicity hounds creates a
difficult marketing proposition, as charitable companies try to
save advertising expenses by courting news coverage without looking
self-serving. An executive from Newman's Own agreed to provide some
information on the condition that no quotation would come from the
company itself. Neither Imus' group nor Redford's responded to
phone calls about that.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at Newman's Own said the company consulted
regularly with celebrities interested in following Newman's lead.
But why take such a difficult route to charitable giving?
</P>
<P>
   Jed Emerson, executive director of the Roberts Enterprise
Development Fund, which finances socially responsible businesses,
said the new popularity of these kinds of enterprises is driven by
'60s-raised executives, with a social conscience, who are trying to
fill the gap left by eroding government social services. Moreover,
he said, building these do-gooder companies is a creative challenge
that, if successful, can massage the ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it is a way for celebrities to be taken more
seriously,'' he mused. ``Maybe it's the same drive that sends
celebrities into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It's none of the above, Allen said. ``Mostly I like
challenges,'' he said, ``and it's a challenge to do a new business
that everybody benefits from.''

CONFUSION OVER TWO MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS CAUSED MARS ORBITER'S LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Simple confusion over whether measurements were
metric or not led to the loss last week of a $125 million
spacecraft as it approached Mars, NASA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An internal review team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in
a preliminary conclusion, said that engineers at Lockheed Martin
Corp., which had built the spacecraft, specified certain
measurements about the spacecraft's thrust in pounds, an English
unit, but that NASA scientists thought the information was a metric
measurement known as newtons.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting miscalculation, undetected for months as the craft
was designed, built and launched, meant the Mars Climate Orbiter,
as it was called, was off course by about 60 miles as it approached
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the cautionary tale that is going to be
embedded into introductions to the metric system in elementary
school and high school and college physics till the end of time,''
said John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's reaction was equally blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is disbelief,'' said Noel Hinners, vice president
for flight systems at Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colo.
``It can't be something that simple that could cause this to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding was a major embarrassment for NASA, which said it
was investigating how such a basic error could have gone through
the a space mission's checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not that the data was wrong,'' said Edward
C. Stone, the director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., which was in charge of the mission. ``The real issue is
that our process did not realize there was this discrepancy and
correct for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also wondered how something so basic could have
gone undetected for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked I could sort of visually detect the
difference between a foot and a meter,'' Pike said. ``This is kind
of the very first thing in Physics 101 or Engineering 101. This is
the only significant program failure that anyone's ever heard of
that's due to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure could raise questions about whether NASA and its
contractors are skimping on safety in order to cut costs. The Mars
Climate Orbiter, the first spacecraft designed to study the climate
of another planet, was exceedingly inexpensive by NASA's standards.
It is part of a new strategy to fly more but less expensive,
missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   That limits the damage done by the failure of any single
mission. ``There is not a single mission in the program that is
critical to the overall program,'' said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   But Pike said, ``Obviously the question they are going to have
to ask is maybe it was a little too cheap. The question that will
have to be asked here is whether in cutting costs, they cut
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure is also another black eye for Lockheed, the nation's
largest military contractor, which in the last year or so has
suffered several failures of rockets and missiles it has developed.
These failures led the company to restructure its operations and
change management in its space business.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said they are checking to make sure the same
error does not occur in the Mars Polar Lander, which is now en
route to Mars and scheduled to reach the planet on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate review committees have already been formed to
investigate the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter _ the internal Jet
Propulsion Laboratory peer review team, which made Thursday's
preliminary findings, and a special review board of experts from
the laboratory and elsewhere. An independent NASA failure review
board will be formed shortly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known with certainty what happened to the Mars Climate
Orbiter. At first there was speculation that it crashed on Mars or
burned up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But the review team now tends to think that the spacecraft is
now orbiting the sun, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokesman said.
Under this theory, the spacecraft approached too close to Mars and
overheated, causing the engine that was being fired to bring the
craft into orbit to stop functioning, so the Orbiter continued on
into space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and Lockheed officials said the full details of how the
mistake occurred are not known. But, basically, Lockheed was
providing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with data on the amount of
energy imparted to the spacecraft by its thrusters that are fired
periodically. This was measured in pound-seconds, Hinners said.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory assumed the figure
was in newton-seconds and incorporated it into computer models that
are used to calculate the spacecraft's position and direction.
These models supplement other data about the spacecraft's position,
Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Since one pound equals about 4.4 newtons, it would seem that
such an error would be readily detected, but Hinners said this was
not the case because the thrusters contributed only a little to the
orbit. ``The firings would have been a very small piece of a larger
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The miscalculations put the spacecraft off course by only about
60 miles out of a journey of roughly 416 million miles, Stone said.

GORE AND BRADLEY ARE SET TO BEGIN EARLY SERIES OF DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th-5th grafs to provide different excerpt from Coelho's
letter) (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley are poised to begin an unusually early and intense series
of debates in the run-up to the primary season next year. As a
start, their campaigns said Thursday they have agreed to take part
in a nationally televised town meeting four weeks from now in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Gore's advisers said, they had been reluctant to
agree to early debates because they feared it would elevate the
stature of Bradley and give him millions of dollars worth of free
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bradley has emerged as a threat for the Democratic
presidential nomination, the vice president's advisers said they
were willing to risk giving heightened exposure to a rival who Gore
had virtually ignored for months. Instead, their hope now is to
capitalize on what they consider to be Gore's adroit debating
skills. .
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the campaign released a letter from Tony Coelho,
Gore's campaign chairman, to Douglas Berman, his counterpart in the
Bradley campaign, calling for a series of debates beginning as soon
as next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions during the past few days,'' Coelho wrote,
``Senator Bradley has seemed hesitant to join Al and our campaign
in reaching out to the American people through an increased number
of debates that would allow each candidate to thoroughly present
their views and ideas.`` While the Bradley campaign has not
responded specifically to the letter, Anita Dunn, Bradley's
communications director, said her candidate has long been eager to
engage the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's willingness to debate Bradley is yet another indication
of how competitive the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination has become in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Gore announced
he was paring down his campaign organization and moving his
headquarters from Washington to Nashville in his home state of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, new financial reports indicated that Bradley
had raised more money in the past three months than the vice
president and had more cash on hand as the primary season
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two Democratic presidential contenders seem to be
rushing toward head-to-head confrontations, the Republican
frontrunner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has declined to debate
his rivals until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Bush is so far ahead in the polls that his advisers
said there was nothing for him to gain by participating. And,
unlike Gore, Bush has had far less experience in debates and, by
his own admission, is still being schooled by his advisers about
many national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers conceded that Bradley knows the issues but noted
that the vice president was far more experienced in national
debates. ``I'm going to present my own vision for what this nation
needs to do in the future,'' Gore said Wednesday night in an
interview on CNN. ``And I can't think of a better way to do that
than have a good, spirited debate about the future of America with
somebody who I know well, Bill Bradley. And I hope that he will
accept my challenge to a series of debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's debate challenge, Bradley, campaigning in San
Diego on Wednesday, said, ``That's an abrupt strategy shift _ this
time yesterday they were ignoring me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore won much praise in debates in 1996 for his
dispatching of Ross Perot, the Reform Party presidential candidate,
and Jack F. Kemp, the Republican vice presidential contender, he
did not draw such reviews for how he handled a debate in 1992 with
Vice President Dan Quayle. Gore was criticized then for not
defending his running mate, Bill Clinton, from Quayle's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley have agreed to appear at a Democratic
dinner in Des Moines on Oct. 9, where both are scheduled to speak
but not debate. Some news organizations have scheduled debates in
New Hampshire in January and in California in early March, but so
far the only actual forum that both sides have agreed to is an
hour-long session sponsored jointly by CNN and WMUR, a local
television station in Manchester, N.H., on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors described the format as more a town meeting at
Dartmouth College than a debate because the candidates, while
appearing side-by-side on stage, will take questions from ordinary
citizens and not spar directly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not billing this as a debate,'' said Tom Hannon, CNN's
political director. ``It may be a semantic difference, but there
will be no panel of journalist questioners, there will be no point,
counter-point or rebuttal except if one candidate personally
attacks another the moderator will give them a chance to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN, WMUR, which is an an affiliate of ABC, and the Fox network
, are sponsoring a similar event the next day _ this one 90 minutes
_ among six confirmed Republican contenders, but Bush has said he
will not participate. Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for Bush, said the
only such event he has thus far agreed to is a debate in Iowa on
Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking forward to debating next year when people are
paying attention,'' Ms. Tucker said.

<P>
   A top campaign consultant to Vice President Al Gore helped
Philip Morris Cos. develop television advertisements this spring to
undercut support for a planned federal lawsuit against the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant, Carter Eskew, said in an interview on Wednesday
that he was severing all ties with the concern that developed the
advertisements, which were tested before focus groups but have not
been produced. Eskew's resignation came after inquiries by The New
York Times this week to Philip Morris officials and Eskew about the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew also helped to create a $40 million advertising blitz by
the cigarette industry last year that has been credited with
helping to defeat federal anti-tobacco legislation. He said that
his work on the latest Philip Morris project and other tobacco
industry assignments ended in July when he took a leave of absence
from Bozell/Eskew, the advertising and consulting concern that was
working on the advertisements, to join Gore's campaign as its top
media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said the company
tested some advertisements several months ago in response to
President Clinton's announcement in his State of the Union message
in January that the government would sue cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed such an action last week, accusing
cigarette makers of racketeering and fraud and seeking to recover
up to $20 billion annually in health-care costs for what it
contends are illnesses linked to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tested some ads because we are opposed to the lawsuit and
opposed to the funding of the lawsuit,'' Ms. Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the themes of the proposed advertisements was that any
government lawsuit represented ``taxation through litigation,''
said two consultants who had been briefed about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the House and Senate have resisted an administration
effort to add $20 million to the appropriations bill for the
Justice Department to pay for the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's announcement in January, officials of Philip
Morris and the country's other big cigarette producers, including
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a unit of BAT
Industries PLC, met with their public relations advisers to develop
a response, said the people briefed about those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The companies agreed on a strategy of contacting journalists,
editorial boards and politicians to promote their argument that any
government lawsuit against cigarette makers was unfounded because
the Justice Department did not have the legal basis to bring such
an action.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris officials apparently wanted to take the
campaign a further step, by beginning an aggressive television
advertising campaign that might rally public and political support
against the filing of a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts said the company decided not to produce the
commercials, but she declined to elaborate. The people briefed
about the campaign said officials of R.J. Reynolds and Brown &AMP;
Williamson either did not want to get involved in the campaign or
did not want to help finance it.
</P>
<P>
   An R.J. Reynolds spokeswoman said that the company did not have
any immediate comment. A spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, Mark
Smith, said, ``If we did not agree to do the ads, it probably was
because of timing'' because the federal lawsuit had not been filed.
</P>
<P>
   An industry campaign designed last year by Eskew was credited
with helping cigarette makers to defeat a Senate bill to assess
hundreds of billions of dollars against the industry to sharply
drive up the price of cigarettes and reduce demand.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said in a
recent interview that Eskew retained a relationship with his
concern while working for Gore but had to have all his projects
approved by the campaign and was prohibited from doing any tobacco
industry work or sharing in profits from such work.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for BSMG Worldwide, which owns
Bozell/Eskew, said that Eskew had notified officials this week that
he had severed all ties with the company effective Thursday.

<P>
   Workers at a Japanese nuclear fuel factory were mixing a liquid
batch of uranium Thursday when there was a sudden flash of blue
light _ the ominous flash of radiation at the moment when the
uranium begins a chain reaction, or in the language of the age,
goes critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inadvertent criticality'' is the term used by nuclear
engineers for this accidental chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the atomic age, scientists and engineers have
worried about this type of accident in the handling of nuclear
materials like uranium and plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents at power plants are the most familiar, but accidents
like Thursday's at processing plants have occurred, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the atoms are split, their fragments, called fission
products, are quickly spread and are far more radioactive than the
uranium was before its atoms began splitting.
</P>
<P>
   But nuclear regulatory officials and scientists said the
accident, at the Tokaimura plant northwest of Tokyo, though
serious, was not a catastrophe on the scale of a large reactor
accident like the partial nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island,
near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979, or the explosion at the Chernobyl
nuclear reactor in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1986.
The Ukraine accident killed 31 people and contaminated vast areas
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it will be a long-term problem,'' David
Lochbaum, nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, told Reuters. ``This appears to be a local disaster and
not a global one.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, scientists said, the Japanese accident involves
only a few pounds of uranium and thus should not be enough fuel to
sustain a prolonged chain reaction or cause widespread destruction.
But the criticality does give off a shower of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In a reactor, the reaction is sustained because the nuclear
material is held in place, at the proper density and shape for
continuing the fission process.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a reactor, though, the reaction should die out quickly
because the energy released by the nuclear fission literally blows
the mass apart in a small radioactive burst.
</P>
<P>
   It was still too early to determine exactly what happened at the
Japanese plant.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Meyer, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna, said that the uranium involved was from ore and
was being cleaned in a chemical process.
</P>
<P>
   Some American experts said that if, as reported, the tank was
filled with uranium in the form of uranyl nitrate, this implied
that the uranium had come not from ore but from uranium being
reprocessed after a prior use.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports said that the uranium being processed was
enriched to 19 percent, meaning that 19 percent of the atoms were
uranium-235, the form that splits readily. A breeder reactor, a
type intended to produce more fuel than it consumes, needs the
richer form of uranium.
</P>
<P>
   But in most commercial reactors, uranium is enriched to 3 to 5
percent. The higher the enrichment, the less uranium is needed to
form a critical mass. Dr. Peter Parker, a professor at the Nuclear
Structure Laboratory at Yale University, said, the workers were
apparently mixing too much uranium in a small vessel. ``That made
the density of the uranium so high that the neutrons didn't get
absorbed by the other material around,'' he said, and this led to
an out-of-control reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Several criticality accidents have occurred at fuel processing
plants in the United States. One worker received a lethal dose of
radiation in a similar accident at a plant in Charlestown, R.I., in
1964. Similar accidents at Los Alamos, N.M., killed two bomb
researchers during the Manhattan Project, the effort in World War
II to develop the first atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   At a plant in Wilmington, N.C., owned by the General Electric
Co., workers in 1991 mistakenly transferred liquid wastes
containing uranium into a tank that, because of its size and shape,
could have posed a criticality hazard. The plant declared an
emergency, but the crisis passed without an out-of-control
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has repeatedly fined contractors for lax
controls over uranium and plutonium handled at its weapons plants.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates civilian atomic
projects, licenses seven processing plants and inspects them twice
a year, for criticality safety. The facilities are in Hematite,
Mo.; Columbia, S. C.; Erwin, Tenn.; Richland, Wash., two in
Lynchburg, Va., and the one in Wilmington, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said that to obtain a license,
plants must ``have at least two independent barriers to inadvertent
criticality.''
</P>
<P>
   They could simply assure that the vessel is too small to contain
a critical mass or that it has the wrong shape, a column, for
example, rather than a round bowl. In a sphere, the neutron given
off by a uranium atom is far more likely to strike another uranium
atom, sustaining a chain reaction, than if the material is in a
long thin pipe.

   ``You control the geometry,'' said Felix Killar, director of
materials licensing at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade ground
in Washington. ``You put it in containers that no matter what
happens, the material can't go critical, because it's in a safety
geometry.''

   Some plants weigh the contents of a tank and shut off the flow

   Dr. Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy And
Environmental Research in Washington, said that the Tokaimura plant
in Japan has had other accidents in recent years and should be shut
down for a thorough, independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports that the reaction there could be
continuing hours after the accident, he said: ``This is a most,
most unusual accident. This is going to fascinate the people with
the sharp pencils for a long time.''

COLTS' FIRST-ROUND PICKS IMPROVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAMIAN SECORE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't seem so long ago that the Indianapolis Colts wasted
one top-five draft pick after another, prompting self-appointed NFL
Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. to initiate squabbles between him and
Colts management by making comments to the effect of, `and that's
why the Colts find themselves drafting in the same position every
year.'
</P>
<P>
   Like in 1990, when it drafted Jeff George No. 1 overall,
although George made it clear he never wanted to play there. Or in
1992, when they took Steve Emtman and Quentin Coryatt with the
first two picks of that draft. Or after selecting Trev Alberts
fifth overall in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, however, the Colts have made
outstanding first-round selections, all on offense, that has
provided the foundation for playoff hopes this year and well into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Colts selected Marvin Harrison, who leads all NFL
receivers with six touchdowns, 28 receptions and 422 yards.
</P>
<P>
   1997's first-round pick was tackle Tarik Glenn, who successfully
protects the blindside of quarterback Peyton Manning, the first
pick in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Manning had the most prolific year of any NFL rookie quarterback
in 1998, setting rookie records in completions (326), attempts
(575), passing yards (3,739) and TD passes (26). This year, he
leads the AFC with 911 yards and 7 TD passes and his 404 yards
against San Diego Sunday broke Johnny Unitas' franchise record for
passing yards in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts then filled its void in the backfield with Edgerrin
James, the fourth pick in this year's draft. James has two 100-yard
games and an AFC-leading 276 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short time we've played together, he's a threat on
every play and that's what you want in your running back, just like
Terrell Davis is for Denver and Jamal Anderson is for Atlanta,''
Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind Indy could have selected Ricky Williams ahead of
James at running back. Williams, with 120 yards and no TD's, has
picked up two injuries in two games. The Colts also turned out to
be the wiser in taking Manning instead of, gulp, Ryan Leaf. Enough
said there.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts have scored 86 points in three games and are one blown
second half lead against New England from being 3-0 in the NFL's
best division, the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to be a better team,'' Manning said.
``Our main goal in the offseason was to be an improved football
team and make the playoffs, which I think is a realistic goal.''
</P>
<P>
   GREEN'ER PASTURES: Although Rams coach Dick Vermeil vowed Trent
Green will still have his starting quarterback job next season when
he recovers from his preseason knee injury, what happens if Kurt
Warner continues to play like he's still lighting up the Arena
Football League? This is the dilemma Vermeil may face eventually,
but he's reaping the rewards of Warner's stellar start to the
season. Warner is a second-year Ram who began resurrecting his
football career with the Arena League's Iowa Barnstormers (1995-97)
and NFL Europe's Amsterdam Admirals in 1998. From the 8-on-8,
50-yard, indoor war to the ``big field,'' as Warner refers to it,
he's compiled 584 passing yards, six touchdowns and the second
highest QB rating in the NFC through three weeks (though the Rams
have played two games). ``I always believed that I had the ability
and I always hoped that I would get the opportunity, but I can't
say that I knew it would happen,'' Warner said. ``I had some
workouts that really went well but I think it was always that
skepticism that he had been successful, but it was in Arena
Football, it wasn't on the big field. Everybody always said that we
were always playing in a little cracker box.'' Warner, 28, recalls
his days of playing for crackers, comparatively speaking, in the
cracker box. He estimates his best Arena Football year made him
$65,000. ``I had a job in the offseason,'' he said. ``I would get a
couple of hundred dollars here and there for touchdown passes or
completion percentage or for wins and losses. It was real
incentive-based.'' Warner said his past prepared him for the NFL
much better than if he was drafted into the NFL straight away.
Particularly, he said the Arena League's offense-oriented, faster
paced game enhanced his ability to make quick reads and sound
judgments for the NFL game. ``It has given me a chance to play in a
lot of different football games, a lot of different situations and
how to react to a lot of different things,'' Warner said. ``I was
in a lot of big games in the Arena League and as offense is, you
have to score almost every time that you get the ball so you build
that mentality that no one can stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   TEAMMATES' TAKE ON GALLOWAY: Contract talks between Seattle
coach/GM Mike Holmgren and receiver Joey Galloway broke off again
last weekend, but its damage to the team and Galloway's alienation
from teammates are not as severed as they could be because Seattle
is off to a 2-1 start, which isn't quite the leverage Galloway is
looking for. ``I don't think it's affecting us,'' Seahawks
linebacker Darrin Smith said of the holdout. ``We're all just
trying to get better and win so it's hard to focus on issues we
don't have control of.'' It sure would be a shame to see Holmgren
turn this team into a winner, like he did in Green Bay, get the
Seahawks to the playoffs for the first time since 1988 and for
Galloway to miss out on it all.
</P>
<P>
   HERO OF WEEK 3: Brett Favre, Green Bay. He didn't cry like after
his comeback against the Raiders in Week 1, but his 15th
game-winning drive kept Minnesota weeping for yesteryear. Favre hit
Corey Bradford on a 23-yard, fourth-down, TD pass with 12 seconds
to lift the Packers to a 23-20 victory over the Vikings. By the
way, we're asking Oakland and Minnesota when the last time a
`prevent defense' actually lived up to its name.
</P>
<P>
   GOAT OF WEEK 3: Ki-Jana Carter, Cincinnati. Carter dislocated
his right knee cap against Carolina and was placed on injured
reserve, making it the third season-ending injury he's had in his
five NFL years. Having rushed for 747 yards in 32 career games,
compared to his 1,539 yards as a junior at Penn St., he should have
to return much of the money he's made that comes with being the No.
1 overall draft pick in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK: New York Jets (0-3) at Denver (0-3). In what
was supposed to be a high-profile game when the season started,
last year's AFC cream of the crop has been reduced to cream puffs
after losing their quarterbacks -- John Elway to retirement and
Vinny Testaverde to injury. A victory is vital for both teams for
two reasons: 1) To keep any sort of playoff hope alive. 2) To avoid
further embarrassment and get a victory before the Browns do.
Broncos 17, Jets 13
</P>
<P>
   UPSET OF THE WEEK: Oakland (plus 3 1/2) over Seattle. Nobody's
more upset over Joey Galloway's holdout than the Raiders' Charles
Woodson, who's quickly building his resume as one of the best
cover-corners in the game. Already boasting one of the better
defenses in the NFL, the Raiders' offense is holding up its end
with mistake-free quarterback play from Rich Gannon and a
revitalized Tyrone Wheatley. Raiders 24, Seahawks 16

IN A CITY WITH CATTLE IN ITS PAST, THE COWS HAVE COME HOME

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Now he had seen it all. The exasperated Chicago police
sergeant called to alert the authorities at city hall. Get this, he
told them: A fiberglass cow is standing in the middle of Michigan
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Relax, the sergeant was told, the cow is cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows on Parade,'' a whimsical display of 300 painted and
decorated cows, has created an astonishing buzz. Sidewalk traffic
is jammed with people posing for pictures with the creatures.
Tourism has soared. Art careers have taken off.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Mayor Richard M. Daley's cultural affairs
department, the public art display is the latest example of how
artifice has replaced edifice as a tool of leaders of great urban
centers. In the days of the mayor's father, Richard J. Daley, when
federal money was plentiful for public works projects, Chicago
piled bricks and mortar to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the mayor promotes rose gardens and antique street
lamps and wrought-iron fences, esthetic touches that appeal in a
city where the lunch-bucket populace has largely given way to the
gourmet coffee set. But the stunning success of the objets de cow
also reveals the eagerness of ordinary people to appreciate art.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when New York taxpayers are debating whether to stop
financing a museum for a display that is, depending on the point of
view, provocative or disgusting _ it includes a portrait of the
Blessed Virgin stained with elephant dung _ Chicagoans, including
some who have not haunted a museum in a while, are being reminded
how art can make them smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem alienated by the arts these days,'' said Donald
Stahlke, a Chicago artist whose tattooed cow, Taurus, stands in
front of the Wrigley Building here. ``If it is going to survive,
art is going to have to open up the market a little bit, get out of
the galleries, reach average people.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahlke said the cow exhibit has tickled the artistic
sensibilities of people like his parents, a retired factory worker
and a homemaker, who recently came to Chicago to view the painted
cattle and genuinely enjoyed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   High-brow art does pretty well here, too. The Art Institute
houses one of the nation's finest collections of French
Impressionist paintings, and people have flocked to shows of the
works of Monet, Renoir and Degas. But over the last few weeks,
Chicagoans have been hustling past these famous works to gaze, and
chuckle, at the cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating to see how different artists started at the
same point, and did things so differently,'' said Lyda Haas, 68, a
retired medical assistant, as she admired some cows near the
Tribune Tower. ``They say there's one with high heels. That's the
one I want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Edfors, 52, a lawyer accustomed to taking a brisk,
no-nonsense walk to the office, has lately been stopping to spend a
moment with the painted cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was skeptical,'' said Edfors on a glorious
September morning. ``I just thought this was silly and a waste of
money. But you know, Michigan Avenue has become livelier. People
are having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Cattle have a storied place in Chicago history. Mrs. O'Leary's
cow was blamed for the fire of 1871, although historians have since
vindicated her. The stockyards on the South Side, now defunct,
achieved literary fame, however unappetizing, when Upton Sinclair
wrote ``The Jungle'' in 1906. And for most of the '90s, the
basketball Bulls stampeded to a string of championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago art exhibition, which was modeled after one in
Zurich last year, features a herd bought by art benefactors and
corporations, who hired local artists to turn the bare, fiberglass
beasts into artwork.
</P>
<P>
   After the exhibition, they will be sold at a Sotheby's auction
at the Chicago Theater on Nov. 9. Tickets, priced at $25, are
expected to go fast.
</P>
<P>
   While the cows have generally been treated with respect _
indeed, sometimes with reverence _ there has been some vandalism.
In a few cases, people pulled off cow parts for souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were prepared,'' said Heidi Kooi, a spokeswoman for the
tourism office. ``We had ordered extra ears and horns.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials here estimate that the cow show, which runs
through Oct. 31, has brought an additional $100 million to $200
million in spending in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole phenomenon has some rural visitors to Chicago
scratching their heads in wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can somebody tell me what's going on here with all these
cows?'' asked Larry Harris, 48, a tourist from Chatham, Va., who
works for a dairy farm in rural Virginia. He said he had come to
Chicago to see the bright lights and tall buildings, adding that at
home, he sees cows all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come all the way to downtown Chicago,'' he said with a groan
that turned into a belly laugh, ``and what do I see but cows.'' &QL;

   MAJOR STOCK GAUGES FINISH 3D QUARTER ON POSITIVE NOTE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended the third quarter on a positive note, as a rally in
the bond market helped to push major market indexes higher. They
also benefited as mutual fund managers bought shares of companies
that have done well to make end-of-quarter reports look better to
their investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished the quarter at
10,336.95, after rising 123.47 points, or 1.21 percent. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased by 14.34 points, to
1,282.71, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.89 points, to
2,746.16.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriting by investment banks slowed in the third quarter.
Securities firms and banks issued $473 billion of stocks and bonds,
a 3.5 percent increase from $456.8 billion in the third quarter of
1998, but a marked decline from the first two quarters of 1999.

   HEALTH INSURERS' STOCKS FALL
</P>
<P>
   Shares of major health insurers, including Aetna, which was down

   CENSUS BUREAU UPBEAT ON WAGES
</P>

   Rising incomes, lifted by a strong economy, brought 1.1 million

GRAZIANO DESERVED THE AXE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The revelation that Bob Graziano was fired as president by the
Los Angeles Dodgers the other day wasn't nearly as surprising to me
as the revelation that Bob Graziano was hired as president by the
Dodgers in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Malley is the culprit who committed that particular
felony, much to the distress of the more deserving Fred Claire, who
should have been given the job.
</P>
<P>
   I never rejoice in a person getting fired, but if ever a person
deserved such a fate, it was Mr. Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   The guy was a bean counter who somehow manipulated his way into
a position for which his only qualifications were a pleasing smile,
a friendly personality and a God-given ability to toady up to Peter
O'Malley and then to Fox executives Chase Carey and Peter Chernin.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano had no background in baseball, and originally was hired
by the Dodgers to oversee their financial affairs, quite befitting
a USC graduate with a degree in accounting who once worked for
Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   He was nothing more than a figurehead with the Dodgers, yet took
public responsibility for the trading of Mike Piazza and sacking of
Claire and Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger franchise deteriorated into a chaotic, formless mess
under Graziano's watch, and his detachment is one of the few
positive moves Fox has made since buying the team from O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what role, if any, Graziano played in hiring the
Dodgers' clownish general manager, Kevin Malone, or in all the
other moves that have turned a once proud franchise into one of the
laughingstocks of professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But I do know Graziano was quite willing to take credit for the
ceaseless stream of shenanigans, which the principled Claire
refused to do when the meddling Carey decided it would be a
brilliant idea to teach Mike Piazza a cruel lesson and dispatch him
to the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Claire would wind up getting fired for such insubordination, and
was widely applauded for it.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure Claire isn't shedding a tear over Graziano's
plight, and neither is anyone else with passionate feelings about
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano was the quintessential example of the Peter Principle
an organization's employee advancing to his highest level of
incompetence and I'm sure he'll now go back doing what he does best
in the private sector, auditing accounts, upgrading computerized
ticket systems and catering shamelessly to those giving him orders.
...
</P>
<P>
   Taking into consideration the wacky way the Dodgers have
conducted business since Rupert Murdoch assumed control, I've come
up with two separate categories for Graziano's successor, SC
(serious candidate) and GC (goofy candidate).
</P>
<P>
   Here are my selections:
</P>
<P>
   (SC) Dennis Gilbert A former high-profile player agent (Barry
Bonds, Jose Canseco, Bret Saberhagen, Mike Piazza, etc.), Gilbert
understands the inner workings of baseball, having even played in
the minors himself. Well-respected by all factions of the sport.
Smart, shrewd and perceptive. Might have too many impressive
credentials for paranoid Fox execs.
</P>
<P>
   (GC) Marvin Davis Why not? The billionaire's name is linked to
every athletic business transaction in America, so why shouldn't he
be linked with a major athletic job opening?
</P>
<P>
   (SC) Fred Claire Who's more qualified than Claire, who spent 30
years with the Dodgers working in all aspects of the organization?
He has a keen awareness of hallowed Dodger traditions that have
been swept under the rug by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   (GC) Donald Sterling If the Dodgers are doing it for laughs and
all their moves in recent years indicate that they are then who
better to dispense histrionics than the zany owner of the Los
Angeles Clippers?
</P>
<P>
   (SC) Barry Kemp Unparalleled patience, as evidenced by the $10
million he's blown since 1996 during his ownership of the Long
Beach Ice Dogs and the fact that he agreed with the city to keep
his team here two more years so he can blow another $6 million. The
guy also knows how to field winning teams, as evidenced by the Ice
Dogs' success on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   (GC) Chris Rock Please, don't snicker. At least he's funnier
than Kevin Malone, whose comedic antics I believe are quite
unwitting.
</P>
<P>
   (SC) Beverly O'Neill Mayor Bev has played a vital role in the
revival of Long Beach. I'm sure she can perform similar managerial
magic with the Dodgers if only given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   (GC) Elgin Baylor One of the nicest guys I've known in sports,
and Fox would be doing a laudable public gesture by freeing him
from the oppressive shackles of Sterling. Doesn't know much about
baseball some claim he doesn't know much about basketball, either
but that should be irrelevant. I'm not sure that Bob Graziano even
knew the difference between a ball and strike. ...
</P>
<P>
   First, the Lakers sign A.C. Green, now Benoit Benjamin and John
Salley. Who next, Milton Berle?. ...
</P>
<P>
   So Billy Crystal pays more than $200,000 for a Mickey Mantle
mitt not worth more than $20,000. I never figured Crystal for being
as lousy a businessman as he is a comedian. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's been a sad week on the docks with the passing of one of the
most popular longshoreman, Dave Main, a San Pedro High graduate who
was a junior college All American lineman at Compton College in
1955. ``One of the toughest and nicest guys I've ever known,'' says
Ray Ortiz, who was a longtime friend and Downey neighbor of Main.
...
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue is doing everything within his power to hand over
an expansion franchise to L.A., but I'm still cynical about the
willingness of Michael Ovitz and his supermarket billionaire pal,
Ron Burkle, to put up their own money, which the NFL ultimately
will demand. ...
</P>
<P>
   The NFL officials assess too many unnecessary penalties, blow
too many calls and decide too many games. And this is a recording
that will be recited at least 15 more times in this column during
the fall and winter months. ...
</P>
<P>
   The more people I talk to, the more disgusted I get with Oscar
De La Hoya's performance against Felix Trinidad. There are a few
yokels not on Bob Arum's payroll who still are hopelessly blinded
by De La Hoya's well-marketed luster and worshipfully stick up for
their idol. But those whose brains actually have made it to their
heads and understand the nuances and subtleties of boxing are quite
unforgiving in their assessment of De La Hoya's $24 million public
fleecing. ...
</P>
<P>
   A fighter who does what he is paid to do in a ring he fights
Julio Cesar Chavez will be featured on Showtime Saturday night on
Showtime when he faces Willy (cq)
</P>
<P>
   Wise at the Las Vegas Hilton. Also on the card will be Richard
Lopez, who usually fights at 105 but has beefed all the way up to
108 for his match against Will Grigsby. Incidentally, I hear Chavez
has been savagely demeaning De La Hoya in Spanish television
interviews. ...
</P>
<P>
   Swimming great Susie Atwood reports that the second annual Long
Beach/C.A.R.E. Triathlon and Fitness Expo will be held on Oct. 16
between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the JAX Bicycle Center in Long Beach.
A triathlon will be staged the next day, starting in front of the
Belmont Olympic Pool. Atwood's constant companion, the athletically
gifted, physically imposing, culturally enhancing Dave Butler, is
expected to participate in an event from which the proceeds will go
to the C.A.R.E. program. ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the perfect Dodger president would be my old radio
partner, Joe (The Big Nasty) McDonnell, consigned to eternal
obscurity these days doing afternoon quarterly hour updates on
KFWB, but still a feared journalist who broke a blockbuster this
week about two Dodger minor league coordinators allegedly becoming
``increasingly verbally abusive with young players.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers need a guy to clean house and make all the deft
moves, it would be ol' Joe, who always knows what's best for L.A.'s
sport teams that, at this desperate time, are badly in need of his
unique services.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The country's highest court invalidated
two important tax increases Thursday in surprise rulings that could
hurt the government's efforts to narrow the budget deficit. The
rulings unnerved investors and stocks tumbled nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increases _ on the salaries and pensions of public
employees _ were challenged by civil servants, and the Supreme
Federal Tribunal sided with them in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling that one
tax, which varies from 11 percent to 25 percent for Brazil's
694,000 retired civil servants depending on the size of their
pensions, was illegal. A second ruling found that increased taxes
on the salaries of 712,000 acting government workers were
unconstitutional. Many more civil servants on the state and
municipal levels are affected by the rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions are a blow to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's efforts to exert more fiscal discipline in Latin
America's largest economy, which has struggled to recover from a
currency crisis in January that led to a rescue package by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's administration has been trying to narrow a gaping
budget deficit that corresponds to 12 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product. Pension spending, payroll outlays and interest
payments on government bonds are the main reasons for the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that one branch of the government is more concerned
with preserving the privileges of the civil service as it sees fit
rather than ensuring the long-term health of the economy,'' said
Marcelo Allain, the chief economist at Banco Inter American
Express.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimated the decision would cost the government 3.1
billion reais, or $1.6 billion, in lost taxes next year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks here plunged after the rulings, with the Bovespa index
for the Sao Paulo stock exchange ending down 2.9 percent. The
Brazilian real weakened nearly 1 percent to a one-month low of
1.935 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me wonder about Brazil's ability to get serious,''
said Masaru Nakayasu, an economist here with Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

LED BY REPUBLICANS, HOUSE APPROVES BILL GIVING THE FETUS LEGAL
PROTECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a veto threat from President Clinton, the
House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday that would grant a
measure of legal protection to the human fetus by establishing new
criminal penalties for anyone who injures or harms the fetus while
committing another federal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, mainly Republicans, said it would
protect ``unborn children'' against assaults and other acts of
violence. Opponents said it would undermine abortion rights by
granting legal status to the fetus at all stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved, 254-172, with support from 198
Republicans and 56 Democrats. The measure was opposed by 150
Democrats, 21 Republicans and 1 independent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill passed Thursday night, a person who injures or
kills a fetus in the course of committing any of 68 enumerated
federal crimes could be convicted of a separate offense against the
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties would be the same as the punishment that could
have been imposed if the pregnant woman herself had suffered the
injury inflicted on her fetus.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person who assaults a pregnant woman on a
military base could be prosecuted under the bill for murder or
manslaughter if the fetus died but the woman survived. By contrast
if the assault on the pregnant women occurred in a department
store, it would probably not be a federal crime, and the injury to
the fetus would not be covered by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, federal homicide statutes reach only the killing of a
human being _ a person who has been born.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas D. Johnson, chief lobbyist for the National Right to
Life Committee, said the bill would establish an important
principle: ``when a criminal attacks a pregnant woman, injuring or
killing her and injuring or killing her unborn child, he has
claimed two victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agreed that it might be appropriate to increase the
punishment for violence against pregnant women. But they said they
did not want to recognize the fetus as a separate person, a crime
victim with rights distinct from those of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, said, ``The Supreme Court has never recognized
an unborn child as having legal status.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers denounced the bill as ``a back-door attack on Roe vs.
Wade,'' the 1973 decision in which the court defined abortion
rights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill evoked passions similar to those seen in prior
congressional debates over legislation to ban the medical procedure
that critics call a partial-birth abortion. The meaning of that
legislation was not immediately evident, but emerged only after
more than a year of analysis and debate by lawyers, doctors and
lobbyists for and against abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the House Thursday is known as the Unborn
Victims of Violence Act. It was drafted by Rep. Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, Christopher Smith of New Jersey and Charles Canady
of Florida, all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas, both Republicans, are pushing similar legislation.
``Unfortunately,'' Hutchinson said, ``there are instances where an
unborn child is intentionally assaulted or even murdered to prevent
its birth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House said that it strongly opposed the bill and
that the president's senior advisers would recommend a veto if the
measure reached his desk. To identify the fetus as a separate and
distinct victim of crime is ``unprecedented as a matter of federal
statute,'' the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, an assailant could be prosecuted for
injuring or killing a fetus regardless of whether he knew that the
woman was pregnant. Prosecutors would not have to show that the
defendant intended to cause the death or injury of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The bill protects the ``unborn child,'' defined as ``a member of
the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is
carried in the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the bill would not allow prosecution of doctors for
performing an abortion at the request of a pregnant woman. Nor
would it allow prosecution of ``any woman with respect to her
unborn child,'' or of any person providing medical treatment for
the woman or the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who leads the opposition to abortion,
said the bill ``fills a gap in our criminal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican floor leader, asked,
``How can you recognize the need for prenatal care and reject the
baby's right to protection from violence?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the bill was just a back-door
way to ``establish the legal status of the fetus as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to the Republican bill, Democrats offered a
proposal to increase the criminal penalties for certain acts of
violence against pregnant women. The Democratic bill focused on
harm to the woman, not the fetus. It was rejected by a vote of
224-201.  &QL;

 &HT;    F-22's funding back in budget
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks of contentious debate, a deal has been
reached between House and Senate negotiators over how much to spend
on the controversial F-22 fighter jet program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal that could be unveiled as early as today,
Congress would spend an additional $1.3 billion on the stealth
fighter built by Lockheed Martin Corp. at its Marietta, Ga.,
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The funds would be in addition to $1.2 billion that has already
won approval, bringing the program's total funding to $2.6 billion.
That is about $400 million shy of what was originally requested by
the Air Force and approved by the Senate during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-22 won,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.). ``We've come
a long way from where we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) and the entire Georgia
congressional delegation fought a battle to secure the additional
funding against Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), chairman of the House
Defense Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis successfully waged a campaign to eliminate $1.85 billion
from the House version of the spending bill, saying the $70 billion
F-22 fighter program was too costly and untested. He urged a
``pause'' in the production of the plane to bring it in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a concession to Lewis that the funding used to
purchase the planes would not set in motion the production cycle.
Instead, the money would be pooled from research and development
funds for testing the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the Air Force $723 million in research and
development funds to buy up to six test planes. An additional $277
million would be set aside for advanced purchase orders to start
buying the first lot of 10 planes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another $300 million would be added to cover liability costs
associated with contract termination for subcontractors. Coverdell
said if that money is not used it can be used to purchase
additional aircraft. Members of the Georgia delegation were
relieved to find out the radar-evading fighter jet program had been
saved from the most serious threat in the program's 15-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the Senate position basically prevailed,''
Cleland said. ``The bottom line: The Senate saved the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), whose district includes part of Marietta,
credited ``a massive team effort between the management and workers
at Lockheed, the Clinton administration and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.''

AZUSA PACIFIC'S JORDAN'S LATEST STOP IS A GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to forget last week's game has to be a little difficult
for Azusa Pacific's Deon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to remember, you ask, about Jordan's performance
in a 59-52 marathon victory at the University of Redlands?
</P>
<P>
   How about a school-record 419 all-purpose yards, scoring
receptions of 94, 10 and 45 yards, an 80-yard punt return for a
touchdown and the game-winning 97-yard kickoff return for a score.
All of which added up to his selection as the NAIA Player of the
Week for his efforts in helping his team overcome deficits of 24-0,
31-7 and 38-13.
</P>
<P>
   But his first step in preparing for the team's next game which
is Saturday against visiting Western Oregon is forgetting about
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to start over,'' said the 23-year-old Jordan High
graduate. ``It was a good game and we got the victory. Now I want
to wipe the slate clean. It would be extremely difficult for me to
go out and duplicate that game.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it would be equally difficult for the Panthers,
who are ranked No. 5 in the nation, to duplicate a game during
which they were in a 24-0 hole before 13 minutes were elapsed on
the clock. After the teams traded touchdowns, Jordan hooked up with
former Poly and LBCC quarterback Neo Aoga on a 94-yard scoring play
that was promptly answered by a Redlands touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan ended the first half with his 10-yard touchdown reception
and grabbed a scoring pass from 45 yards on the first drive of the
second half. His 80-yard punt return early in the fourth quarter
gave the Panthers their first lead of the evening and the kickoff
return lit up the scoreboard for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extra conditioning after practice paid off,'' Jordan said.
``If this had been the first game of the season, I don't think I
would have been out there for those final two touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other NAIA players, Jordan didn't exactly take a
straight path to his school. After graduating from Jordan High in
1993, his stops have included Cerritos College, Compton College,
Long Beach City College, Hampton (Va.) University and Kutztown
(Pa.) State. But the only places he actually played in a game were
at Compton and Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   His journey and you may need a road map to follow began at
Cerritos College, where he enrolled as a full-time student and
joined the football team. After not seeing any game action, Jordan
decided to quit football. In 1996, he joined the team at Compton
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left a sour taste in my mouth when I was at Cerritos,''
Jordan said. ``I didn't want my football career to end like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His Compton College experience ended after one season when the
football program was shut down and it was back to the sidelines for
Jordan. He moved to LBCC in 1997 and helped the Vikings finish 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was at Hampton, where Jordan quickly won a
starting position at receiver and kick returner. He traveled with
the team to its opener against Florida A&AMP;M and was sleeping snugly
in his hotel room on the eve of the game when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was (a Hampton coach) telling me that the NCAA was
questioning my eligibility,'' said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that, according to NCAA regulations, a player
has five years to complete four seasons and Jordan's NCAA clock had
begun when he became a full-time student at Cerritos College in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited for four weeks to see if something would change and
then came home,'' said Jordan, who was eligible to play two more
seasons at a NAIA program.
</P>
<P>
   Once again he was out of football. A coach at Hampton helped him
hook on at Kutztown State so he packed his bags and headed for
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money situation wasn't right (at Kutztown),'' said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   About the time he figured that out, Jordan received a phone call
from former LBCC teammate Jack Williams, who was the NAIA Player of
the Year while leading Azusa Pacific to the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I was interested in coming home to play and I
jumped,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan showed up in Azusa three days into fall practice, but
quickly made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just gave me a brief overlook at the playbook,'' Jordan
said. ``But most of the time I was just ad-libbing. I was worried
about getting on the field because they had set guys when I got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   None of them, however, have produced like Jordan. Despite having
trouble with conditioning in the first couple of weeks, Jordan is
leading the team in receptions (23 for 474 yards), all-purpose
yards (223.75 per game), scoring (10.5 per game), kickoff returns
(12 for 338) and punt returns (3 for 83).
</P>
<P>
   ``The (best) thing is I didn't want to be finished with
football,'' said Jordan. ``All I wanted was some place to play.''

 &HT;    UGA affirms race in admissions
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Calling ``the twin goals of academic excellence
and a diverse student population ... absolutely compatible,''
University of Georgia President Michael Adams said Thursday that
race should remain a factor in evaluating some high school seniors
applying for admission to UGA.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought widespread expressions of support from
key state politicians, a dire prediction from the state attorney
general and a threat from the lawyer who challenged the standards
that he would seek an injunction to halt the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Georgia wants to be fair, it wants to be
accessible, it wants to be representative of the total population
of the state,'' Adams told the University Council. UGA ``still must
achieve our goal to have an admissions system that is fair,
appropriate and legal. We believe that using race as a factor in
admissions, but not a sole determining factor, is a legitimate
approach in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's admissions policy admits most students on the
basis of SAT scores and grade point average, and uses race among
numerous other factors in evaluating an estimated 10 percent to 20
percent of applicants not admitted strictly on the basis of their
scores and grades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the policy for culling next fall's freshman class
will offer admission to the valedictorian and the salutatorian from
the 369 high school programs in Georgia accredited by the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools. Such a provision has been
effective in increasing minority recruitment at other state
universities, said UGA Communications Director Tom Jackson, and
Adams felt it was appropriate for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the policy will have to be ratified by the Faculty
Admissions Committee and the University Council, Adams, who has the
final say, effectively has committed the university to a costly,
perhaps protracted, legal battle. Some legal experts _ including
Attorney General Thurbert Baker _ predict the university has little
chance of winning that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``While its chances of prevailing are slim, the university is
entitled to have its attorneys present its case in court,'' said
Baker, whose office would represent UGA.
</P>
<P>
   The school's admissions policies have been challenged in court
by several applicants who were denied admission on what they
contend are discriminatory grounds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge B. Avant Edenfield chastised UGA in
July for using race as a factor in admissions, saying the
university couldn't constitutionally justify its use.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively small percentage of applicants, admissions
officials employ the Total Student Index. The index is a list of
factors _ academic, demographic, leadership/activity, legacy and
family educational level.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of Adams' decision on Thursday, Atlanta attorney
Lee Parks said in a letter to the attorney general's office that
the policy won't hold up in court. Parks said he has 16 white
females, all of whom were rejected by UGA, who want to join a suit
he filed in August against the admissions policies.
</P>
<P>
   Parks plans to file a motion next week seeking a temporary
injunction to halt UGA's employing its current admissions policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look back on this once promising window of opportunity
for settlement and compromise, and regret that it was slammed shut
without any effort at all to look for middle ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after Adams made his announcement, he said
that, given the current legal trend regarding such matters, the
university's case will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gov. Roy Barnes and University System Chancellor Stephen
Portch declared support for Adams' decision, as did other political
leaders, including State Rep. Calvin Smyre (D-Columbus), chairman
of the University System of Georgia Committee, Senate Minority
Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah) and House Majority Leader Larry
Walker (D-Perry).
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over affirmative action and race-based policies
_ including the lawsuits against UGA and threats against the city
of Atlanta's affirmative action programs _ is likely to reignite
debate in the Legislature over such issues, Walker said. When Adams
finished his 20-minute talk, the audience in the law school
auditorium _ which had faculty, staff and students standing in the
back aisles _ burst into applause and rose to give him a standing
ovation, something rarely if ever seen in a University Council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he came to the decision after months of talking to
faculty members, administrators, alumni and educational and
political leaders from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's best for the university,'' Adams said. ``This
is almost a matter of my wanting to treat others as I'd like to be
treated.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from some African-American students was that the
policy was good, but that more would be needed to increase
enrollment of minority members. This year, 597 black students were
accepted, but only 243 enrolled, a trend that began years ago.
Building a diverse student body is complicated and difficult,
students acknowledged. Sophomores Candice Bullett and Jamila
Tillman, graduates of Stone Mountain's Redan High, faulted UGA for
what they perceive as inadequate recruitment efforts. Bullett said
school officials came to DeKalb County to recruit black quarterback
Quincy Carter, but not black scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of kids recruited in my high school had parents
who were alums of UGA, and those kids heard the horror stories of
what it was like when their parents went here,'' said Tillman,
whose mother graduated from UGA in 1976. ``I heard a few stories,
but I came because of HOPE and because it is a great school,
especially for my major, public relations.''

CANDLESTICK CLOSES WITH DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eric Karros unzipped his backpack, ruffled
through some clothes and pulled out a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Karros doesn't get terribly sentimental about much, including
the closing of this Candlestick/3Com Park, but he understands
baseball history, so he held on to the last ball used here.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem sickening to Giants fans, but after 40 years of
baseball, Candlestick's finale was a Los Angeles Dodgers-dominated
9-4 win in front of a regular-season record 61,389 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And Karros, not the Giants, has the ball from the final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably (end up) in my closet somewhere, in a shoe
box,'' Karros said. ``There will be some ball out there that they
say, `Hey, this is the ball.' No. Wrong. That's the last put-out at
Candlestick. Not that it will change my career or anything, but I
was there when it closed.''
</P>
<P>
   It closed with the Dodgers pounding the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   With a rookie Aussie named Jeff Williams (2-0) striking out
Barry Bonds with the bases loaded en route to his second
major-league win.
</P>
<P>
   With Raul Mondesi hitting the last home run, a three-run shot
that was also the 1,000th hit of his career. Despite a splendid
three-day stretch of weather, with the wind finally stirring four
decades worth of ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind started kickin' up at the end and I said, `Now, this
is Candlestick,' '' said Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, who threw the
last pitch. ``A lot of people think because they're moving to a new
ballpark it's going to change, but it's still going to be windy,
it's still going to be cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Giants waged some classic confrontations since
the park opened, but this wasn't one of them. The drama was created
by the knowledge this would be the last game played.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past years when one team strived to ruin the other's
season, the excitement was generated from the soldout crowd who
understood the purpose this game will have in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was an awesome day,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said.
``A lot of people, a lot of excitement. We didn't end it like we
wanted to ... especially the way L.A. beat us, but it's over now.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten, at least for the day, was the cold, the wind and the
flying dust and trash that sometimes engulfed the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some guys saving some dirt,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Maybe the dirt will last longer than grass. There's
nothing I want here. I left my share of blood in this ballpark. I
remember standing at home plate and my eyes watering, so I kept
(blinking) so I could see the ball. And I know I didn't want to hit
it on the end of the bat, or get jammed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mondesi who broke the game open with his homer in the
sixth, a line drive over the left-field fence that gave the Dodgers
an 8-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Williams' fifth-inning performance that provided the
moment of the day. The Giants already had a run in and the bases
were loaded with one out and Bonds batting. After getting behind on
a pair of called strikes, Bonds worked the count full before
Williams snapped off a breaking pitch for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans made it special, with the history that's gone on
here,'' Johnson said. ``It was a special day, and it was nice to
see a young pitcher come up and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They said farewell to Candlestick Park with hoopla, trotting out
past greats who called this home. They celebrated the stadium's 40
years, and they celebrated for not having to play here again.
</P>
<P>
   But the indelible image of the last play will be Shaw getting
Marvin Benard to ground out to first base. And of Karros, scooping
the ball, stepping on first, and then riding out of town with the
most cherished souvenir of the day.

A 3RD JOURNALISM PROGRAM LOSES ITS DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism
at Harvard University, submitted his resignation to the
foundation's advisory board this week, becoming the third head of a
major university-based program for journalists to resign in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of Kovach, of James V. Risser, the director of
the John S. Knight Fellowships at Stanford University, and of
Marvin Kalb, the head of the Shorenstein Center for Press, Politics
and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard,
leave vacant three of the most prominent pulpits in the profession
at a time of growing concern about the future of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Kovach, who is 67, said Thursday that he thought it was time for
the program to be led by someone who was closer to the
technological revolution sweeping the profession because of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new technology, the impact of the new technology and the
changes it's making both in journalism and the economic
organization of the business of news,'' Kovach said, is of such
significance that ``I think that someone in closer touch, or with a
better sense of the impact inside a news organization, might be
better equipped for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Risser, who is 61 and who, like Kovach, will leave next summer
at the end of the academic year, said that the changes in the
profession must be emphasized in programs like his and Kovach's.
Both programs bring in journalists in midcareer for a year's
intensive study of a subject of the journalist's choosing.

RECORD PAYOUT IN BRUTALITY CASES AGAINST NEW YORK CITY POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City paid out a record $40 million in the
last fiscal year to resolve legal claims and lawsuits that accused
its police officers of brutality, up 40 percent from the prior
year, according to an analysis by the comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the increase was not a measure of more
misconduct being committed by officers. Rather, they said
settlements for the fiscal year that ended June 30 had been driven
up by a combination of factors, including a sharp rise in the
number of cases resolved and a spate of publicity about police
misconduct that made it difficult for the city to negotiate from
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a climate where there is so much publicity about police
cases, we are more reluctant to take cases to juries,'' said Lorna
Bade Goodman, a senior attorney with the city's Law Department.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the amount paid out in settlements rise in the last
fiscal year, but the number of new brutality claims seeking damages
from the city increased by 10 percent, to 2,324, the highest number
in a decade, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Police Department contend that the surge in
claims activity is evidence of widening public dissatisfaction with
a law enforcement agency whose use of force is already the subject
of a federal investigation. Indeed, the number of new brutality
cases filed last year far outpaced the general trend of legal
claims overall against the city, which rose by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The swelling settlement figure for police brutality cases
nevertheless did reflect an overall increase in the amount the city
paid to resolve lawsuits and other legal claims last year. The city
paid a record $405 million to resolve such cases, the majority of
them personal injury claims stemming from accidents like sidewalk
slips and incidents of medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the tally for resolving brutality cases had
grown so sharply because the number of cases settled, 739, had
increased by 30 percent last year. The $40 million was paid out
both in cases that were settled through negotiations before trial
as well as those that ended with a court judgment.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers said more cases were resolved because of a new
early settlement policy that the city expected would save money
over the long term by quickly negotiating legal claims as they come
in and before they become mired in court delays. The new policy was
among the recommendations made by an accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which studied the city's claims processing
procedures last year.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor in the higher claim costs, city officials said,
was that several large brutality cases had been settled in a single
year. For example, the family of Anthony Baez, who was choked to
death by a Bronx police officer in 1994, received $2.55 million
this year in one settlement, according to the comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the city agreed to pay $2.75 million to an
electrician who said that, while walking to work in Greenwich
Village on his birthday in 1996, he was beaten by police officers
because he fit the profile of a black suspect they were seeking.
The department has described the incident as a tragic mistake, not
an act of brutality, but never disciplined the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman, speaking generally, said there were many cases in
which the city paid damages even though it did not believe the
officers were guilty of wrongdoing. ``In cases where there is a
sympathetic plaintiff with a bad injury,'' she said, ``we will
often settle, regardless of whether it was caused by the officer,
because we don't want to go to the jury and risk a large award.''
</P>
<P>
   George A. Grasso, the Police Department's deputy commissioner
for legal matters, said that many of the cases settled this year
were several years old _ too old, he maintained, to be of any value
in measuring the level of police misconduct now.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, said that the increase in new brutality claims
filed last year was evidence that a penchant for brutality
continues among too many police officers.

PRIVATE COLLECTIONS ROUTINE AT MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wash.)  (With NY-MUSEUM-OPENING, SENSATIONS-REVIEW) 
(mk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Museum of Art's particular mix of art
and commerce _ an exhibition of art that is owned by one private
collector and partially financed by an auction house _ may not pass
muster at City Hall, but it violates no hard-and-fast rules in the
precincts of the museum world.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few major museums have restrictions that would have
kept the exhibit, ``Sensation,'' out of their galleries and
prevented an auction-house sponsorship, the Brooklyn Museum and
other institutions are free to show any private collection without
fear of violating an industrywide ethics code. The Association of
Art Museum Directors, whose 175 members lead the largest art
museums in North America, says nothing about the subject in its
code of professional practices, though it does encourage museums to
develop some policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policies vary, and many museums do single-owner shows,'' said
James Welu, the president of the association and the director of
the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Mass. Welu dismissed the
charge, made on Wednesday by senior City Hall officials, that the
Brooklyn Museum was conspiring to inflate the value of the artwork
with Charles Saatchi, the British advertising executive who owns
the works, and Christie's, the auction house that is sponsoring the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine and the
city's corporation counsel, Michael Hess, picking up on criticism
in the art world, said the museum was participating in a ``scam''
that would increase the value of the collection. The Brooklyn
Museum extracted no promises from Saatchi that he would not sell
these works, though he has said he has no plans to sell them. And
when ``Sensation'' leaves Brooklyn in January it will travel to the
National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are not aware of how important collectors are in
the appreciation of art, not just today but historically,'' Welu
said. Typically, he added, a third to a half of a museum's
collection is given by private collectors. Sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi is not the typical collector, however. He is well known
for buying many works by young, cutting-edge artists, exhibiting
their work in his and other galleries, creating buzz and then often
selling the works. A year after ``Sensation'' played at the Royal
Academy in London, Saatchi put works by the same artists up for
auction. The proceeds went to charity, but many Britons nonetheless
accused him of manipulating the market and that makes people in the
art world here uncomfortable. Saatchi owns 1,500 works of art, many
by these same artists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike the Museum of Modern Art, which does not present
single-owner private collections unless they are promised to the
museum, most museums do so frequently, often with no strings _ or
very skimpy ones _ attached.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art is currently exhibiting two
private collections, ``The Artist as Collector: Masterpieces of
Chinese Painting from the C.C. Wang Family Collection'' and
``Native Paths III: American Indian Art from the Collection of
Charles and Valerie Diker.'' Next spring, the National Gallery of
Art in Washington will show more than 70 American paintings from
the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Barney Ebsworth. Earlier this year,
the Seattle Art Museum put the Virginia and Bagley Wright
collection of modern art on view.
</P>
<P>
   Some works in the Wright collection have been given to the
Seattle museum, but it frequently exhibits private collections
without any promises of an eventual donation. So does the Met. Even
if they cannot get an ironclad commitment, however, most museums
set their sights on a gift of some sort when they do these shows.
``The museum doesn't disguise its hopes and aspirations with
collectors,'' said Harold Holzer, the Met's chief spokesman, adding
that each exhibition agreement is hammered out on a case-by-case
basis. The National Gallery, meanwhile, requires a gift of ``a
significant work or works'' when it mounts a single-owner show.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi has not promised to donate anything to the Brooklyn
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The museum directors' code says nothing about restrictions on
the sale of works in a show, and Welu said he knew of no museums
that set limitations. The Met, however, said that it does insist
that nothing exhibited be sold during a show or for a period,
ranging from six months to two years, after the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Met and the National Gallery also avoid auction houses as
sponsors for exhibitions, though Welu said that many museums had to
look to corporations involved in the art trade for aid.

GERMAN BANK WILL ENTER JAPANESE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG teamed up Thursday with
Sakura Bank Ltd. of Japan in an effort to take advantage of Japan's
liberalized market for underwriting bond and stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, currently the world's biggest bank in terms of
assets, will get access to Sakura's formidable corporate clients,
which include the giant Mitsui group and Toyota Motor Corp. Sakura,
Japan's fifth-largest bank, is hoping to draw on Deutsche Bank's
expertise in offering corporate securities.
</P>
<P>
   Sakura's shares surged on the news. They initially jumped 100
yen to 838, their highest level since July 1997, before easing
somewhat to close at 800 yen, or $7.53, still a gain of 62 yen, or
8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest in a series by Western financial
institutions to expand their presence in Japan, which has become
more open to foreign involvement as the government lowers the
barriers that had barred commercial banks from underwriting
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Merrill Lynch acquired a substantial part of the
defunct Yamaichi Securities. Citigroup has formed an alliance with
Nikko Securities. And both Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank have
teamed up with Japanese partners in the asset management business.
Earlier this week, an American-led investment consortium won the
right to buy the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Deutsche Bank-Sakura agreement would give the
German bank much better access to the Japanese corporate market
than it had before. ``It is a very significant entree into Japan,''
said John Leonard of Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``Sakura has a
very good set of corporate connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese financial markets are changing rapidly because of a
series of measures that have steadily reduced regulatory barriers
and made the country accessible to foreign institutions. Until
recently, Japanese commercial banks were strictly prohibited from
selling securities. Those prohibitions have largely disappeared,
but most Japanese banks have little experience or skill in
investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Japanese corporations are increasingly eager
to raise money through stock and bond offerings rather than by
taking out traditional loans.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank and many of Europe's other big banks lost hundreds
of millions of dollars in the Asian financial crisis because they
had been among the most aggressive lenders to what seemed like
high-growth markets in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that experience, and the long bleak decline in Japan
itself, Deutsche Bank executives have continued to view Asia as an
important market and they have maintained a big staff. The bank
already employs nearly 1,000 people in Japan and has a fairly good
reputation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche formed a fund venture last year with Nippon Life
Insurance Co. and announced a joint venture with Kokusai Securities
Co. in mutual funds and other forms of asset management.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ On Oct. 26, 1996, Sammy Morris caught a pass at Kyle
Field in the fourth quarter and ran 81 yards for a touchdown that
lifted Texas Tech past Texas A&AMP;M 13-10.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world, it seemed, was at his feet. Morris was a redshirt
freshman, ready to follow Bam Morris and Byron Hanspard in a line
of top-notch running backs at Texas Tech during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-0 and 212 pounds, Morris was an excellent runner, receiver
and blocker. In eight games in 1996, he rushed 29 times for 226
yards and caught 13 passes for 221 yards, averaging 10.6 yards
every time he touched the football.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five months have passed since that play by Morris against
Texas A&AMP;M. He has touched the football a grand total of six times
for 79 yards _ two fewer than he gained on that memorable touchdown
at College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Academic problems combined with a bureaucratic foul-up and an
injury early this season have gutted Morris' career at Texas Tech.
That he will play Saturday against Texas A&AMP;M is testimony to his
perseverance, a change in his outlook on life and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes think that all these bad things have happened, and
I've made it through them so now the good times are going to
start,'' Morris said. ``What I'm doing now is trying to escape the
past and not even worry about it. I'm not going to dwell on it. I'm
going to live for today and live for tomorrow, not on what happened
in the past.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Until the last 18 months, Morris' past was not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1996 day Morris took the pass from Red Raiders
quarterback Zebbie Lethridge and rumbled into the end zone late in
the fourth quarter against A&AMP;M, he knew there was a good chance the
academic hammer was about to come down.
</P>
<P>
   Already on probation, Morris was informed in late October that
he was in more scholastic trouble. There were problems in a
required academic study course in which he was enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy was if you had two absences, you were withdrawn
(expelled) from the university,'' Morris said. ``I knew that, but I
didn't know that two tardies counted as an absence. So I had one
absence and two tardies. The week before (the A&AMP;M game), there was
a lot of back-and-forth over it. It all came down after the A&AMP;M
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about that a lot. All this has happened because I
was tardy for class a couple times. I guess there's lessons to be
learned there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after the highlight-reel play against A&AMP;M, Morris'
career went to freeze frame. He was expelled from the university
for academic reasons and missed the final four games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Morris regained admission to Texas Tech but did not help himself
during the spring semester in 1997, when he failed to make
sufficient grades to be eligible for the '97 season. In 1998, he
was ruled ineligible by the NCAA because his 1996 course load was
deemed unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   An academic adviser had prescribed a course of study for Morris
that did not meet guidelines. Another lost year for Morris.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Morris remained in school and applied himself. He
is scheduled to receive a degree in communications from Texas Tech
this December. Morris was named to the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor
Roll for the fall semester in 1998 and earned the Red Raiders'
academic effort award after last season.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, Morris' wife, Leslie, gave birth to the couple's
first child, a daughter named Kiera. A few days ago, Morris still
had the beaming grin of a first-time parent when talking about his
daughter. He even found humor in the fact Kiera was sleeping no
more than two hours at a time through the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at her, and whatever has happened to me in the past
doesn't seem important at all,'' Morris said. ``I know what's
important now.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey from an immature young college student who paid
little attention to anyone but himself (``I was living my life only
for Sammy,'' Morris said) to a mature young husband and parent who
will leave Lubbock with a college degree is a rewarding story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Morris is one of the neatest guys I've ever been
around,'' said Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes. ``He means a lot to
this team, with all he's been through. He never complained, never
made an issue out of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy was the victim of somebody else's mistakes. Educators
telling him to do this, this and this, and he did this, this and
this, but he still was ruled ineligible. I've got great admiration
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes points to Morris' strong family background as one reason
for his unyielding effort to make something of himself. Morris'
parents, Samuel and Orinthia of San Antonio, built a groundwork
that he was able to fall back on during the rough times.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris believes his life changed in the spring of 1998, when
he and teammate James Easterling decided to start attending church.
Morris says that since then, he has found an inner peace that was
lacking in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that that part of my life was B.C. _ before
Christ,'' Morris said. ``Since then, it's been W.C. _ with Christ.
All I did before was my own thing, and it wasn't working that way.
I knew I needed to look somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Morris has needed that inner strength this season. After working
hard in the classroom and staying in shape even though he hadn't
played in nearly three years, he suffered a bruised shoulder in the
opening game this season. Before the injury, he rushed three times
for 11 yards and caught three passes for 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to go out there in the first game and get boogered up
like that, you know, that was sort of par for the course,'' Dykes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris sat out the next two games, but he practiced this week
and is expected to play against Texas A&AMP;M. Ricky Williams, the star
running back for the Red Raiders, will miss the rest of the season
after reinjuring his left knee in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has tremendous admiration for Morris. They were able to
play together for less than one half after both were injured at
Arizona State in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those
`I'm-going-to-keep-doing-it-till-I-get-it-done' type of guys,''
Williams said. ``He had to stay out of school for so long, but he
bounced back on his feet. The way he's handled all the adversity is
a great lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Williams and Morris are part of the reason Texas
Tech is 1-2 and coming off a devastating 21-14 loss to heavy
underdog North Texas two weeks ago. Morris and Williams watched the
game from the sideline in street clothes, and Morris could scarcely
contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting on the sidelines watching that, I told Ricky, `Man,
I'm going to go get my pads on,''' Morris said. ``That would have
been silly, but I gave it a thought. I wanted to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, too, wanted to help out against Texas A&AMP;M. He tested
his ailing knee in practice this week and aggravated the injury. He
will have season-ending surgery soon, casting another pall over
Tech's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Morris wants to finally get back in the swing of
things, both to help the Red Raiders get untracked and to show what
he can do during what's left of his career. He says he has had a
goal of playing in the NFL since he was in second grade, and time
is running out to demonstrate what he's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his inactivity, Morris was named by ESPN's Mel Kiper as
the top-rated fullback in next year's NFL draft, something that
floored Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that, I thought somebody was lying to me,''
Morris said. ``That's pretty amazing, not having played for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the touchdown reception and run nearly three years ago
remains in the minds of NFL analysts. For Morris, the play against
Texas A&AMP;M is a pleasant moment from his past and a nagging reminder
of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it pretty often,'' Morris said. ``I use it as a
motivational thing. In 1998, I was kind of down during the week
before the team played A&AMP;M. I'd think back to what happened that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't dwell on it. He says he has seen the tape of the
play only two or three times, and that by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad watches it (the tape) all the time,'' Morris said. ``If
he has it on when I'm walking through the room, I'll sit and watch
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris would like nothing better than to do something memorable
again this week. After all he has been through since the last time
he played against the Aggies, it seems he's due for something good
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to be back,'' Morris said. ``Whatever happens,
happens. I know now there is a plan. God has a plan, and I continue
to seek his ways. It's not trusting only what I see, but what's in
my heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd love to get another highlight play against the
Aggies.''

ROCKETDYNE'S CLEANUP DATA SURPRISES ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA MASCARO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- The Department of Defense, not NASA,
conducted most of the rocket engine tests at Rocketdyne's field
lab, an official said, fueling the space agency's contention that
the military is not contributing enough toward cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Elliott, NASA's project manager for the cleanup, said the
agency conducted only 23 percent of the rocket engine tests at the
Santa Susana Field Laboratory from 1949-83, while the Defense
Department performed 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the biggest customer out there,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   The information was presented Wednesday night during the
quarterly meeting of the work group monitoring the cleanup. It
surprised activists, who said they hope to have the military
provide further information about activities at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always led to believe the Santa Susana Field Lab was
used by NASA to develop the engines to the moon,'' Joesph K. Lyou,
an activist and work group member said Thursday. ``We really need
to establish contacts with (Defense Department) to find out what
happened out there over time.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative from Sen. Barbara Boxer's office said the
California Democrat would be willing to work with California Rep.
Elton Gallegly and other local officials to establish contacts with
the military on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued last fall said NASA had been over-billed by
$16.4 million for its share of cleanup and that it should try to
recover costs from other parties, including the Department of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers, who are handling the
site for the Defense Department, did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday night, Elliott said the decades of engine testing
sent more than 500,000 gallons of a possible cancer-causing
chemical -- more than Rocketdyne has estimated -- into the
groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical trichloroethylene -- TCE -- was used as a solvent
to flush the rocket engines before and after they were tested and
until 1961 was collected in an earthen-lined pit at the site. After
1961, it was collected for reuse until being phased out by 1984,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No drinking water wells are believed to be contaminated with the
chemical, and Rocketdyne has pumped more than 1.5 billion gallons
of water from its sites as part of cleanup since the mid-1980s,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contaminated groundwater has long been a concern for
regulators overseeing cleanup at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the water at Rocketdyne is contained and confined
essentially to the Rocketdyne site, it's always a shame when you
lose a resource,'' said Gerard Abrams, an official from the state
Department of Toxic Substances Control, whose agency handles
chemical cleanup. ``It's always a concern because groundwater is an
important resource; it's not a resource you want to lose.''

MUSEUM DISPUTE HAS BENEFITS AND RISKS FOR GIULIANI IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see SENSATIONS-REVIEW and NY-MUSEUM-OPENING)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one place this city where Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani can generally count on a warm reception, it is the
Metropolitan Opera House, where he has for years been reliably
cheered by performers and audiences alike, an affirmation of both
Giuliani's support for opera and his perceived record at improving
the quality of life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But when Giuliani showed up Monday for opening night, taking an
operatic reprieve from his fight against the Brooklyn Museum of Art
to present a commendation to tenor Placido Domingo, he encountered
an unfamiliar reaction. A loud swell of boos mixed in with the
applause that rose from seats filled with men in black-tie and
women in evening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani and his supporters, the fight with the museum has
emerged as a formative moment in his presumed campaign for the U.S.
Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. By denouncing an exhibition
at the museum as offensive and anti-Catholic, the mayor has
presented himself as a defender of the largest voting bloc in New
York _ Catholics _ while addressing concerns among many Republicans
about his ideological standings.
</P>
<P>
   But as Giuliani's reception at the Met suggests, the political
implications of the battle are anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   His move to shut down the exhibition at the city-subsidized
museum has presumably allowed him to nail down the Republican and
conservative voters who will be indispensable to his success.
``This certainly shows that he has the willingness to respond in a
common sense way to the conservative view of issues,'' said state
Conservative Party chairman Michael Long, who has previous voiced
concern about Giuliani's conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But these are voters who probably would never have supported
Mrs. Clinton in the first place. And there is, several pollsters
said, an equally persuasive argument that the mayor may pay a cost
for this shoring up of his political base: his vehement stance on
the museum issue could unsettle some of the few voters who appear
to be up for grabs in this race, in particular Democrats and
independents who have enthusiastically supported Giuliani as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to turn off the people who were neutral on Rudy,
who were kind of the moderate types,'' said Mitchell Moss, director
of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. ``He's
basically going to lose some of the Democrats who otherwise might
have voted for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat who was once a supporter of
Giuliani, agreed that the issue worked to Giuliani's disadvantage.
``I believe this is going to be Giuliani's downfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides asserted that the mayor was not engaged in a
calculated maneuver to position himself in the Senate race, but was
reacting with genuine outrage to an exhibit that offended him.
</P>
<P>
   But the aides say his stance is also good politics, putting him
on the popular side of an issue, portraying Mrs. Clinton as out of
touch, and showing the decisive leadership that his advisers say
will be a central part of his appeal in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of this is, once again, this is a person _ the
mayor _ who is not afraid to speak out when something is patently
and clearly offensive and wrong,'' said Adam Goodman, a Republican
consultant to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Giuliani's course presents him with the possibility
of modest gains, and potentially high risks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in reviewing the political benefits, the mayor's
advisers noted that Catholics make up over 40 percent of the
statewide electorate and have helped elect a number of Catholics to
statewide office. But polls suggest that white Catholics are
already overwhelmingly in Giuliani's corner. In a poll of 911
registered voters taken by Quinnipiac College in September, with a
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent, 57 percent of white
Catholics said they were for Giuliani, compared to 32 percent for
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Giuliani's actions have raised his stock with the
Conservative Party. But by any measure, Giuliani will be in serious
trouble if, six months from now, he is worrying about Conservative
Party support.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that Giuliani's stark confrontation with the museum
could prove problematic with the sliver of the electorate that
describes itself as undecided, which is 7 percent in Carroll's
poll. That is particularly the case with the independent-minded
voters who voted, for example, for President Clinton in 1996 and
Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, last year, but have been
impressed with Giuliani. Giuliani's advisers hope to draw those
votes away from Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The episode, for example, could stoke concerns among those
voters, voiced by respondents in polls and encouraged by Mrs.
Clinton's campaign, that Giuliani is temperamentally unsuited to be
a member of a 100-person deliberative body. ``When you ask who
would work better with others in the Senate, she wins hands down _
despite the fact that the Senate just tried to impeach her
husband,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Thursday's Albany Times Union seemed to
underscore the risk noted by Miringoff. ``Trying to seize control
of a public museum to protest a single exhibit is the political
equivalent of smearing portraits with elephant dung,'' it said,
alluding to one of the paintings at the center of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   And Giuliani could find that his actions could play into what
has been the early strategy of Mrs Clinton's strategy: To try to
push Giuliani to the right, identifying him with Republican
congressional leaders in Washington.

SEVERAL PLANT WORKERS COULD DIE FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for additional info) (With JAPAN-NUKE) 
(bl) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minor doses of radiation released in the nuclear accident at the
Tokaimura uranium processing plant are likely to have mild medical
effects, but the worst amounts, affecting a few workers at the
plant, could prove fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The two workers who were most exposed received a dose of 8 to 10
Sieverts, or in the range of about 800 rads, to use two measures of
radiation, according to estimates by a Japanese radiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are bad numbers,'' said Dr. Eugene Saenger, a retired
professor at the University of Cincinnati and a leading authority
on radiation medicine. ``I would predict the dose would be lethal
without some miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious injury from radiation is caused by doses of 100 or so
rads and upward, and at 400 to 600 rads, half of those infected may
die.
</P>
<P>
   Workers exposed to doses of 100 or more may face crises to the
gastrointestinal tract and to the bone marrow. The constantly
dividing cells of both are prone to radiation damage.
</P>
<P>
   There is no specific treatment for radiation damage to the
stomach lining, Saenger said, other than to replace the body fluids
lost through bleeding. But damaged bone marrow can be treated with
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   People exposed to doses of less than 300 rads would be expected
to recover spontaneously, Saenger said, though they would often be
given supportive therapy in the form of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities reported that radiation around the plant
was 10,000 or more times higher than normal, a figure that Saenger
calculated was roughly equal to 10 rads. This is far higher than
conventional exposures, such as medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Radioactive gases are said to have escaped from the plant, and
these would present a variety of hazards. The most dangerous,
Saenger said, would be iodine-131, a radioactive element with an
eight-day half-life that is created in fission of uranium atoms.
All forms of iodine are quickly taken up by the thyroid gland and
radioactive iodine will damage it, with a risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One safeguard is iodine pills, based on the principle that
normal iodine will get to the thyroid first and block the
radioactive iodine. The pills must be given as soon as possible,
certainly within 24 hours of exposure, Saenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women are at particular risk from iodine-131 because of
damage to the fetus. Little is known about the doses that will
cause genetic abnormalities in the fetus.

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S ANNIVERSARY PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republic of China, whose birth Mao Tse-tung
triumphantly proclaimed from Tiananmen Square 50 years ago Friday,
can claim some proud achievements. Ordinary Chinese citizens now
enjoy higher standards of health, nutrition, education and personal
comfort than at any previous time in the Middle Kingdom's long
history. Beijing is also reclaiming its status as a great world
power for the first time since foreign imperialists began imposing
humiliating concessions on the Manchu emperors a century and a half
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But these gains have come at a terrible and continuing cost.
Millions perished needlessly in the famines caused by Mao's erratic
economic policies and millions more sacrificed their careers and
ambitions to the fanaticism of the Cultural Revolution during the
1960s and 1970s. Virtually all the economic progress of the past
half century has occurred since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping discarded
the precepts of Maoist socialism, opened China's economy to the
world and liberated the entrepreneurial energies of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Deng nor the current leader, President Jiang Zemin,
has eased the suffocating political grip of Communist Party
dictatorship. To this day, no public political dissent is tolerated
in the People's Republic and those who openly challenge this
arrangement are subjected to long prison terms under extremely
harsh conditions. With party loyalists freed from public
accountability, corruption flourishes, local officials abuse their
authority and individual rights are regularly trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographed celebrations reflect the Chinese leadership's
skewed priorities. They have been designed to showcase China's
political uniformity, its military might and its ability to attract
multinational executives. But it is a show of government power, not
popular enthusiasm. While hundreds of thousands of party loyalists
chant officially approved slogans, millions of Beijing's ordinary
residents have been barricaded away from the festivities, potential
dissidents are being closely watched and thousands of migrant
workers have been shipped out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official self-congratulations, China faces serious
problems. Its transition to a market economy remains incomplete.
Banks are swamped with debt, and uneconomic state-owned enterprises
drain resources needed for future growth. Behind the enforced
political silence, there are ample signs of public cynicism about a
Communist Party that claims no coherent ideology and clings
ruthlessly to power simply for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   China also faces problems with the United States. Washington and
Beijing have come a long way from the military confrontation of the
Korean War and America's stubborn 30-year delay in diplomatically
recognizing the Communist government. But relations continue to be
troubled by Beijing's human rights abuses, accusations of Chinese
nuclear espionage and meddling in American electoral campaigns, and
tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the answers to many of China's problems lie in
greater public accountability through wider democracy, from the
lowest levels of village government to the highest rungs of power
in Beijing. To maintain the political stability and economic
prosperity it boasts of today, the People's Republic of China will
have to find room for the unscripted voices of China's people.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Sixty howitzers boomed 50 shots each and
goose-stepping soldiers crossed Tiananmen Square Friday to hoist
the red and yellow flag to begin Communist China's salute to 50
years of phenomenal change.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of Young Pioneers filled the world's biggest public square
in a red and yellow formation spelling the Chinese characters for
``National Celebration'' as the 10 a.m. (local time) ceremony
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   Then President Jiang Zemin, wearing an updated, gray Mao suit,
headed off in a Red Flag limousine to inspect the 11,000 troops
lined up with the latest Chinese military hardware along the Avenue
of Perpetual Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello comrades,'' Jiang called out to the soldiers manning 400
tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello leader!'' they replied.
</P>
<P>
   The camouflage-green phalanx of military machines was set to
roll down the street with a roar of motors and belching exhaust.
Waves of civilian paraders and marching bands in a rainbow of
bright colors were lined up and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my whole life I have been waiting for this moment,'' said
Huang Erzun, 85, a leftist student in 1930s China who settled in
Taiwan and came back to celebrate the 50th birthday of the People's
Republic of China on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in the company of 25 groups of weapons, from tanks to
radars to the new ``East Wind 31'' intercontinental ballistic
missile made up the first military parade through Tiananmen Square
in 15 years. And the air force was expected to unveil its new
``Flying Leopard'' fighter plane in a screaming flyover of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have shown our complete system of
armaments,'' said an announcer from the state television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing access, permitted only to those with a red, numbered
invitation and laminated identity card, was so restricted that in
some prime viewing stands just 30 yards from the armored column
half the seats were empty.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in central Beijing had been immobilized one minute after
midnight as part of an iron-handed security lockdown. Tens of
thousands of police isolated the heart of the capital in a form of
martial law aimed at guaranteeing that no disruption _ or any speck
of spontaneity _ would sully the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 marchers and entertainers for an evening gala were
as carefully picked and placed as the 500,000 potted flowers stuck
all over the city in metal frames, shaped into huge boats, shooting
stars or gaily-colored columns.
</P>
<P>
   To assure none strayed from key nationalistic themes,
participants had a list of 50 approved slogans to shout, such as
the less-than-trenchant: ``Stress theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct!''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour parade hailed China's progress, with 91 floats
including replicas of a space rocket launch and a snowy peak in
Tibet, where mountaineers surrounded by rainbows planted China's
red flag with five yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   The parade swayed down the Avenue of Perpetual Peace, the
capital's biggest east-west boulevard, to be reviewed by President
Jiang near the entrance to the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   The procession was an eccentric combination of the dour
Stalinesque might of Moscow's Cold War parades in Red Square and
the pastel pageantry of Pasadena's New Year's Day Rose Bowl
parades.
</P>
<P>
   Central Beijing started shutting down at noon Thursday, when two
lines of troops carrying bull-horns swept across Tiananmen Square
to evict thousands of strolling Chinese and foreign tourists.
Bomb-sniffing German shepherd dogs followed.
</P>
<P>
   Then offices and shops along the parade route were searched,
locked and sealed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sidewalks closed around the Forbidden City Thursday,
gray-haired Du Zhiying, 70, was having his picture taken before the
ever-present portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motherland has prospered,'' said Du, who was in Tiananmen
Square the day 50 years ago when the late Great Helmsman Mao
declared the People's Republic of China into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Du came from Shanxi Province for the celebration, but the
lifelong party bureaucrat said he was afraid he wouldn't get within
sight of Friday's events. They were open only to officials and
invited guests, and he was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also tried to guarantee control by turning down
pollution, turning out itinerant workers and tuning off beepers and
mobile telephones that might interfere with military
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese live enormously better than they did 50, 20 or even 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Life was genuinely grim in 1949 when Mao stood atop the Gate of
Heavenly Peace to announce the meaning of his army's victory in a
vicious civil war. Hearts lifted with his proclamation of a new
era: ``We, the 475 million people of China, have now stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then a peasant family may have shared a single pair of
pants among 10 people who took turns going outside. Life expectancy
was 35 years, and education an extravagance for a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't change quickly. After a modest start into
industrialization, expanded education and agricultural renewal,
Mao's bizarre notions of continuing revolution sent China into one
chaotic frenzy after another.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Leap Forward. The Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stilted titles lay famine, smeared reputations and
tens of millions of deaths. Mao and his minions nearly wasted a
generation of youth sent not to school but to pound stones or dig
potatoes into the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the relative calm and bloom of prosperity
brought by subsequent leaders _ initiated with the reforms of the
late Deng Xiaoping _ the Chinese people have been forced to do
without free expression and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Economic gains have been remarkable since Deng's reform began in
1978. China has become the world's 11th largest trading power,
churning out a gross domestic product, or GDP, of $96 billion last
year after a decade of average growth rates surpassing 10 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy now is 71 years. Illiteracy is less than 15
percent, mostly among elderly and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stirrings of protest, targeting both political restrictions
and uneven economic distribution, have the communist leadership on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   To head off public dissent, especially in the anniversary
run-up, authorities have taken drastic steps.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16,000 migrant workers were expelled from Beijing, and
thousands more Chinese without proper papers were dumped in
detention centers. Beggars, peddlers and prostitutes were driven
from streets. Even Chinese tour groups were forbidden to enter the
capital for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt called ``operation strike hard'' produced
the arrests since summer of nearly 70,000 people officially
described as ``escaped'' or ``wanted'' criminals. Human rights
groups said democracy activists and religious leaders also have
been detained.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He didn't say he would and he didn't say he
wouldn't. But Warren Beatty held an enthusiastic crowd of
Hollywood's liberal elite in the palm of his hand for half an hour
Wednesday night as he denounced the influence of money in politics
and the rightward drift of the Democratic Party, and insisted that
its presidential candidates not forget society's least fortunate,
whether or not he runs himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty asked after receiving
the annual Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the Southern California
Chapter of Americans for Democratic Action. ``Have we come to the
point where the Democratic Party needs to have a Republican
president before it finds its voice again? A rising tide is not
lifting all boats.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an evening that blended the goofy glamour of a Dean
Martin celebrity roast with the earnest speechifying of a liberal
caucus on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Celebrities like Jack
Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway and Beatty's wife, Annette
Bening, crowded into the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
along with about 150 journalists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's speech, delivered in his trademark halting and
epigrammatic style, touched on topics from diplomatic recognition
for Cuba (he's for it) to the inequities of the emerging global
economy. Addressing an audience of multimillionaires, he rattled
off reams of statistics to condemn the disparities between wealth
and poverty, and called for universal health care, public campaign
financing, and tough new approaches to controlling child labor,
sweatshops and environmental problems in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty singled out campaign finance for special criticism,
saying: ``The primary cancer in this sick system, the big money in
politics, has so metastasized into every area of government that we
can't afford any longer to ignore that the life of the patient,
American democracy, is in mortal danger of expiring on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing date for the New Hampshire primary is only about a
month away, and despite suggestions that he run by some supporters
in both parties, Beatty emphasized that he liked his day job of
making movies. But he suggested that he would keep speaking out, by
insisting that ``if an unexpected person'' with spirit and ability
decided to run for president, it would not matter ``whether that
person became well known as a basketball player or a businessman or
wrestler or a grocery store clerk or a drum majorette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, look drum majorette, there's no harm in thinking
about this, however unlikely it may be,'' Beatty said. ``But
whatever you do, go ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people
nobody speaks up for. If you speak up well, maybe you'll influence
the party, maybe you'll influence the candidates that are running.
And who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And remember, drum majorette, don't delude yourself into
thinking that it's got an awful lot to do with you; it doesn't.
It's the time that you're living in, and a temporary vacuum that
that allows you the privilege of being heard. And one more thing,
drum majorette. When those plutocrats start with you, when you
start hearing those moneyed, honeyed voices of ridicule and
reaction, let them call you coy, let them call you flirtatious, but
keep talking.''

ONLINE BANKER HAS IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY  JASON Z. COHEN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Digital Insight, an online banking service
provider, is set to go public this morning after its initial public
offering was priced Thursday night at $15 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company priced its IPO a dollar above the high end of its
estimated $12 to $14 price range, a move that hints at strong
demand, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market as a whole has performed poorly
recently, some of the stronger IPOs nevertheless have shown strong
gains, said Tom Taulli, a columnist with Internet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight's 3.5 million share IPO, underwritten by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, raised $52.5 million for Digital Insight. The
IPO leaves the company with a market capitalization of $212
million, including shares it holds.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight said it has contracts with 380 small banks,
credit unions, and savings and loan associations to provide
Internet banking, online loan approval and other banking services
over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Taulli said the market for outsourced technical services is one
he expects to grow in the next few years as companies decide to
focus on their business and hire outside firms to handle online
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes more sense to outsource something like that,''
Taulli said. ``Smaller institutions don't have the budgets to do
that, but they know they have to provide those options to their
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Digital Insight reported a net loss of $3.6
million for the six months ended June 30, on pace to surpass the
company's 1998 net loss of $4.4 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always iffy to come out in a volatile or choppy market,''
said Gail Bronson, senior analyst with Calabasas-based IPO Monitor.
``A lot of would-be IPOs were held back in the summer, and smartly
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating how Digital Insight will perform today on its initial
day of trading is too difficult, Bronson said, because it would
require guessing the mood of day traders and institutional
investors.

UNDERWRITING OF STOCK AND BOND ISSUES SLOWED IN SEPTEMBER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So much for the post-Labor Day rush on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The primary business of investment banks _ underwriting sales of
stocks and bonds _ is slowing in the second half of 1999, not
accelerating as some bankers and traders had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Securities firms and banks issued $473 billion of stocks and
bonds in the third quarter, a 3.5 percent increase from $456.8
billion in the third quarter of 1998, but a marked decline from the
first two quarters of 1999, according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   September had been expected by some to be an especially busy
month as corporations hurried to sell bonds before fears about year
2000 complications scared off investors and drove up borrowing
costs. But that pickup did not occur; rather, the quarter ended on
a downbeat, depressed by concerns about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most remarkable thing was the continued weak state of the
corporate bond market, despite the very strong fundamentals,'' said
Jeff Chandler, a managing director at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``A lot
of borrowers are sitting back and demonstrating that they do have
the luxury of time and can sit back and wait until next year if
they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again
next week continued to hang over the market, Wall Street executives
said. But if the Fed makes no change and sets off a rally in bond
prices, the anticipated rush to tap investors for loans before
year-end could materialize in October, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, said Mark Seigel, a managing director at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., ``things will slow down as we approach
year-end.'' In the wake of the financial crises that roiled the
bond markets in the last two years, Seigel said, investors have
shown a decided preference for bonds issued in large amounts by
companies with strong credit ratings, like the $8.6 billion
offering by Ford Motor Co. in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Riskier high-yield bonds, known as junk bonds on Wall Street,
were a much harder sell. Junk bond issuance was just $2.2 billion
in September, the lowest total since July 1995, said Richard
Peterson, an analyst at Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch again led all securities firms in total
underwriting volume. In the third quarter, Merrill Lynch handled
about 17 percent of all stock and bond volume. Citigroup's Salomon
Smith Barney unit ranked second, followed in order by Goldman Sachs
Group, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Those rankings are important to investment bankers because they
use them as weapons in battles for underwriting assignments. But,
in the end, the most important measure is the fees those
assignments generate because some deals are much more lucrative
than others.
</P>
<P>
   In general, investment banks earn fatter fees from stock issues,
especially companies' first-time offerings, than from bond issues.
That is why firms that have strong franchises in distributing stock
tend to rake in more fees.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs took in $339 million in disclosed fees in the
third quarter, or about 15 percent of the industry total of $2.3
billion, according to Securities Data. That put Goldman ahead of
Merrill Lynch, which took in $284 million in disclosed fees. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter ranked third, with $262 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fee revenue correlates closely with how the firms stacked up in
stock underwriting, which held up better in the quarter than did
the bond business. Firms handled about $27 billion in new stock in
the quarter, more than double the $13.7 billion a year before, but
well below the $46.7 billion in the second quarter of 1999, which
was full of initial public offerings by Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 147 initial offerings in the quarter, 71 of them, or
nearly half, came in the Internet sector, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is an appetite for new ideas and new issues and
it's particularly strong in technology and communications,'' said
Tom Tuft, co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman, Sachs. ``A
lot of deals are getting done despite the fact that there's been a
lot of choppiness in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuft said he expected a full calendar of stock offerings in
October and November, then a slower-than-normal December. ``Most
people are focused on getting deals done before Thanksgiving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merger and acquisition activity rose by 43 percent, to $766
billion in the third quarter, from $535 billion a year earlier,
based on the value of the announced deals.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ranked as the leading adviser, ahead
of Goldman, Sachs. Most of the action occurred in Europe, home of
the targets in four of the five biggest deals announced. Morgan
Stanley was also the leading adviser in U.S. deals, which declined
12 percent to $315 billion, from $358 billion a year before.

ART DEALER SAYS ARREST IS AN ATTACK ON RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After being led from her eponymous Fifth Avenue art
gallery in handcuffs late Wednesday and spending a sleepless night
and the better part of a day in custody, the art dealer Mary Boone
assailed the police Thursday for arresting her on charges of
illegally distributing ammunition that was part of an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous attack on the artistic rights to express
themselves,'' Ms. Boone said after her arraignment about 8 p.m.
Thursday at Criminal Court in Manhattan, still in the sleeveless
orange dress and high-heel shoes she was wearing when she was
arrested around 6 p.m. Wednesday. ``It's all a First Amendment
issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, 47, who was proclaimed `Queen of the Art World'' on
the cover of New York magazine in the 1980s, is one of the city's
most flamboyant and outspoken art dealers. She was arrested after
the police were told that she was offering gallery visitors live
9-millimeter cartridges as keepsakes of a one-man show by the
sculptor Tom Sachs. The police seized the ammunition, which Ms.
Boone had placed in a glass vase on the reception desk of her
gallery at 745 Fifth Ave., and a sculpture consisting of four
shotguns and two pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone was arraigned on charges of possessing an exposed
rifle and possessing and disposing of ammunition. She faces up to a
year in jail and $2,000 in fines if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dropped three charges that the police had filed
against Ms. Boone _ resisting arrest, criminal possession of a
weapon and possession of stolen property (a wooden barrier in the
exhibition that the police said was the property of Con Edison).
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office, would not comment on the reason those charges
were not pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, declaring that she had not slept in 36 hours, spoke
briefly to reporters Thursday night and said the cartridges being
distributed from her gallery were not live, operable rounds.
Prosecutors, however, produced ballistic tests that they said
showed the bullets were live.
</P>
<P>
   City officials continued to defend Ms. Boone's arrest Thursday
and denied that it was related in any way to Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's ongoing battle with the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Police
officials said that Ms. Boone had been arrested and booked rather
than issued what is known as a desk appearance ticket, ordering her
to appear in court at a later date, because department policy
mandates the arrest of all people accused of illegal weapons
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars said Ms. Boone's argument that the cartridges and
shotguns were protected artistic expression stands on shaky ground.
Amy Adler, a New York University law professor who specializes in
First Amendment issues, said that courts have generally held that
art barred for being obscene can be protected by the Constitution
but that acts that potentially pose a threat to public safety do
not enjoy that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can go out and commit a murder and say that was
performance art,'' Ms. Adler said. ``It could be art, but it's
still illegal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the Police Department's chief spokeswoman, said
Thursday that the arrest occurred after a reporter for The New York
Post asked police officials to determine whether it was legal for
the gallery to distribute live ammunition. The Post had received a
complaint about the show and told police officials that a reporter
visited the gallery and had taken one of the bullets to the Federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The police sent two detectives from the Midtown North precinct
to investigate the report about 5 p.m. on Wednesday, officials
added. During the 45 minutes that police officials say Ms. Boone
kept the two detectives waiting, they wandered into the main part
of the gallery, where they noticed a cabinet on a wall holding the
guns that were a part of Sachs' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives confiscated the bullets and a number of Sachs'
works on the suspicion that they could be either explosive or used
as weapons, officials said. A decision was made to arrest Ms. Boone
once investigators determined the guns could be used, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone appeared composed Thursday night after spending 26
hours in jail. She chatted with a man accused of robbery while
waiting in a dingy courtroom for her arraignment. A young woman
arrested on charges of selling marijuana and placed in a holding
cell with Ms. Boone said she was ``very nice'' and ``sweet.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros have made a habit of rising above obstacles this season.
That resiliency has put them in position to make magic numbers a
part of their vocabulary for a third consecutive year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If they had their choice of hocus-pocus, the Astros surely would
have made the Cincinnati Reds disappear weeks ago, and the New York
Mets also would have vanished. But at last scan, there was no David
Copperfield on the Astros' roster.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Astros' best route to a magic number of zero
is to create a little magic of their own during the final
regular-season series in Astrodome history. That series begins
tonight when they open a three-game series with the spoiler-minded
Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are locked in a first-place tie with Cincinnati atop
the National League Central Division after splitting a two-game
series with the Reds this week. Both teams lead the Mets by two
games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, Reds and Mets finish the season against sub-.500
competition, but if their opponents seem equally woeful, it's just
an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 76-83 record, the Dodgers have an $80 million payroll
and a roster dotted with superstar-caliber players such as Kevin
Brown, Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. They have won nine of their
last 12 games and were picked by many to contend for the World
Series when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers are a scary team,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made that the Brewers, who host the Reds, and
the Pirates, who visit the Mets, have overachieved to compile their
mediocre records. The Dodgers clearly have the best talent among
the three teams; then again, the Pirates and Brewers won three-game
series from the Astros last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly appears on paper that we have the toughest
series,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Thursday.
``The Dodgers are a dangerous team with a lot of talent. They've
just underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we went to Pittsburgh and Milwaukee and got knocked
around. We were in the driver's seat a couple of weeks ago, and we
got ourselves into this mess. We have no one to blame but
ourselves. A team trying to win a championship has to play like
champions, and we didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still have a good deal of control over our own destiny,
and we need to take care of ourselves. Our biggest game is
tomorrow, and after that our biggest game is Saturday. Our goal is
to win these last three games, and if that's not good enough, then
it's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Astros wouldn't mind a little assistance from the
Brewers and Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Reds have the advantage,'' Astros closer Billy
Wagner said. ``Hopefully, the Brewers will play them the way they
played us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Brewers fold and the Astros struggle against the Dodgers,
the wild-card berth is still a possibility, depending on how the
Mets fare against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunsicker would prefer to see his team add to its collection
of division titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to win the division,'' he said. ``It always has
been. It would be silly to suggest we're trying to get in as the
wild card. We want to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever want to ask anyone else to do your job
for you. If we had done our job, we wouldn't be in this situation.
That's one of the things a team has to guard against. There's a
difference between playing to win and playing not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's crucial victory notwithstanding, the Astros picked a
bad time to fall into a rut. But that tends to happen late in the
season when the bodies of position players are aching and pitchers
become arm-weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three big games coming up with the Dodgers,'' second
baseman Craig Biggio said, ``and we need to try to win them. We
don't know what's going to happen as far as the playoffs are
concerned; we're just trying to win our division, and to do it
three years in a row is unbelievably difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more difficult than they ever imagined.

   NEW YORK _ Nibbling shrimp and baby lobster tails, talking on
cell phones and solemnly contemplating such works of art as a sink
and plumbing nestled in what looked like a musician's case lined in
red velvet, New York's culturati gathered proudly Thursday night at
the Brooklyn Museum of Art in defiance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
bruised esthetic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a gift from the mayor to provide this enormous
publicity,'' said Peter Norton, who developed the anti-virus
computer program that bears his name and is now a major collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hubbub is a lot of nonsense, but you can't buy that kind
of publicity,'' Norton said. ``I said they'd have to open five new
ticket tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, of course, gathered in front of the now-famous
painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' which is festooned with
elephant dung and has become the centerpiece of the dispute between
the city and the museum. Almost unnoticed in a corner was the work
that stirred protest in London: a large portrait of Myra Handle, a
child murderess done in a pointilist style of tiny children's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, for one, was quite taken with the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at how pretty, how lyrical, how sympathetic it
is,'' he said. ``If you get beyond the knee-jerk reaction, it's not
offensive. It has the glowing quality of cloissonne or terrazzo.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the event, a preview benefit for contributors, was
a sea of dark suits, a few worn daringly without ties, and lots and
lots of little black dresses. Many people seemed to get stuck
around the art in the rotunda, filled with Rodin sculpture,
arguably the best work on view.
</P>
<P>
   Listening in on conversations, it seemed the reviews of
``Sensation'' were mixed. Some people said they loved that shark in
the formaldehyde, while others said they didn't think the cow cut
in 12 sections worked as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant, the actor, strolled by all but unnoticed with the
artist Sam Taylor-Wood, whose painting ``Wrecked'' is a take on the
Last Supper with the central Christlike figure a topless woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some pieces that I liked, some pieces I don't like,''
said Michael Bloomberg, the business-news mogul. ``I don't
understand why there is a fuss about this. To me there is nothing
sacrilegious about the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the civil libertarian, was among those present
already bubbling over with plans for a protest rally on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the buzz in the museum,'' he said. ``You hear a lot of
people saying, `What's the big deal,' and maybe they're being
sensitized to the increasing authoritarianism in the city. Maybe
there's a silver lining in the way New York City is being tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn Thursday, seeking to evict the museum. The suit contends
that the museum violated its lease by imposing a special $9.75 fee
for admission to the exhibition and by promoting the commercial
interests of the private collector who owns the artwork in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers also appeared at a routine hearing in
Brooklyn federal court Thursday, where the museum has filed suit
against the city.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The museum's lawyer, Floyd Abrams, was asking Judge Nina Gershon
to schedule a hearing when Michael Hess, the city's corporation
counsel, announced that the city had filed its own suit.
</P>
<P>
   Hess contended that since the city had brought suit in state
court, the federal suit filed by the museum should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon said she would consider the city's request, and
told both sides to submit papers by Oct. 4 on all the issues in the
case, including on whether she should dismiss it. The judge will
hold another hearing on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's most widely discussed work, Chris Ofili's
``Holy Virgin Mary,'' was ensconced behind a Plexiglas shield in a
small alcove, with a guard posted nearby, in an apparent effort to
forestall any overt acts of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Four more of Ofili's works, all executed in his favored medium,
elephant dung, are also on view. All display his hallmark technique
of supporting the main body of work on two footlike pedestals of
dried pachyderm product, which is said by collectors to lose its
smell after it has aired out for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also contains several pieces by Damien Hirst, who
works mostly in dead fish and animals. These include a shark, a
sliced-up cow, a lamb and a bisected pig in formaldehyde-filled
cases, and a Rube Goldberg-like device in which maggots feed on a
dead cow's head and give rise to flies, which are eventually zapped
by an electrical device called an ``insect-o-cutor.'' This last is
said to be a meditation on mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the publicity that the controversy has generated, the
museum played host to hundreds of reporters and photographers
Thursday morning for a first look at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to see so many members of the press interested in
art,'' Arnold Lehman, the museum's director, said dryly, welcoming
the unaccustomed horde.
</P>
<P>
   But the embattled curator quickly turned serious, saying:
``Public funding of the arts is an investment in the values and the
ideals embodied in the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution. I hope that people will choose to see this
exhibition. I also hope they have the right to choose not to see
this exhibition. That is what democracy in America is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's something else I'd like to say,'' he added. ``The
Brooklyn Museum is more than just one work of art that incorporates
animal dung.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman staunchly defended Ofili's choice of artistic
material, saying that the use of animal dung is venerated in many
African cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they tell us is not a story of blasphemy, but of
reverence,'' he said. ``But it is in a language that is foreign to
many of us raised in the tradition of Western culture. Having these
sacred objects in our museums teach us lessons of tolerance,
understanding and diversity. If people do not make the effort to
understand, if people do not exercise tolerance and mutual respect,
then we all suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the controversy would increase ticket sales,
Lehman, who has said he became interested in the exhibit when he
saw the long lines it generated in London, replied: ``Hopefully,
ticket sales will be explosive. This evening we were expecting
hundreds of people. Now we're expecting a couple of thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with a museum filled with people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani continued to fulminate against the exhibition
Thursday from Bakersfield, Calif., where he was on a political
fund-raising jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the motivation is commercial
motivation. You'd have to be a fool not to see that,'' the mayor
said of the dispute that he himself stirred up. ``This is
essentially what you do to promote some kind of commercial
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dolman, a managing director of Christie's, the auction
house that is helping sponsor the exhibit, demurred, rebuffing City
Hall's contention of a scheme to pump up the prices of the artwork,
which is part of the collection of Charles Saatchi, the British
advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of art is determined by supply and demand,'' Dolman
said.

CONFUSION OVER TWO MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS CAUSED MARS ORBITER'S LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to recast lede, correct and define newton and poundal
units of force in 2nd, 19th, 20th and 22nd graphs.)  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scientists lost a $125 million spacecraft as it
approached Mars last week essentially because they confused feet
and pounds with meters and kilograms, NASA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An internal review team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in
a preliminary conclusion, said that engineers at Lockheed Martin
Corp., which had built the spacecraft, specified certain
measurements about the spacecraft's thrust in poundals, an English
unit, but that NASA scientists thought the information was a metric
measurement known as newtons.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting miscalculation, undetected for months as the craft
was designed, built and launched, meant the Mars Climate Orbiter,
as it was called, was off course by about 60 miles as it approached
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the cautionary tale that is going to be
embedded into introductions to the metric system in elementary
school and high school and college physics till the end of time,''
said John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's reaction was equally blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is disbelief,'' said Noel Hinners, vice president
for flight systems at Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver. ``It
can't be something that simple that could cause this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding was a major embarrassment for NASA, which said it
was investigating how such a basic error could have gone through
the a space mission's checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not that the data was wrong,'' said Edward
C. Stone, the director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., which was in charge of the mission. ``The real issue is
that our process did not realize there was this discrepancy and
correct for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also wondered how something so basic could have
gone undetected for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked I could sort of visually detect the
difference between a foot and a meter,'' Pike said. ``This is kind
of the very first thing in Physics 101 or Engineering 101. This is
the only significant program failure that anyone's ever heard of
that's due to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure could raise questions about whether NASA and its
contractors are skimping on safety to cut costs. The Mars Climate
Orbiter, the first spacecraft designed to study the climate of
another planet, was exceedingly inexpensive by NASA's standards. It
is part of a new strategy to fly more but less expensive missions
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   That limits the damage done by the failure of any single
mission. ``There is not a single mission in the program that is
critical to the overall program,'' said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   But Pike said, ``Obviously the question they are going to have
to ask is maybe it was a little too cheap. The question that will
have to be asked here is whether in cutting costs, they cut
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure is also another black eye for Lockheed, the nation's
largest military contractor, which in the last year or so has
suffered several failures of rockets and missiles it has developed.
These failures led the company to restructure its operations and
change management in its space business.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said they are checking to make sure the same
error does not occur in the Mars Polar Lander, which is now en
route to Mars and scheduled to reach the planet on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate review committees have already been formed to
investigate the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter _ the internal Jet
Propulsion Laboratory peer review team, which made Thursday's
preliminary findings, and a special review board of experts from
the laboratory and elsewhere. An independent NASA failure review
board will be formed shortly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known with certainty what happened to the Mars Climate
Orbiter. At first there was speculation that it crashed on Mars or
burned up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But the review team now tends to think that the spacecraft is
now orbiting the sun, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokesman said.
Under this theory, the spacecraft approached too close to Mars and
overheated, causing the engine that was being fired to bring the
craft into orbit to stop functioning, so the Orbiter continued on
into space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and Lockheed officials said the full details of how the
mistake occurred were not known. But, basically, Lockheed was
providing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with data on the amount of
force imparted to the spacecraft by its thrusters, which are fired
periodically. This was measured in poundals, Hinners said.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory assumed the figure
was in newtons and incorporated it into computer models that are
used to calculate the spacecraft's position and direction. A newton
is the force needed to accelerate a one-kilogram mass one meter per
second per second. A poundal is the force needed to accelerate a
one-pound mass one foot per second per second.
</P>
<P>
   The computer models supplement other data about the spacecraft's
position, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Since one poundal equals about 4.4 newtons, it would seem that
such an error would be readily detected, but Hinners said this was
not the case because the thrusters contributed only a little to the
orbit. ``The firings would have been a very small piece of a larger
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The miscalculations put the spacecraft off course by only about
60 miles out of a journey of roughly 416 million miles, Stone said.

CLINTON URGES TOUGH LOVE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE FAILING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.C., N.J., Fla., Calif., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ President Clinton Thursday told governors and
executives at a conference examining educational standards that
students who are held back because they fail to vault newly raised
bars should be treated with tough love.
</P>
<P>
   The president insisted, for example, that each of the 24
governors who arrived here for the two-day National Education
Summit ``look dead in the eye some child who has been held back''
and say, ``This doesn't mean there's something wrong with you, but
we'll be hurting you worse if we tell you you're learning something
when you're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll basically be participating in a fraud,'' the president
continued, as if addressing a student himself, ``which ultimately
will cost you more personally, psychically, and of course,
eventually, financially, than any pain that comes in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the unwelcome prospect of causing such pain
that had brought the 114 leaders together. Led by Louis V.
Gerstner, the chairman of IBM, the group gathered to discuss the
rapidly changing educational landscape, in which every state but
Iowa has either adopted or drafted expectations for what students
should know or be able to do in at least some grades and subjects.
</P>
<P>
   As states begin to install tests to measure that knowledge,
millions of students who fail the exams are expected to be held
back. Thousands, in states including New York, already have been.
</P>
<P>
   But if the conference, which began Thursday afternoon with the
president's address, is intended to grapple with the new
expectations for children, the participants made clear that adults
were to be held accountable as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the conference ends on Friday afternoon, the
organizers hope that the participants, who include the leaders of
the two biggest teachers unions, will endorse a statement of
actions they intend to take. For example, a draft that was
circulating Thursday asked 10 states to start pilot programs
linking teachers' pay to such factors as their skills in the
classroom, their own education and the performance of their
students.
</P>
<P>
   Though many professionals have long been paid according to their
specialties, their expertise and the degree to which they are in
demand, teachers have strenuously resisted similar efforts. They
have feared that their salaries would fluctuate either because of a
principal's whim or because the most logical measure of their
success, student test scores, are often related to factors outside
of teachers' control, like poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, the country's largest
teachers union, recently endorsed a pay-for-performance experiment
in Denver. The union's president, Bob Chase, and his counterpart at
the American Federation of Teachers, Sandra Feldman, said Thursday
that they did not oppose expanding such a program, but they advised
proceeding with caution. How, for example, would schools fairly
define good teaching, they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman said states should look to examples like North
Carolina, which ties teachers' bonuses, of as much as $1,500 a
year, not to the performance of individual classes, but to the
performance of entire schools. It was not clear which states, if
any, would agree to start a pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of such gatherings _ this one included the
governors of New Jersey, Florida and California and the chief
executives of United Parcel Service, DuPont and Prudential Life
Insurance _ is often to move beyond rhetoric to the reality of
schools and classrooms. The speakers here sometimes had difficulty
doing so, calling, as Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina did,
for ``a national passion to have an excellent teaching force,'' but
offering few suggestions for how to reduce class sizes and
otherwise ease teachers' burdens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The speakers Thursday included state superintendents and the
leaders of school board associations, but no rank-and-file teachers
or principals.
</P>
<P>
   Though the last gathering of governors and chief executives,
convened by Gerstner in 1996, succeeded in making ``standards'' a
rallying cry for educators and politicians, it remains to be seen
what the legacy of this gathering will be.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft of the closing statement, the participants would
agree that districts should steer hundreds of millions of dollars
spent on teachers' professional development to courses directly
tied to each state's standards in English, mathematics, social
studies and science. That would, in many districts, be a radical
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty little secret'' of professional development, one
organizer said, has been that some districts have paid little heed
to teachers' education, sometimes rewarding teachers for taking
what in effect are vacations to foreign countries or national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   The participants would also agree to press for programs that
would help failing students before they are held back or denied
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   But forging any broader consensus may prove difficult: the
governors and educational leaders have deep differences on issues
like publicly financed vouchers to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the closing statement, for example, endorses
``choice,'' often a synonym for vouchers, only within public school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want `choice' to be the distraction,'' said Gov. Tommy
G. Thompson of Wisconsin, an organizer of the conference, who has
supported a voucher experiment in Milwaukee. ``Therefore, it's not
going to be mentioned or discussed.''

   NEW YORK _ With a dead shark, dismembered plastic heads, and, of
course, plentiful elephant dung, the ``Sensation'' exhibit at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art does not exactly lend itself to cute
merchandising. But that hasn't prevented the museum from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the first day of business at the ``Sensation'' gift
shop, a boutique on the museum's fourth floor, where curios
relating to the exhibition are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Like the exhibition, the shop's wares range from the strange to
the stranger. Want a paperweight consisting of a plastic rat
encased in an amber block? The shop has it, for $2.95. How about a
lunch box with the biohazard symbol? Yours for $8.95.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Stutz, the museum's vice director for marketing, said the
store's merchandise was aimed at consumers who wanted to take a
little of the exhibit's odd ethos home with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the word sensation as a point of departure,'' Ms.
Stutz said. ``Touching sensations, feeling sensations, thought
sensations.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparently includes items like Astroturf place mats ($6.75)
and toilet paper rolls wrapped in yellow caution tape ($4.50).
There are also yapping battery-powered pigs, and socks and wallets
and CD cases emblazoned with the British flag, a nod to the young
British artists whose work makes up the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, there are sharks, lots of sharks _ a
homage to ``The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of
Someone Living,'' which is artist Damien Hirst's display of a tiger
shark suspended in a tank of formaldehyde. Store bins are stocked
with shark stencils, shark staplers and shark throw pillows.
</P>
<P>
   And while the popularity of the exhibit and its ear-shaped money
clips (85 cents) remain to be seen, store managers said Thursday
that one item already looked like a hit: lapel pins in the shape of
traffic caution signs labeled ``Danger'' over the word ``Art.''

A DUBIOUS HEALTH-CARE PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
   
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is finally getting the hang of how he can use
budget-surplus politics to boost his presidential fortunes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes a $65-billion-a-year plan to make health care
available to nearly all uninsured Americans. His plan, he says,
wouldn't require new taxes, but could be financed with future
budget surpluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While those extra revenues are estimated at about $1 trillion
over the next decade, fiscal forecasts are notoriously unreliable.
As recently as the early '90s, for instance, experts were
predicting budget deficits of $400 billion or more by the end of
this decade. Instead, this year's surplus is now being estimated at
$115 billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recession could put Uncle Sam back into the red, but even if
the surplus forecasts hold up, there are cautionary considerations
to ponder. One is that most, if not all, of the projected surpluses
will be excess revenues from the payroll taxes paid to fund Social
Security. As that money is spent, it will represent nothing more
than borrowing from Peter's Social Security pot to pay for
uninsured Paul's medical-care coverage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, it should be remembered that initial cost estimates
of proposed government programs always turn out to be much lower
than the eventual financial reality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bold new programs offered by candidates, however, aren't much
about details, which are bothersome things that can't be explained
in 30-second sound bites on the evening news. Going beyond the
dubious nature of Bradley's financing plan are the daunting details
of how such a program would improve the lives of those it's
supposed to help. Bradley said, for instance, that his plan would
require health insurance coverage for all uninsured children, but
offered no mechanism to enforce the enrollment of these children in
coverage plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust in the basic goodness of the American
people,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's a touching sentiment, but it's based on a heroic
assumption. Bradley may not appreciate how real life works, but
there are many Americans who may be basically good people but are
nevertheless highly irresponsible. They don't order their lives to
be ready for problems when they happen, but instead choose to wait
for bad things to happen before reacting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another probable consequence of Bradley's plan would be to
increase demand for medical care. Just as there are people who
don't take proper care of themselves and their children, there are
also people who view insurance coverage as justification for
seeking medical care for every real and imagined hurt and
discomfort, no matter how minor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bradley is thinking in terms of fee-for-service or
managed care, the outcome of ratcheting up use of the health-care
system by 45 million users will be the same: More demands on a
system already in a rationing mode. Many Americans may not be aware
of it, but when government trims its Medicare reimbursements to
providers, and companies seek ways to economize on employee
health-care benefits, as has been the case, these are forms of
rationing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budget-surplus politics, however, aren't about truth or reality,
but about gulling voters into thinking they can have more goodies
from government without having to pay for them. &QL;

EEOC ACCUSES NYC OF IGNORING SEX HARASSMENT IN WORKFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated
federal law when it turned away women who said they were being
sexually harassed while working for their public assistance
benefits, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled in
a decision made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The city has maintained that the women were not employees and
and had no legal right to protection from sex discrimination in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC's finding came in the case of a homeless mother of two
who charged that her city supervisor in a welfare-to-work program
had pressed her for sex and retaliated against her when she
refused. The EEOC, which found reasonable cause to believe the city
subjected the woman to sexual harassment and sex discrimination,
has between 5 and 10 similar cases in various stages of
investigation, according to lawyers involved in them.
</P>
<P>
   The women received subsistence benefits only on the condition
that they work off the public aid in city clerical jobs at the
equivalent of the minimum wage. New York City, which has the
nation's largest workfare program, with about 40,000 participants
at any one time, is the only jurisdiction known to be contending
that such workers are not entitled to the protection of federal
civil rights laws against sex discrimination in the workplace,
according to Yolanda Wu, a lawyer with NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund, the advocacy organization that represents the woman
whose case led to the EEOC's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city does not condone sexual harassment of any kind,''
said Lorna Goodman, a senior lawyer in the city corporation
counsel's office. ``If the civil rights laws do not cover these
types of workers because they are not legally employees of the
city, that does not mean that they have no redress.'' She said the
women could bring private lawsuits against the individuals they say
harassed them, or even bring criminal charges of assault in the
cases where they say male supervisors groped them sexually.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Vargyas, legal counsel for the EEOC in Washington
D.C., said federal regulations and court rulings now make clear
that welfare recipients in workfare programs are protected by all
anti-discrimination laws to the same extent that other employees
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you call them,'' she said. ``It boils
down to `does the alleged employer control the manner and means of
work.''' She added, ``If you have people who are not protected
under the laws, you do of course fear for exploitation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The woman in the EEOC ruling was not identified, but she said in
legal papers that she was picked out from an orientation session
for 50 welfare applicants by the man who became her supervisor in
the spring of 1997. Over the next few weeks, she charged, he made
unwanted sexual advances, pressed her to go to a motel with him for
sex, and said he would arrange for her to be absent from the
Brooklyn homeless shelter where she had moved with her 12-year old
daughter and 7-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for her refusal, she said, she ultimately lost
her job and had to fight to keep her welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Gonzales, one of the women with a pending case before the
EEOC, said Thursday at a news conference that she had complained to
two levels of supervisors, to no avail, that her boss at the city's
Human Resources Administration grabbed her genitals, demanded sex,
stole her time cards and threatened her life when she refused his
advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right that the city should treat women who
need their help like this,'' said Ms. Gonzales, 32, who was
unemployed and was facing eviction when she applied for public
assistance in 1997. ``I have nightmares and I still cry when I talk
about this, and I'm still very afraid of that man.''
</P>
<P>
   In a third case before the EEOC, a woman charged that city
supervisors ignored her complaints that her boss at another
workfare site was pinching her buttocks and ribs and putting his
hands down her pants, according to Jack Bryant Tuckner, who
represents her and Ms. Gonzales. Finally, she was transferred to
another assignment, he said, but later the city allowed the same
boss to follow her there.
</P>
<P>
   When the EEOC sought to investigate several complaints of sexual
harassment, the city refused to cooperate, maintaining in its legal
papers that the EEOC had no authority to look into charges made by
public assistance recipients because they are not employees.
</P>
<P>
   After the EEOC went to federal court in Manhattan last spring to
enforce subpoenas for city records connected with three of the
cases, the city also argued that supplying the requested
information would violate the confidentiality of welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not a particularly sympathetic position,'' Ms.
Goodman, the city lawyer, said. ``But this is a legal issue. We
have a good faith duty to protect the taxpayer.'' She added,
``Sometimes we see in court somebody who has been grievously
injured but there may not be liability on the person they have
sued.'' Most of the women who have experienced sexual harassment in
workfare jobs are afraid to complain, said Marc Cohan, a lawyer
with the Welfare Law Center, the advocacy organization that helped
the homeless mother of two keep her benefits.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded in earning her high school equivalency diploma and
finding work in the private sector on her own, Cohan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should she have less protection just because she's poor?''
he asked. ``We have a supposedly law-enforcement mayor who is
hiding behind legal technicalities instead of addressing what is a
horrendous situation. It's absolutely outrageous that the city's
claiming its program mirrors the world of work, and then it denies
these women the basic rights that are available to other workers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written decision, the EEOC said its investigation
determined that the city's Human Resources Administration had
violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the basic
federal law that prohibits discrimination in employment on the
basis of race and sex, because ``it failed to inform a class of
employees who worked as participants in New York City's Work
Education Program, funded through Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families, of their rights under Title VII'' and also failed to
provide any mechanism to complain about harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the EEOC to now try to eliminate the unlawful
employment practices with persuasion and conciliation. If that
fails, the EEOC can seek court enforcement. The women involved were
barred from suing in court until they exhausted the EEOC's
remedies, Ms. Wu said, adding that NOW had unsuccessfully sought
meetings to discuss the problem with the city for two and a half
years.

ABORTION LAW BACKERS THINK FEDERAL JUDGE WILL RULE AGAINST
MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Key backers of Missouri's newest abortion
law think the measure probably will be struck down by U.S. District
Judge Scott Wright. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The officials, including the Senate sponsor of the law, said
they were pessimistic about prevailing in district court not
because they thought the new law was flawed, but because of
previous rulings by Wright. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senate sponsor Ted House of St. Charles said Wright ``has
consistently supported the abortion industry. Judge Wright has
never met an abortion regulation that he liked.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House said he shared the sentiment of other anti-abortion
leaders who expected to lose the first legal round in district
court. A trial to decide whether the statute is constitutional is
set for March 27. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not giving up at the trial level, but we knew from the
beginning that we have to be in this for the long run,'' House
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents said they had a better chance before a
federal appeals court or, if the law got that far, the U.S. Supreme
Court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bednar, legal counsel for Gov. Mel Carnahan, criticized
predictions by abortion foes who thought Wright would reject the
measure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are a bit unfair to Judge Wright,'' Bednar said.
``The fact of the matter is they have a bill with serious
constitutional problems. To try to blame it on the judge they got
is dodging the issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wright declined comment on predictions of how he will rule. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The law is already on hold because of the federal lawsuit in
Wright's court. Arguments and appeals on the issue could delay it
from taking effect for two years, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backers say the law will ban what they call ``partial-birth''
abortions by labeling them as infanticide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by a clinic that provides abortions in St.
Louis and a doctor who performs abortions, said that the new law
was so broad it would ban most abortions and that it failed to
include a health exception for mothers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lou DeFeo, lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Conference and one
of the drafters of the law, said he thought that Wright would
reject the measure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Previous rulings by Wright on abortion cases, as well as other
abortion rulings in district court in Kansas City, led him to that
conclusion, DeFeo said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If the horses ran one way in the past they will likely run
that way in the future,'' said DeFeo, a lawyer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist who called Wright ``the
darling of Planned Parenthood,'' said he would be shocked if Wright
did not reject the law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Lee said history showed that such a setback would not be
fatal to the legislation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that Wright had been reversed on several abortion
cases, including his rejection of a 1986 Missouri law that included
a ban on abortions in public health facilities. The U.S. Supreme
Court upheld that measure in 1989 in the case of Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in 1992 reversed Wright's rejection of
another Missouri law that required special insurance payments to
cover elective abortions, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City attorney Arthur Benson, who is helping to represent
plaintiffs in the lawsuit, cited last Friday's ruling by the U.S.
8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected partial-birth abortion
bans in three states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that after the Eighth Circuit rulings on Friday
that the chances of this law being sustained at the trial-court
level went from slim to none,'' Benson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missouri law is simply unconstitutional,'' he said. ``It
doesn't matter whether we are talking about the trial court or the
appeals court.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cherrick of St. Louis, a special assistant state attorney
defending the law, did not comment on predictions that Wright will
reject it. Cherrick said he would ``try to persuade every court
that our position is correct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The law under fire triggered weeks of debate in the Missouri
legislature earlier this year. Carnahan vetoed it but the General
Assembly overrode the veto last month, just the third override in
Missouri this century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still more abortion arguments may surface during the 2000
session, which begins in January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has urged lawmakers to pass a partial-birth abortion
ban that includes a health exception for the mother. Opponents said
that they had no interest in passing such a measure and that the
health exception would make the ban meaningless. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House said that legislative efforts to keep Planned Parenthood
from getting state family-planning funds _ the object of a separate
lawsuit _ triggered legislative arguments most every year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said the Missouri Catholic Conference remained committed
to an ``abortion-free society'' but was unsure what bills it would
urge lawmakers to approve next year to help achieve that goal. &QL;

DONATIONS TO ASHCROFT, CARNAHAN DRIVES SPARK ALLEGATIONS OF
PARTIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was Republican Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri acting as an
impartial juror when he voted to remove President Clinton in
February? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they have new evidence suggesting he was not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, making an impartial
judgment when he vetoed a late-term abortion bill this year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, Republicans say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over judgment is the latest issue in the U.S.
Senate race between the two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Ashcroft was based on a $2,000 payment that
Ashcroft's Spirit of America Political Action Committee received
from the defense fund of Linda Tripp, who provided prosecutors
tape-recorded evidence against the president. The payment, for the
purchase of a fund-raising list, came on Feb. 9, three days before
Ashcroft voted to cast Clinton out of office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft completely disregarded his responsibility to
hear the evidence as a fair and impartial juror,'' Missouri
Democratic Chairman Joe Carmichael charged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashcroft had an ethical responsibility to disclose, before the
end of the trial, his relationship with Tripp and the money he
received from her,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PAC received two other payments from Tripp's fund, on April
8 and May 10. The three payments totaled almost $2,500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri GOP, said
Ashcroft disclosed the information as the law required. He pointed
out that Ashcroft's thoughts about Clinton were clear from the
beginning of the impeachment trial and that the payment in no way
compromised the senator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft was decisive in this case,'' Hancock said. ``He
was one of the first senators in the country to say Clinton's
behavior was reprehensible.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Constitution defined the impeachment trial as
a political proceeding, not a criminal trial. Several senators
voiced opinions about the case before casting their final
impeachment votes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it unusual for fund-raising lists to be sold to
direct-mail groups, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If Democrats think that a $2,000 list swap influenced John
Ashcroft's feeling about Bill Clinton's behavior with Monica
Lewinsky, then they don't know John Ashcroft very well,'' Hancock
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Democrats came up with the charge to counter
Republicans' accusation last week about Carnahan. The GOP pointed
out that the governor accepted $14,000 in campaign contributions
from abortion-rights groups while a bill banning ``partial birth''
abortions sat on his desk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan eventually vetoed the ban on the late-term procedure.
The General Assembly overrode his veto, making the bill a law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a federal judge has issued a restraining order that
will keep the law from being enforced until at least March, when a
review will be conducted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a staunch abortion-rights supporter, had vetoed
similar legislation earlier in his administration. He has said
there was no link between the contributions and his action this
year and that he welcomes donations from abortion-rights groups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do many actions as governor, and I do them based on my
responsibility, my duty and what I think is right,'' Carnahan told
The Associated Press. &QL;

MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL BACKS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP ON SUITS
AGAINST POLLUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon and a dozen
other attorneys general are siding with an environmental group
asking that the U.S. Supreme Court let people seek court
enforcement of pollution-control laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon appeared Thursday at a news conference called by Friends
of the Earth. The group is appealing a lower court ruling that it
says undermines the Clean Water Act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth and other groups had sued Laidlaw
Environmental Services for letting a hazardous-waste incinerator
release mercury into the North Tyger River at Roebuck, Va. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuit was filed, Laidlaw stopped the polluting, but
then a judge fined the company $405,800. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia overturned the
fine, saying that a fine paid to the government did not serve as a
remedy for a private group's complaint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the ruling meant that a company, if it is sued by a
private group, can avoid a fine by simply stopping its pollution
when a lawsuit is filed. Often, those lawsuits are filed privately
because government won't or can't take action against polluters,
they said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, citizen suits provide a necessary tool for both
private individuals and states to deal with significant
environmental problems,'' Nixon said. ``They take away the excuse
for politicians and their elected officials not to act.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon filed a brief on behalf of 13 states saying that citizen
lawsuits ``fill the gap in Clean Water Act enforcement left by a
lack of government resources.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, citizen lawsuits have stopped pollution caused by
runoff from hog- and chicken-rendering operations, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a necessary and vital part of the regulatory
process,'' Nixon said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some corporations say environmental groups have gone
overboard with expensive, prolonged lawsuits that involve minor or
already corrected violations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen suits are valuable in certain cases, but this is much
ado about nothing,'' said Donald Cockrill, who will argue the case
before the Supreme Court for Laidlaw, now known as Safety-Kleen
Inc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cockrill said lawsuits were justified if the pollution actually
was harmful and if the state or the federal Environmental
Protection Agency refused to act. In the case in question, the
levels of mercury were far from harmful, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cockrill said the main issue for the court to decide should be
whether a citizens group has standing in court to seek financial
penalties that are paid to the government, although he said there
is no guarantee the ruling will resolve that point. &QL;

   Independence, Mo., police early Thursday morning arrested an
Indianapolis man wanted for questioning in the death of his wife
and baby son, whose bodies were found in a freezer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John K. Adams, 24, has not been charged with killing his family,
but he is wanted on two armed robbery charges in Indiana. He was
being held without bond at the Independence jail. On Thursday
afternoon, investigators from Indianapolis were on their way to
Independence to question him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Adams' wife and son were found Sept. 22 in a
freezer in the family's home in Indianapolis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Independence, while on routine patrol, Police
Officer Aaron Gieszen noticed a van parked in a secluded area
behind a power substation at Kiger and Lee's Summit roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect he (Adams) had just pulled off I-70 and was looking
for a place to sleep back there when the police officer found
him,'' Independence Police Chief Gary George said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A check of the license plate showed that the vehicle was
reported lost or stolen, said Detective Sgt. Terry Storey. Gieszen
called for backup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adams was sleeping in the van when police approached. A computer
check revealed that Adams was wanted in Indianapolis. Police
confiscated a handgun at the scene, George said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who since his arrest has threatened to harm himself, is
under a suicide watch, the chief said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, Indianapolis police went to arrest Adams on two
counts each of armed robbery, criminal confinement and carrying a
handgun without a license in connection with holdups at two
restaurants, according to Sgt. Doug Schessel of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department in Indiana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adams wasn't there, but police entered his home and found two
bodies in a freezer. They had been wrapped in blue plastic
tarpaulins and bound with duct tape. The bodies were later
identified as those of Adams' wife, Robin Schafer-Adams, 24, and
their 10-month-old son, John Ramseys Adams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman had been shot to death and the baby had been
strangled, according to the Marion County coroner's office.
Authorities think the bodies had been in the freezer as long as
three months. &QL;

DMITRI LIKHACHEV, 92, GUARDIAN OF RUSSIA'S HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Dmitri Likhachev, a Russian literary scholar revered as
a guardian of national culture and a voice of reason and moral
authority, died Thursday in a hospital in St. Petersburg. He was
92.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade of turbulent change in Russia, Likhachev,
a gentle, elegant man who spoke with the measured eloquence of the
pre-Bolshevik intelligentsia, was frequently sought out by
politicians and commentators as a referee in the churning debate
over history.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, who consulted Likhachev on cultural and
historical issues, was ``deeply grieved'' by his death, said a
spokesman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, as Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
loosened the Communist Party's grip on culture and history,
Likhakhev was enlisted as chairman of the newly established Soviet
Cultural Fund, a foundation that sponsored cultural and restoration
projects with active support from Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, who died
Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1906, the son of a St. Petersburg lithographer,
Likhachev witnessed the 1917 Russian Revolution, the civil war and
the subsequent economic and political upheavals that destroyed the
society he was born into.
</P>
<P>
   While a student at Leningrad State University in 1928, he was
arrested and sentenced to exile in the Solovetsky Islands, the most
notorious of the early labor camps. Like so many arrests at the
time, the reason was spurious: Likhachev was with some students who
were celebrating an anniversary, and a friend sent them a telegram
that pretended to be congratulations from the pope. The entire
group was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   From his four years in the camps, Likhachev gained first-hand
knowledge of the brutality of the Soviet regime. In an incident
that would haunt him through his life, he was selected to be shot
in a random execution in 1929 in retribution for a mass escape. He
spotted his name on the list and hid. For the rest of his life, he
recounted in an interview years later, ``I have had to live two
lives: my own and the life of a man whose name I do not even
know.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final years, he also recalled how he made use of the
experience, listening carefully and with fascination to the tales
and the language of the common criminals who were mixed in with
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   As a scholar, Likhachev was known for his work on Russian
medieval literature. He returned from the camps to a job as a
literary editor, and went on to become a researcher at the
Institute of Russian Literature and a professor of history at
Leningrad University. In 1970 he was made a full member of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Likhachev was a scholar-in-residence at
Pushkin House _ the Institute of Russian Literature in St.
Petersburg _ where he received a steady stream of visitors in a
modest but handsomely decorated second-floor office with a view of
the SS. Peter and Paul fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Likhachev was honored abroad for his work, and was made a
corresponding member of the Austrian, U.S., British and Italian
academies of arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   At home, where he was regarded with deep affection and awe by
fellow intellectuals, he was presented last year with the Order of
St. Andrew, the first person to receive the czarist-era medal since
1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the end of an era,'' said Vladimir Gusev, director of
St. Petersburg's Russian Museum, in a television interview Thursday
night. ``I hope it is not the end of the era of cultured people. I
hope he was not the last of the Mohicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never was a political dissident like Andrei
Sakharov, the physicist who won a Nobel Peace Prize, Likhachev,
like Sakharov, became a reference point for Russians who, after the
fall of communism, were left trying to retrieve a cultural heritage
that had been distorted by the communist experience.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in 1985 by Moscow News, a newspaper that was then at
the forefront of Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost'' or openness,
Likhachev emphasized the importance of culture and history in the
preservation of national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should regard history from the `observation platform' of
our times,'' he said. ``And this platform is not immobile; it
constantly rises higher and higher, opening ever new horizons
before us. That is why the science of history can never be canned,
or provide us with the ultimate truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the Russian intelligentsia, Likhachev was
deeply disappointed by the violence, greed and vulgarity that
surfaced in Russian society after the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year, he recalled how even his fellow
inmates in the Solovetsky camp refused to associate with murderers.
In modern Russia, he noted, people regard ``killers'' _ he used the
English word _ as professionals like any other.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed this on decades of communist rule that had subjected
people to a twisted version of history. ``Morality was perverted,''
he said. ``Marxism reduced history to the most ignoble of
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   But he remained a staunch defender of Russia's new freedoms, and
dismissed popular nostalgia for the stability of the Soviet era.
``Imagine how it was here 10 years ago,'' he said, recalling the
days of bugged telephones and informers who used to lurk outside
his office door.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Likhachev continued to lobby the Russian
government on behalf of educational projects like the financing of
a national television station devoted to culture.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last year, he stressed the moral imperative
of maintaining and raising Russia's cultural standards. ``A lot of
jealousy is the result of people not realizing themselves
culturally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also critical of showcase projects, like the $350
million reconstruction of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in
Moscow, which he described as looking ``something like a prefab
kit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending so much money on a huge cathedral in the center of
Moscow makes me embarrassed before the many parts of the country
where there is not a church for hundreds of kilometers,'' he said.

 Sprint to dedicate campus today amid rumors of a possible merger  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH and TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. today dedicates its huge new Overland Park campus
amid rumors of a possible merger with rival MCI WorldCom Inc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Company officials won't cut ribbons because workers have been
moving to the campus since July. But thousands of area employees
and civic leaders are wondering if Sprint Chairman William Esrey
will cut a deal instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That question hangs like a cloud over a ceremony celebrating the
opening of the first buildings on the projected $920 million office
campus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a universal sense of holding one's breath,''
said Robert Marcusse, president of the Kansas City Area Development
Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is the area's biggest private-sector employer, most
voracious user of office space, a generous community donor and a
major source of civic pride. But Sprint also is big game in a
worldwide telecommunications feeding frenzy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that we are highly
sensitive to this,'' said Mary Birch, president of the Overland
Park Chamber of Commerce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information is in short supply for the company's 15,000 area
employees because Sprint management has yet to make any statement
on its talks with MCI WorldCom, internally or publicly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regulators forbid companies to deny merger talks when they are
proceeding because that might mislead investors. But companies can
simply refuse to comment _ indefinitely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Esrey is expected to make a brief statement to the media after
the ceremony Friday, but he may simply repeat the company's refusal
to ``comment on speculation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The potential effect of a Sprint//MCI WorldCom deal on area
employment is difficult to gauge and would ultimately depend on how
a deal was structured, how much MCI WorldCom paid for the company
and what conditions regulators applied. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow any merger to happen in this (long-distance
telephone) industry that turns back the clock on competition,''
U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard
said Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most observers agree that a deal would result _ at least in
the short term _ in a diminished area payroll, decreased demand for
local office space and weaker ties to the community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After building their company through scores of acquisitions, MCI
WorldCom Chairman Bernie Ebbers and his team have a reputation as
aggressive cost cutters, and would be looking to realize big
savings to offset any premium that they paid for Sprint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's corporate headquarters staff might be quick to feel the
pain. Most analysts speculate that in the event of a merger,
Sprint's management team would leave the combined company. They
also think MCI WorldCom would quickly cut redundant legal, finance
and marketing positions to realize the maximum savings in the first
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greatest operational overlap of MCI and Sprint is in their
long-distance and data operations. Both companies have sales and
marketing staff to serve the business and residential market, and
staff to support their respective networks, many of whom would be
vulnerable as the company melded operations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February, MCI WorldCom agreed to outsource all of its
application development, maintenance agreements and infrastructure
services to Electronic Data Systems of Plano, Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, MCI WorldCom has almost no presence in the
wireless market and would probably see little reason to move Sprint
PCS's fast-growing operations out of Kansas City or cut its
employment significantly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS now employs about 3,300 employees in the city, plus
about 1,000 contract workers. Employment growth has been explosive
_ the company employed 328 in Kansas City at the end of 1995 _ but
is leveling off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprint also has local operations in 19 states, with little
overlap with MCI's operations. Sprint North Supply and Directory
Publishing might also be relatively unaffected by the move, if the
combined company didn't decide to sell the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom acquired MCI last year for $40 billion, the
company began cutting costs immediately. By December, MCI WorldCom
announced that it would cut 1,850 workers, or 2.5 percent of the
payroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 170 of those jobs were in MCI's home territory of
Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland. WorldCom's cuts were
deeper in other markets, such as Dallas, where the company
eliminated 300 jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom also has been digesting huge amounts of real
estate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before closing the deal with MCI, WorldCom bought a giant tract
in northern Virginia with plans for a major corporate campus for
its Internet-access division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom owns 534 acres in Loudoun County and is building
1.3 million square feet of office space. The office park could
ultimately accommodate as much as 7.5 million square feet, said
Larry Rosenstrauch, the county's director of economic development.
That's nearly twice the size of Sprint's new campus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As its Loudoun County campus grows, MCI WorldCom has been
shifting some workers there and is exploring the possible sale of
MCI's longtime headquarters. The MCI campus is expected to have
4,500 workers by the end of the year, and ultimately could house
30,000 workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom pursued its suburban locale while passing on a
generous subsidy offer from Washington, D.C., to build a new $100
million headquarters office in the city. Richard Monteilh,
executive director of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, said
negotiations died soon after WorldCom officials took over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger came along and that's when things stopped,''
Monteilh said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But WorldCom never planned to pull up its Mississippi roots for
the Virginia suburbs. In fact, the MCI WorldCom in May moved into a
new 420,000-square-foot headquarters complex on 84 acres in
Clinton, Miss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's acquisition deals have tended to stall _ at least
temporarily _ the construction projects of potential merger
partners as the companies work out details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gardner, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Economic
Development, said MCI canceled a major expansion of a service
center near St. Louis after WorldCom announced its offer to buy
MCI. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, the combined MCI WorldCom announced that
it would build a $50 million expansion of its National Account
Service Center. The project is expected to create 1,300 jobs and
keep about 1,000 existing jobs in the St. Louis area, Gardner
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the merger, this project was seen as important
enough to complete,'' Gardner said. ``We see an analogy with
Sprint, that a project as significant as (the Overland Park campus)
would be seen as an opportunity that makes good business sense to
keep.'' &QL;

   MILAN, Italy _ This is a city that disguises itself well; it is
Marcello Mastroianni on the outside and Gidget underneath. No
matter how full the streets are with perfectly attired men cycling
to work, no matter how decorous the homes and offices, Milan is a
city whose people are capable of egregious transgressions of
urbanity.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday evening, on the second day of the spring 2000
collections, a photography exhibition called ``Beauty in Progress''
opened at a local gallery. Soon after the event started, there was
noise and commotion: someone important was apparently about to
arrive. Naomi Campbell!
</P>
<P>
   Although the American fashion editors inside simply wanted to
get out and move along, those who stayed for Ms. Campbell's
entrance witnessed their Italian counterparts screaming and
stumbling over one another in pure excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The giddiness was just a prelude to events two days later, at
the collection of Giorgio Armani, the man who has long stood for
the cool grown-up aspect of the Italian personality. Armani is now
showing in a new space, a sleekly converted Nestle factory he
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its layout and also perhaps because of the show's
late start, celebrities were paraded down the runway to their
seats, the chic masses already in their high chairs to behold them.
The crowd was not subdued. There were cheers for Tina Turner and
Sophia Loren and even more song and dance for Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to feel somewhat sorry for Glenn Close _ a woman
who would have found her way into an Armani suit even if the man
had never taken pencil to sketch pad. But as she entered, she was
ignored by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When the collection came through on the backs of approximately
75 models, you had to wonder how many of the looks were conceived
with Ms. Close and women like her _ Armani's mainstay _ in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Printed fabrics were to be the heart of the collection, Armani
had said at his showroom this week. There were ethereally beautiful
painted silk skirts and pretty, painted shantung cigarette pants.
But these were not clothes to project earnestness, either at the
Oscars or a stockholders' meeting. Jackets were typically short,
open, revealing. Pants were short-waisted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Armani has been incorporating more color into
his collections. No one can fault him for refusing to cling
eternally to beige, but his exuberance seemed too studied and
misguided this time out. There were tie-dye cashmeres, limes and
fuchsias set against black, Kandinsky-inspired prints paired with
sequins, or sequined minis over print skirts teamed with black
bras.
</P>
<P>
   On and on went the fuss. There was nothing spontaneous in these
final pieces, which is to say there wasn't all that much that felt
truly youthful, and surely, that was supposed to be the point of
the whole affair. After it ended, all streamed out to the former
factory's cleanly appointed anteroom to celebrate Armani's new
fragrance, which, by the way, is called Mania.
</P>
<P>
   Jil Sander managed a fine job of turning out a collection that
possessed a levity that was unforced. As always, her fabrics lure
you in closer and closer. She had culottes of sueded polyester
fleece, long-sleeve shirts of paper cotton, a double-face leather
wrap skirt. There were rayon-silk skirts with cascading folds in
front, even a few inside-out cotton prints.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Ms. Sander said she was inspired by the ``warm
weather in Hamburg,'' her hometown. It is Ms. Sander's personality,
high minded, confident, uneffusive, that has often led casual
observers to call her clothes ``intellectual,'' which happily isn't
what they're about. It would be hard to make that mistake with this
collection, in particular, which seems aimed at a woman who can
take quiet pleasure in life without the need of an psychotherapist
to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is a man in Milan who might want to let go of his need
to have everyone believe he is the Brainiest Man in Fashion, it is
Gianfranco Ferre. The invitation to his show came with a
coffee-table book in which he pays homage to himself.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the words, ``As everyone knows, that unabashed
and patient traveler, Alberto Moravia ... '' Is it stating the
obvious to say that his architectural clothes were equally
pretentious and silly? Lampshade dresses? Gold-painted breasts?
</P>
<P>
   Over at Genny, where Belgian Joseph Thimister is in charge,
there were exquisite skirts that achieved their goal of fluid
movement. There were airy black-ribbed skirts of papery silk and
lovely neutral chiffons. There was plenty to desire, even if the
show at times felt a bit somber because of lugubrious music. Also
included in the collection was a series of fluorescent clothes, but
they somehow lacked the sense of party-tonight-in-Los Feliz _
surely their only purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Taking flashy clothes a bit too seriously had other precedents
in Milan this week. Designer Alessandro Dell'Aqua, who a few
seasons ago sent out invitations on flesh-toned underwear, has
never been known for underplaying sexuality in his clothes. This
time, his frame of reference, like Tom Ford's at Gucci, was early
1980s disco.
</P>
<P>
   The scrunched leather patterned high-heel boots he showed had
fashion editors and buyers disturbingly titillated. Listening to
supremely tasteful women suggest they want to look like Heather
Locklear in ``Dynasty'' has the effect of hearing someone like
Daniel Boulud say he only eats Tater Tots at home. You sense it's a
lie. At any rate, you know you could never get away with that kind
of thing yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Narciso Rodriguez also immersed himself in the early Reagan
period, but his interpretation never let you forget that he is the
man who designed one of the world's best-known wedding dresses (for
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy). He worked in black and white, metallic,
gauze and sequins, but his lines were clean, more structured.
Rodriguez did not feel the need to sacrifice his larger vision of
how a woman should look to some notion of soigne vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   There were fresh ideas, largely free of retro references, in the
collection of Mila Schoen. The label has been here for quite some
time, but is now produced by a team of 12 designers, many of them
recent graduates of St. Martin's College of Art and Design in
London. Jackets, skirts and tops were cut economically in a manner
reminiscent of Geoffrey Beene. Seams had a purpose. Lines followed
the body's curves. There were bold geometric prints and
sophisticated flesh-tone beaded gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the audience suddenly lacked that bedraggled, midweek,
someone-save-me-with-another-espresso look. They were up, eager to
see what would come next. Even the models looked enthusiastic,
maybe because they finally didn't look as though their next stop in
Milan was a flight to Danceteria.

METS FALL FURTHER BACK AS BRAVES WIN IN 11 INNINGS, 4-3  
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through all the agony and angst of the last 10 days,
the New York Mets had not faced anything quite this gut-wrenching.
At no point in this brutal stretch had so much been riding on a
single outcome as in Thursday night's game with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But after coming back three times at Shea Stadium, the Mets were
beaten, 4-3, in 11 innings, and with the last weekend of the season
at hand, the Mets are two games behind in the National League
wild-card race with three to play.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets lose to Pittsburgh Friday night, and Houston and
Cincinnati win, the Mets will be eliminated just 12 days after
holding a four-game lead in the wild-card race. Even if the Mets
sweep the Pirates in three games this weekend, the Astros or the
Reds would have to lose twice for New York to force a one-game
playoff on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who cannot seem to make anything easy lately,
ratcheted up their madness meter a few notches Thursday night. They
extended a taut game with the Braves into extra innings, riding
through an early deficit, a disappointing effort from their
bullpen, a dramatic game-tying home run by Edgardo Alfonzo and a
brilliant two-inning relief effort by Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   But as if they were trying to desperately hold sand in their
hands, they watched the game slip through their fingers in the 11th
inning, bit by bit, until there was little more than dust left of
their season.
</P>
<P>
   With rookie Octavio Dotel on the mound in just his fifth relief
appearance, Brian Jordan opened the Braves' 11th with a triple over
Shawon Dunston's head in right field on a play in which Dunston
appeared to misplay the fly. Jordan scored on Ozzie Guillen's short
sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, who made the slightly off-line throw home,
kneeled in the grass after the run scored, as if acknowledging that
the Mets were terribly close to bowing out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets trailed by 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth because
their bullpen, so solid for so much of the season, had unraveled in
the top of the inning. Turk Wendell allowed a leadoff single to
Keith Lockhart. That brought Chipper Jones to the plate and
left-handed John Franco to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Franco had gone eight appearances without yielding a run, and
had allowed just two hits in his last six. Manager Bobby Valentine
had tried this trick once before, bringing in a left-hander to face
the switch-hitting Jones, who is thought to be better from the left
side. The last time the Mets tried it, Jones belted a home run to
win the first game of a series last week in Atlanta. This time he
hit a single that scored the tie-breaking run.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura cut off the throw from left, but did not
immediately look to second, so Jones advanced there. Ryan Klesko
followed with a single that put Jones on third and Jordan walked to
load the bases. Franco was replaced amid boos.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and none out, the Mets were on the brink
of losing almost any chance at the postseason with one swing. But
Pat Mahomes relieved and got Andruw Jones to ground into a double
play when Ventura stepped on third and Chipper Jones was caught in
a rundown between third and home. Guillen ended the threat with a
flyout.
</P>
<P>
   There were two out in the Mets' eighth when Alfonzo went to the
plate. He has been in a slump since his extraordinary 6-for-6,
three-homer performance in Houston more than a month ago. And he
was just 1 for 11 on this homestand. But reliever Mike Remlinger
sent a 2-1 slider to Alfonzo, who sent it into the left-field
bullpen. The score was tied, 3-3, 48,364 roared and the Mets lived
on.
</P>
<P>
   The managers battled with their closers in the ninth, Benitez
retiring the side to set the stage for the bottom of the ninth.
Manager Bobby Cox of the Braves put in his stopper, John Rocker,
who struck out Mike Piazza on a checked swing. An infuriated Piazza
argued the call with the home plate umpire, Phil Cuzzi, until
Valentine retrieved him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rocker struck out Ventura and Hamilton, forcing extra
innings.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Sixty howitzers boomed 50 shots each and
goose-stepping soldiers crossed Tiananmen Square Friday to hoist
the red and yellow flag to begin Communist China's salute to 50
years of phenomenal change.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of Young Pioneers filled the world's biggest public square
in a red and yellow formation spelling the Chinese characters for
``National Celebration'' as the 10 a.m. (local time) ceremony
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   Then President Jiang Zemin, wearing an updated, gray Mao suit,
headed off in a Red Flag limousine to inspect the 11,000 troops
lined up with the latest Chinese military hardware along the Avenue
of Perpetual Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello comrades,'' Jiang called out to the soldiers manning 400
tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello leader!'' they replied.
</P>
<P>
   The phalanx of military machines began rolling down the street
with a roar of motors and belch of cloudy exhaust. Slender white,
red-tipped missiles, multiple rocket launchers and anti-aircraft
guns followed the camouflage-green tanks in what state radio said
was the largest-scale military parade in New China's 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of civilian paraders and marching bands in a rainbow of
bright colors followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my whole life I have been waiting for this moment,'' said
Huang Erzun, 85, a leftist student in 1930s China who settled in
Taiwan and came back to celebrate the 50th birthday of the People's
Republic of China on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in the company of 25 groups of weapons, from tanks to
radars to the new ``East Wind 31'' intercontinental ballistic
missile, made up the first military parade through Tiananmen Square
in 15 years. Air force bombers, delta-winged intercepters and
attack helicopters made a screaming flyover of the square.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing access, permitted only to those with a red, numbered
invitation and laminated identity card, was so restricted that in
some prime viewing stands just 30 yards from the armored column
half the seats were empty.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in central Beijing had been immobilized one minute after
midnight as part of an iron-handed security lockdown. Tens of
thousands of police isolated the heart of the capital in a form of
martial law aimed at guaranteeing that no disruption _ or any speck
of spontaneity _ would sully the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 marchers and entertainers for an evening gala were
as carefully picked and placed as the 500,000 potted flowers stuck
all over the city in metal frames, shaped into huge boats, shooting
stars or gaily-colored columns.
</P>
<P>
   To assure none strayed from key nationalistic themes,
participants had a list of 50 approved slogans to shout, such as
the less-than-trenchant: ``Stress theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct!''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour parade hailed China's progress, with 91 floats
including replicas of a space rocket launch and a snowy peak in
Tibet, where mountaineers surrounded by rainbows planted China's
red flag with five yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   The parade swayed down the Avenue of Perpetual Peace, the
capital's biggest east-west boulevard, to be reviewed by President
Jiang near the entrance to the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   The procession was an eccentric combination of the dour
Stalinesque might of Moscow's Cold War parades in Red Square and
the pastel pageantry of Pasadena's New Year's Day Rose Bowl
parades.
</P>
<P>
   Central Beijing started shutting down at noon Thursday, when two
lines of troops carrying bull-horns swept across Tiananmen Square
to evict thousands of strolling Chinese and foreign tourists.
Bomb-sniffing German shepherd dogs followed.
</P>
<P>
   Then offices and shops along the parade route were searched,
locked and sealed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sidewalks closed around the Forbidden City Thursday,
gray-haired Du Zhiying, 70, was having his picture taken before the
ever-present portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motherland has prospered,'' said Du, who was in Tiananmen
Square the day 50 years ago when the late Great Helmsman Mao
declared the People's Republic of China into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Du came from Shanxi Province for the celebration, but the
lifelong party bureaucrat said he was afraid he wouldn't get within
sight of Friday's events. They were open only to officials and
invited guests, and he was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also tried to guarantee control by turning down
pollution, turning out itinerant workers and tuning off beepers and
mobile telephones that might interfere with military
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese live enormously better than they did 50, 20 or even 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Life was genuinely grim in 1949 when Mao stood atop the Gate of
Heavenly Peace to announce the meaning of his army's victory in a
vicious civil war. Hearts lifted with his proclamation of a new
era: ``We, the 475 million people of China, have now stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then a peasant family may have shared a single pair of
pants among 10 people who took turns going outside. Life expectancy
was 35 years, and education an extravagance for a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't change quickly. After a modest start into
industrialization, expanded education and agricultural renewal,
Mao's bizarre notions of continuing revolution sent China into one
chaotic frenzy after another.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Leap Forward. The Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stilted titles lay famine, smeared reputations and
tens of millions of deaths. Mao and his minions nearly wasted a
generation of youth sent not to school but to pound stones or dig
potatoes into the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the relative calm and bloom of prosperity
brought by subsequent leaders _ initiated with the reforms of the
late Deng Xiaoping _ the Chinese people have been forced to do
without free expression and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Economic gains have been remarkable since Deng's reform began in
1978. China has become the world's 11th largest trading power,
churning out a gross domestic product, or GDP, of $96 billion last
year after a decade of average growth rates surpassing 10 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy now is 71 years. Illiteracy is less than 15
percent, mostly among elderly and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stirrings of protest, targeting both political restrictions
and uneven economic distribution, have the communist leadership on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   To head off public dissent, especially in the anniversary
run-up, authorities have taken drastic steps.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16,000 migrant workers were expelled from Beijing, and
thousands more Chinese without proper papers were dumped in
detention centers. Beggars, peddlers and prostitutes were driven
from streets. Even Chinese tour groups were forbidden to enter the
capital for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt called ``operation strike hard'' produced
the arrests since summer of nearly 70,000 people officially
described as ``escaped'' or ``wanted'' criminals. Human rights
groups said democracy activists and religious leaders also have
been detained.
