CAYARD'S BOAT WINS TO CLOSE IN ON FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealan _ It remains to be seen whether America One
and the Prada Challenge will be the two syndicates in the America's
Cup challenger final, but it will be difficult for any future race
between them to match the spectacle of Tuesday's.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing downwind on the final leg, their two very expensive
yachts and experienced crews were within easy shouting distance of
each other, and both the America One skipper, Paul Cayard, and the
Prada tactician, Torben Grael, made sure they were heard.
</P>
<P>
   There were screams about unfair tactics, a flurry of protest
flags on both boats and the sort of close-quarter jibing duel one
rarely gets to see at this level of sailboat racing. But in the
end, America One had the last word, winning by 8 seconds in the
most emotional and exciting race of the challenger series so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a thrill,'' said Cayard, whose boat led by 1 minute 2
seconds at the first mark but was caught from behind by Prada just
before the final windward mark. ``On the one hand I'm happy we won,
and on the other hand I'm not happy because of the lead we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   What should also make Cayard happy is that his team is now
guaranteed of at least advancing to a sail-off for the two-boat
challenger final. With a 7-1 record and only two races remaining in
these semifinals, the worst Cayard can do is finish in a three-way
tie for first. One more victory will guarantee America One a spot
in final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels better today than yesterday,'' Cayard said. ``One
step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Stars and Stripes's crew were also feeling better
on Tuesday than on Monday. After losing one precious point to a
jury decision and losing to Prada on the water on Monday after a
horrific start, Dennis Conner's team managed to keep its hopes
afloat with a narrow 19-second victory over Le Defi Francais.
</P>
<P>
   Though the French already have been eliminated from contention,
they sailed aggressively throughout the afternoon in the relatively
light winds _ 10 to 12 knots in the final half of the race _ that
favor their narrow boat and do not favor the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much in terms of speed,'' said the Stars and Stripes
navigator, Peter Isler. ``We had to sail pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And after they rounded the final windward mark with a fairly
comfortable 50-second lead, Isler and his fellow crew members
looked back and felt a chill go through them when they saw Prada
outwit Cayard and take the lead for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only 10 minutes ahead of them so we could see it all
hapening,'' Isler said. ''Our hearts were broken for a minute, but
we needed a little help from our friends today and we ended up
getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes is now in a tie for third place with the
Nippon Challenge, which defeated America True by 1 minute 20
seconds on Tuesday. Both Stars and Stripes and Nippon have four
points; Prada has five. But the Japanese and Italians only have two
races remaining, while the Americans have three because they had a
race postponed earlier in the round so they could make repairs to
their boat.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stars and Stripes's remaining races is against America
One. The other two are against America True, which is now
eliminated mathematically from contention but which has beaten
Stars and Stripes in all three previous races.
</P>
<P>
   Prada faces Le Defi Francais and Nippon, which has reluctantly
decided not to appeal the international jury's decision that
stripped a point from Stars and Stripes for using an illegal rudder
against the Japanese but did not award a point to Nippon.
</P>
<P>
   There would be protest flags galore on the final leg of the race
between Prada and America One: a total of nine in all as Cayard's
crew desperately tried to find a way to pass the Italians. Prada
was the first to be penalized for not letting America One pursue
its course when it had the right of way when the boats were
overlapped. The Italians then jibed and America One responded,
managing to get past but earning a penalty in the process for not
staying clear.
</P>
<P>
   With the penalties canceling each other out, it became a
straight downwind sprint to the finish and America One got there
first by slightly less than a boat length.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at George W.
Bush's campaign headquarters hangs an editorial cartoon from a
local newspaper that pretty much says it all.
</P>
<P>
   The multipanel strip shows Bush, a would-be president, and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over
ownership of a narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim.
Each grows petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   He hollers for Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Readers outside Texas might not understand the reference, but in
a few months they probably will. If Bush lopes to the Republican
nomination as decisively as many of his advisers and supporters
believe he can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's
boundaries as a political mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush limps or stumbles? That is not a possibility Rove is
willing to entertain, and the business of creating ample insurance
against it is what keeps a cell phone affixed to his ear, campaign
aides lined up patiently at his office door and a sometimes frantic
edge in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked so hard in my life,'' he said recently
during a rare quiet moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, a longtime political operative in Texas, where many
Republicans attribute their current domination of the political
scene to his influence, is Bush's chief strategist. And while he
officially has no more power or influence than Bush's other top
advisers, campaign aides say Rove is first among equals. Bush
readily tagged him as the sire of the campaign's shape, pacing and
densely staffed organizations in states with early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl gets credit for being the architect of it,'' Bush said in
an interview, ``and he should.''
</P>
<P>
   But, tellingly, Bush lavished more effusive praise on Rove for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most about Karl is that he cares about me as
a person,'' Bush said. ``He's got a single agenda when it comes to
my campaigns, and that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rove, who sold an extremely profitable consulting
business, at Bush's request, typifies the devotion that Bush
expects and receives from his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The three at the heart of the operation _ Rove; Joe Allbaugh,
the campaign manager, and Karen Hughes, the communications director
_ have all worked with Bush in Texas since his first, successful
race for governor in 1994, and they are known around the state as
the ``iron triangle'' for their proximity to, and protectiveness
of, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh, with his beefy build and Marine-style buzz cut,
disciplines Bush's staff and watches over the purse strings with a
drill sergeant's intensity. Ms. Hughes, her eyes ablaze with true
belief, hangs on Bush's words, and she laughs the loudest whenever
he cracks a joke.
</P>
<P>
   And Rove, well, he has his fingers in everything, and everything
has his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   This tight-lipped, tightly bound trio and the ethos of loyalty
they represent have helped the Bush campaign roar down the tracks
without many of the leaks, internal dissents, power grabs and
preening that frequently derail candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them has ever attempted anything so big before, and
their profound, palpable affection for Bush raises questions about
whether they see him clearly and dispassionately enough to
recognize problems before they become crises or to give him the
advice he needs for a contest with dramatically raised stakes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, political consultants in Texas said that Bush's
cautious adherence to scripted remarks all last year _ and his
seeming avoidance of some controversial issues _ were telltale
attributes of a Rove-counseled candidacy and holdovers from Bush's
campaigns for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while those designs helped him in his statewide races, they
did him little good in his early debates, as he stumbled over
questions about the books he had read or the nation's relationship
to China. Before long, some Republican officials were questioning
his abilities as a candidate and Bush himself was battling an image
as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is Karl's trademark, it's message discipline, and
he gets everybody sharing that discipline,'' said Chuck McDonald, a
Democratic consultant in Austin who worked for Gov. Ann Richards
when she lost her 1994 re-election bid to Bush. ``They're going to
do things the way they laid out their game plan, and that's not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a presidential campaign, McDonald added, ``It seems to me
that you have to throw some passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove and other aides also watched Bush's lead in New Hampshire
evaporate as they paid less attention to the state than did his
chief Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Rove said that
it was not purely a matter of choice, because Bush's status as the
front-runner compelled him to campaign everywhere, while McCain
could pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Bush supporters in New Hampshire charged Rove and
others with overconfidence, and Bush is now in New Hampshire more
often than before.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Rove has seemingly made few mistakes. McDonald and
other consultants noted that when Rove set up shop in Austin two
decades ago, Democrats held the lion's share of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans do, ``and they're all Karl's candidates,''
McDonald said, adding: ``I admire him, because it's awfully lonely
to be a Republican consultant when there are no Republican
officeholders. That's how it started for him, and that's how it is
for Democratic consultants now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's ties to the Bush family go back even further. In the
early 1970s, when Rove was a student active with the College
Republicans, he became friendly with another rising political
operative, Lee Atwater, who went on to serve as the principal
strategist for the successful 1988 presidential bid of Bush's
father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Atwater was the southern coordinator for Rove's
campaign for chairman of the College Republicans in 1973. Rove won.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rove came under investigation by the Republican National
Committee after accusations that he had been supervising seminars
for college students on how to use ``dirty tricks'' in campaigns.
After the committee exonerated him, its chairman at the time,
Bush's father, gave Rove a job as his special assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Rove met George W. Bush, who swept
into Washington on a break from business school at Harvard
University. Rove was entrusted with giving Bush the keys to the
family car.
</P>
<P>
   Of that first encounter with Bush, Rove said that he recalled
``huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket,
wonderful smile, just charisma _ you know, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rove talks about Bush, he radiates a regard for him that
goes beyond professional obligation or selfish investment in Bush's
fortune. It is more like a crush, both platonic and political, and
it underscores the oddness of this particular couple: the pale,
intense, bookish Rove and the ruddy, easygoing, folksy Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, I couldn't believe how good a candidate he was,'' Rove
said. ``Then, once he got into office, it just blew my mind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That mind, by all accounts and evidence, is a staggeringly
active one, stoked constantly by the thousands of thick volumes of
prose (almost all of it nonfiction) that he owns. These books are
carefully organized in his home study: political philosophy in one
section, the musings of Thomas Jefferson in another, the collected
works of Winston Churchill nearby. The walls around them are
adorned with vintage photographs and portraits of American
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is so interested in history that he literally lives in it,
although that was not easy to arrange: He and his second wife,
Darby, a graphic artist, found the late 19th-century Texas
farmhouse of their dreams on a rural road far from Austin and had
it split into three pieces so that it could be moved 100 miles and
reassembled on a hill outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, 49, grew up in various states along the Rocky Mountains,
where his father's career as a geologist took the family. He
attended the University of Utah and George Mason University in
Virginia, but never received a college degree; he said he was too
distracted by, and preoccupied with, the political work he was
doing on the side.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, in an early indication of his killer instincts, Rove
got hold of some stationery with a Democratic candidate's
letterhead on it, forged an invitation promising ``free food, girls
and a good time'' at the candidate's headquarters and distributed
hundreds of the invitations to poor and homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that such mischief is behind him, but some political
peers said that a ruthless competitive spirit is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who gets in the way of his ambitions for the governor
gets run off,'' said Tom Pauken, a former chairman of the
Republican Party in Texas. ``And if you're not with Karl 100
percent, you're an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald put it more diplomatically. ``Karl plays as fair as
anybody else in politics,'' he said, ``but he plays for keeps. I
always knew where I stood with Karl. I knew he was trying to kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's peers say that he is a master at creating a sense of
momentum, and they credit him with orchestrating the thick parade
of Republican luminaries to the governor's mansion in Austin and
the seemingly endless rollout of endorsements while Bush stayed off
the campaign trail last winter and spring, creating a keen sense of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, some of it was Bush's salesmanship,'' said Charles
Black, a Republican strategist in Washington. But, Black said,
``Karl's ability to use Austin as a base and organize the country
from there was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has overseen the Bush campaign's effort in every
early-primary state to identify _ by phone, home visits and other
means _ potential supporters of Bush, and to try to ascertain that
Bush has the necessary votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   That is a vestige of Rove's extensive, earlier work in
direct-mail consulting. It is also where a good chunk of Bush's
financial war chest has gone, and it could ultimately prove more
critical to victory than the dazzling aspects of campaigning that
attract public notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl's a meticulous planner,'' said Stuart Stevens, one of the
Bush campaign's principal media advisers. Stevens remembered
watching Rove, in a coffeehouse in Austin in April, map out the
Bush effort for the rest of the year on the only kind of paper
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five napkins later, you had the structure of an entire
presidential campaign,'' Stevens said. ``Then Karl just left. I
went back to get the napkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has put boundless energy and thought into Bush's political
ascent _ at Rove's consulting firm there was always a special, red
phone for Bush's incoming calls _ and he has sacrificed for it.
</P>
<P>
   He once had a lucrative consulting contract with the tobacco
industry, but he gave it up when it became an embarrassing
political situation for the Texas governor. He was once his own
boss, with his own eponymous business, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   And after a few episodes in which he seemed to upstage and upset
Bush, he learned to bury his ego, to belittle his own
contributions. Much as Ms. Hughes kept her name off the cover of
the autobiography of Bush that she wrote, Rove spent considerable
time during interviews deferring to Bush as the real political
genius, the leader whose insights are the most vital, whose
interests can never be promoted too zealously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my friend,'' Rove said. ``He's my friend, and I love
him.''

THREE DEAD AMONG 18 STOWAWAYS FOUND AFTER TRANS-PACIFIC VOYAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three Chinese stowaways smuggled aboard a cargo ship
in a cramped container with 15 others were found dead Monday after
a three-week voyage across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just horrible,'' said Bob Coleman, acting director of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the prices migrants have paid for illegal passage
to the United States have been high in terms of dollars,'' Coleman
said, ``but in a situation like this, where lives are lost, the
cost is unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman and two men were dead, said Irene Mortensen, a
spokeswoman for the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Harborview Medical Center here said it appeared the
18 stowaways had been in the container for as long as three weeks
with little water and less food. The vessel left Hong Kong on Dec.
27, according to a computerized tracking system by NYK, a Japanese
shipping firm.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents, who had been tipped off that a ship was carrying
Chinese stowaways, were waiting Monday afternoon as the NYK Cape
May arrived at Terminal 18 on Harbor Island here.
</P>
<P>
   The ship had 40-foot containers stacked high on its deck.
Longshoremen had to remove 35 containers before reaching the one
containing the 18 stowaways, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents discovered the soft-top container in the ship's hold
about 3:45 p.m. Three of the 18 died before the vessel arrived,
Mortensen said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Monday night how long the three had been dead
or how they had died, although others who made the voyage said the
three had been dead between three and seven days, according to the
INS.
</P>
<P>
   They are are the first known deaths in 13 documented cases of
Chinese immigrants being smuggled in containers to West Coast
ports. The first known incident occurred in February 1999 in Long
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials had long worried that such deaths would
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said that we were concerned about this and the
risks it posed for these people,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The container had holes in it, as if those inside had been
trying to tear their way out, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen said the surviving 15 stowaways were in poor health.
Aid cars were called for, and a physician's assistant visited the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a group of people so disoriented and so
distraught as they were when we found them,'' Coleman said. ``They
were just ashen. We just knew immediately how serious it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 15 Chinese men shuffled from ambulances into
Harborview Medical Center; others needed wheelchairs. Doctors gave
them intravenous fluids and vitamins for dehydration and
malnourishment, and testing them to see what kind of extended care
they might require.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't appear traumatized, but they've had no food or
water,'' hospital spokesman Larry Zalin said. The men told doctors,
through hospital interpreters who spoke a Mandarin dialect of
Chinese, that they had been on the ship for three weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten were admitted to the hospital, a nursing supervisor said
Monday night. Two were in serious condition and the others were in
satisfactory condition. One man was vomiting blood.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining stowaways were turned over to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco declined to
comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hong Kong, police and other government officials are
meeting with shipping lines to improve efforts to stop human
smuggling, said Subrina Chow, acting director of the Hong Kong
Trade and Economic Office in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's discovery marked the sixth time in the last eight days
that immigration agents have found stowaways aboard container ships
that arrived at West Coast ports. In all, the INS has found 87
illegal aliens who crossed the Pacific on six different ships since
Jan. 2. In one Seattle case, three men who authorities suspect are
smugglers were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The three alleged smugglers, all Chinese nationals, face federal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to face a preliminary hearing in U.S. District
Court here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The NYK Cape May arrived in Seattle on Monday afternoon after
stops in China, Hong Kong and South Korea, according to the Port of
Seattle. It arrived with containers stacked several layers high on
its decks.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen said the INS had information that illegal aliens might
have been smuggled aboard the Cape May.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation is believed to have links to Hong Kong,
where the containers and their human cargo are typically loaded. In
at least three ocassions, investigators have traced the containers
to the same firm, the Lap Kei Trading Co. of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been smuggled aboard the ships of several lines,
including NYK.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the 18 stowaways aboard the NYK Cape May may have
been smuggled aboard in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   This week, police investigators from Hong Kong are in Seattle
helping local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the stowaways and the smugglers are part
of a complicated criminal network stretching from China to New York
City. Smugglers, known as ``snakeheads,'' recruit immigrants to be
taken illegally to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The stowaways agree to pay $40,000, $50,000 or more to get to
the United States. The price is paid off after the voyage _ often
by the illegal immigrants working in what authorities call a form
of indentured servitude.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants typically end up in New York City, where the
smuggling rings have a center of operation.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the smuggling rings are believed to center around
Fujian province, a coastal region with a long history of sending
immigrants around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian also has had substantial foreign investment and a
resulting strong economy. That has allowed people there to raise a
down payment to give to smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Tracy Johnson, Robert L. Jamieson Jr. and Mike
Barber contributed to this report.

EXCERPTS FROM REPUBLICAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-DEBATE) 
(sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a Republican presidential debate on
Monday night, involving Gary L. Bauer, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by The New York Times. The
debate was at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Senator McCain, you've attacked Governor Bush's tax plan. You
have said that 60 percent of his tax cut will go to the very
wealthy among us. On ``Meet the Press'' yesterday, . . . your chief
supporter, Representative Lindsey Graham, agreed that you are
playing a class warfare game, that you are pitting rich against
poor, something the Republican Party does not like to do. Do you
acknowledge that is what you're doing? Are you going to rethink
your strategy, or are you going to continue this line of attack?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I have never engaged in class warfare. I am very much in
favor of tax cumiddle-income and lower-income Americans. I'm
deeply concerned about a kind of class warfare that's going on
right now. It's unfortunate. There's a growing gap between the
have's and have-not's in America, and that gap is growing and it's
unfortunately divided up along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very strongly that we ought to have middle-income and
lower-income taxes, and we'll be getting into it, I'm sure, later
on in this program. Mine are basically comparable to Governor
Bush's, in some cases far better. But I'm not sure we need to give
two-thirds of that tax cut, of that money, to the wealthiest 10
percent of America. And that's what Tax Notes, a well-respected tax
journalist says is the case this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, there's a fundamental difference here. I
believe we must save Social Security, we must pay down the debt, we
have to make investment in Medicare. For us to put all of the tax
cuts _ all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think, is not a
conservative effort. I think it's a mistake. I think we should put
that money into allowing Americans to be sure that their Social
Security system will be there when they retire . . .
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: He was talking about my plan and I'd like to _
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have 30 seconds for rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Thank you. I believe everybody ought to get a tax cut. I
believe it's important to cut the top rates. I think it's important
to drop the 39.6 to 33 percent. I also know it's important to make
sure people who are on the outskirts of poverty get a tax cut as
well. And my plan does both. I have a plan that takes $2 trillion
over the next 10 years and dedicates it to Social Security. My plan
has been called risky by voices out of Washington. In my judgment,
what's risky is to leave a lot of unspent money in Washington,
because guess what's going to happen: It's going to be spent on
bigger federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Senator McCain, a rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Sure. Two quick points. Your tax plan over the next five
years not only spends all of the surplus, it spends $20 billion in
addition to that. I'm sure we'll have that figured out.
</P>
<P>
   But this idea that somehow if the money is left in order to
salvage the Social Security for America, and Medicare and the debt,
that _ you don't understand the role of the president of the United
States. The president of the United States will veto bills, will
veto bills that spend too much. This present president is vetoing
bills that don't spend enough and are forcing Congress to spend
more. I'll veto bills that force Congress to spend less. That's
what being president of the United States is all about. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. Forbes, you have the first question. You may ask any of
your five opponents a question.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: I'll end your tension and mystery as to who I'm going to
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can see that bull's-eye from here.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: I'm going to surprise you. It's not on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a dream ride for a moment and let's pretend, George,
that you get the nomination in August in Philadelphia, for the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I accept the premise.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: Now, now, glad you didn't hedge on that. Now, would you
make three pledges tonight? One, will you pledge to preserve the
Ronald Reagan plank on life in the Republican platform? Two, will
you finally state unequivocally that you'll chose only pro-life
judges? And third, will you vow to pick a pro-life running mate?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: That's the exact same question Mr. Bauer asked me during
the last couple of debates.
</P>
<P>
   BAUER: Four times. Not that anybody's counting.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Four times, right.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: And the answer's been like that tax pledge. It hasn't
been answered.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Yeah, I'll answer it. I'm going to pick a vice president
who can be the president. I'll pick judges who strictly interpret
the Constitution and not use the bench as a legislative _ way to
legislate. And I will work to keep the Republican Party pro-life.
That's what I'm going to do, Mr. Forbes, and I appreciate your
assumption about me being the party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. Forbes are you satisfied with that answer?
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: No, it's a typical hedge. Where's the pledge? Not a
hedge, but a pledge on the running mate, a pledge on judges, a
pledge on the platform. Vagaries aren't going to work. We need
something specific.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I don't know how I can be more clear. . . .
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: I'm listening, George.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, you're interrupting. I will have a vice president who
can become the president. That's the test, Steve. I will have a
vice president that agrees with my policy. I'm going to have a vice
president that likes me.

<P>
   For the past 2,000 years, millennial visionaries have
periodically forecast the arrival of ten-horned beasts and lakes of
fire and brimstone. On the eve of this millennium, the
end-of-the-world brigade foresaw doom because some computer
software confused 2000 with 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this vision has melted in the dawn, leaving many people
wondering whether the gurus who prophesied this secular apocalypse
were just as unreliable as the mystical millenarians of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the absence of bug-induced problems has been
remarkable. There were no falling airplanes, no exploding power
stations, no rogue missiles. Those horrors were always the stuff of
myth.
</P>
<P>
   But so sparse were tales of disaster that journalists were
driven to reporting on malfunctions in the breath-testing machines
used on drunken motorists by the Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
   More problems may emerge in the coming weeks. Overall, though,
Y2K has turned out to be Y2OK.
</P>
<P>
   One partial explanation is that the huge effort lavished on
bug-squashing has worked. The United States, according to a
Commerce Department estimate, spent about $100 billion on the
problem; the rest of the world probably spent about the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are far smaller than some of the more exotic
figures trailed a few years ago, but they are still substantial.
Yet even the countries that had begun work late and done little _
southern Europe, Russia, much of Asia _ had a trouble-free new
year.
</P>
<P>
   So was the money wasted? Simply comparing who spent what
provides no answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy reliance on information technology is confined to a
relatively small group of countries, most of which began work early
on solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are more likely to use IT which is relatively
new or off-the-shelf (and so easy to fix): it was software which
had been customized by people who had long since retired, used on
old systems, that gave most problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an unprecedented amount of information on potential
problems and solutions was shared within industries such as
finance, aviation and communications. As a result, countries and
organizations that came late to the problem were able to hitch a
free ride on the experience of those that had begun first.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded systems _ fragments of software burned on to computer
chips _ once seemed likely to cause special chaos, given that
nobody knew how many of them took account of time; that fear had
gone in the countries that were first off the mark before most of
the laggards realized they were supposed to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that late starters did not suffer a computerized
comeuppance does not mean that those who took the bug seriously
were wasting time and money. The wastrels were those who did too
much: who failed to differentiate between the big risks and the
unimportant ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible risk management meant fixing the showstoppers, not
fixing everything. That distinction was frequently lost on
politicians, who wanted to avoid blame for inaction, and ignored by
IT consultants, who found bug-squashing a handy source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the bug, many organizations have thought hard about
their computer systems for the first time. They have cleared out
old code, made inventories and invested in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The work may not justify the cost: some of it might eventually
have been done anyway; and some might be a worse use of scarce
resources than devising new products. But at least there will be
some gain.
</P>
<P>
   A further legacy may be a wiser approach to technological
scares. The bug is merely the most prominent in a succession of
computer frights about viruses and sensitive dates. Such scares
have invariably faded.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the correct approach is to treat them like threats to
public health _ indeed, computer technology is now so ubiquitous
that it is as important as safe drinking water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   People need to take sensible precautions, but not to panic. If
squashing the bug ends the apocalyptic approach to technology, it
will bring a happy start to the new year. &QL;

WORDS.)  
  
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``a'' domestic/general news and ``k'' commentary news files.)  
  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia needs a strong leader, able to get laws passed and
obeyed, and institutions built, rebuilt or cleansed of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, its new president, seems a strong, determined
man, supported since parliamentary elections in December by a
fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing a fine chance of
being elected as president in the popular vote that is now due on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin is just what the Russian doctor ordered? Not so fast.
Before jumping to that conclusion, it is as well to review what is
known about this man and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a secretive, clannish place, Putin's
background is fairly clear but that still does not make him
well-known. The trouble is that the few facts that are available
reveal little about his political inclinations or his ideas about
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became prime minister just over four months ago, and
especially since becoming president last week, he has made sure to
offer reassuring noises to all the appropriate constituencies: to
sound democratic to democrats, reform-minded to reformers, tough to
tough-guys, reasonably western to reasonable westerners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what he says that matters. It is what he does. And
most of the significant things that he has done, both in his short
career as a political leader and in his longer career as a spy,
have been scary.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that longer career that the worries begin. In any
country, it would be hard to imagine the former head of the
domestic counterintelligence service becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush may have been head of America's CIA, but that was a
political appointment and he was not a career spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, you might argue, everyone who is anyone has a dodgy
background of some sort, given seven decades of communism. And in
lawless Russia, to have the trust of the secret police and the army
will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But a more sinister interpretation is just as
plausible. For much of this year, the role and influence of the
secret police and the army have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated by Russia's failed war in Chechnya in 1994-96,
derided around the globe for years as a clapped out bunch of
incompetents, the Russian army has long been looking for a way to
restore its pride and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NATO offensive in Kosovo left Russia looking both
unprepared and fourth-rate, apparently incapable of defending
interests or standing by allies. This was an exaggeration, but one
the security services and the military appear to have exploited to
begin their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the incursion by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Dagestan in the summer came a series of deadly bomb explosions in
Moscow and other Russian cities. This was the beginning, remember,
of Putin's rise to power and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   No clear evidence has yet been found for who was responsible for
those bombs, and no one has claimed responsibility. Chechen rebels,
which include some pretty nasty characters, may well have been the
culprits. But, in the absence of evidence, other candidates should
also be kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the very service that Putin used to head, once
the core of the KGB and now called the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that it laid the bombs, either. Yet given
the huge benefits that he, and the security forces in general, have
gained from those tragedies it would be foolish to rule that
thought out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this possibility needs to be weighed in
any assessment of what a long-term President Putin might be like.
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, the manner of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation was also ominous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that it was long overdue; Yeltsin would have
done his country a service by standing down at least two years ago.
But there is also a lot of doubt over whether he really wanted to
stand down even six months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to protect him and his family from prosecution for
corruption, struck with a powerful prospect in the forthcoming
elections, may be explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look terribly voluntary, and despite gestures of
change in the Kremlin (such as the ostentatious sidelining of
Yeltsin's daughter) the signs are that the same court of business
oligarchs and security toughs will be running things in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was, at least in his last years, their puppet. Which end
of the strings Putin holds remains to be seen. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, better possibilities. Out of the
Putin-strengthening evil of the Chechen war could come
institution-building, rule-of-law-enforcing, enterprise-creating
good.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin may indeed believe, as he says he does, in an
open society, with free speech, democratic liberties and pro-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to crush the Chechen rebels may, in due course, be
tempered by a realpolitik desire to stay on reasonable terms with
the Islamic world. His desire to stand up for Russia against the
West may be tempered by a realpolitik desire to keep open Russia's
access to foreign money and to avoid outright confrontations with
America. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that outsiders and Russians alike should give
President Putin the benefit of the doubt. They should keep an open
mind, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the sobering truth is that the facts _ such
as they are, given that he is a former spymaster _ lean more
towards doubt than benefit. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia needs a strong leader, able to get laws passed and
obeyed, and institutions built, rebuilt or cleansed of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, its new president, seems a strong, determined
man, supported since parliamentary elections in December by a
fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing a fine chance of
being elected as president in the popular vote that is now due on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin is just what the Russian doctor ordered? Not so fast.
Before jumping to that conclusion, it is as well to review what is
known about this man and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a secretive, clannish place, Putin's
background is fairly clear but that still does not make him
well-known. The trouble is that the few facts that are available
reveal little about his political inclinations or his ideas about
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became prime minister just over four months ago, and
especially since becoming president last week, he has made sure to
offer reassuring noises to all the appropriate constituencies: to
sound democratic to democrats, reform-minded to reformers, tough to
tough-guys, reasonably western to reasonable westerners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what he says that matters. It is what he does. And
most of the significant things that he has done, both in his short
career as a political leader and in his longer career as a spy,
have been scary.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that longer career that the worries begin. In any
country, it would be hard to imagine the former head of the
domestic counterintelligence service becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush may have been head of America's CIA, but that was a
political appointment and he was not a career spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, you might argue, everyone who is anyone has a dodgy
background of some sort, given seven decades of communism. And in
lawless Russia, to have the trust of the secret police and the army
will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But a more sinister interpretation is just as
plausible. For much of this year, the role and influence of the
secret police and the army have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated by Russia's failed war in Chechnya in 1994-96,
derided around the globe for years as a clapped out bunch of
incompetents, the Russian army has long been looking for a way to
restore its pride and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NATO offensive in Kosovo left looking both
unprepared and fourth-rate, apparently incapable of defending
interests or standing by allies. This was an exaggeration, but one
the security services and the military appear to have exploited to
begin their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the incursion by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Dagestan in the summer came a series of deadly bomb explosions in
Moscow and other Russian cities. This was the beginning, remember,
of Putin's rise to power and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   No clear evidence has yet been found for who was responsible for
those bombs, and no one has claimed responsibility. Chechen rebels,
which include some pretty nasty characters, may well have been the
culprits. But, in the absence of evidence, other candidates should
also be kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the very service that Putin used to head, once
the core of the KGB and now called the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that it laid the bombs, either. Yet given
the huge benefits that he, and the security forces in general, have
gained from those tragedies it would be foolish to rule that
thought out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this possibility needs to be weighed in
any assessment of what a long-term President Putin might be like.
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, the manner of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation was also ominous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that it was long overdue; Yeltsin would have
done his country a service by standing down at least two years ago.
But there is also a lot of doubt over whether he really wanted to
stand down even six months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to protect him and his family from prosecution for
corruption, struck with a powerful prospect in the forthcoming
elections, may be explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look terribly voluntary, and despite gestures of
change in the Kremlin (such as the ostentatious sidelining of
Yeltsin's daughter) the signs are that the same court of business
oligarchs and security toughs will be running things in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was, at least in his last years, their puppet. Which end
of the strings Putin holds remains to be seen. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, better possibilities. Out of the
Putin-strengthening evil of the Chechen war could come
institution-building, rule-of-law-enforcing, enterprise-creating
good.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin may indeed believe, as he says he does, in an
open society, with free speech, democratic liberties and pro-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to crush the Chechen rebels may, in due course, be
tempered by a realpolitik desire to stay on reasonable terms with
the Islamic world. His desire to stand up for Russia against the
West may be tempered by a realpolitik desire to keep open Russia's
access to foreign money and to avoid outright confrontations with
America. &QL;

<P>
   All this suggests that outsiders and Russians alike should give
President Putin the benefit of the doubt. They should keep an open
mind, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the sobering truth is that the facts _ such
as they are, given that he is a former spymaster _ lean more
towards doubt than benefit. &QL;

<P>
   ``The greatest central banker in the history of the world.''
That is Phil Gramm's judgment on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Gramm, a senator from Texas, is chairman of the
committee which will soon confirm Greenspan's reappointment as Fed
chairman for a fourth four-year term, one can assume that he will
not face an unduly rough ride in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's view hardly counts as hyperbole these days. In 1998, the
New Republic ran an article describing how brokers at one New York
investment house had set up a little shrine to Greenspan in their
office; traders were said to pop in there for guidance and
inspiration whenever the action on Wall Street got too frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true that this story was entirely made up and the
author has been sacked. But the striking thing about it was how few
people realized it was fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This week Greenspan's cult status helped him gain the expected
presidential nomination yet again. Imagine any other bureaucrat of
influence being reappointed in the dog days of one presidency for a
term that runs for three-quarters of the next term.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton can act in the full confidence that
everyone with any chance of becoming president is competing to show
how much they love the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain won the contest by saying that if he were president,
and Greenspan died, he would prop him up at his desk, put dark
glasses on him and reappoint the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's cult status does not come out of nowhere. It has
been hard-earned over a dozen years. He has proved adept at dealing
with crises, such as the stock market crash of 1987 and the Asian
meltdown of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   He won his own anti-inflation spurs by hiking interest rates in
1988-89 and again, preemptively, in 1994-95, courting unpopularity
with politicians but reinforcing the Fed's independence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently and controversially, he has reinforced his cult
status by arguing that technological change may be increasing
American productivity, making it possible to run the economy at a
higher rate of growth without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On several earlier occasions, Greenspan's judgment, criticized
at the time, proved sound in retrospect. More than that, as time
has gone on, his personal credibility has contributed to the
orderly calming of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' confidence in him made them willing to take on trust
that 1998's loosening was necessary and sufficient to prevent a
global meltdown, though this was by no means self-evident at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   So the cult has its advantages. But it has three big drawbacks
as well. The first, of course, is that when the object of worship
does make a mistake, the error is magnified hugely. No one knows
whether this is happening now, but the risk is plain.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Greenspan is deemed the patron saint of
America's ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about whether there really is
such an animal (The Economist is at best only a half-believer), and
the hard evidence remains sketchy. But what is certain is that if
there isn't, any future correction will be all the more severe. &QL;

<P>
   A comparison with Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in the
1980s is worrying. Like Greenspan, the long-serving Nigel Lawson
was a trained economist held in awe by many in his field and with
strong, even overbearing influence in the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely credited with creating a British ``economic
miracle.'' But this mattered not one jot when his policies came
unstuck in a welter of asset-price inflation and slumping personal
savings. Britain suffered the consequences for years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more immediately, the personalization of monetary
policy creates its own form of moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are so confident of Greenspan's magic touch that they
may well be bidding up equity prices in the belief that he will
bail them out if things start going wrong. Inadvertently,
therefore, there may be a Greenspan bubble in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   It can reasonably be objected that this has more to do with the
sheep-like attitudes of Greenspan's followers as the Delphic
utterances of the Oracle himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he is at least partly at fault for giving the impression
that he will loosen monetary policy whenever Wall Street plummets
(as in 1987 and 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, whether you blame the High Priest or the Temple
prostitutes, the real danger lies in cultism itself.
</P>
<P>
   Third, what happens when the Oracle retires or goes into the
wilderness? If the credibility of your monetary policy is bound up
in one individual, you face an obvious risk when he or she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that risk proved minimal in 1987 when Paul Volcker,
Greenspan's respected predecessor, stepped down. But to expect
lightning to strike twice is to stretch not only the law of
averages but also the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious replacement with even half Greenspan's
status in the markets (unless perhaps Robert Rubin, the former
treasury secretary, were to want the job).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of a successor is contributing both to
Greenspan's influence and to the ease of his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution to the dangers of cultism: embody in
institutional form some of the personal credibility the chairman
himself now has.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many central banks, the Fed's workings are murky.
The minutes of one Fed meeting appear only after the next is over.
The body has relatively wide powers of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds further to Greenspan's status as a market
magician. Giving the Fed clearer goals _ most obviously a formal
inflation target _ and requiring greater transparency about how
these are being achieved would limit his personal influence.
</P>
<P>
   In America now, that would hardly be regarded as a blessing. But
if you look past Greenspan's formidable reputation and ask whether
the United States has the best central bank in the world, as
opposed to the best central banker, the answer must be no. Now is
as good a time as any to do something about that. &QL;

   ``The greatest central banker in the history of the world.''
That is Phil Gramm's judgment on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Gramm, a senator from Texas, is chairman of the
committee which will soon confirm Greenspan's reappointment as Fed
chairman for a fourth four-year term, one can assume that he will
not face an unduly rough ride in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's view hardly counts as hyperbole these days. In 1998, the
New Republic ran an article describing how brokers at one New York
investment house had set up a little shrine to Greenspan in their
office; traders were said to pop in there for guidance and
inspiration whenever the action on Wall Street got too frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true that this story was entirely made up and the
author has been sacked. But the striking thing about it was how few
people realized it was fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This week Greenspan's cult status helped him gain the expected
presidential nomination yet again. Imagine any other bureaucrat of
influence being reappointed in the dog days of one presidency for a
term that runs for three-quarters of the next term.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton can act in the full confidence that
everyone with any chance of becoming president is competing to show
how much they love the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain won the contest by saying that if he were president,
and Greenspan died, he would prop him up at his desk, put dark
glasses on him and reappoint the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's cult status does not come out of nowhere. It has
been hard-earned over a dozen years. He has proved adept at dealing
with crises, such as the stock market crash of 1987 and the Asian
meltdown of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   He won his own anti-inflation spurs by hiking interest rates in
1988-89 and again, preemptively, in 1994-95, courting unpopularity
with politicians but reinforcing the Fed's independence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently and controversially, he has reinforced his cult
status by arguing that technological change may be increasing
American productivity, making it possible to run the economy at a
higher rate of growth without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On several earlier occasions, Greenspan's judgment, criticized
at the time, proved sound in retrospect. More than that, as time
has gone on, his personal credibility has contributed to the
orderly calming of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' confidence in him made them willing to take on trust
that 1998's loosening was necessary and sufficient to prevent a
global meltdown, though this was by no means self-evident at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   So the cult has its advantages. But it has three big drawbacks
as well. The first, of course, is that when the object of worship
does make a mistake, the error is magnified hugely. No one knows
whether this is happening now, but the risk is plain.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Greenspan is deemed the patron saint of
America's ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about whether there really is
such an animal (The Economist is at best only a half-believer), and
the hard evidence remains sketchy. But what is certain is that if
there isn't, any future correction will be all the more severe. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 550, OR CONTINUE TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   A comparison with Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in the
1980s is worrying. Like Greenspan, the long-serving Nigel Lawson
was a trained economist held in awe by many in his field and with
strong, even overbearing influence in the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely credited with creating a British ``economic
miracle.'' But this mattered not one jot when his policies came
unstuck in a welter of asset-price inflation and slumping personal
savings. Britain suffered the consequences for years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more immediately, the personalization of monetary
policy creates its own form of moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are so confident of Greenspan's magic touch that they
may well be bidding up equity prices in the belief that he will
bail them out if things start going wrong. Inadvertently,
therefore, there may be a Greenspan bubble in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   It can reasonably be objected that this has more to do with the
sheep-like attitudes of Greenspan's followers as the Delphic
utterances of the Oracle himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he is at least partly at fault for giving the impression
that he will loosen monetary policy whenever Wall Street plummets
(as in 1987 and 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, whether you blame the High Priest or the Temple
prostitutes, the real danger lies in cultism itself.
</P>
<P>
   Third, what happens when the Oracle retires or goes into the
wilderness? If the credibility of your monetary policy is bound up
in one individual, you face an obvious risk when he or she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that risk proved minimal in 1987 when Paul Volcker,
Greenspan's respected predecessor, stepped down. But to expect
lightning to strike twice is to stretch not only the law of
averages but also the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious replacement with even half Greenspan's
status in the markets (unless perhaps Robert Rubin, the former
treasury secretary, were to want the job).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of a successor is contributing both to
Greenspan's influence and to the ease of his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution to the dangers of cultism: embody in
institutional form some of the personal credibility the chairman
himself now has.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many central banks, the Fed's workings are murky.
The minutes of one Fed meeting appear only after the next is over.
The body has relatively wide powers of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds further to Greenspan's status as a market
magician. Giving the Fed clearer goals _ most obviously a formal
inflation target _ and requiring greater transparency about how
these are being achieved would limit his personal influence.
</P>
<P>
   In America now, that would hardly be regarded as a blessing. But
if you look past Greenspan's formidable reputation and ask whether
the United States has the best central bank in the world, as
opposed to the best central banker, the answer must be no. Now is
as good a time as any to do something about that. &QL;

   SAN JOSE _ In November, when Intel named a new boss for its
Costa Rica operation, President Miguel Angel Rodriguez joked that
the new manager's job was more important than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was right. Since Intel, an American semiconductor
maker, opened a factory outside the capital, San Jose, in March
1998, Costa Rica's economy has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   So the statistics suggest, at least. After stagnating in the
mid-1990s, the economy has surged: officials estimate that GDP grew
by almost 8 percent in 1999, and that the increase in chip exports
(to $2 billion) gave Costa Rica a trade surplus for the first time
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But these dizzy figures mask a more complex story.
</P>
<P>
   While last year, the value of the Intel factory's production
almost tripled, the rest of the economy grew more modestly, by
around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a second bright spot: Costa Rica's beaches, rain
forests, and volcanoes attracted more than 1 million foreign
visitors to the country in 1999. But farming, traditionally the
mainstay of the economy, is suffering from low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some Costa Ricans worry that their country now has a ``dual
economy,'' and is swapping one form of economic dependency for
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago we depended on coffee and bananas; today we
depend on Intel,'' the central bank president, Eduardo do Lizano,
complained recently.
</P>
<P>
   One statistical effect of that dependency is that once the Intel
plant reaches full capacity by the middle of this year, the
economy's rate of growth will plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that national income (as opposed to GDP) grew by
only 2 percent last year, because of the outflow of profits.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to keep growth going by seeking more
foreign investment. Manufacturers who export their output get an
eight-year tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Other Central American countries offer more generous incentives,
but Costa Rica has other advantages, rare in the region. These
include a democratic tradition, respect for the rule of law, and a
well-educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors led Intel to choose Costa Rica for its only factory
in Latin America. Rodriguez's people are now concentrating on
improving Costa Rica's infrastructure. The main airport is being
expanded, and there is much road-building.
</P>
<P>
   Despite resistance from traditionalists, they are also pushing
ahead with plans to allow private investment in ICE, the
state-owned electricity and telecommunications monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts seem to be paying off. Other foreign investors
have followed Intel. Even if growth now slackens a bit, Costa Rica
has started to make the transition from banana republic to
high-tech manufacturing center. &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ The Chevrolet Traverse may look like a sport-utility
vehicle, but to Joel Piaskowski, a designer, it is ``Chevy's
reinvention of the traditional family sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Half car, half truck, the Traverse is one of nine ``concept''
vehicles that General Motors will roll into Detroit's auto show in
a few days' time.
</P>
<P>
   The new vehicles are designed to support the pledge made by Ron
Zarrella, the president of GM's North American operations, that
fully half of its forthcoming products will break new ground in
design, engineering or creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The car maker urgently needs something special. As well as using
fancy designs, GM is trying to tempt buyers with the promise, on
Jan. 4, of a ``loyalty'' voucher, which will give anyone who is
interested $500 off the price of a new car.
</P>
<P>
   In November its share of the American car market slipped to 27.2
percent, the lowest since the Depression, excluding years of
strikes or wars, before climbing sharply in December, to 30.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For much of 1999, GM blamed the decline on demand that
outstripped its production capacity. But in recent months, GM has
caught up with demand _ and discovered that many consumers don't
want its products.
</P>
<P>
   GM assured the world that it would thrive once 1998's strike was
out of the way. ``We have absolutely not delivered on our
commitment,'' lamented Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After battling cancer for much of the past year, Pearce is
suddenly appearing all over town, insisting that top managers must
be held ``accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time this idea has popped up at GM. But
despite the company's problems, few executives have fallen on their
swords since the boardroom coup of 1992. If rumors swirling around
Detroit are true, however, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   GM's chairman, Jack Smith, offers less-than-heartfelt denials of
an impending shake-up _ though he dismisses talk of a hostile
takeover as ``beyond anything imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains popular with the GM board, and he has honored at
least one promise: to coax the North American car operations back
into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street thinks GM should earn $8.49 a share in 1999, up from
$5.30 in 1998. But profits seem certain to dip in 2000, especially
if, as expected, GM chooses to fight for market share with costly
incentives for car buyers.
</P>
<P>

   DETROIT _ The Chevrolet Traverse may look like a sport-utility
vehicle, but to Joel Piaskowski, a designer, it is ``Chevy's
reinvention of the traditional family sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Half car, half truck, the Traverse is one of nine ``concept''
vehicles that General Motors will roll into Detroit's auto show in
a few days' time.
</P>
<P>
   The new vehicles are designed to support the pledge made by Ron
Zarrella, the president of GM's North American operations, that
fully half of its forthcoming products will break new ground in
design, engineering or creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The car maker urgently needs something special. As well as using
fancy designs, GM is trying to tempt buyers with the promise, on
Jan. 4, of a ``loyalty'' voucher, which will give anyone who is
interested $500 off the price of a new car.
</P>
<P>
   In November its share of the American car market slipped to 27.2
percent, the lowest since the Depression, excluding years of
strikes or wars, before climbing sharply in December, to 30.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For much of 1999, GM blamed the decline on demand that
outstripped its production capacity. But in recent months, GM has
caught up with demand _ and discovered that many consumers don't
want its products.
</P>
<P>
   GM assured the world that it would thrive once 1998's strike was
out of the way. ``We have absolutely not delivered on our
commitment,'' lamented Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After battling cancer for much of the past year, Pearce is
suddenly appearing all over town, insisting that top managers must
be held ``accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time this idea has popped up at GM. But
despite the company's problems, few executives have fallen on their
swords since the boardroom coup of 1992. If rumors swirling around
Detroit are true, however, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   GM's chairman, Jack Smith, offers less-than-heartfelt denials of
an impending shake-up _ though he dismisses talk of a hostile
takeover as ``beyond anything imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains popular with the GM board, and he has honored at
least one promise: to coax the North American car operations back
into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street thinks GM should earn $8.49 a share in 1999, up from
$5.30 in 1998. But profits seem certain to dip in 2000, especially
if, as expected, GM chooses to fight for market share with costly
incentives for car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Smith say he is hinting that it may be time to
retire. Pearce is seen as the front-runner to succeed him, though
GM may yet reach outside.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the next chairman will have to stir things up. That

<P>
   Everyone accepts that a mother-to-be is at the mercy of her
raging hormones. She is, after all, hosting someone else inside her
body, and that body is bound to react to the metabolic needs of its
lodger.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that expectant fathers, too, may suffer symptoms
such as anxiety, fatigue and a ravenous appetite during pregnancies
for which they are responsible is less familiar _ which is curious,
since three-quarters of fathers do, indeed, experience such
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, no one had bothered to look at what happens to
the hormones of expectant men.
</P>
<P>
   But, after studying the literature on expectant males of other
species, Anne Storey, a psychologist at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland, in St. Johns, Canada, decided it was time to look
into the matter in people, too. Her results are about to be
published in ``Evolution and Human Behaviour.''
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal changes in a pregnant woman are not concerned
solely with the fetus's immediate well-being. They are also a way
of preparing her for her forthcoming role as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   In most animal species, however, the role of the father is
limited to insemination, so no hormonal change connected with
incipient fatherhood would be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. Over 90 percent of bird species, for
example, are ``biparental.'' This means that their couplings are
largely monogamous (with a little adultery on the side) and that
both parents help to look after the brood.
</P>
<P>
   And male birds which assist in child-rearing do, indeed, tend to
go through big hormonal changes before their young emerge _ as do
males of the much smaller proportion (fewer than 10 percent) of
mammal species that are biparental.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman is pregnant, the levels of several of her hormones
will rise. These hormones include cortisol (which is related to
stress), estradiol (the main female sex hormone) and prolactin
(which, as its name suggests, triggers her breast tissue to develop
the ability to secrete milk).
</P>
<P>
   Levels of all these hormones are also known to be correlated, in
the females of at least some species, with the quality of
subsequent maternal behaviors such as bonding to newly born
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's first task was to see what hormonal trends occurred
in men. To do so, she recruited 34 couples from an assortment of
prenatal classes and sampled their blood.
</P>
<P>
   The men in these couples, she discovered, exhibited significant
changes in their levels of cortisol, testosterone (the principal
male sex hormone, and thus in some sense the masculine equivalent
of estradiol) and prolactin over the courses of their partners'
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case the level of the hormone in question changed in a
way that matched the pattern that is seen in pregnant women _ which
is, presumably, why men experience many of the same pre-birth
symptoms as women do.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's hypothesis, which is supported by evidence from
other biparental species, is that these increased hormone levels
predispose a man to behave in a fatherly way when his child is
born.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to following long-term changes, Dr. Storey was also
interested in the expectant fathers' short-term responses to things
infantile.
</P>
<P>
   To test these, she and her colleagues took blood samples before
and after a half-hour procedure that involved both members of a
couple watching a video of a breast-feeding mother, listening to a
recording of a distressed newborn, and holding a doll which was
draped in a blanket that had recently been worn by a real newborn
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The parents-to-be were thus exposed to visual, auditory, tactile
and (from the blanket) olfactory stimuli associated with having a
baby around.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, like mothers, fathers show a
significant drop in cortisol levels during this procedure. The
closer a man's partner was to giving birth, the steeper the
hormonal plunge he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men who held the doll throughout the entire
30-minute experimental period showed bigger declines in
testosterone than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that fathers-to-be are undergoing almost
as much of a change of life _ probably as a result of behavioral
and chemical signals from the mother _ as that mother is herself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this extends as far as switching off the
``going-off-for-a-drink-with-mates'' circuits in a man's brain, and
activating the ``cleaning-dirty-bottoms'' circuits, is, however,
something that many women might beg leave to doubt. &QL;

   To test these, she and her colleagues took blood samples before
and after a half-hour procedure that involved both members of a
couple watching a video of a breast-feeding mother, listening to a
recording of a distressed newborn, and holding a doll which was
draped in a blanket that had recently been worn by a real newborn
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The parents-to-be were thus exposed to visual, auditory, tactile
and (from the blanket) olfactory stimuli associated with having a
baby around.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, like mothers, fathers show a
significant drop in cortisol levels during this procedure. The
closer a man's partner was to giving birth, the steeper the
hormonal plunge he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men who held the doll throughout the entire
30-minute experimental period showed bigger declines in
testosterone than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that fathers-to-be are undergoing almost
as much of a change of life _ probably as a result of behavioral
and chemical signals from the mother _ as that mother is herself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this extends as far as switching off the
``going-off-for-a-drink-with-mates'' circuits in a man's brain, and
activating the ``cleaning-dirty-bottoms'' circuits, is, however,
something that many women might beg leave to doubt. &QL;

   Names can be such awkward things. Since the days of Adam, man
has busily tagged his things and thoughts and, more recently, even
his increasingly careful measures of time.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been nothing if not demanding: decades and eras have
gained not just a noun but also an adjective. The ``hungry
forties'' summed up times of want in Britain 150 years ago. This
century the twenties have roared in America and the sixties have
swung in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser decades have had labels: the depressed thirties, the
square fifties and the greedy eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a challenge. So far, the next decade is unbaptized.
</P>
<P>
   An adjective, in advance of actually experiencing the period,
would be too much to expect. But a noun is needed to follow on from
the seventies, eighties and nineties. But what? The problem is all
those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of candidates for the new name. One Web
site (www.namethedecade.com) has instituted a competition to decide
on one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 or so candidates are the millies, the singles, the
two-thousands, the two-Gs, the zips or zippies, the blanks, the
O-somes, the zeros and the ``tainties'' _ ``'cause it t'aint the
nineties, and it t'aint the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Internet-style, may be one way to find an answer, and
readers may well wish to make their votes count. But only after
proper reflection and even _ despite this e-era _ respect for
history.
</P>
<P>
   At the last century's turn a similar problem was solved when the
first decade became known as the nineteen-hundreds. Follow that
principle and we will soon enter the twenty-hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Too fuddy-duddy and pre-millennial? Some prefer instead the Y2K
(Year Two Thousand) as the first of the D2K, and the D2k the first
of the C2K.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a terrible shame: no sooner had we rid ourselves
of the perhaps-awful-but-certainly-awfully-named Y2K bug than we
would be bugged by a whole algebraic era.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, faced with that ghastly prospect, favor various
permutations of zeroes instead. Yet the ohs, triple-ohs, trios,
noughts or the (minimalist) nils and nulls all fail to inspire _
although the zeroes were reckoned, by one British polling company,
to be a popular choice among the public.
</P>
<P>
   Equally the 0-0s, pronounced as the ``uh-oh,'' are really too
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some good names remain available. The millies, or
the millie-nillies, could be popular and appropriately millennial.
But they are surely too flighty.
</P>
<P>
   One can proudly boast of being a child of the swinging sixties;
who would want to be a child of the silly millie-nillies?
</P>
<P>
   The aughts or naughts could also tempt, but lack the satisfying
``ties'' which give other decades' names a pleasing ring at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   So there can be only one solution, which fortunately can already
be found on the popular lists: a name which has the right tone,
rhythm and sense of fun, yet won't saddle the next generation with
distracting connotations.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the naughties. &QL;

CLINTON HE'S ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK - President Clinton, who has sought
to echo the style of John F. Kennedy, will be invoking an older
presidential glamour here today during his expected proclamation of
a new national monument.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly 92 years ago today - Jan. 11, 1908 - that
President Theodore Roosevelt created a national monument here. A
later act of Congress shielded the land further by making it a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been vague about Clinton's purpose in his
visit here - he arrived late Monday night, Jan. 10 - promising only
an ``environmental announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   But unofficial sources say that Clinton will proclaim the Grand
Canyon-Parashant National Monument, covering just over 1 million
acres adjacent to the northwestern edge of Grand Canyon National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The land sprawls across pinon-juniper forests of the Shivwits
Plateau, climbs pine-clad peaks, and tumbles down the sandstone
cliffs carved by the Colorado River near Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to establish the Agua Fria National
Monument in an archeologically rich area north of Phoenix. In
addition, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recommended a monument
to protect thousands of acres of small islands and reefs along the
California Coast National Monument, and called on Clinton to expand
Pinnacles National Monument near San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's expected announcement has rekindled old antagonisms
about Washington's control of vast areas of Western land.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the move have characterized it as a federal land
grab, even though 97 percent of the land involved is already under
the administration of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull joined Arizona's two Republican senators and five
Republican representatives in a Jan. 7 letter to Clinton that asked
the president to ``forgo unilateral federal action . . . and
instead work with us as we involve the people of Arizona in a
preservation effort that allows the public a voice in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's spokeswoman, Francie Noyes, said, ``Clinton's expected
move is a political ploy, with Clinton attempting to burnish his
own legacy and boost Vice President (Al) Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using Arizona for their own political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   However, creation of the national monument, which was proposed
by Babbitt, appears to have broad public support.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statewide poll by the Behavior Research Center of
Phoenix, a bipartisan 76 percent of Arizona voters endorsed the
move.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club spokesman Rob Smith said the poll shows that ``the
people of Arizona understand the importance of protecting our
remaining wild lands, and they know that the president does, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darlene Slusher, an official with a group that represents
the interests of ranchers, hunters, miners and others, scoffed at
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Slusher, Arizona coordinator for People for the USA, said the
poll reflects the naivete and bias of big-city folks in Phoenix and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say the word `environmental' to city people, and they
think it is all well and good. It gives them a warm and fuzzy
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Slusher said environmentalists don't understand how federal land
bureaucracies can stifle individual initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Only 17 percent of the state's land is in private hands. The
federal government owns 42 percent while American Indian
reservations represent 28 percent. Thirteen percent belongs to the
state. &QL; 
Critics of the proposed move also accuse Babbitt of arrogance. Just
a year ago, they say, the secretary was talking about giving
national monument status to about 500,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt had called for Congress to take the lead. But he
rejected legislation sponsored by Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., that
Babbitt said would have diminished that land's current protection
from development and mining.
</P>
<P>
   Just what protection the new monument would receive is not
clear, said Tom Pittenger, Natural Resources Education Specialist
at Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no set criteria for a national monument, so it all
depends on what the (presidential) proclamation says,'' Pittenger
said. ``At this point we have a tremendous amount of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has framed his proposal as necessary to counter the
influences of rapid development in Arizona and in nearby Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The empty spaces are filling up in the West,'' Babbitt said
last month as he announced his proposal to Clinton. ``We have to
imagine what the Western landscape is going to look like in 50
years and try to anticipate, rather than wait for the conflicts to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of Clinton and the federal government are already in
fighting mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a limit to how much land we should take out of
circulation,'' Joe O'Neal said during a visit Monday, Jan. 10, to
Hopi Point. As he spoke, workmen were putting the final touches on
a platform where Clinton will speak this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to admit we are biased,'' added O'Neal, a retired
Air Force colonel. ``Anything Clinton does we don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Gaudreau, a 73-year-old outdoor gear salesman at the
Canyon's South Rim, had a different view. It's fantastic, he said,
because ``once land is gone, it is gone forever.'' &QL;

SWAP PROPOSED OF TRUST LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - There's a quick, easy way for Arizona to save its
most spectacular state trust land, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
said Monday, Jan. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Swap it for federal property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of federal assets that can be used in
exchanges, not just land but mineral rights and surplus military
assets,'' Babbitt said at a conference in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Babbitt, a former Arizona governor, drew mixed
responses Monday, Jan. 10, from Gov. Jane Hull and others.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving some of Arizona's 9.3 million acres of trust land has
become a hot political topic as the state's population soars _ up
1.3 million since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now development is poised to overrun scenic trust lands like the
foothills of the Superstition Mountains and the canyons of the
upper Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   But saving trust land is tricky. By state law, it must be
managed to raise money for education and other public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A committee convened by Hull is considering asking voters to
change the state Constitution so some trust land can be managed for
conservation instead of profit. The federal law that made Arizona a
state would also have to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said an exchange can be done right away, without
shortchanging schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He's already done it in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   There, 363,000 acres of trust land were put into national parks
and forests. In return, Utah got 145,000 acres of federal land,
with valuable coal and gas deposits, and $50 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Babbitt said, is ``you've got to have commitment'' from
state leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt spoke on a panel at the Western Association of Resource
Conservation and Development Councils, a program supported by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, local communities and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK STRATEGIES &QL; 
He also proposed two other quick strategies for preserving trust
lands:
</P>
<P>
   Charge development fees that can be used to buy land.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer development, so some areas are left as open space and
others have higher densities than would otherwise be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, Hull isn't opposed to land trades, her
spokeswoman, Francie Noyes, said Monday, Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   They could end up as part of the Growing Smarter package she's
trying to get through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch, Noyes said, is that ``the public has been opposed to
this in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that land exchanges were
unconstitutional, and voters have refused three times to pass an
amendment allowing them.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said the type of trade he has in mind could be
approved by Congress without violating the Arizona Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   RANCHERS BACK IDEA &QL; 
Ranchers, who have a stake in the grazing rights on trust land, are
fans of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been proponents in the past of including land
exchanges in the bag of tools that the State Land Department has,''
Bas Aja of the Arizona Cattlemen's Association said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many conservative Arizonans aren't eager to see any
more federal land on their maps.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pfister, who leads Hull's effort to put together the
Growing Smarter proposal, sees trades as ``only a partial
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   They would work well for trust land that is surrounded by
federal land, Pfister said, but not for state land on the urban
fringes, which is most threatened by development.
</P>
<P>
   NOT PART OF INITIATIVE &QL; 
Trust land is not addressed in the sweeping growth-management
initiative the Sierra Club is trying to get on next November's
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, former Attorney General Grant Woods, who heads the
initiative drive and was a panelist Monday, endorsed Babbitt's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But he sees the window of opportunity rapidly closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's January, and the secretary won't be there a year from
now,'' Woods said. ``He's made the offer. Now the state needs to
take him up on it.'' &QL;

   Now development is poised to overrun scenic trust lands like the
foothills of the Superstition Mountains and the canyons of the
upper Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   But saving trust land is tricky. By state law, it must be
managed to raise money for education and other public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A committee convened by Hull is considering asking voters to
change the state Constitution so some trust land can be managed for
conservation instead of profit. The federal law that made Arizona a
state would also have to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said an exchange can be done right away, without
shortchanging schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He's already done it in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   There, 363,000 acres of trust land were put into national parks
and forests. In return, Utah got 145,000 acres ral land,
with valuable coal and gas deposits, and $50 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Babbitt said, is ``you've got to have commitment'' from
state leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt spoke on a panel at the Western Association of Resource
Conservation and Development Councils, a program supported by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, local communities and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK STRATEGIES &QL; 
He also proposed two other quick strategies for preserving trust
lands:
</P>
<P>
   Charge development fees that can be used to buy land.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer development, so some areas are left as open space and
others have higher densities than would otherwise be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, Hull isn't opposed to land trades, her
spokeswoman, Francie Noyes, said Monday, Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   They could end up as part of the Growing Smarter package she's
trying to get through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch, Noyes said, is that ``the public has been opposed to
this in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that land exchanges were
unconstitutional, and voters have refused three times to pass an
amendment allowing them.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said the type of trade he has in mind could be
approved by Congress without violating the Arizona Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   RANCHERS BACK IDEA &QL; 
Ranchers, who have a stake in the grazing rights on trust land, are
fans of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been proponents in the past of including land
exchanges in the bag of tools that the State Land Department has,''
Bas Aja of the Arizona Cattlemen's Association said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many conservative Arizonans aren't eager to see any
more federal land on their maps.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pfister, who leads Hull's effort to put together the
Growing Smarter proposal, sees trades as ``only a partial
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   They would work well for trust land that is surrounded by
federal land, Pfister said, but not for state land on the urban
fringes, which is most threatened by development.
</P>
<P>
   NOT PART OF INITIATIVE &QL; 
Trust land is not addressed in the sweeping growth-management
initiative the Sierra Club is trying to get on next November's
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, former Attorney General Grant Woods, who heads the
initiative drive and was a panelist Monday, endorsed Babbitt's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But he sees the window of opportunity rapidly closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's January, and the secretary won't be there a year from
now,'' Woods said. ``He's made the offer. Now the state needs to
take him up on it.'' &QL;

OLIVER SOUGHT AFTER SELE GOES TO MARINERS
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Seattle Mariners signed free-agent
pitcher Aaron Sele last night to a two-year, $15 million contract.
The Rangers could answer by pursuing Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said last night the Rangers have not
ruled out adding another front-line starting pitcher to their
rotation, either through free agency or by trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're doing this because of Sele signing,''
Melvin said. ``We've talked about adding additional pitching. We've
also talked about trading for pitching. If something makes sense,
we may do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who was 9-9 with a 4.26 earned-run average for the St.
Louis Cardinals last year, and Steve Trachsel are the only two
front-line free-agent pitchers left unsigned. The Rangers have no
interest in Trachsel, who was 8-18 with a 5.56 ERA for the Chicago
Cubs, but they have had at least preliminary talks with agent Scott
Boras concerning Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different ways of getting pitching,'' Melvin said.
``One way is by free agent; the other is by trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have had a number of clubs ask about some of their
young players, including pitchers Jeff Zimmerman and Francisco
Cordero and outfielders Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   Sele was expected to sign a four-year, $29 million contract with
the Baltimore Orioles last week, but the deal fell apart when the
Orioles weren't happy with the results of Sele's physical.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Adam Katz, re-opened talks with the Mariners
yesterday, and an agreement was reached quickly after Sele passed a
physical in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied Sele's going to make his usual 30 starts,''
Mariners general mannager Pat Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele was 18-8 with a 4.79 ERA in 33 starts and 205 innings for
the Rangers last year. He is the sixth major free agent signed by
the Mariners this off-season. They've also added first baseman John
Olerud, infielder Mark McLemore, outfielder Stan Javier, pitcher
Arthur Rhodes and Japanese reliever Kazuhiro Susaki to a team that
went 79-83 last year, finishing 16 games behind the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers offered Sele a four-year, $28 million contract
earlier in the off-season but withdrew it after signing Kenny
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made our best effort to try and sign him,'' Melvin said.
``We offered him almost twice as much. You can't do anything about
it.'' nn

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HAVING won another golf tournament, Tiger Woods will now take the
next month off. Why? He wants to work on his game.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course he does. It's clearly a mess. He had to resort
to draining a 40-foot downhill birdie putt with a 25-inch break to
beat Ernie Els in a playoff Sunday. That's unacceptable. A playoff?
Tiger, it's about time to get serious, man.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the PGA, for the sake of fairness and competitive
balance, really needs to step in here and do something. It needs to
order Woods to do nothing for the next four weeks except count his
money. He should be threatened with a fine and a suspension if he
so much as looks at a golf club before his reign of terror resumes
at Pebble Beach, his probable next scheduled tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   Because were Tiger to get any better _ in theory, we must assume
it's possible, although no apparent hitches in his golfing gitalong
jump out at us, do they? _ his would-be peers are going to become
so beaten down and so intimidated by his mere presence on the
course that he'll be winning every event he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. You're right. He's already doing that.
</P>
<P>
   As of the Mercedes Championships, the 2000 season opener in
Hawaii, he's 5-for-5 _ and 8-for-11. Phenomenal. On today's tour,
where everyone, it seems, is long and true and fit and smart enough
to finagle wins, 5-for-5 should be inconceivable. Fifty-two years
ago, when Ben Hogan last mounted such a run, only a select few
players had the skills to compete on equal footing with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have 30, 40 guys out there who could drive it 280,
putt straight and be able to count,'' said Champions co-founder
Jackie Burke, a Hogan contemporary and a man who thought he had
witnessed pretty much everything that could happen in golf over the
last half-century. ``What Tiger's doing is totally amazing to me,
especially for someone his age.''
</P>
<P>
   About that 40-footer, Jackie?
</P>
<P>
   ``What were the odds? Maybe 80-1,'' Burke replied. ``Under the
circumstances, I've never seen anything like it. I'm serious. With
him, I'm seeing some things I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, a superstar in his own right, didn't lose the
Mercedes, the tournament or the $90,000 SL500 that came with first
place. A couple of botched putts en route cost him ultimately, you
could argue, but nobody makes them all, not even Tiger _ except
when he absolutely has to. Els followed the champion's script to a
T, even holing an eagle putt on his final shot in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Which Tiger matched. No, Ernie had the championship forcibly
ripped from his grasp. Hence, Els bells, how psyched out will he _
or any other player who was watching _ be should he find himself in
another such sudden-death shootout with Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Only Tiger's brain could beat Tiger, Burke contends. And it's
unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, he's choke-proof,'' Jackie said, ``because the money
doesn't matter anymore. He's already got more than he'll ever
need.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than four full years as a PGA Tourist, Woods ranks No. 3
on the career money list. It's a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can shoot over a canyon,'' Burke said. ``If he misses, who
cares? He has taken choking completely out of the equation. He
doesn't have to worry about feeding his family.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, he doesn't have a family, which is also a
significant factor in his relentless pursuit of perfection, if
you'll forgive my mixed luxury-car metaphors. Love _ lower-case
``l,'' not Davis III _ could maybe return Woods to earth, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's a bachelor,'' Jackie said, ``he can be selfish
enough to maintain his level of play. Golf is the highest form of
self-indulgence. It's my game, my putter, my driver, etc. When you
have to start thinking about other people, when you're singing
Happy Birthday to the kids over the phone from the Holiday Inn
after a tough round, it gets a little more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players, as a rule, don't evolve into championship-caliber
golfers until they're of the age when they already have the wife,
the children and the white picket fence. Woods destroyed this
normal growth curve. At 24 _ 24! _ his game has fully matured. His
weakness used to be putting, back during the period when he was
winning but once over 43 starts. No more. There are no X variables
to muddy up his focus while leveling the playing field. It's pure
golf right now, and it will remain thus for as long as he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he can't lose. Worse, the other lads don't believe
he can, either. The tour is in serious trouble. Drastic measures
are called for. Tiger must not be allowed to practice. Perhaps they
can require him to drive with his putter and putt with his driver.
Or force him play to his own special par every week.
</P>
<P>
   Or make him find a steady girl.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Ron Mercer of the Denver Nuggets, who will be a free
agent after the season, says he has left No Limit Sports, the
sports agency founded by Percy Miller, better known as rapper
Master P.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mercer, who will now be represented by Andy Miller, and
Charlotte Hornets swingman Ricky Davis have filed the required
documentation with the NBA and the National Basketball Players
Association, the union that represents NBA players, to make the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, who was in Los Angeles for the Nuggets' game against the
Lakers on Monday, was reluctant to discuss the matter in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true,'' Mercer said, ``but I'm not comfortable saying
anything else about it. I don't want to bring a whole lot of
attention to it just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No Limit also represents the Clippers' Derek Anderson,
Portland's Bonzi Wells, Washington's Laron Profit and Atlanta's
Jason Terry, all of whom may drop Miller's agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the situation indicated two reasons for the
dissatisfaction with No Limit: the disastrous, incentive-laden
contract No Limit negotiated for the New Orleans Saints' Ricky
Williams, and Miller's efforts toward his own playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to talk about,'' Davis told the Gaston, N.C.,
Gazette. ``It fell apart when he (Miller) started playing
basketball and stopped concentrating on the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller played for the Continental Basketball Association's Fort
Wayne Fury in 1998-99 and signed training camp contracts with the
Charlotte Hornets last January and with the Toronto Raptors last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Miller currently is playing for the San Diego Stingrays of the
International Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for Williams, the No. 5 pick in the NFL draft,
counting bonuses and incentives, could have paid him over $9
million this year. But since Williams reached only one of his
contract incentives, his salary was $225,000 (he received $3
million of his $8.84 million signing bonus). Indianapolis running
back Edgerrin James, the No. 4 pick in the draft, earned $14.75
million this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is linking himself with golf greats of the past with
every victory.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether his winning streak goes beyond the five in a
row it stands at now, he has done something some of the kings of
the game have never done.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, however, Houston's Jack Burke still is claiming
the record as the last PGA Tour player to win four tournaments in a
row. The 1956 Masters champion and co-founder of Champions Golf
Club did so in 1952, sweeping a month's worth of events without
interruption for rest or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not something Burke dwells on, he is proud of that
legacy. And he's not shy about letting Woods know where he stands
in the historical frame of things.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods is doing, stretching his record from one season to
the next, one millennium to the next, with a seven-week break in
the official season in between, doesn't cut it, as far as Burke is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him from me,'' Burke says with a sly chuckle, ``that he
has to start all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods couldn't agree more. He was asked after his win at the
Mercedes Championships on Sunday how he views his winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in a row? Yep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The history books will disagree, of course. According to the PGA
Tour, Woods' streak is ongoing and official.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all things sporty, comparing Woods to the past is
like lining up apples and oranges. It's true that Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer never did what Woods is doing. Nor did Tom Watson.
But Ben Hogan did. And so did Byron Nelson, whose incredible string
of winning 11 starts in a row in 1945 still looks pretty
untouchable. And then there is Burke's streak.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods is making history, even if he is less than halfway
to Nelson's streak.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, too, knows that Woods' accomplishments stand the test of
time, whether or not they count in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they judge it now,'' Burke says. ``I won mine
in four consecutive weeks. Hogan and Nelson won theirs as they saw
fit to play. Tiger's won the last five he's played in, but they
aren't in consecutive weeks. I don't know how you gauge that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But winning in consecutive weeks brings the fatigue factor
into play. I was second at Augusta that year (in the Masters),
which would have been my fifth in a row. But I played a pro-am a
few days before it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of your definition, winning as consistently as
Nelson, Burke, Hogan and Woods have done is nothing short of
awesome. It's hard enough to win a $2 Nassau once a week, much less
a multimillion-dollar tournament against the world's most skilled
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's doing is a miracle every week,'' Burke says.
</P>
<P>
   Having been there before, Burke says he can envision the fun
Woods is having during this run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's going like this, it looks like you're putting at a
No. 3 washtub,'' Burke says, assuming everybody knows a No. 3
washtub would represent a pretty big hole in the ground. ``You just
know you're going to make those putts. You can hit bad shots and
bad chips, but the putter saves you.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke sees three reasons Woods has been able to win every time
he has stepped to the tee lately: his power, his touch and his
ability to harness his once-wild swing.
</P>
<P>
   Working with teacher Butch Harmon has helped in all of those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got good fundamentals, it's like a good horse
running or a good pitcher throwing _ you just let them go,'' Burke
says. ``But Butch has gotten him to tone down his swing quite a
bit. And that's helped with his accuracy. I haven't seen anybody
with his strength off the tee who can hit it as straight as he can.
We've had guys who can hit it that long but not that straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he's hitting an 8-iron from the fairway to the green
and everybody else is hitting 5-iron, that really pays off over the
course of a four-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you added 100 yards to the first hole at Champions, it
would add a stroke to par. So if Tiger's hitting the ball 20 yards
farther off the tee than everybody else, over 14 holes (the number
of par-4s and par-5s on most courses) that's 280 yards. That equals
out to a 2.8-stroke advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That extra yardage is a big, big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But no more important than his ability to save strokes around
the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so creative around the greens,'' Burke says. ``He's not
afraid to imagine shots and then make them happen. You don't see
guys with that kind of strength who can also chip and putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Put it together, and it adds up to five wins in a row, any way
you slice it.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is where No. 6 takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Woods doesn't disclose where his next event will be until the
week before it is scheduled. But a possible scheduling snag could
be coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was expected to play the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in the
first week of February. That would mean taking the next three weeks
off. But as defending champion at the Buick Invitational _ not to
mention having an endorsement contract with Buick _ Woods will play
at the La Jolla, Calif., event. That is followed by the Nissan Open
in Los Angeles, where Woods was runner-up in '99, and the $5
million Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other top pros, Woods doesn't play four weeks in a
row. It will be interesting to see which of those events Woods
decides to skip.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Chan Gailey has the same question everybody else seems to be asking
right now: Will he be back as the Dallas Cowboys' head coach?
<TEXT>
<P>
   After only a few hours back in Texas, Gailey thought he might
have gotten his answer. He was called in for a meeting with owner
Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the hourlong conversation, Gailey wasn't
handed a pink slip. Instead, Jones simply tossed around ideas with
his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want to? Probably,'' Gailey said when asked if he
questioned Jones about his job security. ``It's better to let him
(bring it up).''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Gailey understands why his job could be in jeopardy
after his Cowboys went 8-8 in the regular season, 1-7 on the road.
They were then trampled by Minnesota in a Sunday's wild-card
playoff game, their eighth consecutive road loss and second
consecutive first-round playoff defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of me commenting on anything, when he (Jones) gets
ready to make a statement, he'll make a statement,'' said Gailey,
who doubles as Dallas' offensive coordinator. ``The sooner the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Jones will ask Gailey to make some significant
changes to his offense, which faltered often this season,
particularly in the second halves of many games. On Sunday, the
Cowboys took a 10-3 lead on the Vikings 10 minutes into the game,
then never scored another point, a pattern that became all too
familiar this season.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman has not spoken publicly against Gailey or his
offense, but it is clear the quarterback would like a less
conservative approach. Jones said in recent weeks he will have
Gailey tailor the offense to better utilize Aikman's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have a scowl on my face, I'd be down, I'd be upset, I'd be
discouraged if I had Aikman's skills, his commitment, and had the
stats that ultimately result in this criticism,'' Jones said. ``I
have a lot of confidence that we can address and make the changes.
That will put a smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Gailey's direction, Aikman has seldom thrown very far
downfield to stretch the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every year there is some level of frustration that
everyone deals with, and you have to fight through that,'' Aikman
said prior to Sunday's game. ``That's life as an NFL quarterback,
as an NFL player.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this year, no question, has been pretty
frustrating for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating was probably too nice of a word after Sunday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediocre, up-and-down, lack of consistency,'' running back
Emmitt Smith said when asked to describe the season. ``Consistently
bad at times. Showing signs of brilliance, showing signs of being a
very good ballclub, but not being able to put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, says Gailey isn't as much to blame as the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accountability lies with players from the standpoint that
we have to be focused, we have to be attentive, we have to be
alert,'' Smith said. ``If we aren't able to do it, the coaches need
to put emphasis on it one way or another. The coach can get on you
as much as he wants, but the ultimate responsibility falls with the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, we've been underachievers,'' Sanders said.
``When you sit in that locker room, it's unbelievable. I think we
placed five guys in the Pro Bowl, and we probably had two or three
others that deserve to go also. And you can't go any farther than
the first round? That's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility Jones will instruct Gailey to hire an
offensive coordinator while holding onto his head job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a guy,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas won three Super Bowls within a four-season span from
1992-95. But the Cowboys have won only one playoff game in the past
four years and are 24-24 over the last three regular seasons, two
of those under Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we plan for things, we can't operate with results like
this,'' said Jones, who spent $41.5 million in bonuses on this
year's team. ``We have to give ourselves a better chance to win.
Everybody's disappointed. We had much higher expectations this
year. Much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Do next year's expectations include Gailey? As long as Jones
isn't saying, Gailey plans to be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep working as hard as I can,'' he said, ``until
they say, `Don't come back.'''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was one form of torture for Chan Gailey to stand along the
sidelines with the echo of that annoying Vikings horn rattling
inside his skull, while out on the field his troops turned another
game plan into something far less digestible than leftover holiday
fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   The pain and anguish will be of an entirely different variety
when sometime this week club owner Jerry Jones gathers quarterback
Troy Aikman, the head coach and a noose in a meeting room to decide
the future of the Cowboys. And Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The main subject will ostensibly be how to get more out of a
Dallas offense that was rivaled by only the Y2K crisis as a widely
celebrated phenomenon that failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, however, will be finding a way to put
happiness back into the life of Aikman, whose smiles the past two
seasons have been about as wide as the Mona Lisa's and as
infrequent as a Marine drill sergeant's.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is little to jump for joy about following a
second straight year of being bounced from the NFL playoffs in the
wild-card round. That just happens to coincide with the length of
Gailey's stewardship of the erstwhile America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-button topic, as usual, is whether the shortcomings of
the Cowboys are the fault of the man who draws up the X's and O's
or the players who are paid large sums of money to execute them.
The tendency, as usual, is to point the finger at the head coach,
since replacing an entire offensive unit is so much more
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this week's meeting of the minds.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is always of a mind to put everything into a paint shaker
and flip the switch following any season that does not conclude in
the Super Bowl. And he is also of a mind to keep his poster-boy
quarterback content, because Aikman still possesses one of the most
accurate arms in the NFL and also a guaranteed contract for
zillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who has seen the years and the concussions pile up, is
of a mind these days to grump and grumble around the Cowboys'
clubhouse, telling confidants he's uncomfortable with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Gailey and the noose play their parts, one having
his neck placed inside the other, which will then be tightened to
extract some, uh, compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dropped passes, fumbles and lame-brained penalties by
the performers, it is Gailey's house that is under siege. This was
made evident when Jones held a meeting with 20 team members without
Gailey present.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would ``rather the man change than change the
man.'' This may be interpreted as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Jones could have gotten Norv Turner back from
Washington. But having won an NFC East title and holding three
first-round draft picks this year, Turner is staying with the
Redskins, and the bull's-eye is staying on Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, it will be time for Aikman to stand up and take
ownership of all the whispering and behind-the-back complaints he's
had about the close-to-the-vest offense Gailey has run. An offense,
by the way, that ran up 389 total yards _ including 286 in the air
_ at Minnesota despite Aikman's receiving corps often displaying
hands of stone.
</P>
<P>
   Is the offensive act so bad, or are the actors? Consider that
former Cowboys receiver Jimmy Smith was the AFC's Player of the
Month in December with Jacksonville. And Patrick Jeffers, a nice
contributor a year ago, was let go because Dallas said it couldn't
afford to pay him $1.2 million this season. Once Michael Irvin was
lost for the season, the Cowboys were forced to go with Rocket
Ismail and a supporting cast straight off a sandlot.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another rub. Jones continues to sell himself on the
Cowboys being real Super Bowl contenders as long as he has Aikman,
Emmitt Smith, Irvin and Deion Sanders on the roster. But those four
players eat up so much of the salary cap that the talent pool is
shallower than a bathtub. Thus, an overall record in the past three
seasons (including the playoffs) that is two games below .500
(24-26).
</P>
<P>
   The $12.7 million he is scheduled to earn next season is the
biggest reason Sanders may have played his last game in Dallas.
Prime Time is not a Charles Barkley type who will play for $1
million for the sake of the team. So he could return to baseball,
where salary cap and sanity are absent. Or Jones, the star
worshipper, may choose to pay Sanders and leave the talent gap
between the Cowboys and the NFL's true elite as Gailey's problem to
accept or reject at this week's summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Aikman and the noose will be for gentle
persuasion.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
HARTFORD, Conn. _ If playing tough teams on the road is giving the
Texas Longhorns a taste of what the NCAA Tournament will be like,
maybe when the time comes they should decline the invitation to the
Big Dance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, they don't have the rhythm to dance with the big
boys. But at least as they keep getting beaten, they are getting
closer to finding the right beat.
</P>
<P>
   And by Tournament time, Texas coach Rick Barnes expects his team
to be dancing to a better tune.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Texas, which has yet to win away from home this season,
lost its third consecutive road game to a name opponent, this time
falling to No. 5 Connecticut 77-67 Monday night before a crowd of
16,294 at the Hartford Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mouring led the Huskies with 21 points and sank five of
six 3-pointers. Backcourt mate Khalid El-Amin was the only other
UConn player in double figures with 14 points. The junior did not
have a good shooting night (4-for-12), but he dished out eight
assists and made a crucial 3-pointer late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Katy native Jake Voskuhl played well defensively for the
Huskies. He finished with nine points, 11 rebounds and two blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Connecticut played its best game, and I
certainly think we can play better,'' Barnes said. ``But this will
be a good experience for us because, as I told the guys, they play
hard, and we have to play that hard to beat teams like this. I just
hate to have to lose games to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mihm scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half to pace
the Longhorns. The 7-foot junior was on the attack in the second
half, hitting six of eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm turned his ankle after colliding with a chair under the
basket after a layup, but he returned after a short break. He said
he expects to be ready to go when Texas (9-4) resumes Big 12
Conference play at Texas A&AMP;M on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a season-low nine turnovers, the Longhorns came up short
against the defending national champions because of poor shooting _
from the field and the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Texas shot a season-worst 33.3 percent from the floor, hitting
just 24 of 72 shots. Connecticut (11-2) matched the Longhorns with
24 field goals but needed just 54 attempts to get them. Texas also
was off target from long range, hitting just six of 23 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies tallied 10 more points from the foul line than did
Texas, which was only 13-of-25 (52 percent) from the charity
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the ball where we wanted to. We just didn't take
advantage from the free-throw line,'' Barnes said. ``When you miss
free throws like that, you put a lot of pressure on your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of 23 NBA scouts on hand saw a lackluster performance
from the teams on the offensive end in the first half. But things
picked up considerably after the break.
</P>
<P>
   UConn found its shooting touch in the second half, though dunks
and layups are the easiest shots to make. The Huskies hit their
first eight shots from the floor on the way to an 18-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mouring, who inexplicably was left alone outside, hit
consecutive 3-pointers to give UConn a 56-39 lead, Texas came alive
and whittled its way back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns spread the wealth in the comeback. William Clay,
Gabe Muoneke (12 points) and Darren Kelly (12 points) each had
baskets, and Ivan Wagner (10 points) hit two free throws to cut the
Huskies' lead to 59-54 with 4:46 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns had a bundle of opportunities to get closer down
the stretch but could never make the big shot when they ne.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner was off on a 3-pointer, Kelly drew nothing but glass from
3-point range, Mihm was off on the front end of a one-and-one, and
after Muoneke kept the rebound alive, Clay missed another trey
attempt _ all with UT in striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the wasted chances, Texas still pulled within 67-62
on Kelly's short jumper with 57.2 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Robertson made both ends of a one-and-one for the Huskies,
but Muoneke answered with a layup with 41.2 seconds left. El-Amin
was perfect from the line, but Texas drew nearer on Wagner's trey
from the right corner, cutting the deficit to 71-67 with 24.6
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But Mouring hit two more free throws, Wagner's next 3-point try
was no good, and the Huskies added a free throw and a layup to salt
away the tough win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly excited,'' Muoneke said of playing the
well-regarded Huskies down to the wire. ``I'm a little
disappointed. I thought we had a chance to win the game, and we let
it get away from us in the first half. Even in the second half,
when we were coming back, we did some things that kept it out of
our reach.''

GALLOWAY FIRST SEAHAWK WHO SHOULD GO AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Tempting as it is to chuck the baby, bassinet,
toys, two pets and three cousins with the Seahawks bath water,
restraint is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Just throw out Joey Galloway, then work with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks wide receiver was dead weight for much of his brief
stay in pads this season. But it's dead weight that has value for
teams looking for ballast.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering his eulogy Monday on the recently expired season,
coach Mike Holmgren touched on several causes of the local annual
football death, this time witnessed by the sports nation Sunday.
Family newspaper restraints preclude a graphic description of the
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   One festering boil was obvious: Galloway. He had one catch for
22 yards, but at least two more appeared catchable if he had acted
as if the season depended on the receptions, which was the case.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Galloway was solely, or even primarily,
responsible for the Seahawks' collapse Sunday, or for the miserable
final half of the season. But he is the one guy who has more
unpleasant baggage than Imelda Marcos, yet still has teams lusting
for him. Any one among several Seahawks weaknesses could be
repaired, if not resolved, by a trade of the canker flanker.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren offered up his usual diplomatic response when asked
about the future of the former Joey Stayaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's still here,'' he said. ``He's a better player than
he showed.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the point. He chose not to show it, first
with his futile holdout, then with his reluctance to engage fully
with the team, run the hard routes and make the punishing catches.
Let's not even bring up downfield blocking or selling routes when
he wasn't the hot read.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren later drifted closer to candor when he was asked to
name his best receiver. He tossed a collective blanket over Derrick
Mayes (62 catches), Sean Dawkins (58) and Mike Pritchard (26), then
after a pause added tight end Christian Fauria (40).
</P>
<P>
   No mention of Galloway (22 catches in eight games).
</P>
<P>
   Even more to the point, Holmgren elaborated on what turned out
to be a mess at a position vital to the success of the West Coast
offense. Because of Galloway's holdout and early injuries to
others, the Seahawks picked up Mayes and Charles Jordan (later
waived). When Pritchard was healthy and Galloway returned, the
Seahawks were overloaded with veteran receivers at roughly similar
ages, skill levels and high salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want a pretty nice pile of wide receivers,''
Holmgren said. ``But you have to have players who understand their
role and willbe happy in that situation. That's huge. It's no one's
fault, but it got out of whack. It got complicated. The game is
hard enough without dealing with all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a little of that stuff, to be honest about it.
You need guys who aren't too worried about, `Am I the man?'''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren never found a rotation to keep everyone happy. And
quarterback Jon Kitna couldn't hoist enough passes to feed the egos
on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to find a way to get Joey the ball,'' Holmgren said.
``But the tough thing was, if you do get him the ball, you're
taking balls away from guys who made plays all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey was used to being involved in 90 to 95 percent of the
plays, and he went down to 50 percent. It's a tough situation that
was hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The folly reached its nadir Sunday when Mayes, the leading
receiver, did not catch a ball. In fact, only seven completions
went to the wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that was due to the Dolphins' pressure on Kitna, as well
as Ricky Watters' inability to run on a gimpy knee. Still, much of
the late-season air-game trouble was due to mismanagement, which
Holmgren owned up to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I didn't do such a great job of that,'' he said.
``Hopefully, if I get in that same situation next year, maybe I do
a better job of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the things that we'll look back on and say, `I
wish that would have worked out differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Holmgren the rookie general manager deserves a hit for
not moving swiftly on Galloway's contract well before camp started,
and for misreading the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the foolish belief of Galloway and his agent that they had
leverage against Seattle proved disastrous for all parties. His
failure to recognize that his position wouldn't improve past the
opening game made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Galloway has some sort of epiphany, the situation would
seem beyond salvage, which Holmgren might find out Tuesday. In
10-minute meetings with each player, he is asking them pointblank:
</P>
<P>
   ```Do you want to be here?''' he said. ``If a guy has a severe
problem with me, or doesn't like rain, he'd better let me know
because I don't want unhappy people around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion is Galloway's meeting might leave Holmgren with
about nine minutes, 55 seconds to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway: Drop dead.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren: After you.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the late offensive failures were also attributable to a
third-stringer at right tackle, a one-legged right guard, a
second-string center, a running back with a bad knee and a
quarterback with a bad toe, throwing to a cat fight in the flat.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway couldn't fix any of those things.
</P>
<P>
   He can now.

   &UR; AOL TIME-WARNER MERGER (Moved in ``f'' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Looking at the strategy behind
marrying a traditional media conglomerate with an online service
provider: The America Online-Time Warner merger represents the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, not
just a fleeting enthusiasm on Wall Street and the obsession of the
nation's technology elite. The top executives of the two companies
presented the deal as a ``merger of equals'' on Monday. But it is
the shareholders of America Online Inc., that will own 55 percent
of the combined enterprise, though Time Warner will account for 80
percent of the revenues. Even the surviving stock symbol will be
AOL. By Steve Lohr.

   AOL-TIME-NEXT (Undated) _ What media-Internet deals may come in
the wake of the AOL Time Warner deal: The announcement Monday of
the combination between America Online and Time Warner creates a
company without peer in the media and entertainment industry, a
colossus that will force competitors from Disney to AT&AMP;T to
Microsoft to reconsider their strategies as the Internet and
traditional media converge. The deal leaves Disne and the
remaining giants of old media with a stark choice. They can try to
carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been
inhospitable to old media companies. Or they can merge with new
media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of
businesses that hardly existed five years ago. By Alex Berenson.

   AOL-TIME-CASE (Undated) _ A profile of Steve Case of AOL:
Perhaps the only thing stranger than Steve Case, the chairman of an
Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed, assuming the
helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was that he wore a
suit to the press conference on Monday where he announced the
audacious merger plan. Case, 37, is known for clinging to his
casual costume of denim shirts and khakis even on the most formal
occasions, but if that changes when the merger of America Online
and Time Warner is completed, it may come as no surprise. Since
before the World Wide Web was invented, Case has survived the
quicksand of the Internet industry with a series of chameleon like
changes of which his deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.

   AOL-TIME-LEVIN (Undated) _ A profile of Gerald Levin of Time
Warner: In the pantheon of prominent media executives, Gerald M.
Levin has long had a reputation as a shrewd gambler with a
scholarly mien: bookish, cerebral, self-effacing and yet tough.
True to form, on Monday the new chief executive of the hybrid of
Time Warner and America Online showed up without a tie for a New
York news conference to announce the planned merger, issuing a
formal greeting to what he called ``the suits from Virginia'' _ the
more formally-dressed executives from America Online's headquarters
in Dulles, Va. By Doreen Carvajal.

and media landscapes as few deals have done. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Looking at how the deal
affects AOL's ambitions in Europe: The Internet may well be
borderless, but it remains remarkably American. Here in Europe,
America Online Inc.'s prospective merger with Time Warner Inc. is
likely to accentuate that phenomenon and to increase the pressure
among rivals for new alliances and mergers. America Online and
Bertelsmann AG of Germany are equal partners in AOL Europe, which
operates local-language networks across the continent. But the most
striking feature about the Internet in Europe is its fragmentation
along national boundaries. Traditional telephone companies are
often the biggest Internet providers in each individual country,
but few have extended their reach across Europe. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WINNERS (Undated) _ Ted Turner is knocking on the door
of the $10 billion club. Turner, the cable-TV pioneer who is vice
chairman of Time Warner, has more to gain than anybody from a sale
of the company to America Online. He is the biggest individual
shareholder of Time Warner, owning about 97 million shares, or
about 6.5 percent of the company. While the long-term effect of the
deal on AOL shareholders is uncertain so far, it will be a sure
winner for Time Warner investors, many of whom are employees of the
company's magazines and cable channels. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ When Time Inc. acquired Warner
Communications 10 years ago, it took 7 years for shareholders in
the combined company to see any meaningful gains in their stock.
Will shareholders in AOL Time Warner, who choose to hold onto their
shares in this latest combination, show better returns than that?
This being the Internet age, most analysts believe that not only
will the benefits to shareholders in the combined company be
immediate, the deal will also justify higher valuations in the
already manic Internet arena. By Gretchen Morgenson.

<P>
   CHINA-UFOS (Beijing) _ The last few months have been a boom time
for UFO enthusiasts in China. Just before the start of the year
2000, there were dozens of sightings. Strange shining objects were
observed scooting through the sky by hundreds of people, from
former airport workers to college deans. Buoyed in part by the
sightings, the ranks of the research societies in major Chinese
cities devoted to unidentified flying objects have grown to more
than 40,000 members. More important still, the normally
conservative official news media have been lavishing attention on
UFO news, with documentaries on the main government television
station and credulous newspaper articles. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   BUSH-ROVE (Austin, Texas) _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at

cartoon from a local newspaper that pretty much says it all. The
multipanel strip shows Gov. Bush, a would-be president, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over ownership of a
narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim. Each grows
petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card. He hollers for Rove.
Readers outside of Texas might not get the reference, but give it a
few months. If Bush lopes to the Republican nomination as
decisively as many of his advisers and supporters believe that he
can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's boundaries as a
political mastermind. By Frank Bruni.

NETS DEFEAT MAGIC, 100-94 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ High off their victory in the Miami Heat's new
building, the New Jersey Nets began Monday night's contest against
Orlando caught in their disturbing trend of following a strong
performance with a weak one.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets trailed the energetic but undertalented Magic by 6
points at halftime, but charged out in the third quarter,
outscoring Orlando by 31-15 and held on for a 100-94 victory before
12,664 fans at Orlando Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which got wild and crazy in the waning moments,
gave the Nets consecutive road victories for the first time since
last April.
</P>
<P>
   Just when their season seems to be coming together, though, the
Nets (14-20) could be faced with another setback. Kerry Kittles,
the wiry shooting guard who has keyed the Nets' resurgence as much
as anyone, sustained what appeared to be a minor injury to his
surgically repaired right knee midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to pass out of a double team, Kittles felt pain in
his knee and had to leave the game for good with 6 minutes 29
seconds left. He said he planned to have the knee examined by a
doctor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just hyperextended it and it just reacted funny and
I felt a little pain in there, that's all,'' said Kittles, who
claimed that the knee was aching before and throughout the game.
``I've had pain for a while, but sometimes when you make a certain
move on the court, it just hurts more than other times. Tonight,
when I did it, it really hurt. It was hurting too much for me to
keep playing tonight. But I don't think anything is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kittles, who scored all 8 of his points in the first half,
left, the Nets led by 86-79. The Magic, which trailed by 80-70
entering the final period, was in the midst of a powerful run that
saw it chop an 86-73 deficit with 8:52 left to 88-84 with 5:19
remaining. During that time, the Nets went without a field goal,
scoring only on two free throws by Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, the Nets seemed poised to close the Magic out
when Marbury ended the drought with an 18-foot baseline jumper, and
Kittles' substitute, Lucious Harris, followed an Orlando foul shot
with a 23-footer that made it 92-85. The Magic scored again, but
Keith Van Horn made a big steal and closed the sequence with a
3-pointer to push the Nets' lead to 95-87 with 3:01 left. When
Harris nailed another 3-pointer to increase the lead to 11 less
than 40 seconds later, Orlando seemed to be through.
</P>
<P>
   But Marbury, who recorded 22 points and 9 assists, collected his
fifth and sixth fouls in a span of 47 seconds while guarding the
amazingly quick Darrell Armstrong (29 points, 8 assists). With 1:37
remaining, Marbury went to the bench, leaving the Nets without
their starting backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made both free throws to cut the lead to 98-91, and
then the Magic's aggressive 1-2-2 halfcourt trap began paying
dividends against a Nets unit that lacked a true point guard. There
was a shot-clock violation on the Nets, followed by an Armstrong
basket. Then Harris missed two free throws, while Bo Outlaw hit one
to pull the Magic within 4 points with 44.8 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnny Newman turned the ball over 10 seconds later and
Orlando forward Monty Williams began streaking toward the left side
of the rim for a layup, the Nets appeared to be on the verge of
blowing yet another fourth-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall Gill, who did an admirable job of playing point
guard down the stretch, flew in from the middle of the paint to
swat Williams's layup attempt away and all but secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it very easy for me because he put it in front of the
rim,'' said Gill, who scored 11 points to surpass John Williamson
and move into ninth place on the Nets' career scoring list with
3,992 points. ``If he had put it on the other side, it would have
been more difficult, but I think I still could have gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he just didn't see me. Either that, or he
disrespected my hops. And I still got them at 31 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach Don Casey said, ``That block was a coach-saver.''
</P>
<P>
   In disarray and setor outside jump shots against the
Magic's hectic halfcourt trap, the Nets trailed by 55-49 at the
half. But they began attacking the basket in the third to open the
quarter with a 20-6 run that put them in command. Van Horn, who
scored 8 of his 20 points in the critical run, said the Nets' spurt
had nothing to do with solving Orlando's frantic defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense screwed us up offensively for much of the
game,'' said Van Horn, who followed Jamie Feick (13 rebounds) with
10 rebounds to help the Nets outrebound Orlando by 53-41. ``We
scored by virtue of hustle and knocking down some big shots at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally in the N.B.A. you don't see teams that play 1-2-2
the whole game. So it was like some guys on the team were trying to
remember what they did in college against a zone 10 and 12 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Their memory served them well.

GAILEY WAITS AS JONES STALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The blindfold, whether you can see it or not,
has already been slipped into place around Chan Gailey's head. A
last cigarette dangles from his lips.
</P>
<P>
   So as is customary, we offered the condemned man a chance to say
his piece yesterday as he sat alone in the Cowboys' overcrowded
public relations library, facing a battery of cameras and
microphones that, from his perspective, must have looked like a
firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least sounded like one.
</P>
<P>
   This was Gailey's opportunity to lash out. At his owner. At his
general manager. At his players. At us, the media, for asking so
many confounded probing, unanswerable questions.
</P>
<P>
   His team had led the league in penalties. It had, by everyone's
estimation, vastly underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   His once-upon-a-time All-Pro quarterback was left to try and win
a game throwing to people named Brazzell (as in no razzle) and
Ogden (as in Ogden) while the other team's quarterback was playing
catch with guys named Carter and Moss and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Players, the guys who didn't make the plays that might have made
a difference, have whispered mostly unfair criticisms about his
offensive scheme. The owner has backed away from his beleaguered
coach so fast that he has to be suffering from major whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka would have ripped off the blindfold and kicked
somebody's butt right there on the spot. Ray Rhodes would have
skewered us with a withering glare. Mike Shanahan would have reeled
off a lesson in four-letter expletives, setting off smoke alarms
throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, to his immense credit, simply accepted the uncomfortable
situation with the same dignity and professionalism he has
consistently shown since taking this job two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise in this corner.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the immediate mandate for Jerry Jones: If he's going
to fire Gailey, and he's certainly given no reason for anyone to
think he intends anything other than that, then he should do it and
get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   Today. Right now.
</P>
<P>
   To leave this good and decent man twisting in the wind while he
shops his job around the league wouldn't just be wrong. It would be
a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Jones left last night for what he says are ``NFL related
meetings'' in New York and plans no announcement the rest of this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be insensitive,'' Jones said. ``What I'm
being asked is to share my thoughts, and I'm continuing to evaluate
our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gailey waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to happen, I just hope he does it quickly,''
Gailey said. ``The sooner the better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these words without rancor or bitterness. That's the
kind of person Gailey is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, those people at Columbine and at Wedgwood, they have
problems,'' Gailey would say later, in the privacy of his office.
``The worst that can happen to me is that I'll be fired ... and I
can get another job.'' Gailey didn't read anything into the fact
that he and Jones spent an hour yesterday morning discussing future
items, like personnel moves and the upcoming Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as a sign that we were going about business as
normal on the day after you got knocked out of the playoffs,''
Gailey said. ``I don't really have any different idea or better
idea right now than before that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out and work as hard as I can today and work
as hard as I can tomorrow, and if Jerry decides to make a change,
he decides to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: It's Jones who gets the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the wrong guy to talk to. I enjoy coaching football, I
enjoy coaching here. Let's leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   But we wouldn't, of course. We couldn't. With Jones declining to
discuss Gailey's situation, we were left to pester the coach with
questions he couldn't answer any more than we could.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey may have felt it was an unfair situation to be in, but he
also knows it comes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to judge fair and unfair,'' he said. ``Like I
said, I'm going to come to work here and work as hard as I can to
do what's right for this football team. 'Til they say `Don't come
to work,' then I won't come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   We gave him plenty of chances to point fingers elsewhere _ at
players, GM, owner, you name it _ but Gailey flatly refused. Twist
his arm all you want, all you'll ever get is name, rank and serial
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team deal,'' he explained. ``We're in it together.
Everybody's in it. Everybody's got either a star on their hat or a
star on their helmet. I understand that. There's sometimes I'm not
perfect, and there's times that they're not perfect. But we're
trying to win a championship together somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way I know to do it. I'll go to my grave
believing you fight together.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, sitting in the middle of a roomful of people
yesterday afternoon, he managed to look very much alone.

THE STARS NEED MATVICHUK TO STEP UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Imagine Tom Hanks in ``Big''. Only bigger. Now,
you can say you know Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk. Only
instead of dancing around his FAO Schwarz-like loft boxing with a
blow up dinosaur, Matvichuk pranced around his living room
pronouncing himself king of the mini-basketball court, air hockey,
ping pong and pool tables that decorated it. He lived to invite
friends over and play. Into these hands falls the Stars' season. Of
course, that's overstating it. Has to be, right? For one player
doesn't a team or a season make. But defenseman Derian Hatcher is
out until at least the All-Star break _ Shawn Chambers is too _ and
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has said it's between now and then that
seasons are defined. So, in many ways, the season has fallen into
Matvichuk's hands because, in many ways, Hatcher's responsibilities
have fallen to Matvichuk. So, maybe, it's not overstating it at
all. ``Knowing that Hatch's out and Chambers's out, I think of
course it lays on my shoulders,'' said Matvichuk, 26. ``I think
with the things that are going on now I do have to contribute a
little more in every aspect of the game for this defensive corps to
work.'' Of course, a couple of years ago, the Stars would have had
to think twice about putting the keys to their car _ much less the
season _ in Matvichuk's hands. It wasn't that he was irresponsible;
that's too harsh of a word. He was just a kid, not so much in age,
but in action. His motto was to live day today and make sure to
have fun doing it. He did. He had a new car every month, a new boat
every year and a carefree attitude well-suited to enjoying life.
``If somebody had asked me if I could be a leader a couple of years
ago I would've said `No,' '' Matvichuk admitted. ``Obviously, my
maturity level has gone up a bit just from living. I don't think
there has been any one experience. You live by experience. You live
with your mistakes and learn from them and then just move on. And
after a while, that slowly changes you.'' His mistakes have been
not unlike those most people make when they're young. Nothing ever
serious, just little things that looking back now he says he wished
he had handled differently. Consequences, too, fall into his
learning curve. He's going through changes in his personal life as
a result. He has started saving so he doesn't wind up broke. He has
had his two trucks for more than a year. He, in essence, has
started to grow up. ``I think in this day and age in sports if you
want to be a responsible player on the ice you have to be a
responsible person off of the ice,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``How much better Richard gets on the ice will be a direct
reflection of maturity in dealing with critical issues off the
ice.'' So far, so good. With Hatcher gone, Matvichuk has become Mr.
Maturity. This season, he is average 23 minutes, 32 seconds per
game, adding game by game to his 74 blocked shots and 98 hits. He
has looked a lot like the player he said he was during contract
negotiations this summer, physically dominating and defensively
so, of course, missed all of training camp in a contract
dispute then reached a deal with the Stars on opening night. were
haggling over what was fair before finally agreeing to terms on
opening night. ] Maybe, that too, was a sign of his maturity. ``Oh,
for sure, contracts are all about ego,'' Matvichuk admitted. ``You
always know what everybody else is making and hope you can make
that much, too. But eventually you have to sit down and look in the
mirror and realize that I'm not the player Derian Hatcher is now.
``But put us together, him and me, and we are one of the best
pairings in the league at shutting down the opposition's top
line.'' Hatcher and Matvichuk. Matvichuk and Hatcher. The
conjunction is almost automatic now. They've been playing together
so long that it's hard not to picture them together. They've been
friends even longer. ``What these two guys had was older guys
helping them,'' Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson said. ``\RFormer
Stars defenseman\S Craig Ludwig was very instrumental. His voice
and his leadership allowed them to grow.'' Hatcher grew a little
faster, but Matvichuk improved every season, Stars general manager
Bob Gainey said. On such smaller steps, the team's hopes for him
were staked. Patience, albeit at times frustrating, has proved to
be rewarding. Matvichuk has taken on a Ludwig-esque role with young
defenders such as Brad Lukowich and Richard Jackman. When Hitchcock
benched Lukowich recently, Lukowich spent the game watching
Matvichuk. ``I watched Matty to see what little things I would try
to do and what he did,'' Lukowich said. ``There wasn't a lot of
difference. It was just a matter of it was done with authority by
him. If we needed the puck out, he did it really hard where maybe I
was a little bit soft.'' Leadership, responsibility, a living room
with furniture, say it isn't so? Has Matvichuk really grown up?
``Are you kidding me?'' Matvichuk asked, laughing hysterically as
he said it. His laugh boomed through the room like a fire alarm,
unmistakable and impossible to ignore. Yes, he's grown up, but
there's enough youngster left to make him fun. ``They're not in the
living room anymore,'' Matvichuk said of his toys, ``but don't
worry, I'm going to find a spot.'' nn

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ A source close to the Mavericks said the team
has made Dennis Rodman an offer, and the 6-foot-8 forward will be a
member of the Mavericks by the end of the week if he wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all up to Rodman now,'' the source said. ``But Dennis is
trying to see what else is out there first before he makes a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman hasn't played since late last season when he was with the
Los Angeles Lakers. He quickly wore out his welcome in LA,
prompting his outright release.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has been a disruptive force during his stops with the
Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles
Lakers. That's why three Mavericks sources, including two players,
wonder why the team would even consider signing the Dallas native.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very young team, so I don't understand why we're
even considering someone with his background,'' said a player, who
requested anonymity. ``I guess he'll be flying to Vegas between
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source wonders what influence Rodman would have on the
young Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he might put a few more seats in our building, and he'll
grab some rebounds,'' another player said. ``But is it worth
risking what we're trying to build, especially with our new owner
taking over?''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban said he has no clue
whether the team will sign Rodman. He said he is leaving the
decision to coach/general manager Don Nelson, who doesn't discuss
personnel moves before they are finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's been decided, and nothing's definite,'' Cuban said.
``We're just looking at our options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we'll consider it. But the final call is in
Nellie's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the situation questioned whether Rodman
could abide by team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if Rodman doesn't come to practice, does that mean Gary
\RTrent\S is not going to want to practice, or one of the other
players don't want to practice?,'' a source asked. ``So my gut
feeling is  not going to happen.'' nn

MAVERICKS' SALE COULD BE FINAL THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ To his surprise, Mark Cuban expects the sale of
the Mavericks to be completed by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, who agreed to purchase the Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr.
on Jan. 3 for an NBA-record $280 million, originally thought the
transfer wouldn't take place until March. But lawyers for both
sides have moved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the other pieces of the contract have happened sooner
than we thought,'' Cuban said. ``The final contract will be
approved this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Board of Governors must give the final approval on the
sale, but Cuban expects that to be nothing more than a rubber-stamp
deal because he has been well-received around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is also slated to have lunch today with former Mavericks
guard Derek Harper and will offer Harper a front-office position in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with some sales people \Ryesterday\S, and I'll meet with
the rest of them \Rtoday\S,'' Cuban said. ``But we're just rocking
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks players like Cuban's infectious attitude and the
way he is always energizing the crowd from his baseline seat while
wearing slacks and a shirt. The players noticed Cuban has a much
different persona than the staid Perot, who was usually dressed in
a business suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban just has the ability to make everybody else smile and
get up with him,'' forward Cedric Ceballos said. ``He's just a
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets you geared up and gets everybody in the crowd geared
up, and you've got to love that about a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos said that's not to discount what Perot brought to the
Mavericks organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take away from what Perot did,'' Ceballos said. ``He
did the things, business-wise, that he's supposed to do as an
owner, and we enjoyed playing for Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you've got an owner jumping and screaming and getting
on the referees, it gets you going. It's a booster.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has often gauged the pulse of the Mavericks' fans by
hanging out with them and buying them beers in the Mavericks Club
after home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been great, and we've been really getting a
good buzz,'' Cuban said. ``People realize we're going to turn this
thing around, so it's been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been packed in the Mavericks Club. We've had more people
in there than in the Stars Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley even noticed the playoff-type atmosphere
the Mavericks acquired during home games last week against Utah and
Atlanta. He also has noticed Cuban near the Mavericks' bench
pumping his fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an enthusiastic owner and a fan,'' Finley said. ``With
him out there supporting us like he is as an owner, it makes us
feel a little bit more comfortable going out there knowing that he
has our back 100 percent, not only as a owner, but as a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the sale of the Mavericks is transferred from Perot
to Cuban, the latter expects the NBA Board of Governors to act
quickly on approving the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited, and we're going to try to get that way all
the time,'' Cuban said. ``Tell everybody the buzz is back.'' nn

DEFENDING CHAMP UCONN SCHOOLS TEXAS ON CONSISTENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Texas has played some of the best teams in
nation but in the past month has failed to play consistently with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns rallied from a 17-point deficit eight minutes into
the second half against Connecticut last night and pulled to within
four points with just under 26 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending NCAA champions held on in championship form to
rescue a 77-67 victory before 16,294 packed into the Hartford Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   After early victories over ranked Michigan State and DePaul, the
Longhorns (9-4) have dropped games to Arizona at home and to
unranked Wisconsin and Utah on the road. Last night's loss leaves
the Longhorns 2-2 against Top 25 teams, but still searching for the
kind of offensive consistency that will make them a strong
contender in the national picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows us what a national championship team is,'' said
Texas center Chris Mihm, who scored all but two of his team-high 18
points in the second half. ``But at the same time, we felt
confident we could play at their level. We could have played better
than we did tonight, but it was a fantastic game, and we have to
learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 36-29 at the half, Texas was snowed by the Huskies early in
the second half. UConn hit its first eight shots and 10 of 12 and
roared to a game-high 56-39 lead with 12:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Huskies cooled down and Texas began to cook,
getting out in the open court and attacking the basket and then
Mihm found the mark, scoring eight of nine at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got to 61-56, but UConn guard Khalid El-Amin popped a
3-point shot from the left corner at the 3-minute mark to slow the
charge. Trailing 67-62 after Darren Kelly's 12-foot jumper with 57
seconds left, Texas had to foul to get possession. The Huskies
responded by making eight consecutive shots from the line and the
closest Texas got was 71-67 on Ivan Wagner's trey with 25.7 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we realize we can defend and we didn't quit,'' UT
coach Rick Barnes said. ``But what we take from this is the
realization that UConn definitely plays harder than we do on the
offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Connecticut played their best game, and I know
we can play better. This will be a good experience for us because
as I told the guys, they play hard. We have to play harder. I hate
to lose a game for us to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half got away from Texas in the last five minutes,
shortly after Wagner's 3-pointer gave the Longhorns a 23-22
advantage. Mihm picked up his second foul and went to the bench at
4:54 and Kevin Freeman tied it with one of two free throws. From
that point, UConn put up an 11-2 run for the biggest lead of the
half at 34-25 at 1:28. But Gabe Muoneke converted inside with 43
seconds left _ for the first UT basket since Wagner's three at 5:19
_ and Will Clay scored a running 6-foot jumper with 26 seconds
left. Souleyman Ware's two free throws with nine seconds left gave
the Huskies a 36-29 edge in a half marred by 24 fouls that
prevented either team from establishing much of an offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies contributed to Texas' poor shooting by blocking nine
shots in the half, including three by Mihm. For the game, UConn
blocked 11.
</P>
<P>
   Huskies' guard Albert Mouring led with a game-high 21 points as
UConn shot a warm 53.8 percent in the second half and 44.4 percent
in the game. Texas shot a season-low 33.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a teriffic job on defense,'' said Jim
Calhoun. ``I think we did it the hard way.''

TEXAS' TRIP EAST FITS GRAND PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The timing might not be exactly right for
Texas' game here tonight against defending national champion
Connecticut, but it's all a part of the master plan of Longhorns'
coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the timing good? Probably not,'' Barnes said. ``But it's a
nationally televised game \R8 p.m., ESPN\S and something I felt we
needed to do because of where we are with our program. For us to be
the kind of team and program that we want to be, we've got to go
play the best.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can question Barnes' desire to play top-notch competition
as he builds his program toward an expressed desire to win a
national championship. Texas (9-3) is 2-1 in games against Top 25
teams this season. The Longhorns have defeated Michigan State and
DePaul and lost by seven to Arizona. They have also lost road games
at Utah and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But to play the Huskies (11-2) tonight, Texas must break the
concentration of focusing on Big 12 wars. The Longhorns defeated
Baylor Thursday in their Big 12 opener and play at Texas A&AMP;M on
Wednesday. But the desire to play Connecticut overshadowed the
less-than-ideal January road trip to the East.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Connecticut attempted to work out a date in November
or December, but previously scheduled games and arena availability
left Texas in a take-it-or-leave-it position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're really concentrating on starting the
conference season,'' center Chris Mihm of Texas said. ``But anytime
you get a chance to play a game like this against the defending
national champion in a Big Monday game, it's an exciting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great chance to see how we stack up against the rest of
the nation again. We're really looking forward to it. And we'll be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would be disappointed if the Longhorns weren't
approaching tonight's tipoff in the Hartford Civic Center with
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a chance like this, it's something you've got
to want to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-ranked Connecticut bounced back Saturday from last week's
shocking loss against Notre Dame at the Civic Center. The Huskies
recorded their 12th consecutive Big East road victory with a 73-51
triumph at Pittsburgh. The Huskies are deep and talented with
players such as forward Kevin Freeman and guards Khalid El-Amin and
Albert Mourning, whose 22 points led the victory at Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   The exposure will not be anything new for Mihm, Gabe Muoneke and
Ivan Wagner _ the veterans from last season's Big 12 regular-season
championship team. But Barnes is working this season with a lineup
that has expanded to a 10-player rotation. Five of those players
have never played a Big 12 road game and for that reason, Barnes
said this game might fit better into the season's scheme of things
than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this \Rnonconference scheduling\S was done with one thing
in mind,'' Barnes said. ``And that's to go on the road to places
where it's as hard as it can be to win because of the tough places
we have to play on the road \Rin the Big 12\S. It will be
interesting to see how we handle this situation. We have a brutal
schedule. But it's going to help us.''

AOL WANTS WARNER BROS. CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ The proposed merger between America Online and Time
Warner Inc. could bring a new wave of activity to the historic
Warner Bros. studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Warner Bros. products _ including television and cable
programming, music and movies _ is part of the driving force behind
what would be the largest corporate merger in history, analysts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those products, called ``content'' in the Internet arena, will
take center stage in the new, multibillion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the merger really reflects the importance of content
and content brands in this battle for the Internet,'' said Michael
Wolf, senior partner at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, a New York-based
management and technology consulting firm. ``Time Warner has one of
the biggest libraries of branded content of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that content is made at Burbank-based Warner Bros.,
where on any given day between 8,000 and 10,000 workers, many of
them contract workers, help create an array of entertainment
products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its huge library of feature films, the studio
produces top television shows, music and movies. Its recent
products include `The Green Mile'' and ``Any Given Sunday,'' the
television shows ``ER'' and ``The West Wing,'' and recording
artists such as Madonna and the Goo Goo Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' products will remedy AOL's ongoing difficulty in
getting good content for its subscribers, according to analyst
Steve Cesinger of Los Angeles-based Greif &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Warner Bros., they're a premier content
provider in every arena,'' Cesinger said. ``This just allows AOL to
have a direct pipeline of content to put on their site.''
</P>
<P>
   Looney Tunes characters, for example, could help draw viewers to
AOL's sites devoted to children's entertainment. AOL could also
host the official ``ER'' Web site, attracting more advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $162 billion stock deal, if approved by regulators
and stockholders, also would benefit Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's two Internet services, America Online and CompuServe, have
more than 22.2 million subscribers. Those members would provide a
huge market for Warner Bros. products.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also would give Warner access to AOL's established
e-commerce infrastructure, saving millions of dollars in
development costs, according to company spokeswoman Barbara
Brogliatti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us right at the forefront,'' she said. ``It
accelerates our efforts in the digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those efforts, Brogliatti said, is the creation of
original programming for the Internet, an arena that analysts say
is poised for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cesinger, the Greif &AMP; Co. analyst, said Warner Bros. could see
business boom if the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were on the studio side, I would think that activity is
going to rev up,'' he said. ``I would think this gives Time Warner
a great engine for growth.''!dlim!!end!

USC'S TREPAGNIER SHOWS HE CAN LEAP INTO BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine still remembers
watching the errant lob pass against Wyoming last season. He got
ready to dive off the court, hoping to save the ball before it
landed out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The ball never got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff catches it out of nowhere and one-handed dunks it,''
Scalabrine said. ``I was sure the ball was going out of bounds and
he caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff'' is USC guard Jeff Trepagnier, a 6-foot-4 junior whose
40-inch vertical leap and extraordinary quickness routinely provide
plays that his teammates never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff breaks all basketball rules,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   That play was just one against Wyoming in the National
Invitation Tournament last season, when Trepagnier had 24 points
and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was another play where Brandon (Granville) threw a full-
court pass to Jeff,'' Scalabrine recalls. ``If you look at the
videotape, Jeff is even with the ball at midcourt. But he beat the
ball to the basket. He is faster than the ball itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite often, it appears that way. Trepagnier is averaging 4.4
steals per game, the second-best mark in the nation, and is gaining
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Trepagnier is as good an athlete as we've played against
and he's got courage too,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said after
playing the Trojans in the Wooden Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Want more proof? Trepagnier decided on a lark last spring to try
the high jump, a way to spend more time with his girlfriend, USC
sprinter Malika Edmonson. In his first competition, he won the
USC-UCLA dual meet with a jump of 6-feet-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``She teased me because she said I got all the publicity,''
Trepagnier said. ``She was jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier followed that by placing second at the Pacific-10
Conference championships with a jump of 7-feet-.
</P>
<P>
   ``He so readily picked up things that take others a lot more
time to grasp,'' USC track coach Ron Allice said. ``That goes
beyond his great vertical leaping ability. He certainly could jump
7-5 or 7-6.''
</P>
<P>
   College has been quite a step, or perhaps jump, forward for
Trepagnier, a soft-spoken 20-year-old from Compton who was not
heavily recruited out of high school. USC coach Henry Bibby has
said he took Trepagnier against the advice of his staff, a decision
no one regrets today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our most talented player by far,'' Bibby said. ``He has
speed, hands, leaping ability and he's still learning to play
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 games, Trepagnier is averaging 15.8 points, 7.0 rebounds,
4.4 steals and playing 35.8 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   USC is even tracking his dunks. So far, he has 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't surprise myself in the game, but I surprise myself
when I watch the film,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier has a new role this year. He is USC's designated
defensive stopper, assigned to the opponent's best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for me, personally,'' Trepagnier said. ``I
try to do a defensive job. In the beginning of the year, the
coaches said they needed a stopper, so I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, who doesn't cheaply offer compliments about his players,
marvels at how Trepagnier manages to stay fresh in games, despite
rarely being substituted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jeff Trepagnier gets tired,'' Bibby said. ``He's
the only guy who can come in after off-days and run and look like
he doesn't get tired. He runs like he hasn't been off.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier still has a long way to go to become a complete
player, and every conversation about him inevitably turns to his
jump shot, which is viewed as the missing piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier shot just 27 percent from 3-point range last season,
and is back at 27 percent this season. It's probably the one issue
he gets asked about most besides his jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could do that, he wouldn't be here right now,''
Scalabrine said. ``But I think the media puts pressure on Jeff to
make jumpers, saying he could be a millionaire if he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier disagrees, saying he understands why people focus on
his jumpshot. He is the first to admit it needs to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me, because everyone asks me,'' Trepagnier
said. ``My jump shot hasn't fallen as much. It's OK, because I'm
not going to stop. They wouldn't know how to play me on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make it in the NBA, you have to shoot really good. I shoot
OK, but not good enough to go to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby also understands how vital a jump shot could be to
Trepagnier's future, not to mention USC's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to start believing he needs that. Right now, he doesn't
believe it totally,'' Bibby said. ``Everyone tells him how great he
is jumping. But he's improving. He has the green light to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sticky topic could be his future as a high jumper.
Trepagnier said he doesn't know if he'll do it again, and Bibby is
still perturbed over last spring's foray into track, feeling he
wasn't properly consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Trepagnier's high-jumping ability, Bibby said, ``I
have no comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Trepagnier would settle for two things: A
victory over UCLA on Wednesday at the Sports Arena, which would
vault the Trojans (9-5, 2-0) into sole possession of first place in
the Pac-10, and maybe a correct pronunciation of his last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game,'' Trepagnier said. ``They've won 10 straight.
I haven't beaten them yet. We'll be pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the name, it's pronounced ``Truh-pan-yea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever gets it right,'' Trepagnier said. ``In class,
commentators and stuff. But I'm used to it by now.''

DODGERS' GRUDZIELANEK MOVES TO SECOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers found their second baseman
and, quite likely, their leadoff hitter. He was under their noses
the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek, who became the first Dodgers shortstop since
1963 to hit .300 in a season, is the Dodgers' man. As winter
workouts commenced Monday at USC, the club announced Grudzielanek
was moving to second base. Manager Davey Johnson also spoke about
Grudzielanek's ability to bat leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   With Grudzielanek shifting sides of the infield, Jose Vizcaino,
Juan Castro and Alex Cora are left fighting for the starting
shortstop position. Cora is the early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, if you're moving a guy that hit .300 for you and
played pretty good at short, if you move (Grudzielanek) over there
you're not looking for a short-term fix over there,'' Johnson said.
``Our reports on Cora are really high. He's doing well in winter
(ball). Don Welke watched him for eight days. But it's a demanding
position, and if we're going to carry a guy like a Cora or Castro,
they have to be able to play the heck out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro and Cora are defensive specialists, but both lack
offensive firepower. However, Cora drew intrigue when he batted
.308 at Triple-A Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, making $3.5 million in the last year of his contract,
doesn't appear to fit the mold of a long-term replacement.
</P>
<P>
   While the move could be made without Grudzielanek's blessing, it
helps that he is now willing to make the move. Six months ago, that
wasn't the case. When he learned last season the Dodgers were
contemplating such a move, he said he didn't want any part of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers traded second baseman Eric Young last month,
Grudzielanek again said he wanted to remain at shortstop. But a few
weeks ago Johnson and Grudzielanek talked.
</P>
<P>
   With the free-agent market thin in second baseman, and the
Dodgers' feeling payroll burdens (yes, even at $85 million),
Grudzielanek became the Dodgers' best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know about the position is they say it's easier,''
Grudzielanek said. ``The thing is the pivot (on double plays).
Being able to pivot is the difference. I just have to wait and see.
I can't visualize what I can do there. But if they want me to play
second, I'll become one of the better second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want it to feel like a demotion, and talking to
Davey, and I talked to him and feel comfortable that they need me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is another thought in the industry. Moving
Grudzielanek to second base frees the Dodgers up for an anticipated
move after the 2000 season: a run at free-agent-to-be Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped Dodgers are also considered a year away from
contending for a World Series title, and moving Grudzielanek now
gives him a season to get comfortable at second base before
possibly teaming with Rodriguez in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek will begin working with former major-leaguer Bucky
Dent this week at Dent's baseball camp in Florida. A year ago
Grudzielanek worked with Dent and then turned in the best defensive
season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was steady. He committed 13 errors and showed more
range than anticipated. He also worked hard, and the Dodgers brass
believes that attitude will aid in his transition to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey made the transition from shortstop to second, and he's
confident Mark will be able to do it,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``We think his athleticism (makes this
possible). He's got good hands, good feet. I think Mark realized
this is what's best for the team, and he's committed to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek also may find his way back to the leadoff spot. His
.326 average was tops among Dodgers last season, but there are
questions about whether he can lead off. He walked just 31 times
last season and batted .277 with a .336 on-base percentage in 112
at-bats from the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Young, the Dodgers' leadoff hitter last season,
batted. 281 with a .371 on-base percentage. Young also stole 51
bases (he was caught 22 times) while Grudzielanek stole six bases
in 12 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Grudzielanek) showed me last year he could be more
selective,'' Johnson said. ``I'm hoping he'll narrow his strike
zone down. His on-base percentage was (.376), and he can do better.
I think he needs to keep working at it, reminding him.''

CHICAGO RUMOR: RICE FOR KUKOC?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another Glen Rice trade rumor is gaining momentum,
and this time the object of the purported deal is a player who
appeals to Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported Jackson has an interest in Bulls
forward Toni Kukoc. The Bulls reportedly would deal Kukoc for Rice,
then move Rice to obtain another player and a first-round draft
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson indicated there were no concrete plans to obtain Kukoc
but didn't dismiss the idea outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni could really contribute to this team, yeah,'' said
Jackson, who coached Kukoc in Chicago. ``That's a legitimate-type
addition to this team. I don't know the possibilities of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what role Kukoc might play here, Jackson said, ``I can't
even fathom it at this level, it's so hypothetical. We have to see
whether it's a reality or not.... I haven't talked to anybody from
Chicago. The coaching staff, I know they weren't pleased he was not
there, not part of that team (while he sat out injured for much of
the season). I did hear rumors of that he sat out so long, like
maybe he wouldn't be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't start the season well, he wasn't in shape to play.
But what has he done since he's been back three games?'' Jackson
said, noting the Bulls had won three straight since Kukoc's return.
``Pretty good. I don't think they want to get rid of him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc is a free agent at season's end and has indicated he might
return to Europe to finish out his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Worm watch: Dennis Rodman reportedly is discussing a deal with
the Dallas Mavericks, and that's fine with Jackson, who has ignored
Rodman's desperate overtures for a Lakers contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him,'' Jackson said. As for the
possibility Rodman might make one last appeal _ sign me now, or
lose your chance _ Jackson smiled and said, ``No, we don't feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did sound a bit puzzled by Dallas' reported interest in
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis will help anybody out,'' Jackson said, ``but he's the
kind of player who puts somebody over the top or adds a dimension
to a championship-bound team or a team that's bound for a long
distance in the playoffs,'' whereas the Mavericks are 10-23 and
headed nowhere.

THERE'S A RAREFIED AIR IN TORONTO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the season's mid-point, it is not a stretch to
say something special is happening in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is holding its 50th All-Star Game at the two-year-old
Air Canada Center on Feb. 6 and Maple Leafs Mats Sundin and Curtis
Joseph will be in the starting lineups for the World and North
American teams.
</P>
<P>
   But this is much more than a one-night stand.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is the top team in the Eastern Conference, on pace to
break the 100-point barrier for the first time in club history and
has a shot at its first NHL regular-season title since 1962-63.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate prize, of course, is the Stanley Cup, which the
Maple Leafs haven't won since 1967, when legendary coaches Punch
Imlach and Toe Blake of Montreal battled in the final season of the
six-team league.
</P>
<P>
   A fresher memory is 1993, when the Kings beat Toronto in the
Western Conference final and spoiled the much-anticipated rematch
between the Leafs and Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, new coach Pat Quinn took Toronto back to the
conference final, only to lose in five games to Buffalo. This year,
the Leafs' 55 points put them behind three teams in the West,
including overall leader Detroit. They also do not have a player in
the top 20 in scoring since Sundin missed much of the first month.
</P>
<P>
   But they reacquired one-time captain Wendel Clark on Sunday for
the third time in club history. He is the Leafs' all-time leading
playoff goal scorer with 33, but he also is 33 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The key has been CuJo.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, among the league leaders in victories (20),
goals-against average (2.20) and save percentage (.921), is being
mentioned as the league MVP. And the Leafs have added some defense
to their usually potent offense. They are 18-5-2 at home, where
they have been sold out all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that's unhappy with what we've done so far is being
unrealistic,'' assistant to the president Bill Watters said this
past week. ``We've got a ways to go in this season, however, we've
been very resilient in any slump we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Quinn's second trip to the All-Star Game and again
he'll be facing Scotty Bowman. Quinn's Campbell Conference stars
whipped Bowman's Wales team 4-1 at the Forum in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn was coaching Philadelphia at the time and moved onto the
Kings for 2{ seasons before bolting for Vancouver. He will be the
first Leafs coach since Imlach to coach an All-Star Game. Imlach's
defending Cup-champion Leafs beat the NHL stars 4-3 in the middle
of the '67-68 season, the last year the league used that format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at guys such as Mats Sundin and myself and realize
we're not getting any younger,'' winger Tie Domi said ``The time to
go for it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard times: Far from the playoff chase are the Atlanta Thrashers
and their goaltender, Damien Rhodes, who managed to get injured
while on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes had been out since suffering a high right ankle sprain
Nov. 17 vs. Tampa. Seems he was working out so hard with weights
that he tore cartilage in his right knee. That required surgery,
meaning he was wearing a cast on both legs.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff like that happens to expansion teams. So does bad
scheduling. Earlier this season the Thrashers had a road trip
against the New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning and New York
Rangers. Now, Atlanta is in the midst of back-to-back-to-back games
against the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gord Murphy, ``We were wondering. If we win the first two
games of the series, do we have to play the third?''
</P>
<P>
   They split the first two, with the third game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrying back: Florida goaltender Trevor Kidd, who sent shivers
through the league when he suffered a serious shoulder injury
during the Panthers' Dec. 13 Skills Competition, plans to skate
this week and hopes to be back in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not facing any shots and I won't start facing breakaways
the first time I'm on the ice, Kidd said recently. ``But I'm
getting a brace next week and I'll start skating and take it from
there. I'm just getting a workout that way versus riding the bike
so I can maintain my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is optimistic because he's already gotten his range of
motion back in his shoulder. He made the Panthers' West Coast trip,
including last Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Kings at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd will see his surgeon, Dr. James Andrews, in two or three
weeks. Before the injury, Kidd was 13-4-2 with a 2.08 goals against
average and league-best .930 save percentage.

STORR'S RECOVERY REACHES ICE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donald Audette is out two weeks with a sprained
ankle and Ziggy Palffy is day-to-day with a bad back. But the sight
of goaltender Jamie Storr practicing Monday for the first time in a
month gave Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray reason to smile.
</P>
<P>
   Storr is not due back for at least two weeks after suffering a
concussion Dec. 11 in Montreal. He still experienced some dizziness
during the practice, but the club already is considering getting
Storr some work next week at minor-league Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie is such a big part of this team that it just hasn't been
the same without him,'' Murray said. ``Stephane (Fiset) has done a
great job for us, but you really need both goalies to get you where
you want to go. When we had him healthy is when we played our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset will be in goal tonight when the Kings (18-15-7) face the
Ottawa Senators (21-14-6) at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Storr first was injured when he struck the back of his head on
the crossbar. He played poorly the next two games before doctors
diagnosed a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, Storr, who was NHL Player of the Week in early
December, was struggling with light workouts on an exercise
bicycle. But Murray said Storr responded better to some skating
without pads.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 games, Storr is 8-5-3 with a 2.71 goals-against average.
Fiset, who opened the season as the starting goaltender, is 9-9-4
with a 2.82 goals-against average. Storr took over after Fiset
missed five weeks with a bone bruise on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury to Jamie really messed us up for awhile,'' winger
Luc Robitaille said. ``We had to rush Steph back way too soon after
Jamie went out and it was a lot to ask. Hopefully, everything will
be back to normal soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of going to Long Beach usually would not excite
Storr, but now he sees it as part of the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been a time when I wouldn't have liked the
idea, but I have matured,'' Storr said. ``I have played well at
this level and know that going there is just part of the process of
playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Defenseman Garry Galley is ready to return after
missing almost five weeks with a concussion. However, the improved
play of Jaroslav Modry will keep Galley on the bench tonight
against Ottawa. Modry, a healthy scratch most of the season, has
two goals and an assist in his last four games and has played solid
defense.... Glen Murray, who recorded the hardest slap shot in the
league this season (103.5 mph ) at Sunday's skills competition, has
been in a slump lately. Before scoring an empty-netter against
Florida last Thursday, he went 10 games without a goal. Before
that, Murray had eight goals in seven games, including three
two-goal games. ``I'm told he has always been a streaky scorer,''
Murray said. ``I think the empty netter will get him back on
track.'' With Audette sidelined, Murray will be playing with
Robitaille and Bryan Smolinski.

LAKERS' LUE FAN FAVORITE

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tyronn Lue's breakfast is delivered to him most
mornings the same way he dishes out passes. Crisply, cleanly and
with a keen sense of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Lue whips his sports utility vehicle into the fast-food
restaurant drive-thru and by the time he pulls up to the first
window, his egg sandwich with sausage and cheese, hash browns and
strawberry soda are waiting for him at the second window.
</P>
<P>
   He used to let his motor idle while he paid. But now he's waved
on through, turning on (but not over) a dime to be on his merry
way. It's a brakes-fast stop fit for a descendant of Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Money for nothing, eggs for free. That pretty much sums up Lue's
life these days as a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a bruise on a bone in his right knee, the second-year
player hasn't appeared in a game since Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the injury, Lue's playing time was curbed, on
account of all the guards _ Ron Harper, Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher,
Brian Shaw and John Celestand _ ahead of him in coach Phil
Jackson's pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into any theater and you'll find movies that run longer
than Lue has up and down the court this year. He has logged 164
minutes, none during the Los Angeles Lakers' current winning
streak, which they extended to 15 games Monday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' latest victim, Denver, was the team that originally
drafted Lue, with the 23rd overall pick, in 1998. The Nuggets
promptly shipped Lue to L.A. along with Tony Battie for Lakers bad
boy Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   Lue, 22, never has lamented the way things worked out, not even
when he was raring to play as a rookie and the Lakers stashed him
away on injured reserve for safekeeping with (wink, wink, nudge,
nudge) back spasms. He swears he'd rather be a lesser player on a
terrific team than a terrific player on a lesser team.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, only in L.A. could Lue be as big a celebrity as Broncos
punter Tom Rouen is in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with the Broncos in Colorado, the Lakers are so
hugely popular here the Backstreet Boys would have to take a
backseat to them.
</P>
<P>
   Lue right now is like A.J. McLean with a lingering case of
laryngitis. He draws special treatment wherever he goes even if
he's not performing.
</P>
<P>
   When Lue does return, you can bet the Staples Center crowd will
go hoarse yelling ``Looo, Looo, Looo.'' Lue has his own cult
following, much like Kurt Rambis, his coach for part of his rookie
season, did during his Lakers playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lue's allure is, unlike the stars surrounding him, he
doesn't seem so far beyond the reach of the common man. He's not
terrifyingly large like Shaquille O'Neal or oppressively guarded
like Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He reminds you more of Everyman than Superman. He is listed at
6-feet and looks 16 years old. ``I look 5-8,'' Lue said with a
shrug. ``People think I'm small, even though I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, people don't need vivid imaginations to picture
themselves running around in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jimmie Guest was pretty confident he could run up some
points on Lue. Guest, a Carson High senior who aspires to play
college basketball, showed up at a Lakers' practice at L.A.
Southwest College the other day, hoping to engage Bryant in a game
of half-court one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant told Guest he'd have to get by Lue first.
</P>
<P>
   So after practice, with Harper and John Salley looking on, Lue
took on Guest, who came appropriately attired, at least, in his
baggy purple and gold shorts and a Lakers t-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd it go?'' Bryant cried out a few minutes later, as Lue
was heading for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed him in seven straight times just like you do to me,''
Lue replied, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got to touch the ball, except to check it,'' Lue
elaborated to his cousin and roommate, Jay Carter, a little while
later while recounting howned away the uninvited Guest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Lue were flopped on the furniture in the Culver City
townhome Lue is renting from Van Exel, trying to decided which of
their favorite hangouts to visit for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a place to eat, dress codes are more of a
consideration than the quality of the food. Lue won't go anywhere
his baggy gray sweat outfit isn't welcomed. Lue doesn't like to
dress up, much to the consternation of O'Neal, who is on him like
Mr. Blackwell. (``He makes too much money to dress in sweats,''
O'Neal said of Lue, who will earn $722,000 in the second year of a
three-year guaranteed contract.)
</P>
<P>
   Lue, Carter and a friend visiting from their home state of
Missouri decided on a restaurant in the Marina that's known for its
huge portions and waits as drawn out as the fourth quarter of a
typical NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone with Lue has to worry about fainting from hunger
while standing in line for a table. No matter how crowded the place
is, he always is seated promptly.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way mostly everywhere he has gone in L.A. since
he got into a game against Utah at the Forum last year, made a few
crisp passes and a couple of nice drives to the basket and won over
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, everything changed,'' Lue said. ``The next day I
went to a Clippers game and every one came down and wanted my
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lue's surprise and mild amusement, his 15-minute contract
with fame keeps getting rolled over automatically, without him
having to so much as lift a finger. Last October, Carter
accompanied Lue to a signing appearance at a shoe store in West
Covina.
</P>
<P>
   They stepped out of a limousine provided by the sneaker company
Lue represents and were mobbed by a few hundred fans.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-aged girl started crying hysterically. Carter thought she
was going to faint. He couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Lue took it all in stride. He signed for every fan, staying an
hour later than he was supposed to, signing without pause, in order
to accommodate everyone.
</P>
<P>
   As he well knows, breakfasts are free but fame does have a
price.

BRYANT SPARKLES AS LAKERS' STREAK REACHES 15
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Has the crowd stopped gasping for air yet? Has the
wave stopped? Did they wake up this morning with visions of Kobe
Bryant's acrobatics still dancing in their heads?
</P>
<P>
   Have the Los Angeles Lakers ever looked better? And will the
Denver Nuggets ever recover?
</P>
<P>
   In a season already filled with superlatives, the Lakers reached
yet new heights Monday night _ and in Bryant's case, quite
literally, as he glided and dunked the Nuggets into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 30 points, 27 in the first half, and almost all of
it in dazzling fashion, as the Lakers rolled to a 130-95 victory at
Staples Center, extending their winning streak to 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 72-point first half put the Nuggets away, and
Bryant's dunk, pass and shoot clinic simply destroyed their morale.
Michael Jordan was present for the events, but coach Phil Jackson
had a loftier comparison in mind when assessing Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Michelangelo tonight in many ways,'' Jackson said. ``He
did some beautiful things out there on the court. He had a great
sense of awareness, his timing was great, defense, and he did some
offensive things that were spectacular. He was a step ahead of
everybody else at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's night also included four steals, four assists and seven
rebounds in 36 minutes, as he made up for lost time and a lost game
_ the Lakers were defeated at Denver when Bryant was injured in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 130 points and margin of victory were both season
highs. So was the 43-point first quarter and the 72-point first
half.
</P>
<P>
   One almost didn't notice the Lakers' other MVP candidate just
miss a triple-double _ Shaquille O'Neal finished with ts, 19
rebounds, a career-high nine assists and five blocked shots in just
32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to go. We just wanted to bury them, try to put
this game out of reach,'' Bryant said, ``and by getting the crowd
involved, hopefully I can demoralize them a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant dunked for his first points of the night, stuffed a
breakaway, 180-degree jam for his second score and hit a pull-up
3-pointer to show off his perimeter game, and the 18,997 in
attendance could hardly contain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3-pointer and a fadeaway later, and the Lakers had taken
a 43-18 lead by the end of one quarter. Bryant was 7 for 7 from the
field and had 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, he opened the second quarter by dribbling out to
the arc and turning around to his another 3-pointer. He fed a
behind-the-back pass to baseline-driving Devean George on the fast
break. He finished another break with a one-handed jam.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if to show there's nothing he can't do, Bryant drained
a 34-footer as the shot clock expired to close out the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe was unbelievable,'' Nuggets coach Dan Issel said. ``I
mean, when he shoots a jump shot from halfcourt and it goes in, you
just kind of know it's his night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson advised the 21-year-old to let the game come to him in
the second half, and a calm, methodical Bryant slowed the pace
before turning the reins over to the bench. By then, the Nuggets
were deflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take the wind out of another team,'' Glen Rice, who
scored 19 points, said of Bryant's performance. ``One of the things
we try not to do is get into a lull by watching him, but it was
kind of hard not to. I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   So The Streak rolls on, and though logic says it must end
somewhere, the Lakers' play suggests they might make history. But
they need 18 more victories to reach the NBA-record 33-game streak
set by the 1971-72 Lakers. And Jackson doesn't see that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I don't think it's possible anymore,'' he said. ``That
year (when the Lakers won 33) there were three expansion teams in
the league, and it really changed the league. There was still the
ABA in existence at that time, so there were 28 or 30 teams ... and
then a dilution of talent that one year, and it changed a lot of
things that were going around.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson never envisioned a 15-game streak either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we talked about 10,'' he said.

 COSTS OF LIVERMORE LASERS PREDICTED TO GROW  &HT;     By BERNADETTE TANSEY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Delays and cost overruns on Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory's superlaser project may mount even higher
under a plan released Monday by a task force assigned to get the
work back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Although the panel found no technical ``showstoppers'' that
would prevent the National Ignition Facility from eventually
meeting its design goals, a Nobel Prize winner on the task force
described that outcome as ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member advisory panel fielded by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said the Energy Department should push back the date for
completion of the ignition facility until 2008 _ five years past
its original deadline and well beyond the additional 12 to 18
months estimated by lab officials when they disclosed the project's
problems last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said it could not yet calculate the bill for
completing the stadium-sized superlaser array, which has already
been estimated at $350 million over budget.
</P>
<P>
   In June, lab officials reported the project on time and within
its $1.2 billion budget, but by September they revealed to the
Department of Energy they had run into formidable technical
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium-sized ignition facility was conceived as a way to
gauge the reliability of the nation's nuclear arsenal without the
need for underground testing, by simulating the energy of a nuclear
blast using the world's most powerful laser array.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's interim report suggested several measures that could
boost the cost further, including a 35 percent contingency budget,
more resources for technical research and the use of an outside
contract management firm to supervise completion of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the task force, John McTague, said the 15
percent contingency budget originally allowed would be appropriate
for an apartment building, not a cutting-edge project like the
ignition facility.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said Lawrence Livermore should install the
optical elements for only half of the planned 192 laser beamlines,
then test the first group of 96 during a hiatus of about two years
before installing the others by 2008 or later.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the first bank of lasers is installed by 2004,
low-energy weapons-related experiments could begin for the Energy
Department's nuclear Stockpile Stewardship Program. But the report
suggests that the low-energy experiments would satisfy the
department's needs only until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department spokesman Matt Donoghue said the department
would have no comment until a final report is submitted from the
Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, which will review the task
force's final conclusions. The Energy Department must win approval
from Congress for NIF's new budget.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups said the interim report skirted the essential
question: whether the experimental array of 192 lasers will ever
work as designed to achieve a controlled thermonuclear reaction in
tiny targets of radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
   Marylia Kelley of the anti-nuclear group Tri-Valley Communities
Against a Radioactive Environment said the report gave short shrift
to significant problems with the laser optics for the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected that this report more clearly delineate
these problems that may in fact be showstoppers,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Paine of the National Resources Defense Council said
the task force should have recommended performance testing on a
single laser beamline before constructing a 96-beam array.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're making an open-ended endorsement for a system of
potentially infinite cost,'' Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Richter, a member of the task force and a Nobel
Prize-winning Stanford physics professor, blasted critics who
called the report superficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard-hitting report,'' said Richter, who pointed to
passages strongly faulting the management of the project by the
lab, the Department of Energy and the University of California,
which operates Lawrence Livermore for the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said the report did not underestimate the technical
problems that will initially force the lab to operate the laser
array at reduced power. Unless those problems are solved, the
optics could be damaged if operated at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The report) says that laser intensity at half the design
level is a shoo-in, but anything else is quite risky,'' Richter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lab director Bruce Tarter declined to comment on the task
force's early recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we agree (with the report) that NIF is one of the
most vital facilities in the Stockpile Stewardship Program,''
Tarter said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force's final report is expected in early spring.

 ROLLER COASTERS LINKED TO BLOOD CLOTS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monster roller coasters are breaking records all over the world
in what aficionados are calling a new golden age of thrill rides.
But now doctors are warning that the excitement may come at the
price of dangerous blood clots on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The latest case, reported Tuesday in a leading medical journal,
describes a 24-year-old Japanese woman who suffered a mysterious,
four-day headache after riding the Fujiyama, rated until recently
the highest and fastest roller coaster in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors initially diagnosed the woman as suffering from tension
headache and prescribed muscle relaxants. But when the headaches
continued, a brain scan confirmed the presence of blood clots,
known medically as subdural hematomas, on both sides of her brain.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had never had problems with headaches. And the doctors
concluded that because the headache began right after she left the
amusement park, the roller coasters most likely were the cause of
the rare blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's symptoms disappeared after the hematomas were
treated in a simple surgical procedure, according to an account of
the case in the latest issue of Neurology, the journal of the
American Academy of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous cases, reported in the United States, also were
treated successfully.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year-old man developed subdural hematomas after riding a
double-loop, corkscrew-type roller coaster. And a 64-year-old man
with high blood pressure suffered a headache after his first
coaster ride _ but still rode 11 more times, after which he, too,
was diagnosed with a blood clot on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   However, treatment is not always successful. Doctors report that
one 73-year-old man died, despite surgery, 13 days after a roller
coaster ride. The man was taking the blood thinner warfarin at the
time of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the reports of brain damage and ``roller coaster
headache'' are extremely rare, and none of them believe that the
risk is high enough to issue public warnings.
</P>
<P>
   But the cases still raise questions about thrill-ride safety as
amusement parks vie to build bigger, faster and scarier
attractions. ``The danger is low but not zero,'' said Dr. Lawrence
Pitts, professor of neurosurgery at the University of California at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He and other specialists recommend that anyone who suffers a new
type of headache after a roller coaster ride _ or other symptoms
such as unexplained nausea or vomiting _ seek medical advice.
Failure to treat the blood clots can cause permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding giant roller coasters can cause chronic subdural
hematoma even in a previously healthy woman,'' concluded
neurologist Toshio Fukatake of Chiba University School of Medicine
in Japan, lead author of the new case report. ``Builders and
designers, managers of amusement parks, and potential passengers on
giant roller coasters need to be aware of this risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious riders pooh-poohed the danger, reveling in what some
call an escalating ``arms race'' for roller coaster bragging
rights. ``I'm going to keep riding them and feel perfectly safe,''
said Bill Linkenheimer, president of an organization called
American Coaster Enthusiasts, based in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in fact, an unprecedented number of records are
expected to be broken in the roller coaster world, including the
tallest and fastest wooden coaster, the first vertical-spiral
coaster and even the first ``flying coaster'' _ the so-called
Project Stealth at Paramount's Great America.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Fujiyama, the ride that caused the Japanese woman's
brain blood clot, is being eclipsed by Superman the Escape, a ride
at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia that catapults riders to a
speed of 100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coasters are being built bigger, faster and wilder than ever
before,'' said Paul Ruben, North American editor of Park World
magazine and one of the world's leading coaster authorities.
``We're getting a wonderful variety of coasters today that our
grandparents never dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hoopla over super coasters, Ruben says the ``most
terrifying'' and dangerous coaster ever built was the infamous
Crystal Beach Cyclone, built in 1927 at Crystal Beach, Ontario. The
ride is the only coaster ever to have a full-time nurse on duty at
the loading platform. It featured a 97-foot drop, after which the
track veered 85 degrees to one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would lose false teeth, faint, there would be cracked
ribs,'' Ruben noted. But by the mid-'40s, more people were watching
the carnage than experiencing it, and the ride was replaced by the
somewhat more-sedate Crystal Beach Comet, now operating at Lake
George, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben said he was not worried about more brain hematomas from
the faster rides. ``There are exceptions to every rule, but in 57
years of riding coasters, I've never encountered anyone who had
significant ill effects other than losing their lunch.''

 &HT;    Rocker has chance for redemption
 &HT;    By Andrew Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 100 Percent Wrong Club, Atlanta's oldest black
sports club, should honor John Rocker for bringing his reactionary
attitudes into the open where they can be addressed in the Atlanta
style _ with humor, truth and reconciliation. After all, similar
insecurities and fears are just beneath the surface in many of us.
</P>
<P>
   We have never been perfect in Atlanta, but we've always reached
out to help one another broaden our perspective and vision and to
see our life together with new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the South, we have witnessed change in even George
Wallace. Why not Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the Martin Luther King holiday, it's appropriate
that we allow his life and teaching to affect our present-day
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Following lessons he learned from Mohandas Gandhi, King taught
his closest associates, including me, to always try to give your
adversary a ``face-saving'' way to become a partner in ending
segregation and racism. Rocker needs Atlanta to hand that kind of
face-saving way out to him.
</P>
<P>
   We could start by trying to understand what the young man was up
against when he confronted New York sports fans and that city's
ferocious press. Macon, the state of Georgia and the minor leagues
are no preparation for New York.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure as ambassador to the United Nations in the
1970s, the New York press even provoked me into a series of
headlines that served only to make my work more difficult. And
there was not the pressure of 60,000 sports fans shouting at me. I
know what it's like to be taunted, so it's not hard for me to walk
a mile in John's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   No one can defend the statements Rocker made to Sports
Illustrated, but we ought to understand them in the context of a
high-strung athlete who geared up for the victory and ended in the
agony of defeat. After the Braves lost the World Series, Rocker
experienced a rage and frustration that were real. It shouldn't
take a sports psychologist to decide that, yes, he was irrational
and explosive and when that happens, all of your deep-seated
prejudices and insecurities come to the surface. And let's not kid
ourselves, we all have them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the second thing we could do to give Rocker a hand in
extricating himself from this controversy _ recognizing our own
prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   As a young minister in the '50s I found myself in San
Francisco's Chinatown. Nothing about my Southern upbringing
prepared me for this. I was not prejudiced. I was trying to buy a
Mandarin dress for my wife, but I panicked. My neighborhood was
Negro, Italian, Irish, German, Polish, Cajun and Creole, but not
Asian. Chinatown aroused fears that I'd never faced, an emotional
angst that made me leave the store in a cold sweat and head back to
the security of my hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The multicultural conglomerate that is New York creates similar
anxieties of being in an alien climate in your own country. I've
seen white Americans indicate the same discomfort when alone in
black neighborhoods here in Atlanta and blacks similarly nervous
when in Miami Beach hotels that seem totally Hispanic. We're all
learning to live together with new understanding for a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Third, we can offer Rocker a support system, including the
opportunity to learn more about Atlanta's transformation from an
ambitious cotton and railroad town into an international city. He
would profit from a visit to the Martin Luther King Center. (And so
would the rest of the Braves.) Ted Turner has banned the use of the
word ``foreigner.'' In a global economy, we are increasingly one
people on planet earth. That message needs to reach us all.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rocker might learn something about dignity and
restraint in the face of vicious taunting by reading about the
experiences of Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, who endured the
indignities of segregation and ugly race-baiting during the 1940s,
'50s and '60s. The crowds and the atmosphere were a thousand times
worse for them than anything Rocker could ever imagine. Yet,
Robinson and Aaron never lost their cool.
</P>
<P>
   They were prepared by generations of training from their elders
in tolerance and restraint. There were religious and political
reasons for their self-discipline. They carried the hopes and
prayers of the race and nation. Success had to be earned on and off
the field, and they were never allowed to forget that.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is still young enough to change, young enough to be
redeemed, young enough to learn those lessons with help from his
teammates and the rest of the Atlanta community. When he absorbs
those lessons, he can throw 100 mile-per-hour strikes with a smile,
and we'll all win.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta, was one of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s lieutenants in the civil rights movement.

 &HT;    Campaign spotlight finds Bush well-cued
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ A quiet exchange between George W. Bush and a
Texas reporter here recently revealed more than any pundit could
about how the Texas governor's life has changed since he moved to
the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by police officers and sheriffs, Bush took the podium
and delivered brief remarks after winning their endorsement. Then
he conducted a news conference _ the roughly 15 minutes of
questioning he permits, usually daily, when he is on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   He wrapped up the Q&AMP;A session, then made his way through the
crowd. That's when the reporter sidled up, knowing he was breaking
an unwritten Bush campaign rule, one an aide is usually at the
candidate's elbow to enforce: limiting unguarded conversation
outside brief, scheduled news conferences and approved interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more question,'' the reporter said to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work that way anymore,'' the governor said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by onlookers, Bush answered the question that day.
But the exchange put the spotlight on how much more closely
controlled and tightly produced Bush has become as he has evolved
into the Republican presidential front-runner. Last week, a
planeload of reporters followed Bush from appearance to appearance.
While his chief rival, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, banters
almost nonstop with reporters aboard his bus, dubbed the ``Straight
Talk Express,'' Bush isn't traveling with the press in the jet the
campaign has chartered from a company named, ironically enough,
AccessAir. Bush is flying in a separate plane.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution from back-slapping governor _ a guy whom veteran
Texas reporters could freely visit in his office _ to tightly
scripted presidential candidate could not have happened smoothly
without a large, precise campaign advance team. They are the people
in every campaign who ensure that the candidate's performances come
off like first-rate theater productions as they move from state to
state and town to town.
</P>
<P>
   More than one veteran of campaign trail coverage have noticed
that some of the Bush team's advance work, such as issuing
reporters formal credentials for each event, looks remarkably like
the kind of thing they've seen when traveling with presidents.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't surprise former advance man Steve Diminuco, who
said Bush's advance team seems to be taking an approach not unlike
the one he and his colleagues used when they worked for President
Clinton. He left advance work in 1998 after more than a decade on
the road for Clinton and for a long list of Democrats, including
Austinite U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett's losing bid for a U.S. Senate
seat in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that when Governor Bush goes anywhere it's not
staged,'' Diminuco said. ``Everywhere he goes it's staged. I
shouldn't say `staged,' it's mapped out. Good advance people try to
create a picture, a picture of what the message is.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained the anatomy of an event such as the one in
Goffstown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say we're going to be tough on crime,'' Diminuco said.
``He's standing behind a podium making an announcement, and there's
going to be a bunch of police officers behind him. . . . We want
the reporters in a particular spot. And why are they going to be in
a particular spot? Because we want you to take that picture. I
always say, `Turn off the volume on the TV and, hopefully, you're
able to get some kind of message from just watching the pictures.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-odd wisecracking, gossiping reporters waited before five
armchairs and a coffee table recently in an otherwise empty room at
a New Hampshire boot-and-sportswear manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The TV guys pointed their long boom mikes at the living room
scene, certain that something would happen soon. The print
reporters, playing their part in the latest act of the ``Bush for
President'' road show, held notebooks and tape recorders. Annoyed
and bemused, they were all accustomed to waiting for the lights,
the camera, the action.
</P>
<P>
   And then the star arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed in a Timberland jacket, vigorously shaking hands and
</P>
<P>
   bantering, Bush took his seat on the stage set. Young people
outfitted in red jackets filed in with him. Bush was there to have
a brief chat about community involvement and corporate
responsibility with the young Americorps volunteers. Americorps is
a pet project of Jeffrey Swartz, president of Timberland Co., the
biggest employer in Stratham, N.H. It was a well-planned television
moment, but one with enough spontaneity to show Bush off to his
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cheatham, a 20-year-old from Boston, launched right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching you on BET (Black Entertainment Television),''
he told Bush. ``You were talking about your book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have been having a slow morning,'' Bush shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham smiled. Reporters and campaign staffers laughed.
Cameras rolled. It was vintage Bush, funny and self-deprecating,
the sort of moment that makes it all worthwhile for Brian
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery leads Bush's advance team. He also did advance work
for President George Bush and for Vice President Dan Quayle.
Montgomery's nine full-time staffers and 158 volunteers scout
locations for events, set the stage and lighting and provide the
props, down to organizing locals to paint signs and show up to wave
them. At a Stratham, N.H., dairy farm, an advance worker set feed
bags outside a split-rail fence, ensuring that the cows would
linger, painting a charming scene for the folks coming to meet the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Advance staffers help coordinate security and figure out how to
get Bush, a seemingly inexhaustible hand-shaker, out of crowded
events. (They call that ``extraction time.'') They work with local
campaign staffers and volunteers to drum up audiences for Bush's
appearances, and they tend to the care, feeding and _ most
importantly for the campaign _ the control of the growing multitude
of reporters who make up his permanent audience.
</P>
<P>
   Details count
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery doesn't like to talk about advance work in terms of
control or messages or pictures. Still, the folks running the Bush
campaign clearly understand the importance of detail and the power
of images.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush speaks, the Texas flag or seal is always front and
center. Trench coat-wearing Texas Rangers wear squiggly ear mikes
just like Secret Service agents. It all gives the campaign a
presidential ambience. Montgomery said that's because some of
Bush's advance team worked in President Bush's White House. Greg
Jenkins, who left his job as a Fox News Channel producer in August
to run media advance for the campaign, did White House advance for
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there any effort to emulate the current administration?''
Montgomery said. ``No, not really. I think everybody would have to
admit they've done a pretty good job in how they've positioned
(Clinton).''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery won't say what his budget is, just that it's ``enough
to get the job done, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, an advance team goes to work about a week
before Bush arrives. They whip up interest over the telephone or
even through direct mail. Word of mouth goes a long way, too,
Montgomery said. They also work closely with the people who
schedule Bush's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From staging and lighting and sound, where the crowd sits, the
backdrop. You name it, we're doing it,'' he said. ``Do we want to
start at a diner? At a local community center? We will block some
time out to do some impromptu stops. We might have four or five
things we're looking at. We might go over there in the morning,
maybe 30 minutes before (Bush) gets there. . . . In some cases,
we're making up our mind on the way there.''
</P>
<P>
   No detail is too small for attention. When former GOP contender
Lamar Alexander endorsed Bush at a Des Moines, Iowa, news
conference in mid-December, a can of Aqua Net hair spray turned out
to be a crucial backstage tool for the nation's most abundantly
funded primary campaign. While Bush waited in another room for
Alexander, campaign aides unleashed a fog of hair spray at a shiny
blue Bush campaign banner, the backdrop for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuts down the glare,'' said the spraying aide, motioning
toward the TV lights and cameras poised to capture the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of advance work helps makes a picture out of a
thousand words.
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton aide Paul Begala calls advance people ``traveling
road show experts; the political version of roadies.''
</P>
<P>
   He tips his hat to the Bush campaign for skillfully using
advance work to lodge Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' message
in voters' minds and to try to change the way many perceive the
Republican Party. ``He's always pictured with minority children,''
Begala said, pointing out that Democratic candidates have long made
such appearances. ``That's advance. They will make sure, when they
go to a school, that it's not lily-white. I like to tease them and
to criticize them, but that has been a leap forward for
Republicans. You watch, it's those subtle things that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick with assessing any campaign, he said, is to compare
the picture with the candidate's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very sensitive detector, voters do,'' Begala said.
``If they're interested, they'll look at the record. . . . If the
substance is at war with the style, people nowadays will figure
that out.''

lot of folks in Minnesota wouldn't be mad with her. I promised I
would.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel (who I swear is not Millie) has confessed to me that she,
acting entirely alone with aforethought but absolutely no malice,
did perpetrate the cruelest hoax to be foisted upon the free world
_ and Haiti _ since Orson Welles had us jumping from tall buildings
to avoid invading Martians back in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel invented Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   What came to be accepted as doomsday by a certain portion of the
world's population, began innocently enough a few years back in
southern Ohio when Hansel, Gretel's usually laid-back husband,
began grumbling about the freezer being so loaded down with garbage
bags full of un-ironed clothes that he couldn't find space for the
venison their son-in-law had brought from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel let his complaint slide. Since she had no plans for using
Aunt Deirdre's big tablecloth until Easter, and maybe not then if
Hansel could be talked into taking the whole family to Cracker
Barrel, she saw no point in digging it out of the freezer and
wasting an afternoon ironing it.
</P>
<P>
   But then when Gretel heard via the grapevine that Hansel had
been asking around the Moose Club for a garage to rent, she began
to worry. Seems he's also unhappy about having had to park his
Mercury under a particularly messy walnut tree for the past nine
years while Gretel kept stuffing more junk into the garage for what
might be her first annual garage sale if it ever came off.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon, Gretel feared, was probably over and maybe she'd
soon have to give up crossword puzzles and weaving teacups out of
pine needles and try to figure out where she'd put the ironing
board after doing up Hansel's dress shirt for their daughter's
wedding _ in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel insists that with more time she could have come up with a
better idea, and that she never meant for the whole thing to go
much beyond the neighbors down the road where they play pinochle on
alternating Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   This particular Friday, the game was at Gretel's kitchen table
which is how, over dessert and coffee, Hansel happened to point out
the fact that the adjustable calendar their daughter had given them
for Christmas in '78, didn't have a 2000 on it. The neighbor told
him he'd probably have to pick up a new one at the John Deere place
but Hansel said he'd really be sorry to see the old one go because
it'd been hanging over the stove for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel, sensing the opportunity of a lifetime, seized the moment
to announce there wasn't going to be a year 2000, in which case
there certainly would be no need for her to bother with the
ironing. It was good for a chuckle and a few ``what-ifs,'' she
says, but insists that's as far as she intended it to go.
</P>
<P>
   Gretel says now she was just as surprised as anybody else when
the whole thing got out of hand. Says before she knew it, the
impending non-disaster had a name (Y2K), and a bunch of folks in
Minnesota had started buying up Spam and toilets that didn't need
flushing. Then she really felt guilty when she read that generators
and dried apricots were outselling pizza and Pabst, and that stores
in Chicago had sold enough kerosene and propane to blow Wrigley
Field (and the Cubs) halfway to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A much chastened Gretel admits to being so frightened by the big
stink her little fib blew in that she's been glued to the ironing
board every day since the rollover. Says all that's left is Aunt
Deirdre's cutwork tablecloth and a couple of shirts she doubts will
button over Hansel's belly any more.
</P>
<P>
   Apologies aside, Gretel (who is definitely not Millie) does
admit that she IS a little sorry the power didn't go off _ at least
long enough for those garbage bags of ironing to thaw and spoil.

 &HT;    Video sleuth tapes hellacious fuss - over a bike helmet
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The man and the kid caught his eye the
second he came around the bend in the road. At first he thought it
was a father and son horsing around. Wrestling. Roughhousing.
</P>
<P>
   Then the whole thing started to register.
</P>
<P>
   The cop. The little kid. The handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Althouse, a private investigator whose passion for
recording stuff has pretty much turned into an obsession, pulled
his car over and grabbed his video camera.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, two minutes. Three, four, five. For 38 minutes _ off
and on to save tape _ Althouse recorded the sheriff's deputy and
the kid. Althouse moved from his spot just once _ when another
deputy came on the scene and parked in his view.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded as the deputy searched the kid's bike pack.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded as the deputy pushed the little boy back to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded as the deputy shouted for the family to stay back
unless they wanted more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded as the deputy uncuffed the boy and the child sat
quietly, staring at the ground, while the deputy wrote the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I didn't know what the kid had done,'' Althouse
said. It wasn't until the camera was off and the boy's mother had
walked by that Althouse found out what had caused the ruckus _ the
handcuffs, the four cop cars, the crowd, the shouting.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old boy hadn't been wearing a bike helmet. ``I didn't
believe her until I looked at the ticket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the things Althouse does for a living: He gets
things on tape. You and I might find this odd. We might have
regular hours and pick up a paycheck every Wednesday. But Althouse
is a paralegal and a private investigator with a quirky life that's
all topsy-turvy. He uses public records and police sources and
folks on the street to earn a modest income. He hands out cheap
business cards like candy.
</P>
<P>
   Althouse, 35, was just north of Boynton Beach, Fla., working for
William Miller &AMP; Assoc. and looking for a witness in an attempted
murder case, when he stumbled upon sheriff's deputy Ken Bachman and
9-year-old Jeffery Morgan. He'd just looked up something in his map
book and was studying the street signs when he saw Bachman, who is
white, cuffing the boy, who is black. Within seconds, he knew this
was something he wanted on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's a voyeur or anything,'' said Dean Willbur,
a West Palm Beach attorney who frequently hires Althouse. ``We
started doing this for a very specific reason, because we get so
many complaints (of police racism). Unless it's on videotape,
people don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's out there, Richard Althouse is, driving around town in
his tie and JCPenney's suit, eyes peeled, slugging Pepsi from the
bottle. And he wants us to know something. ``This stuff happens
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad I believe him.

 &HT;    Virtual portfolio builds skills
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lots of people want to invest in stocks but are too
scared to take the first step.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much to learn, a great deal of it expressed in
numbers and specialized vocabulary. There's the fear that you will
lose your money, mainly because you don't know what you're doing.
To be honest, there is also the fear that people will giggle or
smirk at your amateurishness.
</P>
<P>
   No question, picking your first stocks is an intimidating
process.
</P>
<P>
   One way to confront that fear is to build and track a virtual
portfolio _ an imaginary set of investments. Select five or 10
stocks you like and ``buy'' 100 shares of each one. That's your
virtual or practice portfolio. For the following weeks or months,
you monitor your stocks, keeping track of what happens to the
company and to its stock value.
</P>
<P>
   Note that no money changes hands. This is an exercise, one that
yields a sense of involvement but not a sense of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process gives you a framework for pursuing your
investment education. It also should be a motivator. ``The biggest
hurdle is making the commitment,'' observed Ken Wingerter, a
Robinson-Humphrey portfolio manager who is active in financial
education programs. ``Once you make the commitment, everything else
falls in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit is the potential for building self-confidence.
If your imaginary investments do well, any irrational fears will
become easier to understand and dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, your best choices may turn out to be terrible
ones.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of your education, too. If you discover that you are
a hopelessly bad stock picker, or too impulsive, or just not
interested in doing the work, then you must consider turning the
work over to somebody else. A mutual fund may be the best
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If you are doubtful about imaginary investing, note that
financial educators praise the idea. Tens of thousands of Georgia
schoolchildren participate in stock-picking competitions each year.
At the University of Georgia, a small group of honors students
began a similar project this semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their portfolios will be the learning tool,'' said Esther M.
Maddux, the certified financial planner who will conduct the
course. ``They will first write their investment strategy, pick the
companies they're going to follow and analyze them.'' The last step
will be each student's report on how he or she did _ and why.
</P>
<P>
   You can build a practice portfolio in the old, 20th century way,
with books and paper and pencil. There is plenty of stock-picking
advice in print, and you can find all you need at bigger libraries.
A good resource is Value Line, which includes detailed analyses,
regularly updated, on hundreds of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   To track your stocks, check the stock listing in your daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century electronic way is to use the Internet. You can
find hundreds of informational Web sites and dozens that help you
assemble and track a portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Invest-O-Rama may be the most comprehensive learning site. It is
a kind of electronic library, with links to many other sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Stock Exchange is my favorite for portfolio
building. It allows you to ``invest'' in just about any stocks you
like and to follow their prices for however long you want. The
service is free.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 people now use the site, including classes from
Harvard, Stanford and Cornell universities. Gary Cheng, vice
president of Virtual Stock Exchange, said that trainees at several
major brokerages also use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people want to bridge the gap between their
theories and their lives,'' Cheng said. ``This allows them to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also set up your own stock-picking competition, open
only to the friends, family members or co-workers you choose. That
gives yet another motivation for practice portfolios. ``It's
bragging rights,'' Cheng observed.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers believe practice portfolios are a good idea but
only as a steppingstone. ``You have to go through the stage of
self-education and learning,'' said Ron Meier, a financial planner
and faculty member at the College for Financial Planning in Denver.
``I encourage people to spend about a year learning before they
start making investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get frustrated, he added, if your imaginary investments do
well and you make no real money from them. ``You may feel like
you're losing some opportunities,'' he said. ``But those losses are
the tuition you pay so that you don't make huge mistakes later.''

 &HT;    Clean up for carpet residue depends on adhesive used
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Can't figure out who
</P>
<P>
   submitted one of the questions in this month's column, but I'm
answering it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hardwood after carpet: Someone wrote, called or e-mailed
saying he had taken up an old carpet and found the hardwood floor
underneath had been marred by the carpet backing. This person,
whose original query I have misplaced, wanted to know how to get
the floor looking good again.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: According to the Hardwood Manufacturers Association,
the first step in restoring a carpet-damaged wood floor is
determining what kind of adhesive was used when the carpet was
installed. Usually a dark- or tan-color adhesive is tar-based, and
mineral spirits can be used to remove it. A light or clear adhesive
(usually carpet tape) can be removed with an all-purpose adhesive
remover. A yellow-looking substance is generally carpet adhesive
and can be lightly scraped or easily chipped off, and an
all-purpose adhesive remover will work to remove the residue.
</P>
<P>
   Once the adhesive is removed, the floor can be sanded with a
coarse paper and then resanded with finer paper. In some cases,
carpeting over a hardwood floor is installed with wooden tack
strips along the edges. After the carpet has been removed and the
tack strips are pulled up, wood putty then can be used to fill the
holes. Extra sanding may be needed before finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Black heel marks and other stubborn spots on hardwood floors can
often be removed by rubbing gently with fine steel wool and the
solvent-based wax you usually use on the floor, according to the
Michigan State University Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   Dark spots are often caused by exposure to alkaline substances
that were allowed to dry on the floor. To get rid of these spots,
remove solvent-based wax with mineral spirits. Mineral spirits are
a flammable solvent, so be careful; have adequate ventilation and
be sure there is no spark or flame in the area. Apply white vinegar
to spots and leave it for three of four minutes; wipe dry with a
clean cloth. Repeat this procedure if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If several applications of vinegar do not remove the spot, you
might try a 4 percent oxalic-acid solution. When using oxalic acid,
which is poisonous, read the label and observe all cautions. If
oxalic-acid solution does not work, call in a professional floor
finisher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aluminum Christmas tree: V.S. of Dayton said she found an old
aluminum Christmas tree in storage and decided to display it for
Christmas. She had a color wheel when she first used the tree 40
years ago, but the wheel was lost or thrown out. She wondered if
she could put miniature lights directly on the branches of the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Putting electrical lights on the branches would be a
bad idea. For those too young to remember, when aluminum trees came
into fashion in the 1960s, they were sold with a floodlight with a
revolving wheel of colored plastic. As the wheel turned, the light
shone through the colors and cast them onto the highly reflective
tree. The reason a color wheel was used instead of the traditional
lights was that the aluminum tree posed an electrocution hazard,
according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. If any wires
in a string of lights became frayed, the current from the exposed
wire could be carried along the branches and trunk of the metallic
tree. Anyone touching the electrified tree could get a nasty shock.
_ Ceiling crack: S.G. of Centerville said the ceiling in his family
room has developed large hairline cracks in the dry wall. He's
tried to patch the cracks with drywall compound, but the cracks
develop again.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Gary Porter of the remodeling company G.A. Porter
Construction said a crack in the ceiling can be caused by a dozen
different problems. But if the cracks aren't severe, you might be
able to fix them permanently by patching them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sand the ceiling around the crack until you get down to virgin
drywall-board surface. Tape the area with flexible fiberglass
drywall tape. (Paper tape is inflexible and can encourage new
cracks.) Apply drywall compound according to instructions on the
package; that includes feathering, drying and sanding. Paint when
the drywall repair is complete, and the repair should hold.
</P>
<P>
   If the crack develops again, consider calling a professional to
find out what is causing stresses at that particular spot. If the
crack appears only in winter, it could be as simple as drying
caused by reduced indoor humidity. It could also be caused by
heating and cooling of the roof structures moving the ceiling
rafters in the room.
</P>
<P>
   More drastic fixes could be needed. One fix involves cutting out
a section of ceiling drywall two to four feet wide centering on the
crack. Install a new piece of drywall cut to fit the opening, and
tape the new seams with flexible tape, apply joint compound, sand
and paint.
</P>
<P>
   Another method would be to install an entirely new ceiling under
the old one. You would attach drywall panels through the old
ceiling using extra long drywall screws. Make sure the seams of the
new ceiling don't line up with the seams of the old or you may be
susceptible to the same stresses.

 &HT;    Best college essays `strike a chord'
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the time of year when John Lind's family
likes to tease him.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president for enrollment and management at Southwestern
University in Georgetown, Texas, is in the thick of application
season. Over the next few months, he'll take applications for
admission home every night, evaluating 10 to 20 on a typical
evening, more on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   His devotion to his work extends to reading essays on the way to
church Sunday morning _ with someone else driving, of course _ thus
earning the good-natured jokes from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Southwestern received 1,495 applications. Of these,
995 students were offered admission. Lind examined virtually every
application personally, doing either the first or second read on
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that tell me about the humanness of the person are
the ones I am most enamored with,'' Lind said. ``You get a lot of
things that are superficial,'' but Lind said it's worth it when you
come upon an essay where ``somebody goes into some depth and you
can see the growth occurring, where they learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   For admissions officers at colleges and universities across the
country, the next six to seven weeks are crunch time, akin to a tax
preparer's workload before April 15 or a sales associate's long
hours before Christmas. It's a particularly intense kind of work.
Consider that most people get burned out talking to three or four
job candidates or interviewing half a dozen prospective tenants for
a garage apartment. Think of examining hundreds or thousands of
applications each year, where your evaluation helps determine
someone's future. How do admissions officials stay fresh? How do
they make sure they're evaluating candidates fairly, and not
discriminating against a student because he or she had the bad luck
to be the 50th file they've read that week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, admissions workers say, is to pace yourself, have
good training and apply consistent standards. A built-in system
where more than one person, or even a committee of people, reads an
application also helps.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine Garza, deputy director of admissions at the University
of Texas, escapes the hubbub and interruptions at his office and
goes home to read essays. He is one of 20 admissions officials who
altogether will evaluate 16,000 250-word essays this year. Garza
examines seven to eight essays an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 20 years in the admissions business, Garza knows
what he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to approach each one individually,'' he said. He knows
that even though he may be looking at his 75th essay that week, for
the student, this is only one of the two essays she has written
that will affect whether they are admitted into the university.
``It's imperative that we be as fresh and as fair as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee consistency when you have 20 reviewers and
thousands of applicants at one of the largest universities in the
country, each reviewer goes through an annual eight-hour training
session with English professor Brian Breman. The training ensures
that each reader has the same standards, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, ``we don't try to reread and analyze each and
every line,'' Garza said. ``We're reading holistically, taking all
things into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the similarity of topics, genuine emotion or change
can show through. ``It's rare for essays to be so similar that we
become jaded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Manier, assistant director of admissions at St. Edward's
University, tries not to read more than three applications at one
sitting. After an hour and a half _ 30 minutes per application _
she'll take a break. Over the course of the day, ``once I start to
feel fatigued, I put it away and do something else,'' Manier said.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants to St. Edward's, unlike those to UT, are not given a
word limit on their essays, so they usually run two to three
typewritten pages, about 500 to 750 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really try to get to know the individual through the
application,'' Manier said. ``That's more difficult if the essay is
very general or if the recommendations aren't very descriptive.''
In a good essay, ``it's pretty easy to figure out how the student
ticks and what their values are and what distinguishes them, what's
important to them. What really impresses me is emotional maturity,
a student who is thinking about things that a normal 18-year-old
doesn't think about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Elizabeth H. Stanley, director of admissions at St.
Edward's, the reads go more easily because she is the second person
to evaluate each application.
</P>
<P>
   A team of counselors _ including Manier _ goes through most of
the applications before Stanley sees them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves me from burning out,'' she said. ``Our counselors are
very thorough.'' Still, Stanley reads each essay to get the flavor
of each student's personality _ and generally that means 2,000
essays a year.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the job easier for Stanley is her love of the
admissions process. ``You can't stay in this business if you don't
love what you do,'' Stanley said. ``You would go batty if you were
doing this and you hated it.''

 &HT;    Football's gaudy charade sugarcoats my blood sport
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Big excitement at the practical man's
house on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again by his wife and kids, who were whooping it
up in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Purdue University football team was in a bowl game! The
Boilermakers were kicking butt! Come watch your team, Dad!
</P>
<P>
   The practical man put down his Journal of O-Ring Dynamics to
peek at the screen, but he didn't see much of his alma mater on the
field. No engineers, no mathematicians, no computer scientists. Not
even a lowly lit major. Just a bunch of steroid-stoked jocks
trodding the tired ground of touchdowns and turnovers and taking
themselves way too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He tried, but it was impossible to care. So while he kept
everyone happy by keeping his eyes on the game, he kept himself
awake with a little meditation on the nation's favorite sport.
</P>
<P>
   He hated it. Why?
</P>
<P>
   True, it was a wee bit predictable _ run, pass, block, tackle,
all building to the same simplistic climax: one side wins, the
other loses. But that just made it boring, not irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the fans, those knuckleheads who cheer and boo so
passionately for events that have no effect on their lives? Nah.
They were a mystery, but not worthy of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Then it must be the hypocrisy. All those scholarship winners who
would never be scholars, all those prized pupils who spend their
college careers pumping iron, passing pigskins and failing classes.
But no. He couldn't blame a kid for taking a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man was stumped. Then his sons, stimulated by some
particularly violent collision on the field, began a scrimmage of
their own in the living room. This mismatch _ a 17-year-old against
a 12-year-old _ rumbled to its inevitable conclusion: The younger
one got hurt, bawled, forgot about football and started throwing
punches in a blind rage, while the older one laughed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, now, damn it. That's enough! `` the practical man
bellowed to break them up, and then he saw the light. The problem
with football was right before his eyes, and it was as simple as
this: Football is not boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the practical man is a boxing fan. There's little to
admire about two people beating each other up for money, but as far
as sports go, boxing has one thing to recommend it: It's practical.
</P>
<P>
   The point of sports, he reasoned, is to prove superior strength
and skill by exchanging blows with an opponent. These blows can be
delivered in various ways _ tennis rackets, golf clubs, ball bats,
long bombs, jump shots _ but the model for them all is the sock to
the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the beauty of boxing. It needs no sticks or balls or
hoops or goals, or any special playing areas or complicated sets of
rules. It knows those things are the phony accoutrements of
civilization, elaborate charades designed to disguise our primal
urge to kill as socially palatable pastimes. Boxing embraces the
black heart of competition openly and honestly, and thus, while it
will never gain his endorsement, it wins the practical man's
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Football, on the other hand, is a bogus and wasteful pretender
that requires at least 100 players and coaches, a half-dozen
referees, thousands of dollars worth of equipment, an acre of
painted ground, balls, tees, mascots, cheerleaders and a couple of
goal posts _ all to stage the same mock death match that boxing
pulls off with two guys and two pairs of $20 gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Good Lord, football was more extravagant than a new car! More
shameful than credit card debt! More offensive than a Neiman Marcus
catalog! No wonder he hated it.
</P>
<P>
   Comforted by his piercing insight, the practical man glanced
back at the game, closed his eyes, and slept.

 &HT;    Meditation brings not just peace of mind, but better health
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Morehouse School of Medicine professor Kofi
Kondwani closes his eyes, the scientific study begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the mantra and then we'll continue meditating for 20
minutes,'' he quietly tells eight people sitting around a boardroom
table in a downtown Atlanta corner office. Lights dimmed, the group
closes their eyes on cue.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes lots of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Only outside the wraparound windows does the day drone on. Eight
floors below, headlights stream down the avenue toward highways and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Around the table, heads grow heavy as if a huge snorefest is on
the meeting's agenda. No one is sleeping. But they are resting _
deeply _ while practicing transcendental meditation, based on an
ancient ritual of India. At the same time, they're contributing to
the expanding evidence of physical, mental and emotional benefits
of TM. So far, those benefits include reduced anxiety, increased
productivity and creativity, reduced hospitalization, decreased
stress and a slowdown of the aging process in longtime meditators.
</P>
<P>
   The participants learned the art of this type of meditation in
eight hours taught during four consecutive days, the structured
program brought to the United States 40 years ago by the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, founder of the Maharishi University of Management in
Fairfield, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple procedure done twice daily for 20 minutes at a
time,'' explains Kondwani, one of a handful of African-American TM
instructors and possibly the only professor of meditation on the
staff of an American medical school. ``You sit with your eyes
closed and learn to meditate using a sound that's inaudible. It's a
sound with no meaning that the teacher gives each individual. It
quiets the mind down. Your mind gets down to one thought, and then
that thought is tuned out, and then. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, Kondwani's group _ a teacher, a bus driver, a
government employee or two, a construction supervisor, mothers,
fathers and grandmothers _ falls into a deep rest, sitting up, that
may be more beneficial than the one they take nightly in a
horizontal position. Research has proven that during TM, a person's
heart rate and oxygen consumption decrease more than when he's
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   But what this group wants to see is a decline in dangerously
elevated blood pressure. Aside from being black, hypertension was
the other trait they shared before they learned how to close their
eyes and reach a state of consciousness dubbed ``restful
alertness.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is part of a $1 million, four-year study funded by the
National Institutes of Health to look at reducing hypertension in
older black men and women using nonmedical treatments: TM, anger
management classes or a program of diet and health education.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse is also conducting two other studies involving TM and
heart disease among African-Americans. The studies are overseen by
the Behavioral Medicine Research Center, directed by Charlie
Lollis, a Ph.D psychology researcher, and Dr. Elizabeth Ofili,
chief cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   So far, anecdotal testimony from the Morehouse-NIH study points
to TM's being more effective than the other two strategies.
Previous studies found it as effective as antihypertensive drugs in
lowering blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that ever happened to me,'' says Lenina
King, 43, who joined the Morehouse study last April. ``I've had
high blood pressure for five years, and I've been on so many
different medications to try and lower it, but only meditation
finally did. I went from 170 over 110 to 120 over 80. It's really
calmed me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Taylor, 52, who plays drums and who teaches music in
Atlanta schools, says he was disappointed at first that he wasn't
assigned to the health education and diet part of the study,
because he doubted that meditation would help. ``I really didn't
think it would work, but I know it's helping me out now. It's sort
of like floating on a wave, the patience it delivers and ability to
cope with things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as an art form. Once you learn it, you really
want to practice it. It doesn't mess with your religion and it
doesn't require nothing. And you gain so much. . . . It really pays
off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, the payoff was a drop in blood pressure from 170/110
to 130/77, accomplished even when he stopped his medication.

   Meditation vs. medication
</P>
<P>
   Rising and falling millimeters of mercury in a blood pressure
gauge is the quickest way to find out whether the heart is
straining too hard. Normal blood pressure should be less than
140/90 for an adult. If it goes above that level and stays there,
the condition is called high blood pressure, or hypertension. For
the NIH study, a participant must have a blood pressure reading of
130/85 (high normal) or higher.
</P>
<P>
   A person with uncontrolled high blood pressure is seven times
more likely to have a stroke, six times more likely to develop
congestive heart failure and three times more likely to experience
coronary heart disease than someone with normal blood pressure,
according to the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans have twice the rate of hypertension as white
Americans, with elderly black women showing the highest prevalence
among all racial and age groups _ more than 75 percent of them have
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Some combination of diet, exercise and medication is the usual
treatment. But an estimated 50 percent of patients quit
antihypertensive medicine after one year, because of unpleasant
side effects or for other reasons. Advice regarding diet and
exercise also often goes unheeded, as many patients continue to
live on fast food or other less than healthy fare.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors acknowledge that alternative therapies are badly
needed to treat hypertension and other conditions that lead to
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   ``During TM, the blood flows more easily. . . . It's the
opposite of when you're tense and your blood vessels constrict and
your heart pumps harder,'' explains Professor Vernon Barnes of the
Medical College of Georgia's Prevention Institute, who has
researched TM's effects. ``With meditation, it's like you're giving
your venous system a chance to regroup and revitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory Clinic cardiologist Paul Robinson says he suggests TM to
patients if they suffer from anxiety. ``TM definitely works,'' he
declares. ``There's no question about it. But the American public
are attached to the quick fix; they want us to give them a pill to
take care of whatever's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson also acknowledges that there's a growing swell of
alternative medicine followers, with an estimated 1 million
Americans now practicing TM.
</P>
<P>
   `Going to the source'
</P>
<P>
   Kondwani, who has master's and doctoral degrees in psychology
from the Maharishi University, was wooed away by Morehouse last
year from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was completing
postdoctoral studies.
</P>
<P>
   His role in the Morehouse hypertension studies is to teach
participants the principles behind transcendental meditation, then
make sure they're practicing their new form of alternative
medicine. He also meets with each participant individually to give
them their mantra, and then he meditates with each one to give them
a chance to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a restful job, not a stressful job,'' he says, barely
containing a very relaxed smile. ``There are some days when I sit
with one person in my office and meditate and then the next person
comes in and I meditate again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Kondwani's dress, office or casual conversation would
suggest that he has been a follower of TM since discovering it as a
GI Joe in the Army in Korea in the 1970s. No pictures of yogis with
flowing beards and turbans on his walls; no love beads of long ago
dangling from his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned TM and then I started sleeping better, having a
better memory and I just seemed happier,'' says Kondwani, 44, who
lives in Stone Mountain with his wife and 7-year-old son. ``I
thought, `If it can do all of this and I'm not really even trying
that hard at it, there must be something to it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many places Kondwani has since spread the silence of
TM are Washington public schools, senior centers and prisons,
including California's San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to convince not only those with health risks of TM's
benefits, but also health insurance companies. Learning TM
privately costs $575, a standard rate. Kondwani plans to begin
private group classes Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``With meditation, you are going to the source that measures
happiness within,'' he says. ``People have stopped smoking and
drinking with meditation. . . . If insurance companies would
reimburse people to learn it, think of the possibilities. So far,
the VA (Department of Veterans Affairs ) is the only one
authorizing reimbursement for TM if treating post-traumatic stress
disorder. After we do more of these clinical studies . . . I think
we'll see more openness in the medical establishment to take it
seriously.''

 &HT;    Meditation brings not just peace of mind, but better health
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Morehouse School of Medicine professor Kofi
Kondwani closes his eyes, the scientific study begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the mantra and then we'll continue meditating for 20
minutes,'' he quietly tells eight people sitting around a boardroom
table in a downtown Atlanta corner office. Lights dimmed, the group
closes their eyes on cue.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes lots of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Only outside the wraparound windows does the day drone on. Eight
floors below, headlights stream down the avenue toward highways and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Around the table, heads grow heavy as if a huge snorefest is on
the meeting's agenda. No one is sleeping. But they are resting _
deeply _ while practicing transcendental meditation, based on an
ancient ritual of India. At the same time, they're contributing to
the expanding evidence of physical, mental and emotional benefits
of TM. So far, those benefits include reduced anxiety, increased
productivity and creativity, reduced hospitalization, decreased
stress and a slowdown of the aging process in longtime meditators.
</P>
<P>
   The participants learned the art of this type of meditation in
eight hours taught during four consecutive days, the structured
program brought to the United States 40 years ago by the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, founder of the Maharishi University of Management in
Fairfield, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple procedure done twice daily for 20 minutes at a
time,'' explains Kondwani, one of a handful of African-American TM
instructors and possibly the only professor of meditation on the
staff of an American medical school. ``You sit with your eyes
closed and learn to meditate using a sound that's inaudible. It's a
sound with no meaning that the teacher gives each individual. It
quiets the mind down. Your mind gets down to one thought, and then
that thought is tuned out, and then. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, Kondwani's group _ a teacher, a bus driver, a
government employee or two, a construction supervisor, mothers,
fathers and grandmothers _ falls into a deep rest, sitting up, that
may be more beneficial than the one they take nightly in a
horizontal position. Research has proven that during TM, a person's
heart rate and oxygen consumption decrease more than when he's
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   But what this group wants to see is a decline in dangerously
elevated blood pressure. Aside from being black, hypertension was
the other trait they shared before they learned how to close their
eyes and reach a state of consciousness dubbed ``restful
alertness.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is part of a $1 million, four-year study funded by the
National Institutes of Health to look at reducing hypertension in
older black men and women using nonmedical treatments: TM, anger
management classes or a program of diet and health education.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse is also conducting two other studies involving TM and
heart disease among African-Americans. The studies are overseen by
the Behavioral Medicine Research Center, directed by Charlie
Lollis, a Ph.D psychology researcher, and Dr. Elizabeth Ofili,
chief cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   So far, anecdotal testimony from the Morehouse-NIH study points
to TM's being more effective than the other two strategies.
Previous studies found it as effective as antihypertensive drugs in
lowering blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that ever happened to me,'' says Lenina
King, 43, who joined the Morehouse study last April. ``I've had
high blood pressure for five years, and I've been on so many
different medications to try and lower it, but only meditation
finally did. I went from 170 over 110 to 120 over 80. It's really
calmed me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Taylor, 52, who plays drums and who teaches music in
Atlanta schools, says he was disappointed at first that he wasn't
assigned to the health education and diet part of the study,
because he doubted that meditation would help. ``I really didn't
think it would work, but I know it's helping me out now. It's sort
of like floating on a wave, the patience it delivers and ability to
cope with things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as an art form. Once you learn it, you really
want to practice it. It doesn't mess with your religion and it
doesn't require nothing. And you gain so much. . . . It really pays
off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, the payoff was a drop in blood pressure from 170/110
to 130/77, accomplished even when he stopped his medication.

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ Lots of people want to invest in stocks
but are too scared to take the first step. There's so much to
learn, a great deal of it expressed in numbers and specialized
vocabulary. There's the fear that you will lose your money, mainly
because you don't know what you're doing. To be honest, there is
also the fear that people will giggle or smirk at your
amateurishness. One way to confront that fear is to build and track
a virtual portfolio _ an imaginary set of investments. (Ezell,

There is however a whole lot of Atlanta warming. Ask the orange.
Winters ago, I stopped moving plants indoors for the winter,
outside for the spring. What goes out must stay out. So, last
spring, when I put the orange outside, I was saying goodbye.
Watching the calendar turn from summer to autumn to winter, I felt
a little of what Eskimos must have felt when they set the old
people on the ice to die. But the orange didn't die. Instead, it
weathered the cold snaps, a few leaves burning from deep green to
light olive color. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

peek at the screen, but he didn't see much of his alma mater on the
field. No engineers, no mathematicians, no computer scientists. Not
even a lowly lit major. Just a bunch of steroid-stoked jocks
trodding the tired ground of touchdowns and turnovers and taking
themselves way too seriously. (Man, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STRESS-MEDITATE _ Can learning to relax through meditation lower
your blood pressure? A group of minority women who've never
meditated in their lives are learning it can, through a new study
at Morehouse School of Medicine. Morehouse has such confidence in
the technique to help minority populations that it has recruited a
physician whose speciality is helping people improve their health
by lowering stress. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50.

   CHORE-GUIDE _ Develop a master plan for maintenance and repairs
that outlines everything that needs to be done within the next 12
months. Preparing a list of interior and exterior projects may seem
tedious and time consuming now, but advance planning makes it
easier to shop for competitive product prices and arrange project
financing. This seasonal guide provides a detail list of household
chores and when they should be done. (AHill, Atlanta

   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Let's
get it out of the way, right up front: There's no global warming.
There is however a whole lot of Atlanta warming. Ask the orange.
Winters ago, I stopped moving plants indoors for the winter,
outside for the spring. What goes out must stay out. So, last
spring, when I put the orange outside, I was saying goodbye.
Watching the calendar turn from summer to autumn to winter, I felt
a little of what Eskimos must have felt when they set the old
people on the ice to die. But the orange didn't die. Instead, it
weathered the cold snaps, a few leaves burning from deep green to
light olive color. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 `MY RETURN TO KOSOVO'S KILLING FIELDS': An Exclusive 8-Part
Series   (The following provocative ``separate buy'' articles are from the
Independent of London, distributed exclusively by the New York
Times Syndicate. Please see purchase information at end of
advisory.)  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS:  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his hard-hitting dispatches from the front lines of Kosovo,
the Independent's veteran correspondent Robert Fisk was NATO's
sternest critic during the war in Kosovo _ the top international
news story of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut-based Fisk recently returned to Kosovo _ ``as I always do
after such conflicts'' _ to search for the war's first casualty:
truth. And to assess the war's real _ and continuing _ human toll.
</P>

<P>
   In his hard-hitting dispatches from the front lines of Kosovo,
the Independent's veteran correspondent Robert Fisk was NATO's
sternest critic during the war in Kosovo _ the top international
news story of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut-based Fisk recently returned to Kosovo _ ``as I always do
after such conflicts'' _ to search for the war's first casualty:
truth. And to assess the war's real _ and continuing _ human toll.

FLYING OFF THE SHELVES: SATELLITE DISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ DVD players may have been the hottest
electronics item this Christmas season, but national and area
retailers say another video product was flying off their shelves
nearly as fast: 18-inch satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Small-dish satellite systems are now in more than 11 million
U.S. homes, or about one in nine. And that number is growing by a
quarter million a month. Once considered a luxury item for
videophiles, satellite TV is making its way into all kinds of homes
for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how many are in Kansas City (the satellite
industry likes to keep local sales figures close to its chest). But
there could be as many as 50,000 area homes now dished up.
</P>
<P>
   And despite efforts by our local cable companies to keep
customers from defecting to satellite, that number will probably
keep growing in 2000. Three reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, digital cable offers subscribers more channels than ever
_ but satellite still delivers the most.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the threat from satellite service providers DirecTV
and EchoStar, Time Warner Cable and Comcast both have started
rolling out digital cable systems. Compared with regular analog
cable, digital offers many more new channels to its customers.
(Time Warner only offers digital cable in its ``upgraded'' zones,
which should include all of Johnson County by the end of 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet I counted at least 14 cable networks in DirecTV's
$30-per-month Total Choice satellite package that aren't carried by
Time Warner Cable's $37-per-month digital service, including the
terrific BBC America and the computer network ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has 12 channels DirecTV doesn't, but these include
Metro Sports and four spinoffs of the Discovery channel that show
only reruns. Time Warner also has a few more flavors of Music
Choice audio channels, but I still give the advantage to satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Cable still has one biological strength over satellite: With
cable, there can be three TV sets on in your house, each one tuned
to a different channel. You'd need to buy three separate receivers
to do that with a satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   But dish makers are betting that what you really want are
channels, and the more the merrier.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar also offers dozens of international channels through
its Dish Network. And the company announced last week that it will
give away its new Dish 500 system _ including installation _ to
customers who sign a one-year deal at a $40 monthly rate. DirecTV
also has a free-install deal going, though as with EchoStar you
have to sign up for more than just the minimum number of channels.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the satellite companies began offering
subscribers a new slate of commercial-free educational networks.
(Not of their own free will, let it be said; Congress made them set
aside part of their bandwidth for these channels.)
</P>
<P>
   I've already found a couple I like. One is WorldLink TV, a joint
venture between InterNews and ITVS, two longtime players in the
documentary field. Much of their work has not been seen widely in
the U.S. WorldLink was launched so quickly that it hasn't had time
to pull together a full schedule, so it's making do with a couple
of news programs from England and a collection of world music
videos. And I mean the whole world: ballads from Tibet and Italy,
technopunk from Russia, bagpipe rock from Spain, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I must say that even this hodgepodge is a welcome addition to
American TV fare, which typically forgets that there are other
countries in the world except as backdrops for luxury travel,
political unrest or disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the new channels is PBS You, which was set up for
``distance learning'' _ watching classes on TV for credit. But the
programs shown on the channel are so polished that I can't tell the
difference between them and the usual high-quality PBS fare. The
other night I got roped into a terrific program on PBS You about
the role of narrative in American filmmaking. They interviewed
directors Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg and did a
fascinating analysis of the making of ``Casablanca.'' If I can
watch stuff like that for credit, sign me up.
</P>
<P>
   2. Local TV stations soon won't be an either//or proposition for
dish owners.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big drawbacks to buying a dish has been the
inconvenience of pulling in local stations. Say you've just gotten
that new dish side-mounted on your house (and if I were you, I'd
buy mine someplace where they installed it for you). Now you want
to watch ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC. Good luck
getting it on the dish: Satellite providers haven't been allowed to
carry Channel 9 or any local TV stations in any city, which means
their customers have had to fend for their own, either with
``lifeline'' cable service or a TV antenna.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about to change. Thanks to watershed legislation
passed by Congress in November, satellite companies can now offer
their customers network affiliates. And they will _ just not as
many as your local cable system, and not right away and possibly on
a different dish than the one you own.
</P>
<P>
   The ink is barely dry on all the fine print, so let's look at it
more closely.
</P>
<P>
   First, those satellite transponders drifting high above the
earth's equator only have so much room on them for TV channels. So
for the time being, DirecTV and EchoStar plan to offer just four
networks _ NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox _ to their local customers, plus a
national PBS feed. Eventually, viewers in some cities will get
their local WB, UPN and independent stations. But not everyone will
get everything, because satellite makers say they don't have the
space for all 1,700 TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   They won't come free, either. Just like the cable company, DBS
services must pay for the privilege of carrying local stations.
Expect an added $6//month on your satellite bill. And if you don't
have the latest dish, because the old ones weren't built to pull in
local stations, figure on spending another $300 or so to have one
installed (unless you qualify for one of the free-dish deals).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, no one knows exactly when Kansas Citians will be able
to see their local stations on satellite. So far, the two dish
companies have been focusing on other cities, including some
smaller metro areas than ours, like Nashville and Raleigh//Durham,
N.C. (The Nashville area apparently has one of the country's
biggest clusters of dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, both DirecTV (www.directv.com) and EchoStar
(www.dishnetwork.com) have pledged to carry local stations to at
least 60 percent of the country by mid-2000, so an announcement
regarding Kansas City should come soon. Check their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   3. With a dish, you can watch high-definition TV today.
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of the thousand or so people in the area who owns
a digital TV set _ and you're sick of watching the same old PBS
loop being played on KCPT's experimental Channel 18, Kansas City's
only existing digital TV signal _ then satellite TV has news for
you: With the right dish, you can watch HBO with a brilliant
high-definition digital picture and CD-quality sound today, and
soon you'll be able to get the same with Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll need a TV set worthy of the name high
definition, and even with prices plummeting, expect to pay at least
$2,000 for a low-end model. The digital dish option will add
another $1,000 with installation. But for some viewers, this marks
the first time that high-def has been in their ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you choose satellite TV, it's undeniable that it
has brought benefits to all viewers, even those with cable service.
Time Warner and Comcast are now competing all-out with the dish
makers (Time Warner, for example, is hoping to offer high-def HBO
and Showtime in 2000 as well).
</P>
<P>
   When DirecTV opened shop six years ago, most Kansas Citians were
stuck with 35 cable channels and the government was mulling over
legislation to force TV stations into the digital age. We've come a
long way since then _ and for that you've got to give credit to the
business competition engendered BY those diminuitive dishes that
have sprouted in people's yards like mushrooms.

&HT;     MANY AMERICANS FIND SICK LEAVE A REMEDY FOR WORKPLACE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATE GURNETT  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Prop your pillows, pull a Puffs, grab the phone
and sniffle loudly. You are making a very important call. To the
office. You won't be in today. You have the faux flu.
</P>
<P>
   These days, feigned flu is as common as the common cold. More
workers than ever stayed home last year _ to combat stress or
because they felt entitled to a day off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, personal illness, the cause of 45 percent of all
unscheduled absences in 1995, accounted for only 21 percent of sick
days last year, according to CCH Inc. of Riverwoods, Ill., an
employment information provider.
</P>
<P>
   Why stay home? Family issues led the list at 21 percent,
followed by personal needs, 20 percent, and stress or ``entitlement
mentality,'' each at 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is work itself, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Americans are putting in 1,966 hours per year, more
than workers in Germany, France and hard-working Japan, according
to the United Nations International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Worker stress has tripled since 1995, said Nancy Kaylor, human
resource analyst for CCH, which does an annual survey on
unscheduled absences.
</P>
<P>
   The collision between work and life and getting things done
prompts a grab for more days off, she said. ``One part of the
equation is that work isn't an 8-to-5 proposition anymore for many
of us. We have e-mail and voice mail and pagers and faxes. We're
all plugged in, turned on and always connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a rash of downsized companies and overworked
employees with families headed by working parents who have children
to care for, errands to run and mounting household chores and you
have the makings of a national epidemic with a makeshift remedy:
Call in sick!
</P>
<P>
   A fake sick day is ``more like a stress-buster,'' said one
39-year-old New York state government worker who asked to remain
anonymous. She calls in well a couple times a year: ``It's just
time to relax, read a book or chill out.''
</P>
<P>
   If this woman takes two days, her boss may take more. Wealthier
people fake sick days more often, according to a study by Audits &AMP;
Surveys Worldwide for American Demographics magazine. In fact, 42
percent of Americans with incomes of $50,000 call in ``sick'' when
they're not, which is 11 percentage points higher than the national
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X-ers also skip work frequently; 43 percent said they
called in sick when they were well.
</P>
<P>
   Unscheduled absences cost employers an average of $602 per
employee a year, Kaylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And calling in the sick bed police isn't the best solution, she
argues.
</P>
<P>
   Employers who save the most money do so by meeting workers
halfway with new alternatives like paid leave banks, flexible
scheduling, better child care and buy-back programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective weapon against sick leave abuse? Paid time
off, according to Kaylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In yesterday's workplace you got sick days, vacation days,
maybe a personal day and holidays,'' Kaylor said. ``With a paid
leave bank, all of your days are lumped into one bank and given to
the employee to do with as their needs require.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to tell that little fib at 8:02 on a
Thursday morning when your kid's child care falls through, you can
go ahead and let your supervisor know that you need to take time
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet companies nationwide have been slow to implement new
practices, she added. While 58 percent of companies surveyed used
flexible scheduling, just 18 percent offered emergency child care.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Career Planning in Menands, N.Y., ditched its ``use it
or lose it'' sick leave policy in the 1970s after executive
director Bill Norton noticed people were calling in repeatedly from
October to December to use up their 12 annual days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company, which employees 400 people, lets workers
bank up to 150 days of sick time, to be used under specific
conditions, saving the company money. Northeast Career also lets
employees donate their unused sick time to co-workers in case of
certain dire illnesses such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, unscheduled absences are an anomaly. They just
don't call in sick.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 percent of Americans say they haven't missed a day at
the office, the Audits &AMP; Surveys study found.

&HT;     LIVER PATIENTS TURN TO LIVING-DONOR OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Andy Kennedy didn't take long to decide to give
55 percent of his liver to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In June, she was diagnosed with liver cancer. She already had
severe liver disease. Doctors gave her six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it wasn't an option, it was, `Let's do it,''' said
Kennedy, 33, who lives in Columbia County, about 30 miles southeast
of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, such an exchange was considered too risky.
Although living-donor liver transplants from adults to children
have taken place since 1989, it is only in the past two years that
such a transfer between adults was seen as feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, adults in need of a liver transplant had to rely
exclusively on donor organs from the recently deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Yet transplant surgeons began to reconsider the risks in 1998 as
the average waiting time for such livers reached nearly two years
in some parts of the country. Because the wait is so long, about
one out of every five people in need of a transplant dies before
receiving a liver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, people started to say if there's a one in five
chance that you're going to die, maybe (living-donor transplant) is
worth the risk,'' said Dr. James Piper, the director of liver
transplant and hepatobiliary surgery at Westchester Medical Center
in Valhalla, 30 minutes north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, fewer than 150 adult living-donor liver transplants
have been done across the United States, mostly between relatives
such as Kennedy and his mother, Maureen, who also lives in Columbia
County.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, the family traveled to the Lahey Clinic in
Burlington, Mass., for the complex surgery. In order for the
transplant to work, the donor and recipient must have compatible
blood types. Equally important is adequate size of the donor's
liver when compared to the body size of the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Ma, you gave me life; now it's my chance to give you
back yours,'' said Maureen Kennedy, 62. More than two months since
the surgery, both mother and son say they are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Although the operation may seem like the perfect answer to long
waiting lines for donor organs, transplant specialists are more
cautious about the controversial and difficult procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only for a select group of people,'' said Patricia
Conway, the transplant nurse coordinator at the Lahey Clinic.
``This is not an operation of last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an operation without risk, especially to the
donors, who lose up to 60 percent of the right lobe of their liver,
an organ that functions as the body's chemical factory, regulating
the levels of most of the main chemicals in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controversial,'' Conway said. ``You're taking a person
who is perfectly healthy and subjecting them to an operation they
don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Piper estimates that two or three donors have died in
the United States as a result of the surgery, often from
complications such as blood loss, clots and infections. Cutting
into the liver presents the biggest risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liver is basically nothing more than millions of pools of
blood percolating through cells,'' said Piper, who has performed 75
to 80 of living-donor transplants, mostly on children. ``The
question is, How do you cut through a liver without losing too much
blood?
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential implications to the donor are great,'' he said.
``You can't live without a liver. ... Even the transplant surgeons
are saying, `As great as it sounds, we really need to use
caution.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, surgeons are encouraged by the ability of the
liver to sustain such an exchange. Unlike any other organ, the
liver is uniquely able to rejuvenate itself. A donor who gives up
60 percent of his liver can expect it to fully recover in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the part that remains, the cells will multiply and give you
back all the function,'' Piper said.
</P>
<P>
   Such rejuvenation, however, isn't like a starfish that grows
back a missing limb. Piper said the liver doesn't regain its old
shape. Rather, for reasons that aren't entirely clear, the liver
recovers its original mass.
</P>
<P>
   With no end to the long waiting lines for liver transplants,
specialists expect interest in adult living-donor transplants to
continue to grow. But as with any surgery, ``I would very carefully
pick the person doing the operation,'' Piper said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the operation, Andy Kennedy's liver has regained about 85
percent of its normal function. Doctors expect it to reach 100
percent in a year. Until then, his only restriction is not to drink
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incision has healed, my appetite is back,'' said Kennedy,
a manager at a building supply company. ``Everything is back to
normal; I can pick up my son again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Kennedy, a bus assistant for the Ichabod Crane Central
School District in the town of Kinderhook, also is looking forward
to good health for the first time in three years. ``I feel I can't
repay him,'' she said of her son. ``Saying the word thank you
doesn't do it.''

WILD TITANS FINISH WORTH A SECOND LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's Solomon Wilcots was all set. With 16 seconds remaining in
Saturday's wild-card game and Buffalo leading Tennessee by 2
points, Wilcots had arranged a postgame interview with Bills
quarterback Rob Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilcots stood on the Bills sideline, he watched the kickoff
and saw what he described as a ``huge convoy'' of Titans blockers
across the field, near the other sideline. Then came the celebrated
lateral pass from Frank Wycheck to Kevin Dyson, who ran for the
touchdown that stunned the Bills and prompted a replay review.
Wilcots gave a Bills official one of those ``Oh well'' looks and
hustled over to a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an optical illusion,'' Wilcots said. ``None of the
cameras were directly on line with the 25-yard line. I couldn't
tell conclusively either way. The refs made a good call on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcots is right. As long as the pass is not forward, it is
considered a lateral. The larger issue is whether instant replay
works, and in this particular case it did. Its role is not to
simply overturn on-field rulings but to serve, as Wilcots points
out, as ``an appeals court of sort.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first weekend of NFL playoff games, three plays were
reviewed. Two were overturned. The one left standing was the
kickoff return. During the regular season, there were 195 reviews.
Of those, 133 were coaches' challenges and 57 of those overturned
on-field rulings. Of the 62 reviews called for by officials, 20
overturned on-field rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson's return was not the reason Buffalo lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Bills' inability to execute when it counted most,''
said Wilcots, who interviewed Bills coach Wade Phillips after the
first half and had to clean up the coach's profane screed for
on-air consumption. Wilcots didn't take it personally, explaining
that the Bills had nine penalties in the first half, the last one
setting up a field goal for the Titans. The Bills also were
hampered by injuries to two starting tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The question that prompted Phillips to go off was about Doug
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the controversy about starting Johnson, and given
the Bills' sputtering offense in the first half, I thought it was a
fair question to ask whether Flutie might make an appearance in the
second half,'' Wilcots said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcots said Phillips barked, ``Don't ask me that question,''
before launching into a tirade of expletives. ``It was hard to
decipher,'' said Wilcots. ``But I know it was the heat of battle.''

A MERGER THAT CLICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enormous though it is _ there has been none larger _ the
prospective merger of American Online and Time-Warner should be
appraised for the change it represents in the world of
communications. The melding of separate facets of this burgeoning
field into integrated providers is logical and desirable, with the
proviso that it stimulates continuing innovation rather than
stifling itself with repetitious mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The blending of communication, news, entertainment, and
retailing into a single organization reflects the impact of
accelerating technological capability, with consumers gaining more
and more choice in products. Linking those choices into unified
organizations is healthy as long as it does not interfere with
competition.
</P>
<P>
   American Online has in 15 years become the largest Internet
service provider in the country, with 20 million paying
subscribers. Its e-mail has overtaken the US Postal Service in raw
volume, and it has more users at any given time than cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Inc., a seasoned provider of news and entertainment,
gives AOL its own sources of programming _ everything from CNN to
Looney Tunes _ for the first time. Time-Warner's extensive network
of cable systems also should help AOL deliver high-speed access to
its customers, which is increasingly in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Changes like these are bound to be paralleled by others that
will challenge everyone in the business to worry about the risks of
failing to remain competitive. With luck, and with constant
attention by leaders in the field and consumers, this competitive
atmosphere will stimulate still further innovations. High-speed
modern communications have whetted the appetite of millions of
Americans for ever greater variety _ and led to dwindling tolerance
for the kind of cautious action that can accompany huge corporate
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   Niche players may yet emerge from the sidelines to capture parts
of markets that the largest providers fail to serve. That, too,
will be healthy.

 PALM SPRINGS, CALIF.: ... hidden entrance.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A highlight of any visit to Joshua Tree is the Keys View. A
mountaintop in the Little San Bernardino Mountains at the end of a
side road of the main park roadway, the Keys View overlooks the
entire Coachella Valley with Mount San Jacinto on the far side
dominating the view, which includes the San Andreas Fault clearly
visible along the valley floor and the Salton Sea 40 miles away. On
the day I visited, I saw a golden eagle lift off from one of the
buttes along the side of the approach road. There is a short walk
from the parking area to the overlook itself, and a second
handicap-accessible lookout is also maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Birds, including roadrunners and California quail, are among the
variety of wildlife one is likely to see along the trails. One must
be wary of rattlesnakes, though actual bites by the sidewinders
that inhabit the park are quite rare _ three or four a year,
according to a ranger I spoke with. In addition, most bites are on
the hand rather than the leg or foot, indicating that people were
not being sufficiently cautious or that they may have been
illegally poaching the snakes, which are prized for their skins.
Coyotes also are frequently seen in the park. Unfortunately, too
many people have ignored the prohibition on feeding them and many
have lost their fear of people. The result is a large number of
coyotes falling victim to auto accidents on the roads of the park
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The other important consideration when visiting the Joshua Tree
is proper attire and water. Sturdy shoes and a sun hat are
necessities. A foot above the ground, the signs warn, the
temperature can reach 150 degrees. Even when driving, you should
always have a couple of quarts of water at hand. Be careful of
cactus spines as well, as they can easily penetrate shoe leather
and cause painful wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Camping is available on a limited basis, but much of the park's
beauty can be appreciated in a leisurely day or half-day by car.
Leave plenty of time to stop at the waysides and walks, but don't
be afraid to pull over and wander off the road a bit to enjoy the
scenery and the awesome silence of the desert. Admission to the
park is $10 per vehicle and is good for seven days from the date of
issue. Camping at six of the eight park campgrounds is free. A fee
is charged (and reservations encouraged) for the Cottonwood and
Black Rock campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in Palm Springs on the last day, I again followed the
Lykken trail up above the city. I got to my usual spot and was
pausing to take in the view. I heard a small voice behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, may I get by?''
</P>
<P>
   I turned to find an elderly Korean emigre, walking with stick in
hand and sun hat firmly atop his head. We walked down together. He
had come after the war and had prospered. He had retired here. He
lived in one of the houses in the subdivisions below. He was 80
now, but he came up every day he could. Up the side of the mountain
_ for the exercise and for the view. He kept a steady pace as we
walked down, gingerly but determinedly mastering the occasional
small leaps required by the path. We separated at the end of the
trail and he walked back to his home. I watched him follow the wide
California roadway, stopping here and there to talk to a neighbor's
dog or to poke with his walking stick at something interesting. He
moved along, marching to his own beat, fragile in his age but
determined in his will. Like the mountains and the desert all
around him.

THE LION'S GAME 
By Nelson DeMille 
Warner Books, 677 pp., $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nelson DeMille is in the business of writing thrillers, and
``The Lion's Game'' is a humdinger until he cheats on the reader by
deciding that leaving the door open to a sequel is more important,
and will likely prove more remunerative, than providing a
satisfactory resolution to nearly 700 pages of chase.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, ``The Lion's Game'' is already a sequel, because its
hero, former New York cop John Corey, served as hero of DeMille's
previous bestseller, ``Plum Island.'' Now Corey's taken a job with
the feds, working for an antiterrorist task force, where one of his
colleagues is an old adversary from ``Plum Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey's quite a character, a guy who enjoys dirty work and dirty
jokes; he also serves as a mouthpiece for DeMille, who lets Corey
settle some recent scores for him. Apparently DeMille wasn't too
thrilled with two reviewers of the John Travolta film based on his
novel ``The General's Daughter,'' so Corey lets them have it. On a
flight to California, Corey watches ``The General's Daughter'' and
observes that it ``was terrific, despite a bad review that I
recalled reading in Long Island's Newsday, written by John
Anderson, a so-called movie critic, whose opinion I trusted to be
the exact opposite of mine.'' Corey takes Janet Maslin, formerly
film critic for The New York Times, on an even rougher ride. ``Some
days I do the Times crossword puzzle, other days I try to
understand what Ms. Maslin is trying to say. I can't do both on the
same day without getting a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Lion's Game,'' Corey faces a more dangerous adversary
than Janet Maslin: His name is Asad Khalil, and he is a Libyan
terrorist. As the book begins, Khalil appears to have turned
himself in as an informer, and he's due in to Kennedy Airport on
Flight 175 from Paris, along with escorts from the FBI and the CIA.
Corey is one of those delegated to the more-or-less-routine task of
meeting him and picking him up _ along with his boss, Kate
Mayfield, with whom he gets along so badly it's clear from the
start that they're made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The main action of ``The Lion's Game'' unfolds in the present,
but the roots of the terrorist's action lie in the American air
attack on Libya in 1986. The air raid provides Khalil with
incentives and reasons to seek revenge _ to political, religious,
and ethnic motives, Khalil can add personal and confused sexual
ones. DeMille's narrative advances in alternate chapters, first
from Khalil's point of view, then from Corey's. Khalil is way ahead
of Corey, and the excitement builds as Corey begins to catch up.
Khalil's acts are ruthless, brilliant in calculation and
improvisation, and disproportionate, but they are not irrational.
One of the interests of ``The Lion's Game'' is the extent to which
DeMille is capable of seeing, and feeling, the remorseless,
implacable internal logic of the terrorist's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also based on careful research (DeMille credits his
research assistants in a closing note). Corey finds ``informative''
an infographic about the Libyan crisis that appeared in the Boston
Globe on April 20, 1986, and quotes from it extensively; a spot
check confirms that such an infographic did run in the Globe, and
on that date.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real need for the writer of a thriller to do that
kind of homework, but accurate corroborative detail does help _
Virginia Woolf wrote appreciatively of how an actual clay pot in
the foreground of ``Robinson Crusoe'' helps the reader accept the
entire fantasy. DeMille has developed a real sense of politics and
of interagency bickering that lends further verisimilitude. And
while his characters are hardly of literary subtlety, they are
helped by their creator's earthy, lowbrow sense of humor; one
figure who doesn't have to be there adds immeasurably to the
texture: Boris, a former Soviet agent who has been one of Khalil's
trainers. Boris has spent time in America, and his take on American
mores is always amusing. ``My friend, many American women will find
you handsome. American women will not be as openly and honestly
sexual as European women, but they may try to strike up an
acquaintance. They think they can be friendly to a man without
being provocative and without calling attention to the obvious
differences betwen the sexes. In Russia, as in Europe, we find this
idiotic. Why would you want to speak to a woman if not for sex?''
</P>
<P>
   And it all goes along expertly and entertainingly and
frighteningly _ right up until near the end when DeMille, attacked
by sequelitis, defers resolution and gets all soft and mushy about
John and Kate. It won't matter a year from now, when the sequel has
appeared, and anyone who cares can read both books. It does matter
now, because DeMille has broken the rules of the game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Our nation begins the new millennium by being the only country
in the Americas, Europe and most of the world to execute convicts
who were minors when they committed their murderous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Only six nations are known to have put juvenile offenders to
death in the past decade: Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Our country is the only one that has not signed the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child because it wants to
remain free to execute juvenile offenders. Article 37 (a) of the
U.N. Convention states: ``Neither capital punishment nor life
imprisonment without the possibility of release shall be imposed
for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is apparently too civilized for us. Even China,
which has shown an intolerable lack of respect for human rights,
prohibits the death penalty for those under 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. Supreme Court, not known for its compassion,
doesn't find it ``cruel or unusual punishment'' to execute those
who were 16 years old when they committed a capital crime. This
same high court, however, recognizes that minors do not have the
maturity or judgment to sign contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The rights of minors are generally not equal to those of adults
_ but, according to the high court, their right to be executed IS
equal to that of adults.
</P>
<P>
   A minor's diminished capacity for sound judgment does not bother
the high court at all. In fact, this court has found it
constitutional to execute the mentally retarded and the mentally
ill if they were involved in a capital crime. Again, we are one of
the few nations to allow such execution.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the total number of death row inmates in the United
States tops 3,600. Seventy of those death row inmates are juvenile
offenders. Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty in 1976, 600 men and women have been executed in state
penitentiaries _ approximately 2 percent of those executed were
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oklahoma executed Sean Sellers, a young man who was
16 years old at the time of the murders he was found guilty of
committing.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder,
but that fact was not revealed to the jury at his trial. According
to the Daily Oklahoman, a federal appeals court held that Sellers
may have been ``factually innocent'' of the murders because of his
mental illness, but that innocence alone is not sufficient to grant
federal relief. Sellers was executed on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, 18 states allow juvenile offenders as young as 16
to be executed, including Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Five states allow the execution of those who were 17 or older
when they committed their crimes: Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire,
North Carolina and Texas. And 15 state legislatures have passed
statutes that set the age of 18 as the minimum for eligibility for
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months, the two states that have executed more
inmates than any other states _ Texas and Virginia _ have scheduled
the execution of five juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Christopher Thomas, 26, who was convicted of murdering
his girlfriend's mother and father at her request when he was 17
years old, died by lethal injection on Jan. 10, in a Virginia
prison. There is doubt about Thomas' guilt. Witnesses have come
forward stating that Thomas' girlfriend, Jessica Wiseman, admitted
to them that she had killed her mother, not Thomas. The murder of
Wiseman's mother was the crime for which Thomas was sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Steve E. Roach, who robbed and murdered a 70-year-old woman in
Stanardsville, Va., when he was 17, will be executed by lethal
injection on Jan. 13. Roach is only 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has two other child offenders on death row _ both were
16 years old when they committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has three juvenile offenders and one mentally ill inmate
scheduled for execution in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robison is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Jan.
21. He has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, but was never
given adequate treatment by the state of Texas. He was discharged
by Veteran's Hospital in Waco and his parents were told he ``wasn't
violent'' and the hospital ``needed the bed.'' Weeks later, a
violent episode brought on by his mental illness left five dead.
</P>
<P>
   Glen McGinnis was 17 years old when he murdered a woman during a
robbery. He will be 26 when he is scheduled to be executed on Jan.
25.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Texas is scheduled to execute Anzel Jones for
the murders he committed when he was 17. He won't reach his 22nd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, Texas would have completed a ``hat trick,'' with its
third execution of a juvenile offender _ except that Toronto
Patterson, who committed multiple murders when he was 17, was
granted a temporary stay of execution. He is only 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of executions continues. Last year, 98 death row
inmates were executed _ the highest number of executions since
1976. This year promises to exceed that grisly figure.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which finally did away with the electric chair in favor
of lethal injection, wants to grease the wheels for its death
penalty _ fewer appeals and less time to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   When will our nation learn you cannot teach the sanctity of life
by sanctioning a state's right to kill?

NEW WAYS TO PRAY JUST A MOUSE-CLICK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when those who wanted to communicate with a higher
power clasped their hands, perhaps kneeling in a hallowed
sanctuary, and fervently appealed for divine aid.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can sit at their computer screens, tap out keyboard
prayers, and, in at least some cases, genuinely feel they are
reaching their Maker on line.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, introducing: God.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is an e-mail address for ``God,'' and many
homepages. Also, several Web sites claim they can link the computer
user directly to God. Sometimes, this God even responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply click on the PRAY button and transmit your prayer to
the only known location of GOD,'' says one of the most audacious
Web sites, newprayer.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those who set up these nondenominational Web sites say they
appeal to people turned off by stuffy churches and stern-faced
clergymen. But the sites trouble some theologians, who say they
serve up an easy, noncommittal version of religion for Internet
surfers who shun the traditional obligations of communities of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Foerst, a Lutheran theologian who teaches at MIT, said
interaction with God on the Internet lacks depth and serious
confrontation with questions of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is comfortable, convenient religion, completely
individualized: Just go on the Web and pray,'' Foerst said.
``Religion should be about commitment and community and
self-doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Levin, a business consultant, Mass., found consolation
on Godspeaks.net, one of the most popular of the Web sites, after
his brother died of lymphoma. Godspeaks, which reproduces direct,
provocative billboard messages from an outdoor religious
advertising campaign in Florida, captured his interest.
</P>
<P>
   One such message read, ``That `love thy neighbor' thing? I meant
it. _ God' Another said, ``Let's meet at my house Sunday before the
game _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not standing over you like a religious teacher with a
ruler in hand,'' said Levin, 31. ``It doesn't ask for a donation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of an anonymous Florida donor, the Godspeaks sites
were started in 1998 by Mark MacDonald, 35, a technology
consultant, and the Smith advertising agency in Ft. Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   The donor was saddened by the White House sex scandal and school
violence, and wanted to find a creative way to bring God into
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   With the ad agency's help, the donor agreed to create billboards
with the sayings ``signed'' by God. The Web sites _ Godspeaks.net
and Godspeaks.org _ were formed to display the sayings and to
establish other ways for users to connect with God.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said the creators of the site are presumptuous
in attempting to speak for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being flippant,'' MacDonald acknowledged. ``But our God
has a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald estimated that the Web site gets at least 150,000 hits
a month, mainly from ``people who are crying out for help, or
others who are celebrating that they were reminded of God in a
unique, fun way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Jones, 55, a retired Army inventory specialist and a
committed Catholic from Darby, Pa., logged on to Godspeaks.net
about nine months ago, out of curiosity. She enjoyed the humor of
the site and has now sent the addresses to ``a couple hundred
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me think about ways to make God more central to my
life,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Newprayer.com makes an even bolder claim _ that it can send
prayers via a radio transmitter to God's last known location, a
star cluster called M13 believed to be one of the oldest in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   One theologian, Charles Henderson, called the claim
``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scientific mumbo jumbo,'' said Henderson, executive
director of the Association for Religion and Intellectual Life in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall Stone, 50, a Cambridge, Mass. engineer and freelance
consultant, set up the site last winter after a night of sipping
brandy and philosophizing with friends in Vermont. The conversation
turned to Big Bang theories of creation, and someone suggested that
if everything was in one place at the time of the explosion, then
God must have been there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one place where we could be sure He was,'' Stone
said. ``Then we thought that if we could find that location and had
a radio transmitter, we could send a message to God.''
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with NASA scientists, the friends settled on
M13 as the likely location. They chipped in about $20,000, and
built a radio-wave-transmitting Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they charged $5 a prayer to help recoup part of the
costs. But when some critics cried scam, they provided the service
for free.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stone says, they transmit about 50,000 prayers a week from
seekers around the globe. Most supplicants pray for someone else _
to help an ill relative or a troubled friend, for instance, or to
end war.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent have later sent e-mail testimonials saying
their prayers were answered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if this form of prayer is more effective than
any other. There aren't any comparative data,'' Stone said. ``But
it appears that most people take our service seriously and that a
large number are gratified by the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Stone, professor of theology at Boston University,
described the newprayer site as unusual and probably harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most theistic traditions believe God is everywhere, not in one
place or direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Godspeaks and newprayer are free-of-charge now, but some
more-suspect God-centered Web sites sell products like
``forgiveness'' for $50 or ``divine protection certificates'' for
$9.99.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Boston University's Stone was reluctant to criticize
the new Web sites, saying they reach people more traditional
denominations often miss.
</P>
<P>
   The sites ``probably touch a large and growing group . . . on a
spiritual quest.''

EDITORS NOTE: Flavors of Home is an occasional series that focuses
on unique home cooks. 
 FLAVORS OF HOME: Some Like it Hot, Others Like it Mild   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  There is more to Indonesian cooking than  nasi 
 goreng , the garnished fried rice that is the island nation's most
copied dish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, there is a lot more _ and it isn't all  &LR; rijsttafel &LR; ,
that lavish spread born in Dutch colonial times that is the other
widely known Indonesian food.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking of Indonesia has many more nuances than is conveyed
by these standardized international favorites, says Waty Djohan,
the wife of Indonesia's consul general in San Francisco, M. Hannief
Djohan. Take the notion that all Indonesian food is spicy. Some is
and some isn't, says the first lady of the Bay Area's 4,000-strong
Indonesian community.
</P>
<P>
   It varies from province to province of the large island country,
she says. Sumatran dishes, for example, can pack some heat, while
those of Java lean more toward sweet and gently spicy preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Individual tastes also account for differences. After all, the
consul general points out with a laugh, you can't expect a country
of 204 million people from 300 separate ethnic groups to eat from
the same pot, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   About the only valid generalization about their native cooking,
the Djohans agree, is that rice is the nearly universal staple of
choice. The family often eats it three times a day, a claim backed
up by the industrial-size rice cooker that is used for family meals
and official functions they host in their Pacific Heights
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner always finds the family returning to the flavors of home.
These dinners are cherished rituals that connect the family members
to each other and to their culture. This past year, the family
enjoyed such meals often since daughters Deasy, 28, and Lucy, 23,
were here from Indonesia for a long holiday. (Son Emir, 19, lives
with his parents while taking hotel management courses here.)
</P>
<P>
   When guests join the Djohans, Yati Samhi (Waty Djohan calls her
``my excellent assistant''), who does the bulk of the kitchen work,
serves mildly spicy food. But there is the ever-present bowl of
 &LR; sambal &LR; , Indonesia's equivalent of hot salsa, on the table, so
diners can turn up the heat as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the meal that is decidedly on the mild side is the
rice. Like in many other Asian cuisines, Indonesian cooking
dictates that rice be prepared with nothing but water. Salty and
spicy accents come from foods that accompany the basic rice; the
rice itself should taste pure.
</P>
<P>
   Even the consul general, who admits that his forays to the stove
are rare, is adamant about how rice should be cooked. The rice _
long-grain white rice is the norm _ should be rinsed three times in
clear cold water, then fresh water added to a level one knuckle
above the top of the rice, no matter whether the amount to be
cooked is large or small and whether the grain is prepared in an
old-fashioned pot or a modern electric rice cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional aspects characterize the Djohans' food. There
is a food processor in the large and efficient kitchen, but more
often an  &LR; ulekamcq &LR;  _ a curved stone slab with a wooden pounder,
much like Mexico's  &LR; mocaljete &LR;  _ is used to make pastes of hot
chiles, tomatoes and spices. A long spiked board or  &LR; parutan &LR;  is
the utensil of choice for grinding nutmeg or coconut, other
Indonesian staples. The single most important cooking vessel is a
large, well-seasoned wok, used for everything from  &LR; perkedel &LR; 
 &LR; jagung &LR;  (fritter-like corn cakes) to meat stews and the
all-important  &LR; sambal kacang &LR;  (peanut sauce that accompanies satay)
and  &LR; gado gado &LR;  (salad of crisply cooked vegetables, fried tofu and
hard-cooked eggs).
</P>
<P>
   The wok is also used for frying the puffy crackers called
 &LR; krupuk &LR; . Hard little disks when purchased, these crackers expand
and become light and crisp when fried in about 3/4-inch of
vegetable oil over medium heat. (It is important to press down on
them with a wire strainer or large slotted spoon while they are
frying to keep them from curling up. Don't worry about breaking
them, Samhi says. They stay supple while they fry but get crisp the
moment they cool.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Krupuk &LR; , plain or shrimp-flavored _ the Djohans' favorite _ is
also popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, pointing to
another important aspect of Indonesian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Though the islands may seem isolated, they have, in fact, a long
history of trade with other Southeast Asian countries, Dutch and
Portuguese colonial cultures and Arab countries (90 percent of
Indonesia's population is Muslim). In contacts with these
civilizations over the centuries, Indonesians have adopted and
adapted many foreign culinary influences. So they had their version
of fusion cuisine long before it became a culinary buzz word.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INDONESIAN RESOURCES
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is a hospitable city for an Indonesian cook. With
the exception of a few Southeast Asian fruits _ such as hairy fruit
and snakeskin fruit _ everything needed for an Indonesian meal is
stocked in a number of Bay Area markets.

<P>
   Bring lightly salted water to a rapid boil in a large pot.
Blanch the vegetables in the water one by one, removing each with a
wire strainer or large slotted spoon when crisp-tender, after about
5 minutes. Reserve the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a wok or skillet, until almost smoking. Cut the
tofu into 3/4-inch cubes and fry, stirring constantly, until
lightly browned. Remove and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Break the tamarind pulp into small pieces
in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak 5 to 10
minutes. Strain through a sieve, pressing on the solids with your
fingers to extract as much tamarind pulp as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and coarsely chop the garlic. Remove seeds from the chile
unless you like your sauce very hot. Using a mortar and pestle or a
processor, blend the garlic and chile to a paste.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a wok or heavy frying pan until rippling. Add
the garlic-chile mixture and saute, stirring, until fragrant, about
3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to low and, stirring constantly, gradually add the
palm sugar, 3 tablespoons tamarind liquid or lemon juice and the
peanut butter. Add water as needed to make a smooth, thick sauce.
The sauce may curdle slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange all the vegetables and the fried tofu on a large
platter. Spoon the peanut sauce over all. Garnish the rim with the
egg quarters and sprinkle fried onions over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with rice and sambal, a Southeast Asian-Indian hot pepper
condiment.

</P>
<P>
   Indonesian food authority and author Sri Owen writes in
``Indonesian Regional Cooking'' that the two secrets to these fried
bananas are fresh frying fat and fruit that is just ripe _ neither
green nor mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup rice flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the rice flour, all-purpose flour, melted butter,
coconut milk and salt to a smooth batter.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the bananas into quarters. If using plantains, cut them in
half lengthwise, then cut each half into 3 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1/2 to 3/4 inch of oil or clarified butter in a large

supermarkets.  
 TASTER'S CHOICE: Chocolate Milk Starts New Year With a Bang   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Chocolate milk may be a kid's dream, but low-fat
chocolate milk can satisfy the sweet cravings in adults without
adding a lot of fat. Plus, many of today's chocolate milks are
thickened with carrageenan, making them seem richer than their
actual fat content.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted seven low-fat chocolate milks, all but one
thickened. Fat ranged from 1 to 3 grams for a 1-cup serving. Two
organic brands were included in the tasting, but overall scored
significantly lower than their nonorganic counterparts. Panelists
thought the organic brands were more watery, sweet and less
chocolaty.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Rockview &LR;   &UR; Farms &LR;  (one pint, 75 cents, at
Trader Joe's). Two panelists particularly liked the dark chocolate
appearance and another described it as tasting like bittersweet
chocolate. However, two others thought the texture was a little
thin and watery. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Berkeley &LR;   &UR; Farms &LR;  (one pint, $1.69-$1.79
at many supermarkets). One panelist commented on the rich chocolate
flavor and velvety texture. However, others found it watery and
chalky. Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking dropped dramatically after second place, but the best of
the remaining chocolate milks was  &UR; Lucerne &LR;  (one quart, $1.63 at
Safeway). Panelists objected to what they perceived as a ``thin''
chocolate flavor, although most agreed the milk had a stellar
texture. In fact, three tasters thought its mouthfeel was fattier
and richer than low-fat. One would buy it, two might buy it and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lucky &LR;  (one pint, 89 cents at Albertson's) placed just below
Lucerne, placing it in fourth place. Two panelists thought it
lacked enough chocolate flavor. Another described the texture as
gummy. Still another liked the balance of chocolate and sugar, but
thought the milk was too watery. Three might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Straus Family Creamery, Sunnyside Farms
and Horizon, but they rated too low.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Nicholas Bundy, graduate of the City College
culinary program and former Chronicle intern; John P. Carroll,
cookbook author; Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San
Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Stu Stein, chef/instructor at the
California Culinary Academy. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

RUSSIAN FAILURE TO MODERNIZE ARMY HINDERS CHECHEN FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fresh from the front lines in Chechnya, a Russian
colonel was grumbling recently about the way his paratrooper
detachment was being used in the fighting against Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   His men are among the best-trained troops in Russia, highly
mobile units trained to move fast and capture the high ground, get
behind enemy lines, and cut off escape routes so the infantry can
move in and do its job.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, there is no Russian infantry, at least none that
the generals can count on. So when the main battle gets underway,
the paratroopers are ordered back into the fighting, only this time
in the unfamiliar role of cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular army cannot fight, so they use us,'' said the
colonel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Paratroopers should
not be fighting in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are being raised frequently by officers in the
better-trained units that have been scraped together from barracks
and police stations across Russia to fight in Chechnya. They get to
the heart of the unsightly truth behind a campaign that Russian
military and civilian leaders have presented not only as a military
success, but also as a symbol of the resurgence of Russia's armed
forces, even its national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the huge, draft-based Russian military desperately
needs to reform into a modern, flexible, well-trained fighting
force _ a fact that was widely recognized after the army was
battered and forced to withdraw during its 1994-1996 campaign in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But if the generals learned the lesson, nothing was ever done
about it. With the battle for Chechnya's capital, Grozny, raging,
plans to modernize and slim down the army to make it more effective
have been put off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a military reform is at this point too
uncertain,'' said Pavel Baev, a specialist on the Russian military
at the Institute of Peace Studies in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Baev said Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, who has built his
popularity on the war effort, ``speaks more about buildup and
modernization than about downsizing and restructuring, avoiding the
term `reform' like a bad omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev and other military analysts say the experience of Russia's
two wars in Chechnya demonstrates the need to upgrade mobile and
combat-capable components of the army. But there is nothing
reflecting this learning process in Russia's new Military Doctrine,
a document that barely mentions local conflicts like Chechnya and
reaffirms the commitment to a large, draft-based army.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers have argued that Russia's success in Chechnya
shows that the military does not need to remake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that Russia has an army, that it can do the
job,'' Colonel Sergei Skiba, commander of a reconnaissance unit,
said at the front near Grozny last month. ``We don't need to change
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why an officer like Skiba might feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a professional military to be a meaningful concept, the
Kremlin needs to raise salaries significantly, increase morale and
public prestige, and rebuild the military in a meaningful manner,''
said Dale Herrspring, a former US diplomat in Moscow an expert on
the Russian military. ``Reform is a very expensive proposition. It
is always cheaper to continue doing things the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, updating Russia's army has consisted mainly of
cutbacks in the number of military personnel, from about 420,000 to
about 350,000 ground troops, according to a report last fall issued
by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an
independent London think tank. Many of those demobilized have been
the junior officers and sergeants who are vital for training and
discipline in an army.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lack of funding, a 1996 plan to make the armed
forces a volunteer professional army was scrapped. The army lacks
resources for training, maintenance, and new equipment, the report
said, adding that except for the nuclear forces, the state of
readiness of Russian forces remains low.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of Russia's 1.2 million-strong military is
composed of relatively useless draftees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has a peacetime draft army, and a peacetime draft army
is not an army, it is an educational institution,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst in Moscow. ``No country
in the world can fight a war with a draft army. It's like sending a
high school team to the college national championship. The
Americans tried to do it in Vietnam and look where it got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that the Russian force in
Chechnya numbers 100,000 men, three times the size of the army that
was defeated in Moscow's 1994-1996 war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 percent of them are draftees, and only a few thousand are
considered to be part of dependable combat units. These have been
cobbled together from ``marines, paratroops, internal security
troops, and anything else that moves and can carry a rifle,'' as
Herrspring put it.
</P>
<P>
   Some units in Chechnya _ riot police, police antiterrorist
squads, and SWAT teams from across Russia _ are individually
well-trained and well-motivated, but they have never trained
together as a military force. They have been issued weapons that
are outdated and unfamiliar to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian command has played up the role of ``kontraktniki,''
veteran soldiers who have signed contracts to serve in Chechnya.
The idea is that these soldiers would fight better than green
draftees. But in the combat zone, the kontraktniki are valued only
slightly higher than raw recruits. A recent visit to the front
found one unit of contract soldiers begging for food and hankering
to get home as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just some bums from some slums who have no other way
to earn a living than joining the army,'' Felgenhauer said. ``You
have to have professional sergeants and officers to make good
soldiers out of bad people. The Russian Army doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the military rotated most of its experienced officers
and sergeants out of Chechnya, making matters worse, Felgenhauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been evident, even if state-controlled
television has kept silent about them. Commentators repeatedly have
mentioned the changes in tactics that have resulted in fewer
Russian casualties in the second Chechen war. But as the rebels'
resistance stiffens in their remaining strongholds _ Grozny and the
mountainous south _ Russian losses have mounted rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic that worked to push the separatists out of Chechnya's
northern plains, by pounding their positions with artillery and
warplanes and keeping the troops in the rear, won't work in the
city or the mountains. Lacking well-trained infantry, the Russians
have been forced to commit their best special-forces troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we were trained to do,'' an officer of a riot
police unit from the Siberian city of Yakutsk growled last week, as
his troops headed off to fight rebels in a Grozny suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they think they are being used the wrong way,''
Felgenhauer said. ``The whole armed forces is being used the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is a deep rift between the Ministry
of Defense, which gives priority to improving Russia's nuclear
weapons, and the General Staff, which is running the war. Defense
Minister Igor Sergeev, a former commander of Russia's strategic
rocket forces, is pushing for funds to deploy the new, highly
accurate Topol intercontintenal rocket. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of
the General Staff, wants the military budget to be spent on
outfitting the troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Karasik, who specializes on the Russian military for
the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., sees the Chechnya war
as ``one big military experiment for Russia.'' Karasik believes
that the fighting will lead to ``a more coherent plan to modernize,
and Kvashnin will lead the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But while analysts agree that Russia's generals are hoping to
parlay their perceived success in Chechnya into larger budgets,
some doubt the army will get enough to pay for real reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Putin had an extra $100 million transferred to the
defense budget. A Defense Ministry official said at the time that
the additional funds would be used to provide troops in the north
Caucasus with ``a wide range of reconnaissance and surveillance
equipment, night-vision equipment, new types of guns and
grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev said: ``The General Staff obviously tries to turn the war
into an instrument of getting more resources. Real reforms _ like
restructuring, downsizing, and modernizing the ground forces;
creating mobile forces; organizing a civilian Defense Ministry
dealing with a real military budget _ are completely forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev and others believe Putin could push for radical changes. To
do that, he would need money Russia does not have. And the reforms
can begin only after the fighting in Chechnya subsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hardly possible to reform the army in the middle of
war,'' Baev noted.

variety of wine topics. 
 WINE POTPOURRI: A Most Cordial Liqueur  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Elixirs have been used for centuries to cure all
kinds of ills. The potions were usually secret blends of herbs,
barks, spices, flowers and seeds, each with its own medicinal
property. Over time, the alchemist's curative elixirs were
transformed into what we enjoy today as liqueurs. Cordial and
liqueur are synonymous terms, with the former used mainly in the
United States.
<P>
   One of the most common forms of these potions was developed by
Christian monks seeking a medicine to cure a number of ailments
common to living in cold, damp monasteries. The local abbey often
served as a hospital in the Middle Ages. Benedictine, named for the
monastic order of the same name, is one of the most popular
liqueurs today. The most elegant, complex and elusive of the great
liqueurs, however, is Chartreuse, made in a monastery near
Grenoble, France.
</P>
<P>
   Originally invented to aid indigestion, green Chartreuse went
public in the early 19th century, when it was served as a
 &LR; digestif &LR;  to French Army officers who were bivouacked at the
abbey. Yellow Chartreuse followed in 1838.
</P>
<P>
   Chartreuse is an herbal liqueur, using a neutral spirit base to
which is added 130 different herbs and botanicals. The herbal
flavors are extracted through maceration and the finished liqueur
is then barrel-aged for several months before bottling. Green
Chartreuse, at 110 proof, is the strongest, while the
honey-flavored yellow is bottled at 80 proof.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Frederick Wildman, importers of Chartreuse, sponsored
a Chartreuse drink recipe contest at MoMo's in San Francisco. The
idea was to develop an original drink recipe, using green
Chartreuse. Contestants from MoMo's, Absinthe, Starlite Room,
Pastis and Little City poured, mixed, tasted and adjusted, then
presented their creations to Erick Boardman, MoMo's beverage
manager, Harry Denton of the Starlite Room and Gino Margarino of
Wine Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to Paulina Krol of Little City for her ``Little
Somethin', Somethin','' while second place was given to Marcovaldo
Dionysos, of Absinthe for a concoction he named ``Green Demon.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Forrar of the Starlite Room won first place with ``Hot &AMP;
Bothered,'' a warm drink that highlighted the complex aromatics and
flavors of green Chartreuse.
</P>
<P>
   For one serving of ``Hot &AMP; Bothered,'' muddle 2 lemon slices in
a snifter, add 2 to 3 whole cloves, hot water and honey to taste,
less than a teaspoon. Top it off with 11/2 to 2 ounces of green
Chartreuse, stir and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal dram of Chartreuse is said to have the ability to
prolong life and restore health. Maybe, but I can't think of a
better way to get ``Hot &AMP; Bothered'' this winter than with a little
Chartreuse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anno Domini &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While we're considering great drinks to savor and contemplate,
treat yourself to a bottle of Germain-Robin Anno Domini, a
California brandy that is the equal of the best Cognacs. Made in
Mendocino by Alambic, Inc., Anno Domini is assembled from distiller
Hubert Germain-Robin's best aged brandies, then finished in French
oak barrels for a silky richness that lingers on the palate. Anno
Domini is $350 and in limited distribution, but if you can't find
it, try any of Germain-Robin's excellent brandies. You won't be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Para for the New Year &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1878, Benno Seppelt made the first Seppelt Para port in his
new winery in Australia's Barossa Valley. Seppelt wanted to
wood-age his port for 100 years. Today, Seppelt draws on its
founder's legacy, a stock of Tawny ports dating back to 1878. The
1899 Seppelt Para Tawny port is the 21st in a series of
100-year-old ports, made in the same style from Shiraz, Grenache
and Mourvedre. I had occasion to taste some Para ports in Australia
and they are awesome, unlike any other port on the market. Only 250
bottles of the 1899 Para port will be available in the United
States for $750 each, so get your piece of history that will pay
you pleasurable benefits for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The last Potpourri of 1999 mentioned a sweet wine called
Y-Tokay, a fun wine made from the Tokay grape by Clos du Bois.
After rereading that item, it occurred to me that there is some
confusion about the use of the name Tokay. When spelled Tokay, the
wine is white and made from a spicy Muscatlike grape of the same
name. However, in the French wine region of Alsace, there is a
white wine called Tokay d'Alsace, which has nothing to do with
Tokay, but is made from the Pinot Gris grape. To eliminate that
confusion, the European Union has instructed Alsace wineries to
stop using the term Tokay d'Alsace. Finally, there is Tokaj, a
classic sweet wine made in the Tokaj region of Hungary and little
known today by modern wine drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sauvignon Blanc Redux &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I love Sauvignon Blanc, but in recent vintages I've been
disappointed with California Sauvignons. The Chronicle Wine
Selections on this page lists nine 1998 Sonoma Sauvignon Blancs
that, even at our lowest rating of two stars, were the best of the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on with Sauvignon Blanc? I wish I knew, but here
are a few of the panelists' comments from the Sauvignon tasting:
``over-cropped grapes,'' ``weak in flavor, watery,'' ``some of the
wines are technically clean, but not interesting,'' and ``too much
oak trying to hide the flavors.'' And the most telling comment of
all: ``It seems that few of these wineries take Sauvignon Blanc
seriously.''

BURNS: COACH HUNT ISN'T FAIR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A barefoot Pat Burns sat in a chair near the office door and
nearly doubled over as he recalled the one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that one,'' he said Monday after his Bruins had
finished practicing at the Ristuccia Center in suburban Wilmington,
Mass. ``What was it that Rick Pitino called talk-show callers? `The
fellowship of the miserable'? Man. I was howling when I heard that
one . . .''
</P>
<P>
   So the head coach of the Bruins howled again as he told the
story of the radio-bashing Celtics coach. When you are a pro coach
_ in any sport _ you savor the laughter as often as you can. You
realize laughter will not come often. You realize that when it
comes, somebody is probably laughing at you. And when times are
most difficult, the raucous laughter will be followed by a
diabolical call for your job.
</P>
<P>
   We are at an interesting intersection in Boston pro sports. Pete
Carroll has been fired from the Patriots after an 8-8 finish. There
have been rumblings about Burns being fired because of the Bruins'
14-18-10 record. And while Pitino is virtually unfireable, the
Celtics' president/head coach leads a bad team headed for yet
another New Jersey lottery in the spring. He also guides a
desperate organization that has resorted to Double A baseball
promotions (shave your head, gain admittance) to sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It is every fan's right to question a coach's performance. The
same is true for sportswriters, many of whom begin to shake
violently when six months have passed without a call for someone's
income to be snatched away. But reality is that no one understands
the psyche of a pro coach like a pro coach. That's why Burns
thought of making a phone call last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call Pete Carroll,'' he said, ``but I didn't know
how to get in touch with him.''
</P>
<P>
   What was he going to do, tell the former coach that he shouldn't
have let Sam Gash get away? Was he going to rip the offensive
philosophy of Ernie Zampese?
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Pete. He never really had a chance, after the 6-2
start,'' Burns said. ``I would just tell him to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same message he has delivered to several coaches in
the NHL. It is what he told Kevin Constantine when Constantine was
fired this season by the Penguins. Quite frankly, it may be a
message he recites to the mirror one day before 2001. This is how
the business works.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was not pleased when the Globe's Kevin Paul Dupont
suggested that, no matter how wrongheaded the decision, Burns could
be the man who pays the price for his, his players', and
management's mistakes. Life is hard enough when you have to worry
about your own errors. Imagine being responsible for your flaws and
everyone else's. (I have never been a parent, but I imagine that's
kind of what it's like to be one.)
</P>
<P>
   As Burns spoke Monday, he fiddled with some magnets that had his
players' names on them. He pushed a group of magnets to the right
of a message board.
</P>
<P>
   ``My injured guys,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to speak about the firing business. He talked about
how he has been criticized in two languages, French and English.
Recently, he has run into some fans in Greater Boston who yelled,
``Go back to Montreal.'' And that's not so bad because, ``In
Montreal, I had a few cabbies give me the finger. And they'd try to
run you over.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a few more stories and then uttered a comment that is
very logical, yet very irrelevant when it comes to pro coaches:
``Dammit, there's got to be more than one guy accountable when
something goes wrong with a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he right? Of course. If the season ended today, the Bruins
would not be in the playoffs, even if they clearly have the
personnel of a playoff team. Whom do you blame for their record?
You could point to a lot of people, but the cliche is always to
figuratively behead the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Harry Sinden assured him that his job was not in
jeopardy. ``Sometimes,'' Burns said with a laugh, ``that's the kiss
of death for a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, with all respect to Sinden, I wouldn't be too comfortable
if I were Burns. This is not the real world. A man's word is not a
man's bond in pro sports. There are two things coaches can count
on: being criticized and being lied to. Now that I think about it,
three things: criticized, lied to . . . and fired. That's even true
for a coach like Burns, whose teams never have missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a quick conversation with Burns and get a glimpse
of why he has been so successful in his career. He says he can
watch five minutes of a game and find 100 mistakes. He admits that
he goes off on reporters sometimes just to fire up his team. He
recently walked away from NECN's Chris Collins after a series of
questions that he didn't like (``But I don't personally dislike the
guy,'' he said). He said that a good head coach must have a
presence with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a popularity contest,'' he said. ``Look, (Dave)
Andreychuk has played for me four or five years and I don't think
we've had a conversation. It's not that I don't like him, but I
think he looks at it this way: He has a job to do and I have a job
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Burns's job required him to take a trainer's fishing box _
filled with Band-Aids _ and throw it on the ice to protest a call.
He was thrown out of that game. He laughed Monday when he talked
about another coach who was so upset with an official that he
grabbed a stick and went on the ice flailing it as if he were a
blind man with a cane. You know, the coach was trying to say that
the referee missed the call.
</P>
<P>
   More laughs from Burns. It was good to see. Laughs are rare. Ask
Mrs. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and his wife were in New Hampshire Sunday. They were
in the woods, supposedly relaxing. Line Burns noticed that her
husband had a distant and familiar look in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not here right now, are you?'' she said. ``You're at
the FleetCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `What's my plan if Allison can't go . . .' ''
he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What a job. Burns should not lose it, even if the Bruins go
winless in their next 10. He is the best coach in the city. But he
is also a pro coach, and pro coaches inevitably become receptacles
for misplaced blame.

EDITORS NOTE: Every other week, The Chronicle features ``Learning
to Cook'' by Marion Cunningham, a cooking teacher and cookbook
author best known for her revisions of the Fannie Farmer cookbooks.
This column is intended for novices in the kitchen. &HT;     LEARNING TO COOK: Dust Off the Pot, Fondue Is Making a
Comeback   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Following my last column featuring Baked Fondue,
today's recipe is the classic version of this famous Swiss dish.
<P>
   This, too, is simple to make. But it requires either a fondue
pot placed in the middle of the table or a heatproof casserole that
can sit over a burner to keep the dish hot once the fondue has been
cooked on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   Each person has a fork (fondue forks are 10 inches long) that
they can use to spear a cube of bread. Then they dunk and coat the
bread with fondue and eat it.
</P>
<P>
   A salad that goes well with this dish is a mixture of baby
spinach leaves, butter lettuce, crisp Fuji apples and celery. The
dressing consists of a mixture of olive oil, rice vinegar and a
little sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Fondue goes back many centuries in Switzerland, but it was not
well known until the famous French epicure, Brillat-Savarin wrote
about it in his classic, ``The Physiology of Taste,'' in 1874. It
became a popular European dish from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Fondue is not just a recent concept. I believe it is our modern
version of primal man crouched near an outdoor fire, sharing food
with the clan. Fondue is modern way of eating food at a communal
table.
</P>
<P>
   The best routine we have is the daily ritual of sharing with
others around the table at home.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CHEESE FONDUE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Gruyere or Emmenthaler cheese, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kirsch (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large loaf French or Italian bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
(leave crusts on)
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely grate the cheese and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put the wine and cornstarch into a jar, screw on the lid and
shake until well mixed. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the paper skin from the garlic and crush the clove,
pressing down hard with the broad blade of a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the crushed clove of garlic all over the bottom of a fondue
dish, or any 2-quart flameproof enameled casserole. Light the
burner under the fondue dish. Pour the wine/cornstarch mixture into
the fondue dish and heat until the wine is hot, but not boiling.
The wine  &LR; must not &LR;  boil, it should only be hot enough to melt the
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cheese, a handful at a time, stirring constantly with a
table fork. As each addition melts and becomes creamy, add another
handful and repeat stirring with a fork until all the cheese is
melted and smoothly blended. When the fondue is creamy and smooth,
stir in the optional kirsch and the nutmeg and salt. Stir to blend,
then taste and add more nutmeg or salt if the flavor is faint.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the fondue pot to the table and place over its heat
source. Each guest spears a cube of bread and dips it into the
fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

&HT;     WANTED: HISPANIC WOMEN WHO WILL GRIN AND BARE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By IHOSVANI RODRIGUEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A Playboy photo crew is searching for the perfect
Hispanic woman who is willing to bare (almost) all.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the duality of the magazine itself _ it occasionally
contains award-winning journalism, but the main sales attraction
remains pictorials of nude women _ people are here have debated
whether to welcome the Playboy crew or shun it.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's search for Hispanics to appear in an upcoming
``Latinas Sensuales'' issue irritates the magazine's detractors
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playboy has always been big on promoting stereotypes of women
that can eventually have an adverse effect,'' said Juanita
Firestone, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at San
Antonio. ``They're saying that this is what a Latina is supposed to
look like. They're so tied to that one particular look _ something
very exotic and somewhat anglicized _ when in reality most Latinas
don't look like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue there is nothing wrong with Playboy, which, they
say, portrays women tastefully when compared to the lewd portrayals
in some other magazines for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the full content of the magazine, and the
lifestyle that it covers, you'll see that Playboy is very
sophisticated. It's very aware of its sophisticated image, and it
doesn't objectify women as much as other magazines,'' said Sammye
Johnson, professor of communication at Trinity University. ``They
celebrate fine arts and fine lifestyle. When they use women at
different stages of undress, I think they're celebrating feminine
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is seeking models from Los Angeles, Miami, San
Antonio and San Diego for the section on Hispanic women. The recent
search in Miami attracted more than 200 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin craze in the arts and entertainment world is the
reason for an issue devoted almost entirely to Hispanic women, a
magazine official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything that's Latina is hot,'' Playboy
spokeswoman Karen Ring Borgstrom said. ``We understand that some
people may have problems with what we're doing. However, if you
look at the very definition of feminism itself, you'll see that
these women who decide to use their femininity to their advantage
are making a very feminist decision. I've been working for Playboy
for 29 years, and if I thought there was something wrong with the
magazine I wouldn't be working here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic women interested in appearing in Playboy must make an
appointment with magazine representatives. Auditions in San Antonio
will be held through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have the option of posing nude or clothed during the
audition, and they are negotiating their own compensation.
</P>
<P>
   They must be at least 18 years old and appear for auditions with
two forms of photo identification showing their date of birth.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute
Recipe takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast and
Fresh. 
 WORKING COOK: Winter Greens Add French Note to Chicken   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Pan frying chicken breasts can be a challenge.
Ideally, you'd like them to be golden brown on the outside and
juicy on the inside. More often than not you get a nicely browned
hockey puck or a juicy piece of meat with alarming traces of pink
inside.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to avoid chicken breast issues is to use small,
thin half-breasts, which are featured in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh
recipe, and relatively high heat for quick browning without
overcooking. If you do end up using larger breasts, brown them on
one side, turn them over and then finish them in a 400 degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   The greens accompanying the chicken add a French touch,
especially if you add some pan drippings to them. To simplify the
recipe, use whole, prewashed baby spinach leaves and saute them
until just wilted (braising is not necessary).
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Dish utilizes five-spice powder, a Chinese
spice mixture made of ground star anise, cinnamon, Szechuan
peppercorn, fennel seeds and cloves. Heady and rich, it brings an
intense earthiness to many Chinese dishes, especially braised ones.
</P>
<P>
   The spice mix complements shiitake mushrooms extremely well. In
this vegetarian dish, soaking dried shiitakes creates an instant
broth that intensifies the stir-fry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In the Now &AMP; Later beef stew recipe, sweet parsnips balance the
acidity of a healthy dose of red wine. When preparing a
long-simmering stew like this, your main goal should be to cut the
meat and vegetables into uniform pieces. They cook more evenly that
way, and they also look a whole lot better on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes

<P>
   PAN-FRIED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH BRAISED WINTER GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch Swiss chard or other winter greens
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil + 2 to 3 tablespoons olive
oil for sauteing the chicken
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   4 skinless boneless chicken half-breasts (4 to 5 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Mince the garlic. Cut off the stalks of the greens, then chop
the leaves width-wise into 1-inch ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium skillet (preferably nonstick)
over low heat. Add the garlic and saute for a few minutes. Add the
greens and increase the heat to medium. Stir until incorporated and
the greens start to wilt. Add the broth and bring to a simmer.
Cover and cook until the greens are tender, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the tenderloin (the thin muscle loosely attached to the
breast), from each half-breast and set aside for another use.
Season each breast liberally with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons
oil and heat until almost smoking. Carefully add 2 of the
half-breasts. Saute until browned and the inside has no trace of
pink but is still juicy, about 11/2 to 21/2 minutes per side.
Remove with a slotted spoon to a warm plate and repeat with
remaining half-breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the vinegar into the greens, and adjust the seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Place a portion of the greens in the center of each
plate. Top with chicken and drizzle with pan juices.

</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms

<P>
   2 green onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instrctions:
</P>
<P>
   Start bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bring the 21/2 cups water to a boil in a small
saucepan. Add the dried shiitakes, cover and simmer 3 minutes.
Drain liquid into bowl, then squeeze the mushrooms in your hands
over the bowl. Set aside mushrooms and liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the noodles in the large pot of boiling water until tender
(according to package directions). Drain and rinse under cold
running water. Drain well.

and dried shiitakes and slice into thin strips.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large saucepan
over medium heat. Add the 5-spice powder and the shallots and
saute, stirring frequently, over medium heat until tender, about 2
minutes. Add the garlic and saute 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Increase heat to medium-high and add both fresh and dry
shiitakes with 1/2 cup of the reserved mushroom-soaking water.
Saute, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are tender, about 3

   BEEF STEW WITH PARSNIPS, SHALLOTS &AMP; ROSEMARY
</P>
<P>
   Though supermarkets offer cubed stew meat, you'll have a cleaner
tasting, less fatty stew if you buy bottom round and cut it
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 pounds beef bottom round, fat removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups red wine
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds shallots, peeled and halved (quartered if very large)
</P>
<P>
   8 cups low-salt beef broth
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds parsnips
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds red new potatoes, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Season the meat with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with a bit
of the rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large, heavy stockpot over medium-high heat. When warm,
add enough oil to fully cover the bottom of the pan and heat until
almost smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Working in batches, add the meat without crowding the pan. Allow
the meat to brown on one side, then turn and brown on the other
sides, turning as necessary. When the cubes are nicely browned,
remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the pan with half of the wine, scraping the bottom of
the pan to dislodge all the browned bits. Boil until the liquid has
almost evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to medium. Add the shallots and remaining rosemary
and brown slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining wine and
simmer until the alcohol evaporates, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the meat to the pan. Add the broth, bring to a boil,
reduce heat, cover and simmer for 50 minutes, until the meat is
quite tender.
</P>
<P>
   While the meat cooks, peel the parsnips and roll-cut into even
bite-size pieces (place parsnip on a cutting board and cut off an
end on the bias. Roll the parsnip 180 degrees and cut again on the
bias. Repeat.)
</P>
<P>
   Cut the new potatoes into similar-size pieces _ quartered if
large, or leave whole if very small.
</P>
<P>
   When the meat has cooked 50 minutes, add the parsnips and
potatoes. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, until tender.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

   Saying this last weekend, when his AmericaOne campaign from San
Diego had won just three races in a 10-race series, might have
seemed a bit presumptuous. But even in spite of a boat breakdown in
Race 2 of the current series, a certain sense of destiny has been
hanging over the San Francisco team since the very beginning when
it went 8-2 in October's warmup round.
</P>
<P>
   Barring horrendous bad luck, Cayard will race in the Louis
Vuitton Cup finals starting Jan. 25. If he wins _ probably against
Prada _ he would then square off with New Zealand in February.
</P>
<P>
   He has proven that on most days, with at least even luck,
AmericaOne with him driving and John Kostecki calling tactics can
beat any of the 10 other challengers that started racing here three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If not for that one bad-luck race _ the day his genoa track
exploded under pressure _ AmericaOne could well be the only
undefeated of six boats in this round.
</P>
<P>
   And with a healthy respect for all sports _ basketball is one he
played and still loves _ the San Francisco State alumnus places
sailboat racing in the context of other sports. Conclusion: The
America's Cup is horribly antiquated and needs change.
</P>
<P>
   As he mused near the dock of his compound before a race with
crosstown rival Dawn Riley, Cayard said, ``The first person to set
up a system where the event is going to be a much better event for
everyone _ participants, the public, the corporate partners _ he'll
get the support of everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard says he is that person.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the first Cup racer to realize that this
billion-dollar international event is vulnerable because it has no
central management. Unlike in the NFL, Major League Baseball, or
even boxing, the authority over the America's Cup falls to the last
winner as he or she interprets a Deed of Gift written in 1887 by
the Cup's original champion, the New York Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' said Cayard, ``we don't even have a calendar.
In Formula One, they race in Monza, then they race in England, and
they race in Monte Carlo. Or NBA basketball, they have a calendar
of events. But here, how do you follow sailing at this level if
you're a sailing fan and you don't even know when the races are?''
</P>
<P>
   From America's Cup to the Whitbread to the Volvo, goes the
Cayard vision, the world's top sailing teams would make the circuit
on a regular basis. Keep the continuity going, keep the team names
before the public, and allow sponsors to identify their products
with the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the whole thing is so discontinuous,'' he said,
``that it's hard for Ford or HP to build a public awareness that,
`Oh yeah, you're the guys who support the sailing team,' so all the
sailing buffs can buy HP computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard would like to see the Cup run every two years, and twice
at each venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``More intensity over a shorter period of time,'' said Cayard.
``This event is just too drawn out. It would be best run as a
six-week, high-impact schedule like World Cup soccer finals. I
think that would sell better. I think all that crap we went through
here in October was just not followed very heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than one 18-mile race per day, Cayard would like to toy
with the format. Perhaps three starts with a single
windward/leeward loop after each start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, if you were tied after two heats, the third one
would be a tiebreaker for the point,'' he said. ``And the three
short races would only take 2 1/2 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cayard has had years on the America's Cup scene to develop his
thinking, and now, with his stature in sailing reaching its
fruition point, he has the authority.
</P>
<P>
   He started Cup sailing in 1983 as a 23-year-old mainsheet
trimmer for the late Tom Blackaller on Defender, the team that lost
the Challenger finals to Dennis Conner's ill-fated Liberty
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Fremantle, Australia, Blackaller had promoted Cayard to
tactician on the radical but underfunded USA campaign, the first
from San Francisco. Again, Conner won the challenger's role and
went on to win the Cup back for the San Diego Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the shakeout over New Zealand's big boat versus the
Conner catamaran settled down and the new IACC 75-footers were in
place in San Diego, Cayard was back in 1992 as the hired gunslinger
for Italy's Il Moro de Venezia.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate showdown between Cayard and New Zealand was as
tough on the water as off, as Il Moro helped fuel the challenge to
New Zealand's allegedly illegal use of a bowsprit. So intense grew
the controversy that New Zealand showed signs of unraveling.
Finally, in the challenger finals the pressure became too intense,
and with his loyal patron Raul Gardini firmly in place behind him,
smoking cigarettes in the 17th man slot on the maroon Il Moro,
Cayard roared back from a 4-1 deficit for a 5-4 defeat of New
Zealand for the Louis Vuitton Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulo'' had become an adopted son and national hero of Italy,
and took his place as a world-class skipper. The fact that Il Moro
lost to Bill Koch's America3 that year, and that New Zealand beat
Cayard three years later when he drove Young America for Conner in
The Match, did not diminish Cayard's stature. It was clear his best
years lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On his resume were six world championships Cayard won in Star
class, and an Admiral's Cup win in 1995. But the most impressive
win had to be the 1997-98 Whitbread Around the World race in which
Cayard's sailing skills fused with his ability to manage a huge,
complex program. He not only won but dominated the grueling,
nine-month race and emerged with a claim to the title of the
world's premier all-around sailor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's program is a combination of experience and young
enthusiasm, with some new sailors in their first America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   While he has felt solid throughout this event, Cayard admits
that the pressures of running a complex campaign while skippering a
racing machine and crew on the water can be overwhelming at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many pieces to the puzzle, it can really get
to you,'' he said. ``This is the way Dennis Conner was able to do
it, but the way things are going, it's too much. There's a lot
going on, and for a long time I was buried in the details of trying
to raise money, making phone calls to sponsors and writing letters
and following up with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm fully involved with the boats and the maneuvers. I'm
fully into sails and sail shapes. All these subtleties require a
lot of personal attention by me. It's really full-time. Honestly,
it's probably not the best way to do it. It's too much for one
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into this semifinal round, which began a week ago, Cayard
was nervous about the best-of-six format, despite AmericaOne's
strong record. On any given day, a strong team can suffer a fluke
loss to a weaker team, losing a point it had already banked.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that was exactly the case the day AmericaOne broke its
headfoil racing America True.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole format,'' said Cayard, ``is very nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cayard's stated plan for his syndicate _ to build one
boat to use for the first three months, with a second boat for the
finals _ has worked to a T. Principal designer Bruce Nelson (one of
the Stars &AMP; Stripes '87 luminaries) created Hull 49, and the
present Hull 61. Both have a dark gray ``intimidating'' look, with
splashes of lime green waves on the hull, and lime spinnakers.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any chafing as AmericaOne's bid took shape the last
three years, it was never apparent to outside eyes, though some
earlier reports suggested that Cayard may be getting bogged down in
detail.
</P>
<P>
   But now, well more than halfway up the torturous climb to the
pinnacle of the America's Cup, Cayard is not only looking to the
top, but also to the future of the sport he has poured his life and
talent into.
</P>
<P>
   And how close is the world of yacht racing from seeing Cayard's
sweeping changes in the America's Cup?
</P>
<P>
   Said Cayard, never one to underestimate his chances of winning
it all here next month: ``We're one win away.''

column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods. 
 BEST WAY: Cooking Broccoli   By Rebecca Markowitz  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Broccoli is one of the most commonly eaten
vegetables in America. It is accessible year-round and can be used
in a variety of dishes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broccoli is a member of the crucifer family, which also includes
cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale and arugula. The entire crucifer
family contains phytonutrients that aid the enzymes that help fight
carcinogens. The darker the crucifer, the higher the amount of
phytonutrients. So, for example, broccoli is better for you than
cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know why you should eat broccoli, here is our best
way to cook it.
</P>
<P>
   When preparing broccoli, it is best to first remove the florets
from the stem. Lay the broccoli on a cutting board and cut off the
thick stem near the base of the florets. Trim the florets from the
remaining stem. Break apart or slice any large florets. The pieces
should be bite-size.
</P>
<P>
   We began our tests by cooking 1/4 pound of florets using three
common methods: boiling, steaming and microwaving.
</P>
<P>
   When boiled for only three minutes, the broccoli became very
soft. The florets looked limp and tasted overcooked. When salt was
added to the boiling water, the broccoli became mushy and reminded
tasters of broccoli they had eaten in school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Steaming resulted in a uniformly cooked floret. A metal steaming
basket was placed in the bottom of a 4-quart saucepan with enough
water to cover the bottom but did not touch the vegetables. The
water was boiling before the broccoli was added; it was cooked for
4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Microwaving took between 11/2 to 2 minutes, and produced
inconsistent levels of doneness. The same floret could be fully
cooked in some parts and raw and crunchy in others.
</P>
<P>
   We also tested salting the broccoli, both before and after
cooking. Sprinkling the broccoli with salt before cooking resulted
in an even flavor throughout with no apparent change in the texture
or appearance of the florets.
</P>
<P>
   The broccoli that was salted after cooking tasted saltier, even
though the amount _ 1/4 teaspoon _ was the same. The salt flavor
also was less consistently distributed. When salted after cooking,
some of the smaller florets looked a bit worse for wear abused &LR; from
the post-cooking toss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   Toss 1/4 pound broccoli florets with 1/4 teaspoon salt, then
steam in a metal basket over boiling water that doesn't touch the
broccoli for 4 minutes.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Rivoli Masters Mushroom Fritters   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Few appetizers are as enticing as Wendy Brucker's
Portobello Mushroom Fritters, but few chefs are as talented as she
is, either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fritters are composed of mushrooms that are crunchy outside
and steamy-soft inside. They're combined with an arugula and
Parmesan salad enhanced with a sherry vinaigrette, and then the
whole dish is drizzled with a creamy aioli. It's an unbeatable
combination of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the great dishes she prepares at Rivoli in
Berkeley, which she owns with her husband, Roscoe Skipper. The room
has an open casual feel, thanks to large windows that overlook a
manicured garden in back. It's warm and comfortable, perfect for
her enticing food.
</P>
<P>
   Her combinations are clean and direct: puree of artichoke soup
with shaved Parmesan; braised pot roast with mashed potatoes,
roasted root vegetables and a watercress and horseradish creme
fraiche; or a delicious hot fudge sundae with whipped cream and
toasted nuts.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a homey neighborhood menu, but the execution is so
good that people drive from all over the Bay Area to dine at
Rivoli.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Rivoli, 1539 Solano Ave. (near Peralta), Berkeley; (510) &LR; 
 &LR; 526-2542. Open for dinner nightly. &LR;

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ High heat &LR; . Mushrooms should be cooked at 350 degrees so they
crisp.

TITANS' ADAMS IS AN ORIGINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Bud Adams was wandering through his team's
spankingly huge locker room aimlessly, for the miracle _ like all
miracles _ could not be immediately grasped. Adams had a huge cigar
in his hand, unlit, as he tried to put words together to explain
what just had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville might just as well have seen a miraculous reunion of
George Jones, Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and all
the country music legends down at the Grand Ole Opry for what had
just transpired inside Adelphia Coliseum. Nashville is new to pro
football, but Adams is not, and if the fans of the Tennessee Titans
exulted, Adams virtually glowed.
</P>
<P>
   For, unlike the Titans' fans, Adams has paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time in Seattle when we were down to the goal
line and had an easy field goal to kick to win the game with almost
no time left,'' Adams recalled. ``But they blocked it and they ran
it all the way back for a touchdown and instead of winning the game
at the end, we lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams gave that as an example of the many, many heartaches he
has endured. But that game, in which his Houston Oilers lost to the
Seahawks, had come in midseason long ago; it was not a playoff
game. But Adams perhaps could be forgiven for his memory lapse
because he is unique among the original American Football League
founders and their franchises. Adams's team is the only one that
hasn't made it to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have made it, the Chargers have, the Chiefs and
Jets and Raiders have, as well as the Bills and Broncos. But not
Adams's team, which began as the Houston Oilers and is now the
Titans. And now only three of the original AFL owners are left:
Lamar Hunt in Kansas City, Ralph Wilson in Buffalo, and Bud Adams
here, across from the slumbering Cumberland River and Music City
USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where Ralph is,'' said Adams when asked if had
gone over to offer his condolences to Wilson after a shocking
lateral produced a 75-yard kickoff return and a truly astounding
last-second win by the Titans over the Bills Saturday. ``I don't
know if Ralph has left his (owner's) box.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams quickly realized that his reply bordered on rudeness, so
he immediately added that he and Wilson had talked warmly before
the game. He and Wilson have gone through too much to be rude to
each other, first helping to found the AFL 40 years ago and then
helping to raid the NFL during the 1960s, forcing the established
league to merge with its upstart rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Ralph understands the game,'' said Adams. ``He's been
there a few times and he knows what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was that Adams has not been there, and Adams went
out of his way to point out, ``Ralph and I have been in this the
same length of time. We go back to 1960 the first year, the start
of the American Football League. There's only three of us left
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And on this day Wilson's Bills had lost and Adams's Titans had
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game just doesn't end like that,'' said Adams, toying with
the unlit cigar. ``You'll probably not see one end like that again.
I doubt you'll ever see that play again because everybody'll be
ready for it. I've seen a lot in my day but not that.''
</P>
<P>
   His original Houston Oilers had played at Jeppesen Stadium, then
at Rice Stadium for a bit, and then moved to the eighth wonder of
the world, the Astrodome. Upon moving to Tennessee, Adams became a
temporary tenant at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, then at Vanderbilt
Stadium, and now finally has the new Adelphia Coliseum in
Nashville. But ultimate success has eluded him since the NFL and
AFL merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first year in our new stadium, all our new fans, our new
uniforms _ I'd have to say this ranks up there with the nicest ones
I've ever had,'' said Adams. And then he nudged the victory upward,
saying, `It's moved into my No. 1 win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s alone, Adams has seen his Oilers blow
fourth-quarter leads in playoff game after the 1991, 1992, and 1993
seasons. The first time, quarterback Warren Moon was unable to get
a first down in Denver, allowing what could never be allowed in
Denver, a John Elway chance at a drive in the final moments. Next,
the Oilers blew a 35-3 lead up in Buffalo. Finally, an aging Joe
Montana in Kansas City took apart his team. Always the same result:
Bud Adams's team stopped short of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' said Adams, ``we've had our disappointing losses. We
had four games that we thought would get us to the Super Bowl,
especially in '93 (the Buffalo loss) when it didn't seem like we'd
miss it. But we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Oilers were far from the Super Bowl each time. The
41-38 loss to the Bills was in a wild-card game, and the 26-24 loss
to the Broncos in 1992 and the 28-20 loss to the Chiefs in 1994
were divisional playoff games. In Adams's mind, his team was merely
a step from the Super Bowl, but it rarely got close.
</P>
<P>
   ``In missing all those years,'' said Adams, ``I was thinking,
`We had to get there sometime.' And we kept building for it and
maybe it might happen this year. We've got a good young coach (Jeff
Fisher) and a good young team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams has been through too much to push his fantasy too
fast. He's not thinking Super Bowl yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, it's an elimination thing, this playoff thing,''
said the Titans owner, ``and some teams that are better than others
don't get there because they screw up in one game on the way there.
And we almost screwed up (Saturday). We were as lucky as hell to
win this one. I had to admit, I thought it was all over and we'd
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams then laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows you,'' he said. ``I can be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cigar was still between his fingers, unlit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were giving 'em away free and I just thought I'd grab
one,'' he said. ``I don't smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wandered around the locker room, tossing out unhappy
memory after unhappy memory, mixing in a good memory now and then,
the cigar twisting in his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wild cards once in San Diego (1979), and (fullback
Earl) Campbell was hurt and (quarterback Dan) Pastorini was hurt,
and our No. 1 receiver was out and the owner of the Chargers told
me before the game that he felt so sorry that we had to come all
the way out to San Diego to play a game when we didn't have our
best personnel,'' Adams reminisced about a 17-14 win by the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Oilers won two AFL championships, way back in 1960
and 1961, since then they have lost twice in AFL title games (1962
and 1967) and lost back-to-back AFC Championship games (1979,
1980).
</P>
<P>
   Truly, Adams has paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a shot this year,'' said Adams, lighting up his fantasy
if not the cigar in his fingers. ``We'll find a way.''

RAMOS HAS THE STYLE TO STIR THE REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mauricio Ramos has warm memories of his first visit to New
England, which was when he was preparing with Bolivia's national
team at UMass-Dartmouth for the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all made to feel at home,'' said Ramos, who is
expected to be the Revolution's midfield choreographer next season.
``Everyone on the team gave everything we had, and playing in the
World Cup was a great experience, the highlight of my career, the
dream of every footballer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of the region's Bolivian immigrants attended the
team's practices in June '94, and the 0-0 tie with South Korea was
played before a sellout crowd at Foxboro Stadium. Though Bolivia
was eliminated after the first round, its display of class and
competence validated the level of the country's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, 30, returned last week to lesser fanfare and cooler
temperatures. He is working out with his new teammates at a fitness
facility and residing in a hotel while searching for productive
fishing sites and a home for his family _ wife Laura and two
children, Laura, 8, and Mauricio, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution training and exhibition games will begin in earnest
Jan. 28 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. And the Revolution, who have
struggled to find a successful style in four seasons, will have
less than two months to adjust to Ramos's rhythm before their
opener March 18 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At least it is clear how coach Fernando Clavijo plans to build
the team. Colombian Leonel Alvarez will support Ramos in midfield.
Ecuadoran Eduardo Hurtado and Venezuelan Giovanni Savarese will be
the goal-scorers. Everyone else will be support players _ and even
if they do not speak Spanish will require a Latin understanding of
the game. Passing skills will be paramount. Players will have to be
comfortable on the ball. Impatient play and other tactical
deficiencies will be unacceptable, because a single weak link will
sabotage the effectiveness of the style of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution still have far to go to assemble a team skillful
enough to become a contender in Major League Soccer's Eastern
Conference. But they are establishing a direction for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treated very well by everyone since I came here,''
Ramos said. ``And this is very important for me. The guys I have
met are friendly and I am sure we will have a good team. We have a
good mixture of players, and everyone is excited to turn things
around here. With the players we have, we should be much better
than last year. I could promise the people a championship, but that
would not be realistic. What I can say is that the people will
recognize our will to win and they will see us working day by day
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is wisely attempting to keep expectations at a reasonable
level. He has been compared with Marco Etcheverry, his compatriot
from Tahuichi Academy in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and his role will
be similar to Etcheverry's with D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to be compared with another player,
especially Marco, who is a friend and who plays the same
position,'' Ramos said. ``We perform the same function, the team's
No. 10, but we have very different styles of play. Marco likes to
bring the ball from outside the penalty area to the goal. We both
like to build the play and pass, but if I have a chance I will take
a shot from outside the area.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Draft no breeze
</P>
<P>
   The MLS has wisely decided to place all eligible players into a
single pool for a Super Draft Feb. 6 in Fort Lauderdale. But under
the current system, the draft is unlikely to attain anything more
than superficial popularity. The enterprise of each team's scouting
and selecting process is subverted because players' names must be
submitted to the league and the players must be available for an
open tryout camp.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if a team succeeds in the draft process, there will
have been little speculation leading up to the event. And
speculation is the lifeblood of publicizing a drafting system. The
MLS and its teams would receive much more publicity without a
draft, because the scouting and selecting process would be the
responsibility of each team. Also, teams' ability to judge talent
would be tested, with accompanying accountability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Iran ineffective
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran struggled in its US debut Sunday. Mexico defeated the
Iranians, 2-1, before 34,289 spectators in Oakland, Calif. Juan
Pablo Rodriguez, who was recruited as an 18-year-old by the MLS but
failed to make an impression with San Jose in '97, set up both
Mexican goals, by Luis Hernandez in the fifth minute and Cuauhtemoc
Blanco 13 minutes later. Ali Daei converted a penalty for Iran in
the 26th minute. Iran will meet Ecuador Wednesday and the US Sunday
in Pasadena . . . The World Club Championship, which concludes
Friday, is illustrating the potential power of club soccer. The
tournament, wedged into the crowded international calendar, has
captured the attention of only a fraction of the audience of the
World Cup. But the BBC reported that there were 11 million viewers
for the Manchester United-Necaxa first-round match. Maracana
Stadium appeared to be nearly filled for the Vasco da
Gama-Manchester United game, though attendance was not announced.
And Manchester United's results _ a tie with Necaxa (1-1) and loss
against Vasco (3-1) _ brought some validity to the tournament.

PROGRESS IN CENTIMETERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first challenges globalization will impose on
Americans is conversion to _ or at least fluency in _ the metric
system.
</P>
<P>
   With the turn of the 2000 calendar, Britain became one of the
last countries to complete its official shift to metrics. This
sensible policy was mandated by the trade requirements of the
European Union. Small benefits may also be noted domestically if,
for instance, the evening pint is replaced by a liter. But one
retailer told Reuters that new legal sanctions are excessive: ``How
can someone who sells children sweets in a quarter-pound bag be
guilty of a criminal offense?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is now lumped with two other world powers _
Liberia and Burma _ as holdouts from the metric world.
</P>
<P>
   It is not for lack of trying. John Quincy Adams first
recommended the system in 1826, and it was actually adopted by
Congress as the official national measure in 1893. More than a
century later, this is still a fiction in much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it seemed to matter little. Trips by the mile, using
gasoline by the gallon, to buy meat by the pound made perfect
sense. We were used to it. It was part of our culture, and change
would be irksome. There's no denying that something is lost in the
phrase ``A miss is as good as a kilometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet we have taken some steps successfully, such as packaging
many soft drinks, wine, and liquor _ but not beer. The failure to
convert more speedily has a price, demonstrated most dramatically
last September by the loss of the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter
because someone forgot to convert to metrics.
</P>
<P>
   Only a zealot would demand a disruptive instant conversion, but
slippage is discouraging, as when Congress rescinded a requirement
that road signs include distances in kilometers. Much of the world
is learning English, a rich language that is the practical tongue
of globalization. We in the United States would best stir ourselves
to learn globalization's proper measure.

WHO IS TO BLAME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Let's get the Harvard Pilgrim receivership in perspective.
Granted that this is a time of tumultuous change in health care.
Still, is there anything in the annals of business more
untrustworthy than an insurance company that goes broke? Not broke
exactly, but requiring government protection from its creditors?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not _ especially when it is one of the oldest and most
respected health plans in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Pilgrim receivership is a good deal bigger story
than was the insolvency of the Bank of New England 10 years ago. As
The Boston Globe's Mitchell Zuckoff demonstrated in a story Sunday,
the trail of missteps at the health plan goes back a long way.
</P>
<P>
   More people are at risk of being harmed _ patients and their
doctors in the first instance _ than by the bank failure. An
outright collapse of the health maintenance organization would be
much more injurious to the region's health than the banking debacle
was.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? Goodness knows there is plenty of guilt to to go
around. The BNE disaster began when egomaniacal chief executive
Walter Connolly breezed into town via bank merger from Hartford and
went on a lending binge designed to surpass the Bank Of Boston. The
Harvard Pilgrim story isn't quite as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, give a free pass to the putative watchdogs _ the
corporate purchasers, the regulators, the newspapers. The numbers
they were getting were deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Pilgrim insiders _ the accountants, the lawyers, the
consultants, the physicians council, the board of directors _
deserve more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Amiable Alan R. Morse, the former banker who served most of the
'90s as chairman of the board has a lot of explaining to do. So
does former Big Eight accountant Alan Greenberg, who ran Pilgrim
Health Care for 10 years and took over as chief executive of
Harvard Pilgrim in October 1996 to watch the health plan slide
downhill. And then there was Mone Anathan III, the able Filene's
executive who quit running the compensation committee for divinity
school.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one man who deserves more blame than any other,
it is Manuel Ferris, the hotel executive who ran the plan from 1991
until 1996 while living in Tucson, Ariz., for much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' connection with Boston stemmed from his years in the
hotel industry, first as a manager in Sheraton Corp.'s North
American division, then as a senior executive in the Howard Johnson
chain. In 1985, at the age of 52, he took early retirement when
HoJo's lodging division was acquired, and for the next six years
remained on the beach, traveling and teaching and serving as a
director of what was then the Harvard Community Health Plan Board.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1991, a rebellious group of physicians upset at having
their compensation tied to their patient load ran off chief
executive Thomas Pyle, a veteran businessman who had guided much of
the plan's growth. Ferris stepped in to serve as acting chief while
HCHP conducted a nationwide search for a successor. Six months
later they settled on Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris made a show of visiting each of the HMO's offices to
placate the angry doctors, who mainly wanted to be left alone. He
declined to move to Boston; he made his decisions mainly by
consensus. In 1993, he took time out to stage and star in a one-man
Tennessee Williams play at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he presided over a merger with Pilgrim Health Care that
more or less doubled the membership of ther new plan to one million
members, making it the biggest health plan in New England. The
business logic of the merger was widely praised.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferris did little to consolidate the accounting and medical
record systems of the two plans. In a town where Fidelity
Investments and State Street Bank created back office operations
that were among the sharpest in the nation, Harvard Pilgrim's
bookkeeping languished.
</P>
<P>
   And in early 1996, citing ``personal reasons,'' Ferris retired
for a second time, at the age of 63. ``He helped heal some very
deep wounds,'' wrote board co-chairmen Alan Morse and Gil Shapiro
in a memo at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds are deeper than ever now. I tried to phone Ferris in
Tucson Monday. ``At the customer's request, that number is
nonpublished'' said the recording. Too bad. It would be good to
hear what he had to say.

ALMOST AS COOL AS RICKY MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We cannot praise Alan Greenspan enough. The accolades poured
forth again last week after President Clinton reappointed the
chairman of the Federal Reserve to another four-year term. On the
following days, the Fed chief was described variously as a
magician, a king, a saint, a god, and the reigning Hiram, Ohio,
spelling bee champion.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that Greenspan's accomplishments lift him above
the average mortal. He is credited with rescuing the global economy
from a series of potentially disastrous meltdowns, sustaining the
longest economic expansion in U.S. history, propelling the greatest
bull market ever seen and, where NASA has failed miserably, he has
been able to tune into the frequency of the lost Mars probe on his
dental bridgework.
</P>
<P>
   But we only know what we see of this exceptional man. He has the
grave presence of the central banker. He speaks in sober language
of fund rates and basis points. He favors staid suits, tasseled
loafers, humdrum eyeglasses and, at bedtime, is partial to
irrationally exuberant pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Alan Greenspan, really?
</P>
<P>
   We've rummaged around in his closet, rifled through his
briefcase, inspected his trash, and verified that he is, in fact,
Walter Matthau.Our research has uncovered many fascinating nuggets
of previously unknown biographical information, including a
detailed account of his days in the Symbionese Liberation Army
fighting for floating exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Early in life, Alan set his heart on a career as a central
banker. When he was as young as 8, he took a personal interest in
our nation's long-term economic growth. Deaf to his mother's
protests, little Alan would lock himself gloomily in his bedroom
whenever the benchmark 30-year bond moved above 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother reminded the boy that inflation was well under
control and that the gross domestic product was still expanding at
the same rate as the universe, Alan would reluctantly agree to go
outside like other children and sit under an old oak and calculate
the square root of the corn puffs in the Kix box.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenspan name has a curious history. Like many immigrants,
Alan Greenspan's ancestors washed onto New York's shores from a
distant land, bearing a name that was unpronounceable by the
American tongue. The officer on duty, who happened to have lunched
on canned meat that day and as a result had a terrible stomach
ache, gave the huddled family a name of his own making: Greenspam.
Needless to say, the Greenspan name might never have become
synonymous with brilliance had Alan's parents not legally changed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Those early days are indeed a distant memory for the
distinguished Fed chief. Greenspan takes special pride in knowing
that his contributions are recognized. Most gratifying, he
believes, is his ranking on People magazine's list of the
millennium's Most Intriguing People, just behind Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton noted last week that the Fed chairman had
guided the world to prosperity through his own ``sophisticated
analysis'' of economic trends.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is indeed a serious student of economics. Whenever
confronted with a particularly knotty question, he uses a technique
he developed over many years, first during his days at Columbia
University and later at the Kentucky Horseshoeing School. This
involves seating himself in a comfortable armchair, tilting his
head back, closing his eyes, and placing a nickel on each eyelid.
In this state, he ponders monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, he moves into the conclusive phase of his
deliberation, that is, he flips one of the nickels. The right
answer _ Raise rates? Lower rates? _ rests on the luck of the toss.
It hasn't failed him yet.

MARRYING OLD, NEW FIRMS LOGICAL, BUT PROBLEMS ABOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo and Disney? Viacom and Lycos? News Corp. and who knows
who?
</P>
<P>
   This is the tone of conversation about media companies for the
moment, the talk of matching the old with the new in a flurry of
mergers sparked by Monday's agreement for America Online Inc. to
purchase Time Warner Inc. for $178 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deal talk propelled the stocks of practically every company that
might be buyer or prey. Shares of Walt Disney Co., Viacom Inc.,
News Corp. Ltd., and Lycos Inc. all soared by 10 percent to 20
percent during the day. Yahoo stock advanced about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The logic seems simple. The old media companies need access to
the distribution system of the future, which is clearly the
Internet. Leading Internet companies that have amassed millions of
customers need to pump more content through their Web portals to
continue building revenues. Their mergers would be a marriage of
convenience, if not downright necessity.
</P>
<P>
   And it could all happen while the 800-pound gorilla, Microsoft
Corp. and its MSN Internet ventures, remain tied up in political
knots. After its grueling antitrust trial, could you imagine
Microsoft announcing plans to buy Disney or another leading media
company?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to decide what's going to cause you to move, this
type of transaction has historically been a big catalyst,'' said
Keith Benjamin, a longtime Internet analyst and general partner of
Highland Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are coming together here that are going to
lend themsleves to more mergers,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are serious problems involved in getting any media
mergers between new and old off the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner was the best imaginable deal of the group,
for several reasons. Unlike other traditional media companies, Time
Warner offers America Online the high-speed broadband access it
dearly wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, America Online has the most manageable
chasm to leap when it comes to the disparate stock market
valuations of new and old media companies. Some investors believe
that wide gap will make deals impossible for most other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical that you're going to see a firestorm of mergers
and acquisitions,'' said Brian Stack, a mutual fund manager at MFS
Investment Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, with billions in revenues and substantial
profits, is a widely acceptable investment for mutual fund managers
and other institutions, which own hundreds of millions of shares.
In the go-go world of Internet stock investing, America Online and
its stock, trading at 200 times earnings, is considered a slow-lane
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Yahoo and many other leading Internet companies are
much more expensive, trading at over 600 times earnings if there
are any profits at all in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Disney shareholders don't want their investment converted into
such a volatile currency. Yahoo's stock would probably plunge if it
was used to buy a relatively slow-growth business.
</P>
<P>
   Now turn the proposition on its head and imagine Viacom or some
other traditional media business buying an Internet company. The
old-liners would gasp at the price they would have to shell out to
buy an Internet leader. ``It would be wildly dilutive,'' said
Stack.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: The proposed purchase of Lycos Inc., of Waltham, by
Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., which died last year before it
could get to a shareholder vote. Unhappy Lycos investors revolted
because they couldn't stomach the price a non-Internet media
company would pay for their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Diller and Lycos were just ahead of their time. But the
episode is clear evidence of the high expectations Internet
investors project onto their favorite stocks and what can happen
when they are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many big Internet companies in a box. Their high
stock prices remain dependent, for now, on rapidly increasing
revenues. But video content, the kind that old-media companies pump
out endlessly, will clearly be the source of Internet traffic
growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those wild stock prices will fall down if revenues don't stay on
a high-growth track. But the same high prices might tumble with the
purchase of a big traditional media company that could provide the
content.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative: Find partners. Yahoo has grown its business
dramatically through partnerships and alliances with many different
companies, notes Charles Lax of Softbank Technology Ventures, whose
parent firm owns 23 percent of Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo has done tremendously well without having to tie itself
up with a media partner,'' Lax said.
</P>
<P>
   His take: If an Internet site has enough traffic, content will
find its way there.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office shows movies from all film studios. Blockbuster
rents videos from every producer. Why can't an Internet site remain
independent and rely on relationships with all media companies to
pump out content?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, others say, is that the young Internet industry now
stands at a critical point in time and can't afford to rely on the
staying power of a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of these deals is that you need to leap into the
unknown,'' said Josh Bernoff, a principle analyst at Forrester
Research Inc. ``It's very hard to join hands with a partner and
have confidence that it's going to be a long-term relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as simple as getting from here to there. But don't
count on a smooth ride.

THOSE WILD LAS VEGAS WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Las Vegas itself, weddings in the City of Glitter get more
and more spectacular. Here are three examples:
</P>
<P>
   _At the Las Vegas Hilton, bride and groom can dress in their
intergalactic best and plight their troth aboard the USS
Enterprise, while Star Trek characters look on. The setting is the
hotel's multimillion-dollar attraction, ``Star Trek: The
Experience,'' and wedding packages start at $2,000. For more
information, call 800-732-7117.
</P>
<P>
   _At the MGM Grand, Merlin is the master of ceremonies, woodland
spirits escort the wedding party, and a fire-breathing dragon
attempts to interfere with the vows. All this takes place on the
stage of the multimillion-dollar (everything in Vegas is
multimillion) production show ``EFX.'' Packages cost $4,995. For
more information, call 800-646-5530.
</P>
<P>
   _At the Treasure Island resort, the Britannia _ a replica of an
18th-century British warship that does daily battle with a pirate
ship _ can be the setting for nautical nuptials. Someone dressed in
the garb of a British sea captain will conduct the ceremonies.
Packages start at $2,995. For more information, call 800-866-4748.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more examples, ranging from a wedding atop the
``Eiffel Tower'' at the Paris casino to nuptials aboard a hot-air
balloon. There are also little chapels, some of which will perform
the ceremony as you drive through, and wedding hosts ranging from
Elvis to the Grim Reaper. But wherever and however you marry, may
you be each other's best friend for life.

   Winter _ there are lots of ways to enjoy it without putting on
skis.
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick offers a great White Gold Rush catalog describing
not only skiing but also dog-sledding, snowmobile trails, romantic
getaways, and Fredericton's Winterfest 2000, Feb. 4-11, which
features igloo building, ice slides, and fireworks. Meanwhile,
Miramichi City's White Gold Festival, Feb. 11-13, features polar
bear golf and ice fishing.
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick boasts 563 miles of groomed snowmobile trails,
including a new trail link with better access between Fredericton
and Moncton. With up to 157 1/2 inches of snowfall yearly, New
Brunswick has the largest snowfall and one of the longest seasons
south of the Arctic. For a copy of the catalog and other winter
attractions in New Brunswick, call 800-561-0123.

   Boston is known as the walking city, because it is easy to get
around on foot. One can follow the Freedom Trail and wander through
300-plus years of history in three miles or less, and without
strain. Now there's a new way to discover old Boston, the Shawmut
Peninsula Walk, which traces Boston's original shoreline. The walk
captures a time when the fledgling city was just a rough Colonial
settlement on a hilly promontory in Boston Harbor. The Shawmut
Peninsula Walk opens a new window onto Boston's Colonial and
genealogical past, said Ann Hershfang, president of WalkBoston, the
pedestrian advocacy organization, which produced the map. Using the
self-guided map, walkers can trace the original shoreline along
present-day streets. The map also contains lively historical notes,
neighborhood information, and transit stops. The map is $3.95 and
can be found in bookstores or from Bryant Altman Map and Book
Distributors, Endicott Street, Building 26, Norwood, MA 02062;

   In 1841, the rescue of a boy shipwrecked off the coast of Japan
would change the course of Japanese-American relations and world
history. ``Drifting: Nakahama Manjiro's Tale of Discovery,'' at the
Rosenbach Museum &AMP; Library in Philadelphia through Jan. 30,
introduces the original manuscript chronicling the rescue of
14-year-old Manjiro by an American whaling schooner captain. Upon
his return to Japan in 1851, government officials suspected Manjiro
of bringing dangerous foreign ideas into the country. One official,
however, recognized the value of Manjiro's experiences and had him
describe his tales of American whaling techniques and Western
technologies. Manjiro's original manuscript, along with paintings,
maps, and other items, is in the exhibit. The Rosenbach is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The library also contains
rare books, manuscripts, and art. For information, call

Whale watching
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, whale watching is one of San Diego's top
activities. From mid-December to mid-March, more than 15,000 whales
migrate from the chilly Alaskan seas to the warm-water breeding
lagoons of Baja California. The whales' 5,000-mile journey is one
of the longest known distance any mammal migrates annually.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, as many as 200 whales a day have been counted
off San Diego's coast. For visitors there are many whale-watching
services, from seaside watching stations to cruises and aerial
tours.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cabrillo National Monument, on panoramic Point Loma
peninsula, visitors have a glassed-in observatory from which to
spot the whales, examine exhibits, and listen to narrations on the
whales. A Whale Watch Weekend is planned Jan. 22-23 with
presentations by specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to catch the whales is by taking a Biplane, Air
Combat &AMP; Warbird Adventures flight, some 1,000 feet above the
whales. Prices range from $98 for two on an open-cockpit biplane to
$200 a person on a World War II Warbird (call 800-SKY-LOOP).
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the whales or whale cruises, call the
San Diego Visitors Bureau at 619-236-1212 or visit
www.sandiego.org.
</P>
<P>
   Once the whaling capital of the world, Lahaina, Maui, has become
the whale- watching capital. From December to April, whales live in
Maui's waters. Special events are planned for the period, including
Whale Week on Maui, Feb. 19-26, and WhaleFest, March 18-26. Both
events include whale watching, sailing, and dive excursions as well
as seminars and lectures. For information, call the Maui Visitors
Bureau at 800-525-MAUI or, on the Web, check out www.visitmaui.com.

FRENCH FARMHOUSE AN ECONOMIC AND DELIGHTFUL RENTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ELIPH, France _ An explosion of tunder so loud it seemed to
go off three inches behind my left ear jerked me awake in the
middle of a previously quiet and sultry August night.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, trying to turn on the stove for our morning
coffee, we discovered that the storm had cost us more than a little
sleep. The power was out, and we began to anticipate a huge hassle
trying to pierce the electrical power bureaucracy with our limited
French to arrange for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The cottage we had rented in this tiny village west of Chartres
is known as La Vielle Grange, or the Old Farm. Was it about to turn
into the Big Headache?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as happened more than once during our two-week stay,
what at first appeared a daunting task turned serendipitously into
a bonus. A visit to our French neighbors in search of the electric
company's phone number immediately resulted in three volunteers _
one an electrician _ bounding over to our house for a look.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in their overflowing house, the three were tradesmen
from Paris who had been building their communal country home for a
decade during the only free time they had _ their August vacation.
Their skills proved more than adequate to the task at hand. After
locating the fuse box in the laundry room, a flip of the circuit
breaker was all that was needed to bring the lights back on.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving rise to a few grins at the cluelessness of the
American visitors, the incident broke the ice for a little
crosscultural socializing. That evening the four members of our
group spent an hour over drinks with our neighbors, mangling the
French language and having a friendly exchange with their household
of 20, which ranged from 2-year-old Doreen to the gap-toothed Mama,
whom I judged to be in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago a British ad man wrote ``A Year in Provence,'' an
affectionate account of his and his wife's experience living among
the locals in the south of France. The two weeks we stayed at La
Vielle Grange were our scaled-down version. Call it ``A Fortnight
on the Edge of Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   We came away persuaded that renting a well-located house or
apartment does indeed offer certain advantages over staying in
hotels. Price can be one. Our converted farmhouse cost $1,140 for
two weeks, including the rental of two bicycles. It would have been
tough to match that staying in hotels, given that my wife and I had
one of our children with us for the entire time and another for
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Our location, on the eastern edge of Normandy, put us within
range of Paris. We caught the train in La Loupe, 3 1/2 miles from
our cottage, for the 1 1/2-hour ride to Paris's Gare Montparnasse.
Chartres was a half-hour away by train or car.
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy coast requires a car and is more of a stretch for a
day's visit. We reached the spectacular Mont-Saint-Michel, the
fortified town with a church on top that rises off the tidal flats
on the edge of Brittany, in three hours. With a huge glut of fellow
tourists making the town's narrow streets all but impassable at
midday, we splurged on a hotel so we could linger into the evening
and also enjoy the misty morning views.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we drove north to Bayeux to see its 225-foot
tapestry whose embroidered scenes narrate William of Normandy's
conquest of Britain in 1066. That afternoon we visited the Omaha
Beach D-Day landing site as well as the American cemetery, with the
graves of 9,385 war dead, behind it. We also visited the nearby
German cemetery, with its 21,500 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Between the tapestry and the war sites, we barely had time to
look skyward shortly after noon to witness the last full solar
eclipse (95 percent) in that area until 2081.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, our time in France was taken up with nosing
about small villages near St. Eliph or checking out reports of an
interesting church two or three towns away. Many days the highlight
was a leisurely lunch at one of the ubiquitous little family
restaurants with unpretentious but delicious food.
</P>
<P>
   Our cottage was in a region known as Le Perche, farming country
that produces wheat and cattle. It is known for its Percheron draft
horses, powerful animals bred to pull carriages and farm equipment.
While much of the area is made up of flat fields punctuated by the
occasional concrete water tower, there are also numerous villages,
dark and dense forests, and picturesque hills and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   If half the fun is discovering the unexpected in the sleepy
countryside, we also had the experience of others to point out some
attractions. Previous guests at La Vielle Grange had noted things
they had found interesting in the guest book supplied by our
landlords, Gordon and Helen Dowsett of Providence. More
importantly, the Dowsetts' property manager, a knowledgeable La
Loupe resident named Yves Pelatan, shared his local lore over
croissants and cafe au lait provided by his wife, Ghislaine.
</P>
<P>
   In Montier au Perche, we edged up a steep hill to reach a
still-active, 900-year-old church with a Romanesque arch and four
gargoyles. As instructed, we sought out an elderly couple next door
for the heavy, decorated iron key, as long as your hand, that would
let us into the church for a self-guided tour.
</P>
<P>
   Across a stone wall from the graveyard, tan-colored cows chewed
grass and switched their tails desultorily at the flies. We gazed
at the church's memorial to the town's 20th-century war dead. Some
60 names were listed as killed in the World War I vs. only three in
World War II, when France fell quickly and spent most of the war
years under the German occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Another day we drove an hour south to Chateaudun, whose handsome
castle held a commanding position just off the town square. Below
the castle we visited Chateaudun's extensive caves, where an
animated guide talked us through 65 million years of geologic
history as we shivered in blankets in the subterranean chill. The
tour was capped by an underground sound- and-light show, my first
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Perche region's museum in Saint-Cyr-la-Rosiere has an
exhibit of old-fashioned farm implements used in growing and
harvesting wheat and making apple brandy. A bigger hit with our
group was that Sunday's hands-on activity for kids _ kneading sweet
dough into little animals or other shapes before it was baked in
the farmhouse's old wood-fired oven.
</P>
<P>
   Back at La Vielle Grange, we would sit on our stone patio
sipping red wine as the sun slipped in the sky. An occasional
apple, plump if not yet ripe, would drop from the tree before us
with a thud. Horses could be seen through the trees in the field
out back. Occasionally the bucolic peace would be interrupted by
the mournful wailing of a child or by one of our next-door
neighbors screeching around the corner on a motorbike whose
muffler, if it had one, did not seem to work too well.
</P>
<P>
   After our big midday meal, we would usually be content with a
picnic supper of bread, sausage, and two or three kinds of
delicious French cheese. Bedtime came early, with my wife and I
sleeping in the open loft over the kitchen while our daughters
shared a pullout sofa bed.
</P>
<P>
   The cottage was an empty shell when the Dowsetts undertook to
convert it nearly 10 years ago. As Yves Pelatan put it, it was ``an
old barn, four walls, half a roof, a dirt floor, nothing.'' It now
has an attractive and comfortable interior of stucco walls anchored
by heavy, exposed timbers that reach up to a slanted ceiling. There
is also a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Demand among Americans for European rentals has been coming on
strong in recent years, according to Carolyn Grote, who runs a
listing service for such properties from Berkeley, Calif. Her
company, Ville et Village, carries about 50 of its own listings in
Paris and the south of France and provides access to hundreds more
in France and Italy through her affliation with a British agency,
Grote said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the potential savings compared with a hotel,
Grote said many foreign travelers are deciding they don't want to
eat every meal in a restaurant. With a rented cottage or farmhouse,
they can shop at the local market (Tuesday mornings in the town
square in La Loupe) and try their hand at replicating the regional
cuisine they have enjoyed in local restaurants.
</P>

WWII MEMORIES OF FIERCE DUELS IN THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ In the heat of the day in Palm Springs,
you need to get out of the sun. There are lots of places to go, but
one that's a little off the beaten track is the Palm Springs Air
Museum. Housed in a couple of hangars at the back of the airport,
the museum is dedicated to preserving the planes that won World War
II. From trainers to bombers they are lovingly maintained in
flightworthy condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the real attraction at the museum is the docents. They are
all volunteers and many of them were pilots during the war.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Roy June. He and his wife, Laura, come down every
Sunday to volunteer; she in the gift ship and he as a docent. On a
recent Sunday afternoon he took a couple of visitors under his wing
_ literally _ and told the story of his war.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's still in pretty good shape for his age. His hair is thin
but its white thatch still covers his head. The iron-hard body he
had as a 21-year-old in World War II has softened. But behind the
thick bifocals his eyes are still clear blue, reflecting the color
of the Pacific where he fought and flew.
</P>
<P>
   He still flies, too. Less often now, in small Pipers and
Cessnas, and always with a copilot. But in the war he flew alone.
He flew P51s. The hottest plane of the war. It could do 450 miles
an hour behind its huge fourbladed prop and its Pratt and Whitney
engine. He was in the 15th Fighter Group. Eight hours from Iwo Jima
to the home islands shepherding B29s. Twenty minutes over the
target and then eight hours back. No land in between, just endless
blue. They were the longest over-water missions of the war.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and said that he saw enough ocean that when his war
was over and he got back to the States he put two oars on his
shoulder and walked inland until he met people who didn't know what
they were. There he settled, Odysseus home from Troy at last.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the exploits of a young airman dueling with Japanese
Zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't turn on them _ they were too maneuverable _ but
if you dove straight at the ground they couldn't keep up with you.
. . . I'd see their tracers fall off as they fell behind.'' Tracers
that were straining to knock him out of the sky. Later the
Americans formed aerial teams. When the Zeroes got the drop on one
of the pair, the two Mustangs would take off in different
directions; whichever one the Zero followed the other member of the
team would ``scissor'' back and attack him broadside. Soon the
Zeroes stopped hunting them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one mission, he lost his electrical system. His orders were
clear; he was to return to a rendezvous point and wait for the rest
of the squadron. He had no radio, but his partner signaled him to
return to the rendezvous point. Just then, he said, things heated
up. He stayed as the Japanese fighters swooped in. ``I had just
enough electricity left to work the machine guns. The two pilots
shared a shoot-down. The Japanese disengaged. They headed back to
Iwo Jima. All the way back, I thought I was going to get into
trouble for disobeying orders.'' He got the Distinguished Flying
Cross instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once, he ran smack into a typhoon. ``I tried to climb out of it,
but couldn't. They said the cloud tops were at 20,000 feet. I got
up to 40,000 and never found them.'' Blind, buffeted he struggled
back. He made it. Twenty-four others did not.

   Sixteen hours in a canvas seat. You sweated so much that when
you came back your boots were soaked through. Good, sturdy,
top-grain leather flight boots only lasted a couple of months in
the Pacific before the moisture ruined them. When you got back, the

   He takes a visitor over to see a P47. The P47 was heavier and
slower, but more powerful than the P51. It could get in so steep a
dive that air built up in front of the wings and robbed them of
their lift. The only solution was to pull back on the stick and
level off, but the crushing G forces invariably caused the pilot to
black out as the blood rushed from his head. For 30 seconds or a
minute the pilot wouldn't be able to see. All he could do was
listen to the sound of the engine, alone in the sky, blind. If the
engine revved up, it meant the ship was diving again. Back stick,
keep it level until you could see again. No big deal, it's just the
way it was.

   Ruth opened an access panel on the P47. He showed the
supercharger buried in the tail. Somebody had the idea of taking
the exhaust from the engine and, instead of blowing it out into the
sky, piping it back to drive an impeller that sucked air in from
the outside and compressed it and fed it back to the engine so that
it could run with more power as the air thinned out at altitude.
Everybody was working to win the war _ the men and women back on
the factory floor, trying in any way they could to make the best
planes in the world to beat the enemy.

in 36 months. One battle plane an hour at Grumman on Long Island.

   After he was trained he went to Blacksburg, Va., to join his
first squadron. He had never been in a P47 before. The CO told him
to sit in one for an hour and a half to become familiar with the
controls. When he was done an old sergeant quizzed him on where the
throttles and gauges were and where the stick was. He passed. He
went back to the CO and asked to see a flight manual on the new
ship. ``Oh there's one around here somewhere, I suppose,'' the
colonel said, ``but I don't know where. Look, you're a pilot. Just
go take it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did. Fresh out of training with brand new wings on his
flight suit and a brand new plane around him, he bounced it down
the runway, pulled back on the stick, and leapt into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   He was 21 years old and he was master of the air.

CARREY CHANNELS KAUFMAN, BUT NO ONE CARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hollywood, there is no sound more unsettling, more unholy,
than the resounding thud of a film bombing at the box office. It's
especially unnerving when it arrives on a tsunami of hype and
expectation, is helmed by a two-time Oscar-winning director, is
called the best film of the year by Entertainment Weekly, and stars
one of the Hollywood's highest-paid and most successful actors of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But such has been the fate of ``Man on the Moon,'' the film
biography of the late controversial performer Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening Dec. 22, the film, which stars Jim Carrey as
Kaufman and was directed by Milos Forman, has pulled in a measly
$30 million at the box office _ barely enough to cover Carrey's big
fat paycheck. Compare that to ``Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo,'' which
has no real stars (I'm sorry, but Rob ``Making Copies'' Schneider
is not a star) and is as dumb as a box of rocks but has garnered
more than $60 million. And ``Deuce Bigelow'' is still in the top
10, while ``Man on the Moon,'' has dropped to 12th place in less
than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even two Golden Globe nominations _ for Carrey as best actor in
a musical or comedy, and for best picture, haven't helped. Perhaps
if Kaufman had appeared at the premiere _ some deluded fans still
believe he faked his death as the ultimate gag _ it might have
provided a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have thunk it? When the film, which takes its title from
the lovely R.E.M. tribute song to Kaufman, was proposed in 1998, an
A-list of actors, including Tom Hanks, Nicolas Cage, Edward Norton,
and John Cusack expressed interest, before the role went to Carrey.
Forman, who won Oscars for ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and
``Amadeus,'' and even made a crass pornographer seem cuddly in
``The People Vs. Larry Flynt,'' was on board to direct.
</P>
<P>
   With Carrey and Forman, the film had a pedigree to die for, but
Kaufman still seemed an odd choice for a film biogrpahy. More
performance artist than comedian, he was a brilliant, abrasive
talent who infuriated as often as he entertained. While revered by
fellow comics from Richard Belzer to Robin Williams, to the
moviegoing public Kaufman, who died of cancer in 1984, may be
little more than a mildly interesting footnote best remembered for
his role as sweet-natured mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC sitcom
``Taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Man on the Moon'' was touted as one of the most
eagerly-awaited films of the holiday season. But with its failure,
the question must be asked: eagerly-awaited by whom? Did Hollywood
overestimate the public's interest in the short, strange life and
career of a man who died 15 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a case of people making a movie about someone
they knew very, very well, and clearly had great affection for, but
is not really that well-known or remembered by the general
public,'' said Martin A. Grove, columnist for the Hollywood
Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who worked with Kaufman
on ``Taxi.'' DeVito, who befriended Kaufamn, also plays his
manager, George Shapiro, in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Danny about the movie, and he understandably was
just thrilled to be able to bring Andy's story to the screen,''
Grove said. ``But so many other people don't know who he was, or
only vaguely remember him, and not quite as the giant the
filmmakers remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even greater problem with this film biography was
just how little biography it offered, Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie doesn't give us great insights into why he was who
he was _ in other words, how he developed and what made him that
way,'' he said. ``Sometimes you can have a movie about someone you
don't know that well, but the movie can take you through a process
which is in itself entertaining and fulfilling. But here it
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Man on the Moon'' plays like a video of Kaufman's
greatest hits with loving re-creations of his routines _ See Andy
do the ``Mickey Mouse'' theme on ``Saturday Night Live!'' See Andy
take out his Carnegie Hall audience for milk and cookies! See Andy
play the uber-obnoxious lounge singer Tony Clifton! See Andy
wrestle women and destroy his career! But that's all
</P>
<P>
   To paraphase a hilarious bit Denis Leary once did about Oliver
Stone's windy opus, ``The Doors,'' you can sum up ``Man on the
Moon'' in three sentences: He's weird, he's nobody. He's weird,
he's famous. He's weird, he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's failure must be especially hard for Carrey, who
doesn't so much play Kaufman as channel him. It's an eerie, uncanny
performance, which is easily Carrey's best to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a knockout performance,'' Grove said. ``Jim Carrey proves
with this film what he set out on the path last year with `The
Truman Show.' He proved he was a capable actor, and this movie
proves that wasn't a one-time thing. Unfortunately, this material
just doesn't deliver enough to make it what an audience wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why for all its good intentions, ``Man on the Moon''
has found itself greeted with the one reaction Kaufman himself
rarely received: indifference.

THE `OTHER' PLAM SPRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL MCGEARY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ It's 6:15 a.m., but I'm still on Boston
time, so I've been up for a while. A half-hour earlier I walked
through the quiet lobby of my luxury hotel, turned left at the end
of the driveway, and walked to the main road. After another short
walk through a neighborhood of California-style houses with desert
landscaping and stucco walls, I began an ascent of the North Lykken
trail, a gradual dusty path cut into the side of the San Jacinto
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After walking about 10 minutes, I pause on a flat rock and look
east. It's September and the sun is just up. Below me a late player
or two stumbles out of the Indian casino. To the left, golfers are
already two or three holes into their morning round. But up on my
rock I am alone, save for the chuckwalla lizard that flits out
momentarily to get its bearings and then, continuing its early
morning foraging, just as quickly darts back to the safety of
another stone. Behind me the mountain rises to a ridge line and
beyond that to an 8,000-foot summit. Here, four or five hundred
feet above the valley floor, I am content to rest in the morning
stillness.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs is best known for two things: as the desert retreat
of cinematic (and more recently, political) glitterati and, of
course, golf. Bob Hope is perhaps its most enduring symbol.
Presiding over its desert landscape from his mountainside retreat,
Hope oversaw the merging of the spa and the great middle-class
game, lending his name to the world-class winter tournament spread
over three championship courses. Hope helped make the resort
synonymous with the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Palm Springs has another side, just down the street,
literally, from the manicured, landscaped, and gated faux adobe
communities, from the lush greens and fairways, within sight of
casinos, high-end shopping, and restaurants with rose-colored
tablecloths, is a wilderness experience very different from any in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in Palm Springs itself. A series of hiking trails have
been carved out of the mountains that back up right to the edge of
the city. Palm Springs lies in the Coachella Valley, bounded on one
side by the San Jacinto mountains dominated by 10,804-foot-high
Mount San Jacinto and on the other by the Santa Rosa range. Because
it is a desert environment, there are no trees to obscure your
view. Trails are not so well marked that you can't follow a wrong
one and have to retrace your steps, but because you always have a
clear line of sight, you can always get your bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Trails are of varying degrees of difficulty from easy lopes (the
kind I favored) to more arduous. You can walk as much or as little
as you want _ some are as short as three-quarters of a mile while
others are half-day or full-day hikes. Even short hikes can take
you to spectacular lookouts where you can oversee the whole valley,
the Santa Rosa mountains to the south, and north as far as the
Little San Bernardino range and Joshua Tree National Park 45 miles
away. One, the Araby trail, even takes you to a scenic overlook
above Hope's house so you can share his magnificent view.
</P>
<P>
   Some trails are amenable to horseback riding or off-road
vehicles. Some are best accessed by horse or RV as the trail heads
are well off the main roads.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware though that Palm Springs is in the desert. Never
undertake even a limited walk without plenty of water. It is
possible to stray down a dead end and have to retrace your steps.
It's best in summer to try to take your hike early in the morning.
Hiking boots are a good idea, but sturdy walking shoes are
sufficient for many trails. A guide to the 36 trails of the
Coachella Valley is available in local bookstores for $4.50. It's
good enough for casual hikes, but for more arduous or wilderness
experiences, US Geological Survey topographical maps are also
available. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mount San Jacinto &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who want the mountaintop experience without the hike,
Mount San Jacinto is an obvious answer. In the 1950s, the rugged,
10,800-foot mountain with its chimney canyons and nearly vertical
escarpments became accessible to the general public when a cable
car system was completed. Previously only serious hikers and mule
trains made the arduous ascent. For $17.65, you can get on a cable
car at the 2,000-foot level and take a 15-minute ride to a
restaurant, museum, and gift shop maintained by the state of
California at the 8,500-foot level. The ride up and down has
spectacular scenery _ mountain canyons and chimneys, flora changing
from low desert to pine forest on the way. That makes the
stomach-twisting dips worth the trip as the car passes each of five
towers and lowers itself down the swayback cable before resuming
its ascent. Once on the top, there are a number of walking trails.
And there are rides on mules with mule skinners as guides through
the mountaintop environment. Be aware that the air at the station
is much thinner (and cooler _ 30 to 40 degrees so) than at the
valley floor. Don't overtax yourself, but I found a
three-quarter-mile nature loop among the giant ponderosa pines _
some 6 feet or more in diameter _ to be quite manageable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Joshua Tree National Park &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a Tuesday, midmorning. I have left my rental car in a
pullout by the side of the blazing asphalt. From the road I walk
into a thin grove of towering cactus. They are far apart, each one
commanding the precious water for hundreds of square feet. They
cast little shade, but the grove has a cool feel, even in the
95-degree heat. I make my way to a rock outcrop at the end of the
glade. I sit down (after checking for rattlers) and enter into a
silent world. Here in this place of immense vistas, horizons 40
miles away, it is utterly quiet. The silence is welcoming,
enveloping there and not there, like the shade of the Joshua trees.
The buzzing of a fly sounds deafeningly loud. I hear the sound a
two-ounce lizard makes as it deftly darts across the rock below.
</P>
<P>
   Behind me stands a low mass, a hill forced up for the earth's
innards. It seems to teeter for all its massiveness, almost fragile
despite its massive, stony musculature.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Joshua Tree National Park. It's about 45 minutes
from downtown Palm Springs. Covering 794,000 acres and extending
from the high Mojave Desert of California to the Colorado Desert on
the Arizona border, the Joshua Tree is a place of stark beauty.
Named for the hardy cactus that dominates the high desert (the
Mormons who first settled the area thought it looked like Joshua
preaching to the Israelites with its upreaching arms and majestic
bearing, so the legend goes), the Joshua Tree is a place of
spectacular stillness and monumental beauty. Besides the groves of
Joshua Trees, the landscape in the high desert is dominated by
hills of monzonite, expressed basalt from the internal fires of the
earth, which thrust up, cooled and cracked, and then were exposed
by the erosion of softer stone around them. The monzonite hills
loom over the landscape in assemblies of great squarish boulders. A
road winds through the high desert from the town of Joshua Tree to
the Twenty-nine Palms. The park is meticulously maintained and
there are many pullouts without interpretive signs and scenic
overlooks, including an abandoned mine. A number of interpretive
walking trails are scattered throughout the park, ranging from a
few hundred yards to a mile or more long.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly liked Skull Rock trail, which has many trailside
exhibits on desert flora and fauna, including the Joshua Tree, the
yucca, the pinyon pine, and the creosote plant, all of which have
adapted to the harsh desert environment. Be on the lookout as well
for kangaroo rats, chuckwalla lizards, and other desert dwellers
that may dart across your path. The trail is an easy
three-quarter-mile walk with interpretive signs placed trailside.
</P>
<P>
   Another spectacular trail is one that winds through Hidden
Valley. This small canyon is all but invisible. Entrance is gained
by a small opening in a sheer rock face. Once through, however, you
see before you a small jewel of a secret world, rather like
something out of Tolkien's ``The Lord of the Rings.'' The canyon
was reputedly used as a staging area and holding pen for rustlers,
who, so the story goes, watched from hidden lookouts as posses
galloped by oblivious to the fact that their quarry was but a few
yards away. Before that it was used as a wintering place for the
local Indians, and many Indian trails still crisscross it. An easy
one-mile loop takes you along an interpretive trail through the
valley and back out the hidden entrance.

AOL'S CASE POISED TO PRESIDE OVER MEDIA GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America Online Inc. chief Steve Case succeeds in his bid to
buy Time Warner Inc., his strategy could be summed up by a headline
that once appeared in the acquiree's flagship publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``How AOL Lost the Battles But Won the War,'' Time magazine
wrote in 1997, adding that ``America Online Defied the Techies,
Catering to the Chattering Masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the headline appeasd more apt than ever. With the
announcement of its proposed $178 billion acquisition of Time
Warner, AOL is poised to become a dominant media company. It
arrived at the top of the media heap by taking big risks time and
again to build market share, only to emerge ever-stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AOL hopes the Time Warner deal will help it gain control of
high-speed data wires and editorial content ranging from movies to
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by regulators, the deal would mark a momentous
ascension for the 41-year-old Case and the Dulles, Va. company he
heads. Several years ago, AOL's heavy marketing expenses seemed to
make its very survival an open question as it mailed out truckloads
of software to broaden its user base.
</P>
<P>
   But, introducing deal in New York, Case sounded less like an
Internet technical guru than a evangelist for new-media content.
</P>
<P>
   ``At AOL we've worked hard to develop a medium as central to
people's lives as the development of television,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just come up with faster, more affordable ways to
deliver information,'' he said. ``We must enrich and expand that
information and make it more central and more valuable to people's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL still faces a host of rivals in its basic market for
Internet access, for which 20 million members now pay $22 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But over its nine-year history, it has buried many rivals by
offering a host of services like simple graphic commands. It also
provided consumers with easy access to the new terrain known as the
Internet and the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The large subscriber base it gained also did much to drive the
overall growth of the Internet. ``For most of America they were the
Internet,'' said Garry Betty, chief executive of Earthlink Network,
now the second-place service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, AOL also legitimized the notion that the potential
for profits to be earned in cyberspace _ even if years away _ still
justifies major investments.
</P>
<P>
   A key convert to this notion is Gerald Levin, chief executive of
Time Warner, who said the soaring market capitalizations of
companies such as AOL were justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market caps in the Internet space, I accept, because I
think something profound is taking place,'' Levin said. ``To me
it's quite simple, a belief that the present value of the future
cash flow is so significant, that's how you justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is much the creation of Case, who emphasizes his company's
youthful following with a casual wardrobe of his own. The image
belies his wealth, however. The stock and options in AOL Case held
as of July 31 were worth $1.4 billion, based on the company's
closing price Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Case grew up in Honolulu and in 1980 graduated from Williams
College with a political science degree.
</P>
<P>
   Next he did stints as a manager at Procter &AMP; Gamble, where he
worked on products like a hair-conditioning towellette, and
PepsiCo., where he worked on new pizza toppings, according to
Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought in by his older brother, Dan, to help run what
was known as Quantum Computer Services.
</P>
<P>
   The company introduced what it called the America Online service
for users of Apple computers in 1989, and two years later offered
the service to PC users and changed its name to America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Case became the company's chief executive in 1993 and quickly
began practicing what would become AOL's fundamental strategy of
expanding market share.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy drew subscribers at a furious pace and catapulted
AOL past competitors like Prodigy and CompuServe. In 1994, AOL had
one million subscribers. By February 1996, it boasted five million.
</P>
<P>
   Networks begun by other potential rivals like Microsoft Corp.
never achieved AOL's critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's revenue also grew from $19.5 million in 1991 to $115
million in 1994 to $3 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company's trajectory by now has made it a role model for
other Internet companies, from retailer Amazon.com to search engine
services like AltaVista, who often cite AOL's success to justify
their own massive marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy was also expensive for AOL, leading to losses
that peaked at $499 million in 1997. It is now one of the most
profitable Internet companies, earning $762 million in its fiscal
year ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, AOL also had trouble maintaining an
infrastructure of server computers, hubs and routers that was able
to keep up with the traffic. By 1996 the company was known as
``America On Hold'' in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also faced shareholder complaints it minimized the financial
impact of its spending, and changed its accounting practices after
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   To continue its expansion, AOL purchased CompuServe, its onetime
archrival in 1997; AOL purchased Netscape Communications in 1999,
giving it control of one of the Web's most influential search
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he initiated the talks with Time Warner last October.
Under the terms of the agreement, he will become chairman of the
combined company, which he said would include responsibilities for
technology, investments and philanthropy, while leaving Levin as
chief executive overseeing most day-to-day responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Betty, of Earthlink, said one challenge for the merged company
will be to avoid alienating users with too much advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Case must also show AOL can function as steward of Time Warner's
longstanding editorial traditions. Time magazine, for instance, was
founded by by Henry Luce in 1923. Other properties include the
Warner Bros. movie and television assets, and magazines including
Fortune, People and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he is looking forward to being responsible for content
as well as services. ``It's not just about making money, it's about
serving the public interest,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Key backing came from Ted Turner, the creator of the Cable News
Network and now a major Time Warner shareholder, who said he will
support the agreement with Case's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so easy to go out and create an AOL,'' Turner said.
``No one else has been able to do it.''

 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pioneering mountain climber, accomplished nature
photographer, founder of The Museum of Science, Bradford Washburn
nonetheless would rather talk about his icily etched photo hanging
in the cardiac care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It's there to remind recovering patients of his triple-bypass in
the same room, and how he came back ``stronger than ever.' And, by
implication, how they can too.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 89, Washburn likes to focus on stamina and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the photograph doesn't come up immediately during a
meeting with Washburn, but the handshake does. It's strong, firm,
and held longer than expected, as if to convince his visitor, and
himself, that he could still realize his dream of climbing Mount
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   For a glimpse of the man, even in the winter of his life, here's
how the photo got tacked on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lion Head, in the New Hampshire White Mountains overlooking
Tuckerman Ravine, is a favorite destination for Washburn and his
wife Barbara, five years his junior. They have often hiked up it
just to have lunch, though it is not an easy climb.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking there in the fall of 1991, Washburn noticed that, for the
first time, he had to stop a couple of times and catch his breath.
His doctor told him he was in good shape for a man his age, but
Washburn, the perfectionist, insisted on a stress test.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through, he recalls, ``They pulled me out and hauled me
over to Mass. General'' for a balloon catheterization of his
arteries. ``I told them I wanted to see the procedure,'' Washburn
said, ``so they turned the television monitor around. . . . I could
see places where the arteries were almost blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   But catheterization often needs to be repeated. So Washburn
immediately had grander plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I told them,'' Washburn recalls, ``I'm completely
prepped for a bypass operation, let's go for it. They said I'd have
to be scheduled, but I didn't want to come back. So they found
there was an opening . . . and I had a triple-bypass the next
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   As thanks for making his 10-day stay ``a breeze,'' Washburn
donated to the cardiac surgery step-down care unit a copy of his
photo of climbers on the Alps' Doldenhorn Ridge. Now, he says, ``My
great joy is to go back to my room there every few months. There's
always some guy in it who's just come out of intensive care, and I
tell him that I thought you'd enjoy meeting me, because I occupied
this room eight or nine years ago, and I've never felt better in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, his wife says simply, is ``the kind of guy who, when
he makes up his mind about something, you don't have time to take a
deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His resume would say that Bradford Washburn is a cartographer,
mountaineer, photographer, and museum director. Born in 1910, he
graduated from Harvard College in 1933 and married Barbara Polk in
1940. He is the father of three and grandfather to seven. Director
of the Museum of Science from 1939 to 1980, he has received
numerous awards and honors.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the exhibits. The Museum of Fine Arts is
diplaying a collection of Washburn's photographs through the end of
April. And Boston University has mounted a show from his personal
and professional papers that will run at Grabonsky-Rosenfeld Hall
through November.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tales. Washburn is a storyteller
extraordinaire, though Barbara often has a warmer, more personal
version of his yarns.
</P>
<P>
   Take the story about a classic Washburn photograph. He didn't
take it himself _ it was shot by former Boston Globe editor Thomas
Winship _ but it is the one that Washburn sends out when asked for
a photo of himself. It was taken atop 10,185-foot Mount Bertha
(which Washburn describes as ``tiny but difficult'') near Glacier
Bay, Alaska, in 1940, and it shows Washburn and his bride of two
months, he with a cocky grin, she with a look that seems to mix
surprise and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people don't know,'' says Washburn mischievously,
``is that five minutes after that photo was taken, both Tom and
Barbara got hit with diarrhea. We didn't have much room up there,
and it was a straight drop down one side, so first I lowered
Barbara over one side and then Tom over the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara's version omits that aside, but it was her first major
climb. ``We had to cross a glacier, and it was a long way to go to
establish a base camp,'' she recalls. When they finally started the
climb, ``I got through the first day and thought it was a lot of
fun, but it got harder, and Brad admitted that he didn't know it
was going to be that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara was in the first group of five to make the final ascent.
``We got up to 8,000 feet, and then a blizzard hit, and we had to
stay there about a week, all five of us in one tent,'' she recalls.
``I knew it was a sissy thing, but every morning I'd pray that the
weather wouldn't clear. But one morning it did and Brad said we
were going up. I stuffed five Pilot crackers in my pocket and that
saved me because we were out for 19 hours before we got back to
base camp, and I didn't realize that I was pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time he led his team up Mount Bertha, Washburn had
climbed Mount Washington several times (the first time at age 11),
the Matterhorn and other Alpine peaks (at 16), and several
previously unclimbed mountains in the Alaskan Coast Range. But not
then, and not ever, Everest.
</P>
<P>
   On his desk in the office he maintains at the science museum _ a
room cluttered with maps and photographs and memorabilia _ is a
small plastic cube with a tiny chunk of rock from top of Everest.
But no, he said, ``I've never been on the ground closer than 15
miles. I was interested in climbing it, but that was before it was
climbed, before the war, and I couldn't do it then because Nepal
wouldn't let you in. And . . . after the war I was just too damned
busy getting this museum going.''
</P>
<P>
   When Washburn retired from the museum in 1980, at age 70, he
realized he was still interested in Everest _ but as a cartographer
rather than as a climber.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when Harvard had an Institute for Geographical
Exploration, Washburn took several courses on mapmaking, and later
was its assistant director. The institute pioneered the technique
of aerial mapping but was closed down after World War II. (Last
year, Washburn prevailed on Harvard President Neil Rudenstine to
place ``a lovely little plaque'' in the lobby of the institute's
old building on Divinity Avenue, now the Yenching Library, noting
that ``the roots of mapping the world by air were laid down
here.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd mapped Mount McKinley and Squam Lake (in New Hampshire)
and that was great fun,'' he said. ``So I thought, what would I
like to do if I was not 60 or 70 years old? Why, I'd like to map
Everest.'' It took four years to get permission, from both Nepal
and China. The project created topographical maps from a series of
photographs taken during a series of crisscrossing flights over the
peak in 1984 at 39,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Washburn was involved in the effort to calculate
Everest's height by laser _ the results of which indicated that it
is being pushed upward about an inch a year and gradually to the
northeast as the geological plate of India slides under that of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   But Washburn's living legacy, the brick-and-mortar one that he
shepherded for decades, is the Museum of Science, its spire
piercing the sky at the head of the Charles River, and an everyday
part of Boston fabric that last year attracted 1.8 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Washburn's climbs, his photography flights, his mapping
expeditions came while he was its fulltime director. In his early
years there, he moved it from its dusty quarters on Berkeley Street
(now the Louis store) and into its soaring new structure on vacant
landfill that he named ``Science Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn says he would be happy with his obituary if it were
just one sentence: ``He built the Museum of Science.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara, again, fills out his spare remark.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Smith College, she was working in
Harvard's biology department and heard of secretarial openings at
the museum, where Brad was the new director. But she knew the old
museum building on Berkeley Street _ and knew of Washburn _ ``and I
didn't want to go work in that stuffy old place with a crazy
mountain climber.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn learned of her and kept recruiting her. ``So one
night,'' she said, ``when I was going out on a date, I went in.
Brad told me to think about it and then he kept calling me every
night. I finally figured that if that guy was so aggressive, maybe
that place might be going somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When Washburn retired, Carlton Fuller, then honorary chairman of
the museum's board of directors, recalled that 40 years previously,
there was in effect ``no Museum of Science. What we had was the old
Museum of Natural History. . . . '' In the ensuing decades,
Washburn led fund-raising drives that brought in an average of over
$1 million a year and created programs and exhibits that increased
the number of visitors from 40,000 a year to well over a million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main concession that Bradford and Barbara Washburn have made
to advancing age is to sell the house they built on top of Belmont
Hill and move to Brookhaven, the retirement community in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, Barbara Washburn recalled. ``One day we
looked at each other and agreed the last thing we wanted was a
nurse coming in, and the trouble of going about getting one. So we
started looking at retirement communities, and liked what we saw
here.'' And what was characteristic about that decision is that it
was made on the eve of their heading off for Alaska. ``The morning
we were leaving,'' she said, ``we came out and signed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they slowed down any since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ, yes!'' says Washburn bluntly when asked if he still
drives _ the car being a red Nissan station wagon immediately
identified by a ``This Car Climbed Mt. Washington'' bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Washburn is still active, and encouraging older
people to do the same. In 1992, Grand Circle Travel, an adventure
travel company based in Boston, established a foundation to donate
a percentage of its profits to social-welfare projects in countries
where it sends its tour groups.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn and his wife are both directors of the foundation and,
according to Martha Prybylo, Grand Circle's vice president for
corporate philanthrophy, have been active in reviewing grant
applications.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, Prybylo said, he is a model for the
company's travelers, most of whom are over 50. She recalled a
recent company trip to Antarctica with the Washburns aboard _ and
Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Everest and a Washburn friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for our travelers to see his vibrancy,'' she said
of Washburn. ``He represents another time, a time when there still
were mountains to conquer. But the lessons he has for us are
enduring.''

MILLENNIUM MEMORIES: HOLD OR UNLOAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kristen Petersen's question: What on earth to do with two
tiaras, atop which ``2000'' appears in glittering rhinestones?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sohmers's answer: Put them in a closet until 2020, and then
take them out and sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen manages Crossing Main, a women's clothing boutique in
Marblehead, Mass. The tiaras are the last of several such $56
headpieces, the rest of which were sold before New Year's Eve.
``Maybe someone from the class of 2000 will want them,'' she muses
hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Sohmers owns Wex Rex Collectibles in Framingham, Mass. He
suggests that folks such as Petersen stash their tiaras _ and their
millennium T-shirts, mugs, plates, pins, books, watches, key
chains, glassware, vases, Christmas ornaments, casino chips, snow
globes, bean bags, party hats, plush toys, clocks, coins, cuff
links, tie tacks, ice buckets, dolls, horns, screen savers, license
plates, napkins, caps, serving trays, sunglasses, and Official
Times Square Confetti _ for two decades. ``After 20 years, the
young people who are most affected by an event are old enough to
have disposable income and to buy back their memories,'' he
explains. ``I guarantee that this stuff will surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hake isn't so sure. Hake, who has been running collectibles
auctions out of York, Pa., for more than 30 years, sees last
weekend as akin to the Bicentennial celebrations of 1976: too
diffuse and lacking in potential nostalgia. ``A tremendous amount
of the same type of stuff was produced for the Bicentennial, and
it's virtually worthless today,'' he says. ``I have the feeling the
millennial stuff is headed down the same road.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe short-term profit is the way to think. Searches of more
than 60 Internet auction sites this week found that more than 9,000
millennium-related items, many of them originally produced as
instant collectibles and not as souvenirs, are at any given moment
being peddled by individuals. Some items are clearly more desirable
than others, however. Noticeably hot: the last in a series of 101
pins originally available at the Disney Store, a $4 item that
immediately sold out when released on Dec. 31 and earlier this week
was fetching $100 and up on the Net. (This was before word leaked
out that the pins will again be sold by Disney in April, thereby
dropping prices to between $20 and $25.) Noticably not hot:
Millennium the bear Beanie Babies, many of which are going bidless.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there's been no shortage of Y2K stuff out there.
Besides millennium souvenirs and other bric-a-brac, we've seen the
likes of millennium Faberge eggs, millennium Hummel figurines,
millennium Waterford toasting flutes, millennium Zippo lighters,
millennium Cabbage Patch Kids, millennium Hot Wheels, and
millennium editions of Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. There's also
Millennium Princess Barbie, who was released in July by Mattel Inc.
and ``flew off the shelves'' at $30, according to company
spokesperson Danny Palumbo. For the past few days, many of the most
popular editions of the doll _ not to be confused with Millennium
Princess Barbie Hallmark ornaments or Millennium Princess Barbie
McDonald's plastic figures _ have been selling in excess of $100 at
Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   So the way Joanne Sargent figures it is this: Sell now. Sargent,
who lives in southern New Hampshire, is a collector of Disneyana
who purchased about 200 of the Disney Store's 101 ``Countdown to
the Millennium'' pins that were released between Sept. 23 and Dec.
31. She even has four copies of pin (NU)1, the Mickey Mouse memento
that is still fetching solid sums at Internet auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wait?'' Sargent asks rhetorically. ``I know what a
recession is like. I don't want to be stuck with what I've got.
Besides, I didn't think the prices would be this high right away. I
didn't think it would happen so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disneyana and Barbieware have preexisting markets, vast
networks of collectors who'll buy anything with mouse ears or a
tiny waist. A millennium coffee mug has no such automatic fan base.
Yet even if Hake is right, and such an item will likely go the way
of the Bicentennial ashtray, it might find a home at the Center for
Millennial Studies at Boston University. The four-year-old center,
working in consultation with the Library of Congress, wants to
archive millennial documents and memorabilia pertaining to the year
2000. Even rhinestone tiaras may apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catalog only academic material, we'll get a distorted
picture of what happened,'' contends David Kessler, executive
administrator of the center. ``Millennialism isn't just about
academia. It's also about popular culture. We need all levels of of
material to understand how millennialism fits into society.'' Folks
who contribute to the archive will receive a certificate of
recognition and earn the title of associate archivist.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the upbeat millennial knickknacks, of course, lurk the
commerical memorabilia of the apparently defused Y2K bug. T-shirts,
``bug'' spray, and plush-toy bugs dominate. But according to
Sohmers, who's bullish on other millennium stuff long term, bug
items will always represent a down market simply because no havoc
was wreaked on Jan. 1. ``Disasters are very collectible,'' he
points out. ``People collect stuff relating to the Johnstown flood.
To the Hindenburg. To the Titanic. Why? Because people died.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has died from the Y2K bug, although Charlie Nugent
isn't feeling too great as a result of it. Nugent, who owns a
financial software consulting company in Boston, decided last year
to create and sell ``I'm a Y2K Survivor'' T-shirts. He started with
a batch of 100, just to see how they'd do. He sold a grand total of
30, which ended production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll put them on the Internet and see what happens,''
Nugent says sheepishly of his remaining shirts. Perhaps he should
put them in a closet for 20 years first.

BLURRING LINES: AOL PURCHASE MIXES THE MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ, DON AUCOIN, AND PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As media aftershocks and soaring stocks greeted the news Monday,
many analysts saw the sale of Time Warner to America Online as a
potentially dramatic turning point in the way Americans receive
their news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torch has been passed to a new generation; that torch is
now clearly in the hands of the Internet,'' said Bruce Leichtman,
director of media and entertainment strategies for the Yankee
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as old media or new media anymore,''
added Jim Nail, senior analyst at Forester Research in Cambridge,
Mass.. ``It's all just media.''
</P>
<P>
   For the public, the possibilities generated by the leading
Internet service provider, partnered with the largest media and
entertainment company, seem almost endless.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world of merged media, consumers could use their
computer to conjure up their favorite celluloid heroes from film
archives; movie studios could preview new flicks to Internet
audiences; the venerable Time Inc. magazine brand could crank out a
new group of hip Internet-related publications; and perhaps best of
all, people may end up spending less than they now do on media
services like cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the roughly $180 billion deal Monday, the new AOL
Time Warner chairman, Steve Case said that ``in the tradition'' of
Time's founder, ``Henry Luce, it's not just about making money.
It's about serving the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The new mega-company ``will mean new kinds of entertainment . .
. shopping for a variety of products and services, and new
opportunities to communicate,'' he added. AOL will essentially
serve as a portal through which consumers can gain access to
entertainment and news from CNN, HBO, Warner Bros., (television,
movies and music), and Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   However, the merger also rekindled fears among some observers
about the consolidation of media power in fewer and fewer corporate
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us as citizens, the news is very troubling,'' said Mark
Crispin Miller of New York University. ``Conflict of interest is
now so widespread that the phrase almost has no meaning any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will now have every reason to cram its offerings with Time
Warner product,'' he added. ``AOL will tend to guide us toward
sites the feature the latest Warner Brothers release, the TV shows
and movies that Warner Brothers produces, the stuff on HBO. We will
be in a kind of specialty mall.''
</P>
<P>
   To W. Russell Neuman, a professor of communications technology
at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania, the fact that AOL is in the driver's seat on the deal
underscores the new reality governing entertainment and information
in the cyber-era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old mantra was: `Content is king,'' Neuman said. ``There's
a new mantra: `Content is king, but access to the home is the
kingmaker.' That's what AOL has.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuman said the merger had come about because the players
recognize that the demand for broadband Internet access will grow
rapidly in the next few years. They also understand that the
quality of streaming video will soon improve, he said, which will
make Time Warner's massive holdings in film and television even
more valuable by, for instance, enabling the company to market
Warner Bros. films directly to consumers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the merger clearly indicates that the Internet is
becoming an integral part of everyday life, like the telephone and
television. The deal will provide AOL with access to Time Warner's
cable network, enabling it to provide high-speed cable, or
broadband, Internet access to its members. That means that in
typical households, the Internet can be on 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always on,'' said Frank Gens, vice president of Internet
research at International Data Corp. in Framingham. ``The concept
of the dial tone will be dead. You don't need to pick something up
and get a dial tone; this is about a constant, virtual presence of
as much of the world as you want to have in your kitchen or your
living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives in the entertainment and Internet industries have
long envisioned ``convergence,'' or the merging of television and
Web content. By giving more consumers access to broadband service,
the merger is likely to speed up the process of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   According to the analysts, consumers could see a host of
scenarios play out. For instance, Dan Amundson, research director
for the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, said he
could envision consumers being able to download music from the
numerous record labels owned by Time Warner directly from the
Internet, or cobbling together video clips of their favorite stars
by going via AOL to the Time Warner movie archives.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rutherfurd, the head of the investment bank at Veronis,
Suhler &AMP; Associates in New York, foresees the day when Warner Bros.
will shoot half a movie and then preview it on cable or the
Internet to gauge early public reaction and make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that scenario,'' he said, ``the consumer really wins.''
Both AOL and Time Warner ``are very, very consumer-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherfurd and Gary Klein, vice president and managing director
of Media and Entertainment Practice at the A. T. Kearney Executive
Search firm in New York, also think the new mega-media company will
ultimately be able to provide less expensive services to consumers,
in part because there are so many different revenue sources within
AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, however, sounded a cautionary note: Consumers may have to
be a little patient before they see dramatic results, suggesting
that the new company will focus on such issues as cross promotion
at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see much the first year,'' other
than ``the combined entity trying to leverage each other,'' he
said. ``This is a big deal and they've got to start to recoup the
number.''
</P>
<P>
   And even with all the potential upside, there are concerns _ and
some gloomy scenarios _ surrounding the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies are ``good at buying things,'' said the media
critic and author Jon Katz. ``They're not very creative at running
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of CNN's Web site and the ambitious
entertainment site launched by Warner Bros. Interactive, Time
Warner's other on-line efforts have been less than stellar: Its
Pathfinder Web site, which lumped together content from the Time
Inc. magazines, failed dramatically. ``For all its success as a
media company, Time Warner has not figured out the Internet, and
neither has any other media company,'' said Dan O'Brien, an analyst
at Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, some observers see the merger as another
mega-media conglomerate that reduces the number of independent _
and divergent _ voices in the information universe. Monday, for
example, CNN's Willow Bay found herself in the awkward position of
interviewing her bosses, Case and the Time Warner chairman, Gerald
Levin. And Time magazine's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, has to
figure out how to chronicle the expansion of the company that
employs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to covering a big corporation,'' he said. ``Now,
we'll have to get used to covering an even bigger one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, took Monday's developments in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad news . . . for consumers, it's bad news for civics,''
Katz said. ``Media was not meant to be that big, was not meant to
be that corporate. There is a very fundamental civics question. Do
you want to have an independent media or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the trend toward consolidation exemplified by the
Viacom-CBS merger and the AOL-Time Warner deal are erasing
``ideological and aesthetic variation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to amaze me that people keep saying we enjoy a
greater range of media product today than we did 50 years ago,''
Miller said. ``It's becoming more and more clear that that's a
distinction without a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuman added: ``The consumer will benefit only if when the dust
settles there are more than three companies left. I don't think
three super-media companies is enough to generate the kind of
competition I'd like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Wall Street greeted news of the deal with open arms,
Main Street seemed a little more wary. Some members of an AOL
message board posted notes Monday that warned of a ``Big Mistake,''
worried about the lack of competition, and fretted about AOL's
ability to ``control my Internet and TV.''

AN ELECTION TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES &UR;  &LR; _ Let's see if I've got this right:
</P>
<P>
   --The Democrats have a candidate attempting to come from behind
here with a huge, unprecedented investment in television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   --Republicans have a gradual trend toward taxes as the defining
topic in a conservative party. There are various competitors for
the position of truest believer, but one candidate has a habit of
straying from orthodoxy and even a tendency to be (dare one utter
the feared word) bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   --In the horse race-fixated press, there is no dearth of
conflicting certainty about the eventual outcome of the two races,
but there is an intriguing absence of a clear front-runner in New
Hampshire _ one jurisdiction that has had in-depth exposure to
them. Important uncertainties also remain about about the other
one, here in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   --And of course, let's not forget that we have a vice president,
an effective partner in a successful administration, who has yet to
hit it off definitively with the prospective voters from his own
party and faces an even steeper hill with a general voting public
possibly looking for change.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking, of course, about 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate was Dick Gephardt; the Republican
vulnerable to the accusation of believing in responsible governance
was Bob Dole; and the vice president widely viewed as vulnerable
was George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All analogies eventually teeter and fall, but this one _ between
unstable campaign atmospheres, uncertain trends, tactical gambles,
even debates over orthodoxy _ is worth holding onto because of an
additional element that is truly defining: 1988 and the year 2000
were years in which the presidency was an open seat.
</P>
<P>
   That fact changes the nature of the game. When the presidency is
open, everything is up for grabs. The essence of the campaign
becomes an attempt to answer the question of how we move on.
Naturally, when the options are various forms of continuity
clashing with various forms of change, a dose of volatility is
injected into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. In modern times _ post-World War II _ open
presidencies have been relatively rare. Before this year, there was
1988; 1968, a unique period of domestic and international strife;
1960; and 1952. Against those, our collective memory includes nine
presidential elections with an incumbent on the ballot. And open
seats in a competitive climate, even with front-runners and top
tiers, produce more wide-open, weird campaigns, a historical fact
that counts triple where the presidency is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Open seats have also followed important stretches of time. The
one in 1952 came as an unprecedented 20-year New Deal era was
ending; the other three wound up eight-year incumbencies _
Eisenhower, Kennedy-Johnson, and Reagan. This year caps another,
Bill Clinton's, which was not exactly a quiet time no matter your
point of view. Quite apart from the opportunity an open seat
creates, we should expect campaigns to decide what is on the next
page after chapters like these to be harder to figure.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more. It may not be front and center in any voter's
brain, but in the background of this year's election is the fact
that no matter how it comes out, the result is certain to go
against the historical grain.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, consider the implications of Bill Bradley's run at
Al Gore. If his ship were to come in, a Bradley nomination would
produce the first general election in 48 years in which neither an
incumbent president nor vice president is on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And the actual defeat of an incumbent vice president for
nomination to succeed his president is essentially without
precedent in modern times. It is true that an aging Alben Barkley
hung around in '52 and would have liked the nod from Truman or the
Democratic convention, but he didn't compete in any of the handful
of primaries held in those days.
</P>
<P>
   But keep going. If Gore prevails through November, his election
would represent only the third occasion in our current electoral
system of president-vice president tickets on which a veep was
elected to succeed his president (Bush in '88 and Martin van Buren
in 1836;each lost reelection in bad economies).
</P>
<P>
   And a Republican victory would be just as weird by historical
standards. At least in this century, good times have consistently
kept the ``in'' party in control of the White House. Only in the
assasination and war craziness of 1968 could you find an exception,
and even there the clouds portending economic trouble were clearly
present.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes all the sense in the world for campaign 2000 to pull
people in different directions, to produce wide swings in
sentiment, and to be subject to odd goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an attractive alternative, Democrats will not find it
easy to dump their vice president. And no matter who the Republican
is, the country will not find it easy to change parties during
record prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But something very unusual is about to happen. And that makes
the best advice before we start counting noses in two weeks to
buckle your seatbelt.

LANGUAGE SLEUTHS ON THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unsolved language mysteries tossed out as part of a year-end
housecleaning have found a willing audience of volunteer sleuths.
And as it happens, the simplest-looking questions turned out to
have the most complicated answers, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'd think the origin of the name Braintree, the
town in Massachusetts, would be easy to track down, yet the two
authoritative-sounding answers disagree on the word's etymology.
Town moderator Joe Powers, citing a 1985 history of Braintree,
writes that the Massachusetts town was named for the Braintree in
England's Essex County. ``The present belief is that the name is
derived from the original Branchetreu that appears in the Doomsday
Book, meaning `the town on the hill.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Irwin of Boston, who researched the question a few
years ago, traces the name not to the French Branchetreu but to Old
English. ``The name Braintree seems to stem from brannoc tre, or
`raven's tree,' '' he says, possibly because a tree used as a raven
rookery was a local landmark.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the Old English name was recast into French
in the Doomsday (or Domesday) Book, since that survey of England
was ordered by William the Conqueror 20 years after his Norman
troops bested England in 1066. But till we find out,
Branchetreu/Brannoc Tre remains on the list of mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jeff Blake's question about the hyphen in ``Moby-Dick,''
here too the answers are less than complete.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lipman says Melville used ``Moby-Dick'' for the title and
Moby Dick for the whale ``to avoid possible confusion between the
book and the whale, which he perhaps could have avoided if he stuck
with the original title, ``The Whale.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rhys Bowen, an amateur Melvillean, explains that nobody
really knows what the author intended. Yes, the first American
edition has a hyphenated title and an unhyphenated whale, but
there's no manuscript evidence to show the author wanted it that
way, or, if he did, what he meant by it. The editors at
Northwestern University Press, publisher of the definitive edition,
have this to say, according to Bowen: ``The question whether the
hyphen should be retained in the title is not an easy one,'' and
``the whole matter is uncertain.'' This leaves ``wide latitude for
debate over grog,'' writes Bowen. ``Melville himself would surely
revel in the ambiguities.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors, though _ however grog-sodden _ do not revel in
ambiguities of this sort, and many recent editions of the novel are
titled ``Moby Dick,'' no hyphen, in line with prevailing usage.
Just as well, too, that Melville's hyphenation didn't catch on:
George Eliot would have called her book ``Silas-Marner,'' James's
short novel would be ``Daisy-Miller,'' and John Updike's newest
fiction would be ``Gertrude-and-Claudius.'' There are already
plenty of surplus hyphens littering our pages _ but that's a rant
for another time.
</P>
<P>
   As for Robert Nelson's puzzler _ how would a Russian represent
the click sound of the !Kung and other African languages, using the
Cyrillic alphabet _ that's a snap, said Glenn Adams of Acton. The !
is not just an exclamation mark _ it's also the International
Phonetic Alphabet symbol for this kind of click. The sound is
impressively named a ``velaric ingressive postalveolar stop'' _
describing the parts of the mouth used, the direction of airflow,
and the truncation of the sound _ and its IPA symbol works (for
linguists, at least) in any language.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to G. Campbell, Compendium of Languages, Vol. I,
!Kung, also known as !Xu, holds the world record for the size of
phoneme inventory, with around 100 consonants,'' Adams continues.
``!Kung is spoken by a few thousand Bushmen on the northwest fringe
of the Kalahari Desert.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go to the Kalahari to hear that !, or even
be able to find it on a map. All you need is a CD with one of
Miriam Makeba's ``Click Songs.'' (Warning: After hearing Makeba,
people have been known to lose sleep trying to reproduce the click
sound. The diagrams in David Crystal's Cambridge Encyclopedia of
Language may help _ or may not.)
</P>
<P>
   That's several mysteries semi-solved, and surely the others _
including rotivity, if it's really a word _ will yield up their
secrets one day.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The lost weekend
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: Joe Murray was unable to write his regular
column for today. He is recovering from last weekend. Instead, he
submitted his notes, which are reprinted in their entirety.)
</P>
<P>
   Big weekend trip planned. Wife and I are driving up to Dallas to
visit daughter and husband who are expecting baby any minute now.
Driving from there to Waco to visit younger daughter and husband
who had baby just a week ago. Exciting times.
</P>
<P>
   Trip to Dallas uneventful. Stayed off interstate, kept to back
roads. Got lost only once. Got into only one fuss with wife. Fussed
about whose fault it was we got lost.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Erin, son-in-law Jessie glad to see us. Jessie has
tickets for that night's Mavericks game. My wife a big NBA fan.
Always wanted to attend a professional basketball game.
Unfortunately, not possible in Dallas where they only have the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and Jessie go to game. I stay home with daughter who is
expecting baby any minute now. I ask her how she's feeling. She
says fine. Every few minutes I ask again.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Sunday, we're going with them to church. Sunday
afternoon we're going with them to baby shower their Sunday school
class is having. Exciting times.
</P>
<P>
   I read a book. Daughter is working crossword puzzles. Quiet
evening at home. Just what I like. Would like it even better if I
could breathe. Erin, Jessie have two cats that they love terribly.
Never mind I'm terribly allergic to cats. Gonna be a bad night, I
can tell.
</P>
<P>
   Throat scratchy. Eyes watery. Starting to cough. Decide to sit
in guest bedroom away from cats. Cats seem to resent my presence.
Can't imagine why.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, daughter says. Guest bedroom is where we keep cat
boxes, back in closet. Not one cat box. Not two cat boxes. Three
cat boxes. Exciting times. Have died and gone to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Move cat boxes into hall. Cats vow blood vendetta. Finally, am
about to get to sleep when Jessie and my wife return. Good news,
bad news. Good news: Mavs won. Bad news: Wife slipped and fell in
driveway, sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Can't remember worse night that didn't involve gunfire. Fitful
sleep for both of us. Next morning wife can't go to church, ankle
too swollen. We leave early for Waco. Jessie, Erin sorry to see us
go. Cats ecstatic. Me, too, now that I can breathe again.
</P>
<P>
   Trip to Waco uneventful. Interstate all the way. Big trucks try
but fail to run us over. Arrive daughter Kate and son-in-law
Keith's house. Eat lunch. Take pictures of new baby. Wife is
staying a week to help daughter with baby, sprained ankle or no
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of daylight left. Plenty of time for me to drive back home.
Better I should stay the night, they say, get early start in
morning. Cat? Well, yes. But hardly seen it since they brought baby
home. No doubt vowing blood vendetta. I'm outta there.
</P>
<P>
   Trip back to Lufkin uneventful. With nobody to confuse me about
directions, make really good time. Glad to be home. Dogs glad to
see me. Tell them what happened with cats. Dogs vow blood vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet evening at home. I'm reading a book. Every few minutes
dogs ask me how I'm feeling. I say fine. Gonna be a good night, I
can tell.

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Late last year, a brutal army _ acting on the orders
of a ruthlessly ambitious politician _ laid waste to one of its
historic provinces, slaughtering thousands, driving up to a half a
million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers, the European Union and the United States
warned that the killing must stop. The rampaging army claimed it
was fighting separatist ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we in the West do about it? Absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't bomb Russia's bridges or power stations or railway
lines or barracks or television transmitters or _ by mistake, of
course _ buses and a passenger train and a hospital and refugee
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   No, we tut-tutted and appealed for a political solution in
Chechnya. And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
scourge of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told us how
important it was to keep good relations with Russia, that Moscow
should not be ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the double standards would have been sharper had the two
events coincided. If the Russian army had bombarded Grozny as NATO
was bombing Belgrade, a few more questions would have been asked
about the ``human values'' which the West was supposedly upholding
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If we can go to war because Albanians were being persecuted in
Kosovo by the Serbs, why couldn't we go to war when Chechens were
being dispossessed of their homes and driven from their villages?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NATO's campaign closed just in time for Russia's
newly-resigned president, Boris Yeltsin, and his prime
minister-turned-successor, Vladimir Putin, to claim that it gave
Russia the right to crush the rebels of its recalcitrant southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   One day, perhaps, historians will add the Chechen dead to the
casualties of Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, we ever know the casualty figures. For the dead of
the only war fought by the European powers since 1945 have still to
be counted; more than half the mass graves of Kosovo have still to
be opened and the Serbs have still to give a final figure for their
civilian and military losses.
</P>
<P>
   There may be 4,000 Albanian corpses _ victims of Serb forces _
still undiscovered in the frozen soil of Kosovo this winter; around
2,000 have already been dug up.
</P>
<P>
   And the town war memorials of Serbia suggest that the Yugoslav
army's dead may be more than the 600 claimed by Milosevic. Perhaps
1,500 Serb civilians were killed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 8,000 people were killed in the war for
Kosovo. Not one of them was a soldier of the NATO alliance. For if
we went to war with the Kosovo Albanians, we were not prepared to
die for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, another variation of the old joke _ that NATO was
ready to fight to the last Albanian _ is making the rounds. As one
survivor put it to a French reporter when NATO troops eventually
entered the ruins of Kosovo: ``While you were flying high in the
skies above us, we down here were dying.'' And it is true. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 350 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the NATO bombardment began, the Serbs turned with far
greater savagery upon their Kosovo Albanian enemies who _ having
waited with enthusiasm for the bombs that would free them from
their Serb oppressors _ found that NATO could not save them.
</P>
<P>
   While Franco Stamatovic and the other Serb war criminals were
unleashing their cruelty upon the Albanians, up to half a million
men, women and children were driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Only more than four months later would NATO's
``bloke-in-the-street'' spokesman, James Shea, cynically sum it all
up. ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``things have to get worse in order to
get better.'' They didn't tell the Albanians that at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the war _ to force the Serbs to accept a political
settlement in Kosovo that would also give the Albanians a
referendum to decide their own future _ had quickly to be
redefined.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bombing Serbia to save the Albanians, we were now
apparently bombing Serbia to get the Albanian refugees ``back into
their homes'' _ most of whom were still in their homes when the war
began.
</P>
<P>
   And when, after 79 days of bombing, NATO marched into Kosovo,
the referendum that might have given the Kosovo Albanians
independence was quietly dropped from the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence for Kosovo _ the only way to peace in the
Balkans,'' say the Albanian bumper stickers in Pristina today. But
the honeymoon is over. Soldiers from the NATO-led ``peacekeeping''
force are tearing the stickers off cars entering the few remaining
Serb areas. U.N. police forces in the province are being abused in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians want their own land, not a U.N.-created
administration linked to Serbia. As for the remaining minority
Serbs, only around 40,000 of the prewar population of 250,000 are
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia drove 50 percent of the Albanian population out of the
province. Now Kosovo Albanians have driven 80 percent of the
minority Serb population out of the province. The ``peacekeepers''
could not keep the ``peace.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should we have tried to save the Albanians in their moment of
agony? Could we have crossed the frontier and fought the Serbs
instead of skulking along the Macedonian border while U.S.
President Bill Clinton opposed a ground offensive? At the least,
the Serbs would not have had time to slaughter so many innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But war for the West must now be cost-free. We bomb. Others die.
We got a taste of this in the 1991 Gulf war, then again in the
year-long bombing campaign against Iraq that started once more in
December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo war reached perfection. Not a single Serb bullet hit
a single NATO soldier. Just one NATO pilot was shot down _ and he
was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO didn't have the guts to send a single heavily-armed
NATO soldier into Kosovo to save the Albanians. Our soldiers never
engaged the enemy. Instead, fearful that the Western alliance might
start to disintegrate as the bombing failed to bring Milosevic to
heel, NATO's bombing targets became more promiscuous.
</P>
<P>
   Power stations, housing tracts, small bridges were hit, even a
tobacco factory.
</P>
<P>
   NATO apologized when it bombed a mass convoy of refugees being
driven from their homes by the Serbs. But just over half way
through the air bombardment, NATO took a strategic decision. It
would no longer apologize for anything it did.
</P>
<P>
   So when American jets struck a narrow bridge at Varvarin at
midday on the village's market day _ blasting Serb civilians into
the Morava River _ and then came back 20 minutes later and killed
the rescue workers, there was not a word of regret.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO arrived in Kosovo, it watched the Serb war criminals
streaming out in their trucks along with thlav army. And did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't worth a single NATO casualty to arrest a single Serb
paramilitary _ even though hundreds of Hague war-crimes
investigators would subsequently be working for months in the
province to identify the very same criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Serb killers retired to Montenegro or central
Serbia, confident that NATO would not pursue them. And they were
right. &QL;

<P>
   NATO's original demand for complete access to all of Serbia _
made at the ``peace'' talks in Paris which preceded the war and
refused by the Serbs _ was also quietly dropped once Milosevic
allowed NATO troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For now, NATO will stay in Kosovo, just as it will stay in
Bosnia. And for now, Milosevic will remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents cannot stir a people who are using all their
energy to survive a winter any more than American exhortation can

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distriy New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Late last year, a brutal army _ acting on the orders
of a ruthlessly ambitious politician _ laid waste to one of its
historic provinces, slaughtering thousands, driving up to a half a
million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers, the European Union and the United States
warned that the killing must stop. The rampaging army claimed it
was fighting separatist ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we in the West do about it? Absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't bomb Russia's bridges or power stations or railway
lines or barracks or television transmitters or _ by mistake, of
course _ buses and a passenger train and a hospital and refugee
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   No, we tut-tutted and appealed for a political solution in
Chechnya. And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
scourge of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told us how
important it was to keep good relations with Russia, that Moscow
should not be ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the double standards would have been sharper had the two
events coincided. If the Russian army had bombarded Grozny as NATO
was bombing Belgrade, a few more questions would have been asked
about the ``human values'' which the West was supposedly upholding
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If we can go to war because Albanians were being persecuted in
Kosovo by the Serbs, why couldn't we go to war when Chechens were
being dispossessed of their homes and driven from their villages?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NATO's campaign closed just in time for Russia's
newly-resigned president, Boris Yeltsin, and his prime
minister-turned-successor, Vladimir Putin, to claim that it gave
Russia the right to crush the rebels of its recalcitrant southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   One day, perhaps, historians will add the Chechen dead to the
casualties of Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, we ever know the casualty figures. For the dead of
the only war fought by the European powers since 1945 have still to
be counted; more than half the mass graves of Kosovo have still to
be opened and the Serbs have still to give a final figure for their
civilian and military losses.
</P>
<P>
   There may be 4,000 Albanian corpses _ victims of Serb forces _
still undiscovered in the frozen soil of Kosovo this winter; around
2,000 have already been dug up.
</P>
<P>
   And the town war memorials of Serbia suggest that the Yugoslav
army's dead may be more than the 600 claimed by Milosevic. Perhaps
1,500 Serb civilians were killed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 8,000 people were killed in the war for
Kosovo. Not one of them was a soldier of the NATO alliance. For if
we went to war with the Kosovo Albanians, we were not prepared to
die for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, another variation of the old joke _ that NATO was
ready to fight to the last Albanian _ is making the rounds. As one
survivor put it to a French reporter when NATO troops eventually
entered the ruins of Kosovo: ``While you were flying high in the
skies above us, we down here were dying.'' And it is true. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Once the NATO bombardment began, the Serbs turned with far
greater savagery upon their Kosovo Albanian enemies who _ having
waited with enthusiasm for the bombs that would free them from
their Serb oppressors _ found that NATO could not save them.
</P>
<P>
   While Franco Stamatovic and the other Serb war criminals were
unleashing their cruelty upon the Albanians, up to half a million
men, women and children were driven from their homes.

   BUSH-THEATER _ GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ A quiet exchange between George
W. Bush and a Texas reporter here recently revealed more than any
pundit could about how the Texas governor's life has changed since
he moved to the national stage. Flanked by police officers and
sheriffs, Bush took the podium and delivered brief remarks after
winning their endorsement. Then he conducted a news conference _
the roughly 15 minutes of questioning he permits, usually daily,
when he is on the campaign trail. He wrapped up the Q&AMP;A session,
then made his way through the crowd. That's when the reporter
sidled up, knowing he was breaking an unwritten Bush campaign rule,
one an aide is usually at the candidate's elbow to enforce:
limiting unguarded conversation outside brief, scheduled news
conferences and approved interviews. ``One more question,'' the
reporter said to Bush. ``It doesn't work that way anymore,'' the
governor said quietly. Surrounded by onlookers, Bush answered the
question that day. But the exchange put the spotlight on how much
more closely controlled and tightly produced Bush has become as he
has evolved into the Republican presidential front-runner. (Heath,

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As state officials consider making felons out of
persistent low-level criminals, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye is
calling for less plea bargaining on misdemeanors and more special
courts to handle them.

<P>
   Kaye, in a State of the Judiciary address at the Court of
Appeals on Monday, also called for restructuring the courts, using
collection agencies to crack down on delinquent fines and giving
assigned defense counsels their first raise since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The address focused heavily on misdemeanor offenders, an issue
that has drawn wide concern since a recent brick attack on a woman
in New York City, where a suspect has a history of prior arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has suggested that a person with three
misdemeanors in 10 years be tried as a felon, which could mean
longer time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye steered clear of the attack or Pataki's proposal but said
the problem is apparent: Two-thirds of misdemeanor defendants in
New York City last year had a record; and more than half of
low-level offenders had prior arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this sort of behavior is in itself a cause for concern
_ it corrodes and degrades our neighborhoods and communities,''
Kaye said. ``But even more disturbing is the threat that persistent
petty offenders may turn to violent crime, on occasion even to a
horrendous, sensational crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts, Kaye said, are so bogged down with cases that ``the
system is reduced to a plea-bargain mill,'' which some refer to as
``McJustice.'' She called for about two dozen new judges in New
York City and greater use statewide of Drug Courts, which have been
tried in various communities, and Community Courts, which deal with
quality-of-life offenses. Both focus on finding ways to discourage
repeat offenses through not only punishment or restitution but
rehabilitation and job counseling.
</P>
<P>
   On court restructuring, the jurist suggests consolidating the
system into two tiers. The Court of Claims, County, Family, and
Surrogate's courts would all merge into the Supreme Court, while
New York City's Civil and Criminal courts, Nassau and Suffolk
District Courts, and upstate City Courts would become part of a
statewide District Court. Most of the major changes require
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye suggests paying new costs through the current $70 million
in surcharges on fines, which now goes to the state's general fund.
She also called for hiring private collection agencies to collect
fines, an idea that will be tested soon in certain courts in New
York, Long Island and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye also proposed to raise assigned counsel rates, now $40 per
hour for in-court work and $25 per hour for out-of-court time, to
$75 for felony cases and $60 for misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew a cool reaction from the New York State
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, whose president-elect,
Kathryn M. Kase, said Kaye's desire to increase rates was
encouraging, but ``even if we go to $75 an hour, we would still
have people in this state that would not be able to pay their
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the address, Kaye and Chief Administrative Judge
Jonathan Lippman issued an 85-page book of more than 140
legislative proposals, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Making lawyers disciplined for professional misconduct pay the
costs of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving jurors in high-risk cases anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing courts to hold juveniles responsible not only for
property damage but physical harm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving parents and children the same confidentiality privilege
held by husbands and wives, attorneys and clients and doctors and
patients.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The biggest deal the world has seen was born not in
New York or anywhere else in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was planted as the seed of an idea in the remote provinces of
southern China, and in Peking and Shanghai where Steve Case and
Gerald Levin spent a week together last October on a Time
magazine-sponsored news tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   Case, head of America Online (AOL), and Levin, chairman of Time
and the putative CEO of the new company, became friendly about a
year ago when they met at a conference. They kept in touch, purely
on a personal basis, after that.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until shortly after their China sojourn that Case
picked up a telephone in AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va., on the
outskirts of Washington, and speed-dialed Levin. (No, he did not
apparently, use his e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea,'' he said, ``let's put our two companies
together.'' Clearly, Levin did not take much persuading. The call
was placed barely two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said Monday that in considering AOL's advances, he knew
that if he didn't enter into such a marriage by the end of 2000 one
of the other media giants would have done so. And he didn't want to
be second.
</P>
<P>
   Both in terms of numbers and brand names, the merger is
dazzling. Time Warner brings the largest number of household brands
to the marriage: Time magazine, CNN, Warner Brothers, People, HBO,
Sports Illustrated, Warner Music Group, Fortune, Entertainment
Weekly, Looney Tunes and Cartoon Network, which features, among
others The Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   AOL with its cyber assistant Connie is a brand in its own right,
of course. Among its other assets, however, you have Compuserve,
Netscape, Digital City and AOL Moviephone.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer reach that the new company will have can also be seen
in the subscriber numbers. Add them up and you have a mighty chunk
of our world.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has 20 million members, Time magazines have 30 million
subscribers and CNN is available to one billion television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable, the cable television network that AOL will be
able to tap into to distribute its product at super high speed, has
13 million subscribers. (Only AT&AMP;T's network in the U.S. is
bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Transcending the deal itself, meanwhile, is the message it
delivers about our new Internet age and about the myriad new
companies crowding for a piece of it. It means we can believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is venerable, it is mighty and it is safe, but
Monday it sent an unmistakable message: the Internet is the future.
</P>
<P>
   A truth that has been creeping up on all of the media industry
for so many months has now been spelled out in blaring neon. The
future is called the broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something profound is taking place,'' Levin told a crammed New
York press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said something else terribly important too. The crazy,
insane, untenable valuations that have been put on Internet
companies in recent months _ on the Amazons and other dot-com
pioneers that are roaring up the information highway, and the stock
indices, with little early prospect of making any actual money _
are not crazy or insane at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the present valuations,'' he said. ``Their future
cash flow is so significant, that is how you justify it.'' And the
amounts of cash washing around the merger are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner Monday described putting his name to the mega-merger
last Sunday night as not unlike his first experience of having sex
some four decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Putting ink to the proposed combination was, it would appear,
almost a religious experience for the old maverick from Atlanta.
You can understand that.
</P>
<P>
   With the 100 million shares that he owns in Time Warner,
acquired through the sale of his own beloved CNN to Time three
years ago, Turner was making himself roughly $2.5 billion richer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, however, there was still more behind his excitement.
When the rest of the world learned about what was happening in the
boardroom that night, it would stand back in awe and amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-mergers, where the figures are in billions not millions,
are commonplace. But this deal was clearly different and not just
because it was the biggest in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   No single event could better capture what is happening to the
media industry as one millennium turns into the next.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the world's leading information and entertainment
companies linking up with the largest audience in cyberspace, it is
bound to influence the nature of what we see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will speed the rush among media providers to offer
tailored news and football results straight to customers' mobile
phones. Before long, trips to the video shop will be obsolete, as
films become available on demand through cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the ultimate symbol of the old media opening the
door to the new universe of digital and broadband communications _
a universe that both fascinates and frightens it _ and deciding to
abandon caution and leap through. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Time Warner, a company with decades of history, is flinging
itself into the arms of AOL, a business just 15 years old and
barely known a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining event for Time Warner and America Online as
well as a pivotal moment in the unfolding of the Internet age,''
said Time Warner president Richard Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will also note the special timing. It was on Jan. 10,
1990 _ exactly 10 years ago _ that Time Warner was created out of
the fusion between the Time Inc. and Warner Communications, two
companies that had been founded in 1922. Time was the creation of
Henry Luce, whose name was repeatedly invoked in Monday's merger
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, however, may be the fact that this deal, or one
like it _ say between Disney and Yahoo! _ has not happened before.
Case said Monday with admirable restraint: ``This is the first time
a major Internet company has merged with a major media company and
the possibilities are endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the really observant among us would have seen this
merger coming a few short months ago when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
starred in a cute little romantic film called ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Any AOL users will know where that phrase is from and will
recognize the on-screen icons that are featured in the film. They
are the signatures of that company. And who made the film? Warner
Brothers, of course. &QL;

on a personal basis, after that.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until shortly after their China sojourn that Case
picked up a telephone in AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va., on the
outskirts of Washington, and speed-dialed Levin. (No, he did not
apparently, use his e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea,'' he said, ``let's put our two companies
together.'' Clearly, Levin did not take much persuading. The call
was placed barely two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said Monday that in considering AOL's advances, he knew
that if he didn't enter into such a marriage by the end of 2000 one
of the other media giants would have done so. And he didn't want to
be second.
</P>
<P>
   Both in terms of numbers and brand names, the merger is
dazzling. Time Warner brings the largest number of household brands
to the marriage: Time magazine, CNN, Warner Brothers, People, HBO,
Sports Illustrated, Warner Music Group, Fortune, Entertainment
Weekly, Looney Tunes and Cartoon Network, which features, among
others The Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   AOL with its cyber assistant Connie is a brand in its own right,
of course. Among its other assets, however, you have Compuserve,
Netscape, Digital City and AOL Moviephone.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer reach that the new company will have can also be seen
in the subscriber numbers. Add them up and you have a mighty chunk
of our world.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has 20 million members, Time magazines have 30 million
subscribers and CNN is available to one billion television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable, the cable television network that AOL will be
able to tap into to distribute its product at super high speed, has
13 million subscribers. (Only AT&AMP;T's network in the U.S. is
bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Transcending the deal itself, meanwhile, is the message it
delivers about our new Internet age and about the myriad new
companies crowding for a piece of it. It means we can believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is venerable, it is mighty and it is safe, but
Monday it sent an unmistakable message: the Internet is the future.
</P>
<P>
   A truth that has been creeping up on all of the media industry
for so many months has now been spelled out in blaring neon. The
future is called the broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something profound is taking place,'' Levin told a crammed New
York press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said something else terribly important too. The crazy,
insane, untenable valuations that have been put on Internet
companies in recent months _ on the Amazons and other dot-com
pioneers that are roaring up the information highway, and the stock
indices, with little early prospect of making any actual money _
are not crazy or insane at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the present valuations,'' he said. ``Their future
cash flow is so significant, that is how you justify it.'' And the
amounts of cash washing around the merger are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner Monday described putting his name to the mega-merger
last Sunday night as not unlike his first experience of having sex
some four decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Putting ink to the proposed combination was, it would appear,
almost a religious experience for the old maverick from Atlanta.
You can understand that.
</P>
<P>
   With the 100 million shares that he owns in Time Warner,
acquired through the sale of his own beloved CNN to Time three
years ago, Turner was making himself roughly $2.5 billion richer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, however, there was still more behind his excitement.
When the rest of the world learned about what was happening in the
boardroom that night, it would stand back in awe and amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-mergers, where the figures are in billions not millions,
are commonplace. But this deal was clearly different and not just
because it was the biggest in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   No single event could better capture what is happening to the
media industry as one millennium turns into the next.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the world's leading information and entertainment
companies linking up with the largest audience in cyberspace, it is
bound to influence the nature of what we see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will speed the rush among media providers to offer
tailored news and football results straight to customers' mobile
phones. Before long, trips to the video shop will be obsolete, as
films become available on demand through cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the ultimate symbol of the old media opening the
door to the new universe of digital and broadband communications _
a universe that both fascinates and frightens it _ and deciding to
abandon caution and leap through. &QL;

<P>
   Time Warner, a company with decades of history, is flinging
itself into the arms of AOL, a business just 15 years old and
barely known a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining event for Time Warner and America Online as
well as a pivotal moment in the unfolding of the Internet age,''
said Time Warner president Richard Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will also note the special timing. It was on Jan. 10,
1990 _ exactly 10 years ago _ that Time Warner was created out of
the fusion between the Time Inc. and Warner Communications, two
companies that had been founded in 1922. Time was the creation of
Henry Luce, whose name was repeatedly invoked in Monday's merger
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, however, may be the fact that this deal, or one
like it _ say between Disney and Yahoo! _ has not happened before.
Case said Monday with admirable restraint: ``This is the first time
a major Internet company has merged with a major media company and
the possibilities are endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the really observant among us would have seen this
merger coming a few short months ago when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
starred in a cute little romantic film called ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>

   Any AOL users will know where that phrase is from and will
recognize the on-screen icons that are featured in the film. They

Brothers, of course. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The biggest deal the world has seen was born not in
New York or anywhere else in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was planted as the seed of an idea in the remote provinces of
southern China, and in Peking and Shanghai where Steve Case and
Gerald Levin spent a week together last October on a Time
magazine-sponsored news tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   Case, head of America Online (AOL), and Levin, chairman of Time
and the putative CEO of the new company, became friendly about a

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

RIGHT ANGLE: SIDEWAYS THINKING DOES THE TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RESENDING - ALSO MOVE IN `L' CATEGGORY)
 &UR; Thaddeus Steele was a man who could think sideways. In fact, he
invented the art.
</P>
<P>
   He was my wife's grandfather, and he was never completely
socialized. He kept rattlesnakes under the house. He fished and
hunted for a living, and although he sometimes held a job, if he
thought the fish were biting, he left the job site for the fishing
pond without a single wince of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   He also believed that traffic signs and stoplights were there to
``instruct those who didn't know how to drive.'' Because he knew
what he was doing, he ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for his inventive method of problem solving that I
remember him here. Thad Steele never met a problem he couldn't
solve, and in a way no one else might have thought of.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner post of his back porch cracked, and the porch
roof sagged on one side, he lassoed a nearby sapling and pulled it
down under the porch eave, using the natural springiness of the
tree to keep the roof from falling.
</P>
<P>
   STILL THAT WAY &QL; 
``It was still that way the last time I saw it,'' my wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a neighbor used a shortcut across his lawn,
eventually wearing a path in the grass, Thad Steele knew how to
stop her. He never would have confronted her directly; that wasn't
his style.
</P>
<P>
   No, he dug a person-size hole hip deep in the center of the
path, mixed up a load of pudding-quality mud to fill it in, used
carpet tacks to secure a cloth across the hole and sprinkled it
with dirt and grass to camouflage the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the woman stepped into the hole up to her waist in
brown goo. She stopped shortcutting across his yard.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the touch of the carpet tacks.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of Thad Steele's peculiar approach to
life.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING SCARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His friend Hub Hawkins had a stutter. Thad had said many times
that ``if Hub were frightened enough, he'd talk as plain as the
next man.'' One day, while Thad and Hub's cousin Dewey were sitting
on the front porch, they saw Hub walking toward them on the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thad leveled the pistol he always carried _ as all real men in
Madison, N.C., did in those days _ and fired several times at Hub's
feet, making him dance. Hub yelled back, ``D-D-Dod d-damn you,
D-Dad D-D-Deele!''
</P>
<P>
   That was one solution that didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   But sideways thinking often did work. Thad Steele kept five blue
Dodges in his backyard so he always had parts for the blue Dodge he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife and her sister argued violently over who owned a
beautiful pitcher and bowl that had belonged to their mother, Thad
Steele took the crockery down to the creek and broke them on the
rocks. It stopped the squabble.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TO REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He pierced straight through to the reality, to the heart of
the matter,'' my wife says. ``He was not about social acceptance.
He thought it silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once, when she was about five years old, her
grandfather was asked to baby-sit her. For Thad Steele,
baby-sitting meant the child adapting to him, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because he had intended to go hunting that day, the
child went hunting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen a bunch of flying squirrels in the woods near the
house, and so the three of them _ Thad Steele, his gun and the
five-year-old girl _ went out shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After he had shot three of them, he wrapped them in a blanket
and handed them to the child, telling her, ``Take care of them like
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps more appropriate ways to deal with a child,
but the old man knew who he was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said, `Watch these while I go down the path
looking for more,' but he didn't. He turned them into baby dolls
for me. He understood me and made me feel like a million dollars. I
was their mother because of what he said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has learned her lessons from Thad Steele well. She is
also a master of sideways thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When she was young and poor, recently divorced, she couldn't
afford her automobile inspection, so she painted the inspection
sticker on the windshield of the car and used it for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult and an art teacher in Arizona, she was given an art
room with carpet _ not the best kind of floor for a room full of
second-graders with jars of tempera paint. And when the inevitable
spill happened and she couldn't scrub out the stain, she realized:
``I'm an art teacher; I can mix that color.''
</P>
<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of our family, sideways thinking skips
generations, like some genetic traits. My wife's grandfather had it
in spades, but her father did not. He was a thoroughly socialized
man, well-thought of in the community.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got the gene, but her daughter didn't. She is a reporter
on a newspaper in the South, and she has all the people skills
necessary for the job. But although she is very smart, her
intelligence travels in a straight line, not crabwise.
</P>
<P>
   But that daughter is now pregnant, and if the pattern holds
true, the twins she is carrying will turn out to think sideways,
like their grandmother and great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looks forward to subverting them, showing them the
secrets of sideways life, hoping to explore a world free from
social and cultural expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks forward to baby-sitting them, just like her
grandad baby-sat her.

RIGHT ANGLE: SIDEWAYS THINKING DOES THE TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RESENDING - ALSO MOVE IN `K' CATEGGORY)
 &UR; Thaddeus Steele was a man who could think sideways. In fact, he
invented the art.
</P>
<P>
   He was my wife's grandfather, and he was never completely
socialized. He kept rattlesnakes under the house. He fished and
hunted for a living, and although he sometimes held a job, if he
thought the fish were biting, he left the job site for the fishing
pond without a single wince of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   He also believed that traffic signs and stoplights were there to
``instruct those who didn't know how to drive.'' Because he knew
what he was doing, he ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for his inventive method of problem solving that I
remember him here. Thad Steele never met a problem he couldn't
solve, and in a way no one else might have thought of.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner post of his back porch cracked, and the porch
roof sagged on one side, he lassoed a nearby sapling and pulled it
down under the porch eave, using the natural springiness of the
tree to keep the roof from falling.
</P>
<P>
   STILL THAT WAY &QL; 
``It was still that way the last time I saw it,'' my wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a neighbor used a shortcut across his lawn,
eventually wearing a path in the grass, Thad Steele knew how to
stop her. He never would have confronted her directly; that wasn't
his style.
</P>
<P>
   No, he dug a person-size hole hip deep in the center of the
path, mixed up a load of pudding-quality mud to fill it in, used
carpet tacks to secure a cloth across the hole and sprinkled it
with dirt and grass to camouflage the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the woman stepped into the hole up to her waist in
brown goo. She stopped shortcutting across his yard.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the touch of the carpet tacks.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of Thad Steele's peculiar approach to
life.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING SCARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His friend Hub Hawkins had a stutter. Thad had said many times
that ``if Hub were frightened enough, he'd talk as plain as the
next man.'' One day, while Thad and Hub's cousin Dewey were sitting
on the front porch, they saw Hub walking toward them on the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thad leveled the pistol he always carried _ as all real men in
Madison, N.C., did in those days _ and fired several times at Hub's
feet, making him dance. Hub yelled back, ``D-D-Dod d-damn you,
D-Dad D-D-Deele!''
</P>
<P>
   That was one solution that didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   But sideways thinking often did work. Thad Steele kept five blue
Dodges in his backyard so he always had parts for the blue Dodge he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife and her sister argued violently over who owned a
beautiful pitcher and bowl that had belonged to their mother, Thad
Steele took the crockery down to the creek and broke them on the
rocks. It stopped the squabble.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TO REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He pierced straight through to the reality, to the heart of
the matter,'' my wife says. ``He was not about social acceptance.
He thought it silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once, when she was about five years old, her
grandfather was asked to baby-sit her. For Thad Steele,
baby-sitting meant the child adapting to him, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because he had intended to go hunting that day, the
child went hunting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen a bunch of flying squirrels in the woods near the
house, and so the three of them _ Thad Steele, his gun and the
five-year-old girl _ went out shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After he had shot three of them, he wrapped them in a blanket
and handed them to the child, telling her, ``Take care of them like
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps more appropriate ways to deal with a child,
but the old man knew who he was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said, `Watch these while I go down the path
looking for more,' but he didn't. He turned them into baby dolls
for me. He understood me and made me feel like a million dollars. I
was their mother because of what he said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has learned her lessons from Thad Steele well. She is
also a master of sideways thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When she was young and poor, recently divorced, she couldn't
afford her automobile inspection, so she painted the inspection
sticker on the windshield of the car and used it for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult and an art teacher in Arizona, she was given an art
room with carpet _ not the best kind of floor for a room full of
second-graders with jars of tempera paint. And when the inevitable
spill happened and she couldn't scrub out the stain, she realized:
``I'm an art teacher; I can mix that color.''
</P>
<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>

   LONDON _ Monday was the day the Internet grew up.
</P>
<P>
   We knew this strange, amorphous communications network, tied
together by a few amateurs from personal computers, telephone wires
and a lot of clever software, would become the dominant technology
of the first quarter of this century.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Net was still dominated by the stand-alone
companies that helped to popularize it, it would remain outside the
corporate mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Internet companies are worth an enormous amount on the
stock exchanges. Sure, they are growing amazingly fast. But while
they have immense promise, they don't employ many people and have
not, in the main, been making any money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all is different. The merger between the world's biggest
Internet service provider and the world's largest media group means
the might of American capitalism will be devoted to pushing the new
technology into every aspect of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   There will now be a string of mergers, including British and
European ones, as other media groups try to gain electronic access
to our homes.
</P>
<P>
   Any firm with a message or a brand name in media will be
clamoring for our attention, trying to create services we will want
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   How they reach us _ whether through the PCs as at present, or by
interactive television, or by mobile phones, or even by video games
consoles _ is still for grabs. But over the next 10 years the
technology will race ahead and the variety of entertainment and
information services on offer will explode.
</P>
<P>
   The limit will not be technology; it will be our taste and our
time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reasonable presumption that the American dominance of
the Internet will continue _ though the key invention, the World
Wide Web, was made by a Briton working in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But while it would be right to expect the tidal wave of American
popular culture to flow even more strongly, the Net is ultimately a
democratic technology. It will do what we want of it.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to use it to watch Hollywood movies, we will download
them in seconds. If we want to revitalize local government, it will
create local discussion forums. If we want to buy shares, a few
clicks of the mouse will do that. And if we want to use the great
global library to educate ourselves better, then that too is
available for all.
</P>
<P>
   Not all giant mergers succeed. Companies _ and mergers _ succeed
only if they can create goods and services we want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   We, the consumers, are about to be offered an explosion of
choice: choice of entertainment, of education, of information. A
few years ago we had only four television channels. In 10 more
years there will be hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   This world will be as different as our supermarkets are now from
the family grocers of the Fifties. But it will be our choice: we,
as consumers, will win. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Napping at work is one of the best ways of
increasing productivity and reducing human error, according to
psychologists, who found that the majority of employees already
sneak off for a quick kip during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are taking the idea so seriously that they are
introducing sleeping rooms in their offices so employees can have a
midday snooze without feeling guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Research conducted by Bill Anthony, a professor at Boston
University, and published last week in a book called ``The Art of
Napping at Work,'' has shown that 70 percent of employees admit to
sneaking naps at work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Anthony believes that napping is not only natural but
also essential to health and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workplace napping is a natural, no-cost way to increase worker
productivity,'' he said. ``Business need to introduce a workplace
napping policy outlining the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, which he wrote with his wife Camille, is designed to
help people overcome environmental barriers and skepticism that the
workplace napper faces.
</P>
<P>
   Companies who have taken part in their research have found it
boosts staff morale and business benefits from having ``two
mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown that most people now get one to two
hours less sleep per night than before the invention of the light
bulb and it well recognized that modern living has introduced a
nationwide sleep deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses who ignore the financial and health benefits of
napping at work are asleep at the switch.'' Following Bill and
Camille Anthony's advice will lead to greater productivity,
increased job satisfaction, and better health, a win-win situation
for everyone, said Dr. James Maas, author of ``Power Sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   One convert to the napping at work is David Johnson, managing
director of a consulting firm in Pittsburgh. ``We have experienced
an increase in productivity and seen less human error as a result
of our nap room,'' he said. `` We are proud to be part of this
forward-thinking movement.'' &QL;

introducing sleeping rooms in their offices so employees can have a
midday snooze without feeling guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Research conducted by Bill Anthony, a professor at Boston
University, and published last week in a book called ``The Art of
Napping at Work,'' has shown that 70 percent of employees admit to
sneaking naps at work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Anthony believes that napping is not only natural but
also essential to health and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workplace napping is a natural, no-cost way to increase worker
productivity,'' he said. ``Business need to introduce a workplace
napping policy outlining the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, which he wrote with his wife Camille, is designed to
help people overcome environmental barriers and skepticism that the
workplace napper faces.
</P>
<P>
   Companies who have taken part in their research have found it
boosts staff morale and business benefits from having ``two
mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown that most people now get one to two
hours less sleep per night than before the invention of the light
bulb and it well recognized that modern living has introduced a
nationwide sleep deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses who ignore the financial and health benefits of
napping at work are asleep at the switch.'' Following Bill and
Camille Anthony's advice will lead to greater productivity,
increased job satisfaction, and better health, a win-win situation
for everyone, said Dr. James Maas, author of ``Power Sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   One convert to the napping at work is David Johnson, managing
director of a consulting firm in Pittsburgh. ``We have experienced
an increase in productivity and seen less human error as a result
of our nap room,'' he said. `` We are proud to be part of this
forward-thinking movement.'' &QL;

 &HT;    CRITICS SAY CUSTOMS X-RAY SEARCHES ARE X-RATED
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Customs Service is fielding complaints
about its new BodySearch security system, which critics say invades
air travelers' privacy by revealing ``every curve of your naked
body right through your clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be exposed like a Playboy playmate by these new
voyeur-vision devices, even when you are fully clothed,'' said
Libertarian Party national director Steve Dasbach.
</P>
<P>
   The $125,000 BodySearch system uses very low doses of x-ray
energy to scan and display an image of the traveler's body on a
screen. Hidden drugs, currency, explosives and firearms _ even
plastic weapons _ can then be identified. It is manufactured by
American Science and Engineering Inc. of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service introduced the system three months ago and
is using it at six major airports _ Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los
Angeles, Miami and New York's Kennedy International.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for 13 airports to be equipped, with two more systems
to be installed by March at Washington's Dulles International and
Newark International, said Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has asked the U.S. Department
of Transportation to issue a regulation that explains how airports
can use the BodySearch, said legislative counsel Gregory T. Nojeim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since airport officials don't need a search warrant to use
these x-rated x-rays, everyone from your teenage daughter to your
grandmother can be technologically stripped stark naked _ in stark
violation of their right to privacy,'' said Dasbach of the
Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who drafted our Bill of Rights would be shocked at
the extent to which these electronic strip searches violate our
Fourth Amendment rights to privacy,'' said Nojeim. ``Passengers
check their luggage at airports, not their rights to personal
privacy and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say the complaints are being blown out of
proportion. Murphy said the BodySearch is in a private area of the
airport, and trained customs officials who view the images are of
the same sex as those who are being scanned.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Customs decided to use the device because in the
past, officials were forced to touch sensitive parts of people's
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the BodySearch) does is alleviate the need for us to
touch people, because people don't like to touched, and we don't
blame them, because our inspectors also feel uncomfortable touching
people,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the machine has the ability to record and print
images, Murphy said Customs only prints the images if they show
hidden objects. Printed images are used as evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
   Air travelers arriving in the United States are searched only
when an inspector has ``good'' reason to suspect that a passenger
is carrying contraband, Murphy said. He said that on average, 15
passengers from a flight carrying 300 are searched.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious passengers are taken to a secluded area and are given
the option of being scanned or undergoing a physical pat-down.
Travelers who choose to be scanned are then given lengthy
explanations of how the BodySearch works.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at Chicago O'Hare, not many people have
opted to be scanned. Spokeswoman Sherese Miles said that since the
BodySearch was installed at the airport in November, only nine
passengers have been scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nojeim said Customs needs to find better methods of
detecting drug smugglers and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice between a pat-down search and an electronic strip
search is no real answer,'' he said. ``Both involve an unreasonable
affront to the dignity of the passengers. These machines conduct
electronic strip searches of passengers, even though there is
little or no evidence that they are engaged in crime.''

&HT;     BRADLEY PICKS UP ENDORSEMENTS OF SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three San Francisco supervisors with diverse
political agendas have endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley for the
Democratic presidential nomination, a sign that Vice President Al
Gore may have a tougher battle in California than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, Michael Yaki and Gavin Newsom threw their support
behind Bradley for the state's March 7 primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, the president of the city's governing Board of
Supervisors, is the city's most powerful gay leader. Yaki is one of
San Francisco's most prominent Asian-American politicians. Newsom
is a businessman with a strong constituency of moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   California, which has 434 of the 2,169 delegates needed to
capture the Democratic nomination, is pivotal for presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley does well in Iowa on Jan. 24 or in New Hampshire on
Feb. 1, Gore would especially need California in March to pick up
his momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's camp was not fazed by the news from San Francisco. Polls
generally give Gore the edge in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we applaud the senator's three endorsements, it is clear
that the vast majority of California community leaders want Al Gore
in their corner, fighting the good fight for education, health
care, the environment and the economy,'' said David Chai, Gore's
campaign press secretary in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the endorsements of Bradley by Yaki, Ammiano and Newsom
are minor on the national scale, they represent a diverse voting
populace and a possible chink in Gore's armor, according to the
Bradley camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``These supervisors represent significantly different views, but
they came together on this one thing,'' said John Roos, Bradley's
state campaign chairman. ``And when you buck the establishment, it
has an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said Monday that he supported Bradley partly because the
Clinton-Gore administration had wavered on gay rights. Homosexuals
around the nation were stung, for example, by Clinton's ``don't-ask
don't-tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said that homosexuals should be allowed to serve
openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks have been in line with Bradley's, except that he
said in a recent debate that he would require any appointee to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree in advance to let gays serve openly
in the military, but later backtracked and said he would not
require such a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Gay voters could play a bigger role than ever in this
presidential primary season, especially in California and New York,
which have large gay populations. The New York primary also is
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki said his disappointment with the Clinton-Gore
administration stems partly from what he perceives as its poor
treatment of Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki expressed concern for the way Asian-American donors were
treated in the wake of the investigation into campaign fund raising
by the Democratic National Committee on behalf of President Clinton
and Gore in 1996. The DNC was accused of illegally taking money
from Asian-American sources that originated overseas. Donors with
Asian surnames complained about receiving calls from the FBI, Yaki
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been singled out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki, who has been active in other Democratic campaigns, pledged
to work around the state, and especially to drum up support for
Bradley, in Asian-American communities.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick, who is working on
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein's re-election campaign, doubts that
Bradley would have much of an edge with gay and Asian-American
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has support from Asian-Americans, too, Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the San Francisco Bay Area, gay supervisors and state
legislators have endorsed both Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, an adviser to the California Democratic Party,
wasn't willing to discuss either candidate's possible strengths and
weaknesses in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fight is with the Republicans,'' Mulholland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Bradley contest for California will take shape after
Iowa's caucus and New Hampshire's primary, when the candidates will
have five weeks to campaign here and in New York and 13 other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore already has made more than 60 visits to California since
the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To win the party nomination, ``Al Gore has got to stop Bill
Bradley in California,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior
associate at the School for Politics and Economics at Claremont
Graduate University in Claremont, Calif. ``He not only has to win;
he has to win decisively.''

&HT;     OLD WORLD MEETS THE NEW IN AOL, TIME WARNER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, the editors of Time magazine chose Amazon.com
founder Jeff Bezos as their ``Person of the Year,'' symbolizing the
emergence of electronic commerce and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   American Online Chairman Steve Case might have been the better
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Case, who announced on Monday that AOL was buying the magazine
and its parent company, Time Warner Inc., for $166 billion,
embodies the newfound muscle of the Internet, a burgeoning industry
that has gone from society sideline to mainstream media in less
than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, no longer the outsiders looking in, now
possess the money and clout to compete with America's biggest media
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important measure of the industry,'' said Dan Case,
the older brother of the AOL chairman, who is president and chief
executive officer of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist investment company in San
Francisco. ``Every company now has to have a corporate development
strategy in relation to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial deal, which is pending regulatory approval, would
rank as the largest corporate merger ever. AOL has agreed to buy
Time Warner in a stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's ascendance is a classic tale of U.S. entrepreneurship,
similar in scope to the railroad barons and automobile pioneers who
transformed America's landscape in the first half of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In just over a decade, AOL has built the most successful
Internet company in the nation, attracting 22 million users while
actually generating a profit, a rare feat in the world of
electronic business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it acquired Netscape Communications Corp. and
MovieFone, and it bought on-line competitor CompuServe the year
before that.
</P>
<P>
   Based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., AOL has more
than four times the net profit of Time Warner, earning $762 million
in the fiscal year that ended June 30, even though Time Warner's
annual revenues of $26.8 billion dwarf AOL's $4.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, New York-based Time Warner also was formed just over
10 years ago, emerging from the 1989 marriage of the Warner Bros.
movie studio to Time Inc. But the two companies that make up Time
Warner have a much older history.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. was created in 1923 by two college students, Henry
Luce and Briton Hadden, who launched a weekly news magazine called
Time. The company went on to become a standard-bearer for American
journalism, publishing famed titles such as Life magazine, Sports
Illustrated and People.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., also founded in 1923, produced the world's first
feature-length film with sound, ``The Jazz Singer,'' in 1927. Other
Warner film classics have included ``Casablanca'' in 1942 and
``Rebel Without a Cause'' in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner bought cable company TBS in 1996, which added the
all-news channel CNN to the company's cable lineup of HBO and
Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, AOL Time Warner's brands would include AOL,
CompuServe, CNN, Time, Netscape, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, HBO,
Warner Music Group, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, People,
Entertainment Weekly and Looney Tunes.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That kind of consumer reach has Wall Street drooling, as traders
immediately started speculating on more megamergers, driving tech
and media stocks higher in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a merger that transforms the landscape of media to
form an extremely valuable and respected company, in our view,''
said Susan Walker White, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. in San Francisco. ``It's a great fit for both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   White sees the deal as a boon to AOL on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be able to build new opportunities for
entertainment, commerce and communications with the extensive
content of Time Warner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, she said, ``It provides AOL with a broadband
(Internet access) strategy. Time Warner has the second-largest
cable system in the country, with access to 20 percent of all U.S.
households.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband access to the Internet refers to the high-speed
delivery of Internet content, enabling providers such as AOL to
offer data-intensive media like audio and video. One method of
delivering broadband service is through cable television lines.
</P>
<P>
   With those synergies in place, said White, others will want to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, when you see a large merger like this it gets other
companies looking at their positions,'' White said. ``I've heard
Disney, Yahoo, companies like that, are thinking about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet portal Yahoo, with a market capitalization of $115
billion, is a prime candidate for a similar deal, being one of the
few Internet companies with enough money to even consider buying a
media giant. The problem is, there aren't enough Time Warners to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult to find a company as
well-diversified as Time Warner,'' said David Cole, a media analyst
with The Cole Group, a print publishing consulting firm based in
Daly City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the companies are oriented toward print, broadcast or
film. Finding a company that has a foot in those worlds, not to
mention cable, is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, it looks like Steve Case, along with Time Warner chief
executive Gerald Levin, have made an enviable and timely proposal,
combining the household names of old media with the household
pipelines of new media.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of deals are where the new economy meets the
Fortune 100,'' said Dan Case, whose own company went through a
merger last year, linking up with Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously ahead of the puck again,'' Dan Case said of his
brother. ``As a brother, I'm incredibly proud of him.''

I AM NOT, NOT, NOT A SPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: X. works for a large telecommunications-equipment maker
gathering intelligence about its competitors. At trade shows, he
tries to wheedle information from rival companies' employees
without letting them know who he is. He agreed to be interviewed on
condition that neither he nor his employer be identified. )

<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't use the word ``spy.'' When someone says ``spy,'' it
connotes illegal activity. We don't trespass; we don't lie; we
don't do anything illegal. I am a competitive intelligence
professional. I don't go up to someone and say, ``I'm a spy.'' I
say, ``I am a market analyst.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd be surprised what people will tell you. I don't interview
people; I elicit information from them by casual but boring
conversation. People remember the first thing you say and the last
thing you say. They generally forget the rest.
</P>
<P>
   They also remember questions better, so I don't ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   I bring the conversation closer and closer to the things that I
am interested in. It's very much about thinking on your feet. If a
person says, ``I am director of new product development,'' an alarm
goes off in my head. I have to keep the conversation general until
I figure out what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   I might try to goad someone into bragging. Or I might provide an
opportunity for someone to correct me. I might say: ``You never
have enough people when you are working. How many guys you got in
your department? 10? 11?'' And he might say, ``Oh no, we've got
15.'' What good is that number? Well, we can estimate the total
manufacturing costs based on the number of people working in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   How much can you get from one guy in one conversation? Not a
lot. But you get a little every time and they start to think they
can tell you more. It's really important to remember names. What
better way to introduce yourself than to walk up to someone with a
beer and say hello?
</P>
<P>
   I target mail room guys and secretaries. They are called the
invisible people because they have a great deal of information, are
generally underappreciated and no one ever asks their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are also great to target. The reason? What is a
scientist's motto? Free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   A great place to overhear information is the men's room. I heard
about one guy who dresses up like an attendant and hands out towels
to listen to people's conversations. Another place where people
keep talking is on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   If I know the guys I'm targeting will figure out who I am, I
have to pay somebody else to go after them. Recently, two
consultants I hired found out where executives from a rival company
played golf and arranged a foursome. The executives blabbed
throughout the round, and I got the information I needed.
</P>
<P>
   I also do what any good reporter does: look at published
articles and brokers' reports and the like and build a picture of
what a company is doing.

IT'S A SWEET WINTER'S COMPANION. IT'S, YES, A TURNIP .
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the idea of eating with the seasons has gained
currency among American cooks. Those who find this concept a little
precious might just be tempted to ask, ``And what are people in
cold climates supposed to eat all winter? Rutabagas?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. And turnips.
</P>
<P>
   For winter eating, these root vegetables taste far better than
their reputations suggest. Tinged with an undeniable bitterness,
they also have an underlying sweetness, which comes out when they
are cooked. Add the pleasantly starchy texture, and you have a
complex and satisfying flavor experience.
</P>
<P>
   But so unhip have the turnip and the rutabaga become that many
cooks don't know one from the other. This is not a huge problem,
since they are so closely related (in the same branch of the
crucifer family) that they can be used virtually interchangeably.
It is the rutabaga, though, that is more responsible for the somber
aura that surrounds these roots.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the rutabaga are murky. It showed up in Europe in
the Middle Ages and is thought to be a cross between a turnip and a
squash or a cabbage. Although it most likely comes from the region
around Bohemia, it is often called a Swede because the name comes
from a Swedish word meaning ``thick root.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the size of a large grapefruit, round, with a pronounced
neck, yellow or brownish skin and purple accents. Its yellow flesh
is smoother and denser than that of turnips.
</P>
<P>
   But what really distinguishes the rutabaga is that it is the
ultimate survivor. It is easy to grow, it can be left in the ground
long after the first frost without suffering any damage, and it
stores well in root cellars for months. This means it is plentiful
and available at any time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, during World War II's scarcities, rutabagas became
a staple in much of Europe. They were eaten as vegetables, turned
into jam, and even dried and ground to make ersatz coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, they have been reminders of privation. Shoved to the
back of the root cellar, their emergence on the dinner table is to
many a harbinger of hard times.
</P>
<P>
   The turnip has a more illustrious history. Turnips were
cultivated 4,000 years ago in China and the Middle East, regions
where they are still valued. They were popular in Europe during the
days of the Roman Empire and up to the 18th century, when the more
versatile potato became the root vegetable of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Turnips range from golf-ball to tennis-ball size, which is the
most common. Commercial varieties usually have white flesh covered
with a thin white skin topped with a purple ring. They are
available year-round, but their peak season begins in October and
extends through February.
</P>
<P>
   Our partiality to these vegetables was spurred by a so-called
turnip that is actually the descendant of a rutabaga. Called a
white Macumber turnip, it is a cross between a rutabaga and a
radish. It is grown only in the region around the town of Westport,
on the southern coast of Massachusetts, where it is as revered as
the Vidalia onion is in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Every year around Christmas, a group of Westport farmers,
business people and fishing folk gather for a covered-dish
celebration, to which each person brings a favorite turnip
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Having attended these dinners for 10 years, we realized the
potential of all turnips and rutabagas. They are excellent mashed
with a little garlic, nutmeg, milk and parsley, roasted with a
little coriander or made into soups. Taking a cue from the Middle
East, we also found that they make great pickles and can be used in
refreshing salads.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the turnip or the rutabaga has a sweeter and less
aggressive flavor is a matter of contention among aficionados. In
our experience, it varies from root to root, so they can be
substituted freely for one another in most recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are slight differences. Rutabagas take longer to cook
because of their denser texture, while the more open-grained
texture of turnips results in silkier soups and purees.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping, look for vegetables that are firm, heavy for
their size and smooth skinned, with no brown or soft spots or
splits or cracks in the skin. Avoid turnips that are wrinkled; they
have lost moisture and will have a rather spongy texture.
</P>
<P>
   Except for very young turnips from your own garden or a roadside
stand, turnips should be peeled before eating. Rutabagas, which
have a thicker skin and are often sold with a wax coating to keep
their moisture from evaporating, should always be peeled. We prefer
a paring knife, rather than a vegetable peeler, since the dry outer
skin that covers the moist, crisp interior can sometimes be thick.
</P>
<P>
   Even after you start cooking with these homely roots, you may
not feel inspired to write an ode to the rutabaga, as Frank Zappa
did in ``Call Any Vegetable,'' his classic 1969 opus. But you'll
definitely have some great, satisfying side dishes.

   SIMPLE ROAST TURNIPS OR RUTABAGAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes &QL;

   1{ pounds turnips (about 8 to 10 small or 5 to 6 medium) or
rutabagas (1 medium)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   \ cup roughly chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lemon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground coriander. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Peel the turnips or rutabagas
and cut them into large chunks. Place in a roasting pan, add the
olive oil and salt and pepper to taste, and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place the pan in the oven and roast, stirring or shaking the
pan every 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender but not
mushy, about 35 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the vegetables from the oven, and place them in a
large bowl. Add the olive oil, garlic, parsley, lemon juice and
coriander, and toss well. Adjust the seasonings to taste, and serve
while hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CREAM OF TURNIP SOUP WITH HONEY-SAGE-RAISIN BUTTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, peeled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2{ to 3 pounds (about 2 large or 4 small) turnips, peeled and in
bite-size chunks
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon minced fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon roughly chopped dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup light cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced chives (optional). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large stockpot, heat the vegetable oil over medium high
heat until it is hot but not smoking. Add the onions, and saute,
stirring frequently, until they are transparent, 7 to 9 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the chicken stock, turn the heat to high, and bring to a
boil. Add the turnip chunks, then reduce the heat to low, and
simmer gently, uncovered, until the turnip chunks are very tender
and easily broken apart when they are pierced with a fork, about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the turnips are simmering, cream the butter in a small
bowl with a wooden spoon or a fork. Add the sage, honey, raisins
and salt and pepper to taste, and mix until they are of a uniform
consistency. Place on a piece of wax paper, roll up in the paper
into a tube shape, and place in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   4. When the turnips are tender, remove them from the heat, and
puree in small batches, if necessary, in a food processor or
blender. Pour the pureed mixture back into the stockpot, season
with salt and pepper to taste, and place back on the stove over low
heat. Add the cream, and cook, stirring frequently, until it is
just heated through, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Adjust the seasonings to taste, and pour the soup into bowls.
Place a small slice of the flavored butter on top of each serving,
sprinkle with chopped chives if desired, and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings. &QL;

LET SHRIMP TALK THEIR HEADS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is the second of eight columns by Tadashi Ono, the chef
at Sono in Manhattan. They are being written with Mark Bittman.) 
 (DW) 
 By TADASHI ONO 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether to peel shrimp before cooking them is debated
endlessly among cooks, but even when the nonpeelers win, the shrimp
are almost always shelled before they are eaten. The shells, like
fish skin, are tough when raw, almost rubbery, and usually
virtually inedible. Yet proper cooking can make them crisp and
delicious, a lot like soft-shell crab.
</P>
<P>
   My technique is similar to methods common in China, where shrimp
are often stir-fried in their shells, and Japan, where unpeeled
shrimp are simply salted and grilled.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the shrimp's flavor is actually contained in the
head and shell, and the head is full of delicious, buttery juices.
The French know this, since they use the heads and shells to make
sauces. I set out to create a dish in which the shrimp do the
talking, one that features the head and shell as much as the meat
and expands on the classic Asian treatments. So, I liberally season
the shrimp with salt, then sear them in olive oil in a very hot
skillet so they are extremely crisp. I then toss in shishitoh
peppers, a Japanese variety with just a touch of heat but good
flavor. (Long frying peppers are a fine substitute.) Chili paste
and orange and lemon zest add the last flash of flavor. I serve
this dish unaccompanied as an appetizer, but it would make a fine
main course, followed by a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Good shrimp are essential, but they needn't be live or even
``fresh'' (as opposed to frozen). I believe good frozen shrimp are
often better, because freezing techniques have become so good. Look
for frozen Pacific white shrimp, sold with the heads on in
Chinatown and some local markets.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is not complicated; the most time-consuming step is
trimming off the tops of the heads, the sharp end of the tails and
the spiny legs. If you like, you can also extract the veins with a
toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of ``soft shell'' shrimp is how an uncomplicated
preparation presents them in a nearly natural state, demonstrating
their true complexity. Once you taste them, you will understand
shrimp in a way you never did before.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-GRILLED SHRIMP WITH PEPPERS Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 pounds shrimp, shells and heads on
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   20 shishitoh peppers, or 8 long green frying peppers, cut into
1-inch pieces, seeds removed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili paste, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   Juice of a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a small, sharp knife, cut off the top of each shrimp's
head, including the eyes. Also cut away the sharp end of the tail
and the tough front legs. If you like, use a toothpick or needle to
poke through the middle hinge of the shell, just below the top of
each shrimp's back, and slowly draw the toothpick out to remove the
vein. Sprinkle shrimp liberally with salt.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat a large skillet over high heat for a minute. Add oil
and, when it smokes, the shrimp. Cook, undisturbed, for a minute,
or until underside is crisp and pink. Turn and cook a minute
longer, and add peppers. With heat still high, cook, stirring
occasionally, for a minute or two more.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add chili paste, then zests, and cook 30 seconds, stirring.
Turn off heat, sprinkle with lemon juice and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

PINOT NOIR, NOT SO FICKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mysterious, elusive, seductive. ...'' It's more the
description of a femme fatale than a wine, but pinot noir seems to
bring out the big lug in writers. They bemoan the grape as ``fickle
and hard to tame'' while salivating over its ``fleshy, supple and
round'' flavors.
</P>
<P>
   What makes pinot noir so tantalizing is that despite its
potential for greatness, it often disappoints. Even going to
Burgundy, the original source of pinot noir, and spending a fortune
for a famous label is no guarantee. And the hope of duplicating the
alluring Burgundy has led many wineries down the path to perdition.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, the rise of pinot noirs has been a success
story. Winemakers were finally able to identify areas where the
grape could flourish, including the Russian River Valley in Sonoma
County, the Carneros region of the Napa Valley and the Central
Coast, a huge tract stretching from the San Francisco Bay to Santa
Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   In this last area, some of the best pinot noirs are made in
Santa Barbara County, where the cool coastal climate in the Santa
Maria Valley and Santa Ynez Valley favors Burgundian grapes. These
pinot noirs tend to be fruity, rich and surprisingly sweet; yet,
the best are nuanced, offering flavors from bright berry to deep
chocolate and licorice.
</P>
<P>
   More than many other wines, pinot noirs change in the glass. The
wine, which on first sip seems harsh, can open up and taste
completely different in 15 minutes, then evolve yet again.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive pinot noirs, which can run upwards of $50,
tend to come from single vineyards. Midrange bottles come from a
single county or valley, while budget bottles use grapes from a
wider region. These six choices are listed in order of preference. &QL;

   SANFORD, SANTA BARBARA COUNTY, 1997 $23

`NEXT FRIDAY' STARTS FUNNY, BUT LEADS INTO WEAK END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It opens with such raucous, irreverent, bad-taste hilarity _ the
opening titles are a riot _ that it's a shame this sequel to the
1995 crossover hit, ``Friday,'' runs out of steam half-way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' picks up where ``Friday'' left off, with Craig
(Ice Cube) finally knocking the local bully, the sadistic and
ominous giant Debo (Tommy ``Tiny'' Lister Jr.) off of his
neighborhood throne of terror and flat into jail.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debo's had four years in the slammer to fester and simmer
over all the imagined wrongs wrought by Craig and he's decided to
break out and seek some serious revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed in South Central, however. Craig is still
unemployed and living at home. When his father (John Witherspoon)
catches wind of Debo's escape, he hauls Craig out to his Uncle
Earl's (Don ``DC'' Curry) suburban dream house in Rancho Cucamonga,
which was purchased with lottery winnings. He gauges the boy will
be safe in the sticks but little does he know that the idle and
idyll of the 'burbs really are the devil's playthings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 'hood is quiet and serene next to the wild times
brewing in this wacked-out, upscale cul-de-sac. Craig's
not-so-bright cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) is in trouble with his
ex-girlfriend. The tax man is about to auction off Earl's fancy
digs and Craig's new aunt has her eye (and just about everything
else) on her nephew. Even the neighbors are a trio of bad-news
Hispanic brothers just out of jail, but they also happen to have a
gorgeous baby sister who makes Craig's knees go weak.
</P>
<P>
   Anything and everything does happen in this ``stranger in a
strange land'' story. It's just too bad there's nowhere for ``Next
Friday'' to go after such a promising start. Ice Cube wrote the
script, as well as starring in and producing the film, and he
suffers from the typical screenwriter problem of not knowing where
to go after his initial set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, a cast of old and new actors labor to plumb the
comedic material but after a time they're stranded and relegated to
pratfalls, S&AMP;M sex, scatological jokes and ethnic stereotyping. The
first ``Friday'' at least had the energetic zaniness of Chris
Tucker to keep things zipping along. ``Next Friday,'' after its
midway mark, just lumbers until it fizzles out.
</P>
<P>
   Next Friday. Directed by Steve Carr. Written by Ice Cube. Cast:
Ice Cube, Mike Epps, Don ``DC'' Curry, John Witherspoon. New Line
Cinema. 93 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-

(ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif.) PERK DU JOUR: A WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beth Ciabattari, the human resources manager at Wanger Asset
Management in Chicago, had to take a deep breath before listing the
contents of the office kitchen. ``They have one wall filled with
about 25 bins and they have everything from Ruffles potato chips to
Fritos to Snickers to Twix bars to sunflower seeds,'' she said, her
voice growing heavier with each calorie mentioned. ``They just do
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' she said, adding, as if to lighten the load,
``they do have granola bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the imported spring water, the sodas, the
tuna-fish-and-cracker lunch packs, or that it is all free to
employees whenever they have the urge to munch.
</P>
<P>
   At many fast companies, and even some slower ones, the office
kitchen has evolved from a nook with a Microfridge and a handful of
plastic forks to a temple of snacking where every indulgence is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that a loaded kitchen on each floor entices
employees to work longer days, said Richard Federico, a work-life
consultant with the Segal Co., an employee benefits consulting firm
based in New York. He tells of one large company where employees
who worked late were treated to free popcorn in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then somebody new in Human Resources did a cost-benefit
analysis and found out it cost $100 a month for the free popcorn,''
he said. That was a pittance in the grand scheme of things, but
someone thought it costly enough to do away with the treat. Sure
enough, as soon as the popcorn was cut, people stopped working
late. The moral, Federico said, is that ``the return on investment
for a bag of popcorn is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn is but an appetizer. The Commercial Property Services
Co. in Santa Clara, Calif., furnishes its kitchen with a gas stove,
toasters and blenders, as well as the raw ingredients for meals. It
is part of one employee's job to replenish the stocks of cold cuts,
frozen meats, vegetables, even herbs. On nice days, employees roll
the barbecue out onto the patio. ``If you came in in the morning
and wanted to have scrambled eggs and ham and bacon, sure,'' said
Ray Baker, the chief operating officer for the 50-employee company.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen doubles as a meeting room, with one wall covered in
whiteboard. ``It's all wired so we can plug projectors and
computers in, and do projections onto the wall,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, centralized kitchens that can double as conference
rooms have become standard, largely as a result of the rising cost
of office space, said Steven Basque, a principal with ADD Inc., a
design firm in Boston. His company recently moved into a new
building with a central kitchen area that employees must walk
though to get to other offices, making it a hub of activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become in the office almost what the family room is
residentially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Bertholdt, 59, a shareholder services representative at
Wanger, can confirm that. ``We gravitate toward the kitchen,'' she
said. When she has a question for a fellow employee, particularly
one too consumed with work to be disturbed at his desk, she might
wait to catch him during snack time. ``You'll go in there and
you'll see an analyst or a portfolio manager, and you can pick
their brain a little bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bertholdt sees the bounty as an expression of corporate
affection, but even so blames the free potato chips for the five
pounds she gained when she joined the company three years ago. ``I
eat all day,'' she said. ``I'm so full by the time I leave here, I
don't want to think about food any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Free food is an important symbolic benefit, even for employees
who can demand hefty salaries. Michael Weissenburger, 31, said he
was pleasantly surprised when he joined GTE Internetworking, a
division of the GTE Corp., as manager for international finance two
years ago and saw the kitchen setups at the Burlington, Mass.,
campus. You know your office cares when the division president
periodically makes rounds with an ice cream cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first job, we had a very small, dank, dark kitchenette
with an old microwave and no refrigerator,'' he said. ``Here, there
is always food around. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Abundant pantries are no passing fad, either. Bob Gaudreau, a
founder of the Regus Business Centre Corp., which leases fully
furnished offices around the world, says he has redesigned the
kitchen areas into ``beautiful piazzas'' where employees can rub
elbows while taking a snack break. (No fountains or pigeons, but
there is cappuccino.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the refrigerators and microwaves, he added
televisions and iMac computers. ``So many people are working from
home or just sitting in a cubicle, and the social aspect of work,
that's the part that people seem to be looking for,'' Gaudreau
said. ``People who literally sit across from each other might
literally never speak to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even accounting firms and law firms, which tend to be more
conservative in their decor, are jazzing up their kitchens,
dazzling employees and clients with stainless steel appliances,
glass-front refrigerators and granite countertops. ``Those kinds of
things are the amenities that people like to show potential hires _
that they've got this funky space, with Starbucks coffee and
designer teas,'' Basque said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, things are a bit more low-brow. After all, doggie
bags are one reason for the popularity of office kitchens; Harry
Balzer, a vice president at NPD Group Inc., a market research firm,
estimates that 2.5 billion helpings of leftovers were carted out of
restaurants last year, and that a good number ended up in office
refrigerators. So, undoubtedly, did many pastries, sandwiches and
catered goodies that companies lay out at office meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People find that they don't even need to go out and get
anything,'' Basque said. ``It just seems like there's always food
in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Ciabattari says, employees have logged only joking
complaints about the sinful variety of treats that Wanger doles
out. The company recently expanded its culinary repertory to
include carrots and celery. But more fattening comestibles prevail.
``Sometimes I wish we had to slip a quarter in a slot,'' she said.
``It would make you think before you grab something.''

GIFT-WRAPPED IN GREEN

</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one dish most non-Koreans associate with
Korean food, it is bulgogi, grilled marinated short ribs. At my
favorite restaurant on 32nd Street, the meat is stripped off the
bone, marinated in a soy-based sauce and grilled at the table; the
hot meat is then wrapped in cool lettuce and eaten with the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The process is thoroughly enjoyable, but I've recently been
disappointed by the meat at ``my'' restaurant. It is sliced so thin
that it dries out as it cooks (for tenderness, short ribs have to
be cooked either very fast or long and slow, by braising). Worse,
the marinade seems to have been tamed over the years, and it is no
longer strong enough for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I thought the grill in the table was such an
important part of the dish that I never even tried to make it at
home. I finally realized, though, that the time the meat spends
over the coals _ one to five minutes depending on the heat _ might
be long enough to add the mental image of wood flavor, but
certainly not the reality.
</P>
<P>
   So, in what might be described as typical American arrogance, I
set about reinventing this traditional Korean dish. The marinade
was easy, because I have asked in enough Korean restaurants to know
its makeup _ a potent mix of soy, garlic, scallions, ginger and,
the secret ingredient, sugar. Some cooks also add ground sesame
seeds, but I found that made the marinade too pasty.
</P>
<P>
   The slicing and the cooking gave me a few problems. I suspect
restaurants freeze the meat, then shave it wafer thin on a
deli-style slicer. But I realized that this extreme thinness was
counterproductive. Thicker, hand-cut slices will brown on the
outside before they are overcooked on the inside. The meat can be
easily cut off the bone, then sliced across the grain with a sharp
knife. It's even easier if you freeze the meat for 30 minutes or so
to firm it up.
</P>
<P>
   Grilling is the best way to cook this meat; a couple of minutes
over a very hot fire is ideal. But a stove-top grill or very hot
iron skillet works nearly as well, as long as you have a powerful
exhaust fan to suck out the smoke. A good broiler will also work
fine. Finally, if you set an iron skillet or heavy roasting pan in
an oven heated to its maximum temperature, then throw the meat in,
the meat will sear and cook through in a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you cook the meat, do not sacrifice internal
juices for external browning. It's better to serve lightly browned
but moist meat than tough, overcooked meat with a lovely crust.
</P>
<P>
   Romaine lettuce is the most common wrap for this meat, although
I do what most restaurants do and offer rice with it as well.
Restaurants also provide a small bowl of soy sauce and a dish of
ground bean paste (a strong soy condiment) for garnishing the meat
or dipping the lettuce. I don't think either is necessary, but
certainly it's no added work to offer them at the table.
</P>

BEEF WRAPPED IN LETTUCE LEAVES, KOREAN STYLE  &QL; 
Time: at least 45 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 pounds short ribs
</P>
<P>
   { cup roughly chopped trimmed scallions, shallot or onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peeled and roughly chopped ginger
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   16 to 24 romaine lettuce leaves, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   Additional soy sauce or bean paste (available at Asian markets),
optional.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Use a sharp knife to strip meat from ribs; it will come off
easily and in one piece (reserve bones and any meat that adheres to
them for stock). If time allows, freeze meat for 30 minutes to make
slicing easier.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine scallions, ginger, garlic, sugar, pepper, soy sauce
and { cup water in blender, and puree until very smooth. Slice meat
[ to \ inch thick. Toss with scallion mixture, and marinate for 15
minutes to 2 hours. Preheat a grill or broiler, or preheat oven to
its maximum temperature, and put a heavy roasting pan in it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove meat from marinade, and grill, broil or roast just
until done, no more than a couple of minutes a side; it's nice if
the meat is browned outside and rare inside, but it's imperative
that it not be overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   4. To eat, wrap a piece or two of meat in a torn piece of
lettuce; garnish with a drop or two of soy sauce or bean paste if
you like.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

TNN SERIES `18 WHEELS' IS LIKE A LONG HAUL DOWN A BAD ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to measure viewer reaction to ``18 Wheels of Justice''
might be to track the sales of Kenworth T2000 trucks. If the 7-ton
rigs start flying off the Paccar lot without benefit of hefty
rebates or 2.9 APR financing, then TNN's first original drama
series will be the hottest thing at the cable channel since the
Statler Brothers brought three-part harmony to Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Even if sales of the Seattle-made trucks are sluggish, the show
is another obvious sign of the gradual makeover of TNN from
country-music channel to schlockmonger intent on attracting male
viewers to witless programming.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that even bad drama series cost enormous sums to
produce _ hundreds of thousands of dollars per episode _ it's
remarkable that the writing in ``18 Wheels of Justice'' is so
been-there, done-that tedious.
</P>
<P>
   All you need know is that Stu Segall (``Silk Stalkings,''
``Pensacola: Wings of Gold'') and Richard C. Okie (``Pacific
Blue'') are the powers behind ``18 Wheels of Justice'' to
understand where we're headed. Though polished to a high sheen,
``18 Wheels'' looks like much of the syndicated stuff that fills
the schedules of local stations on weekend afternoons and late
evenings: unimaginative plot points interspersed with stupidly
violent scenes designed to keep stunt people employed.
</P>
<P>
   If you approach ``18 Wheels of Justice'' expecting as much, you
shouldn't be disappointed. But once the new-car smell wears off,
it's hard to imagine coming back week after week just to see a guy
use a big honkin' truck to keep the baddies at bay.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely you'll be returning for G. Gordon Liddy's
acting, either. With all the depth of a cue card, the Watergate
criminal-turned-radio host plays the villain of this piece, a
ruthless crime lord named Jacob Calder who continues to dispense
terror from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The man who put him there, special agent Michael Cates, is
Calder's target, which leads Cates to change his name to Chance
Bowman and enter a special witness-protection program. This is
where things get hinky. As part of his cover, Bowman becomes a
long-haul trucker with a spiffy vehicle that puts James Bond's cars
to shame. But if he doesn't want to be noticed, one might wonder
why Bowman is crossing the country in a monster truck that has
every accessory except hot and cold running boards. (It does have
cup holders with hot/cold temperature controls.)
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Vanous, the hunky guy from the Diet Coke commercial _ the
one where a bare-chested construction worker got an office full of
women to go ga-ga _ plays our hero with a range of emotion not
detectable on conventional instrumentation. Case in point: At the
beginning of the premiere episode, something happens that would
make any human being collapse in a puddle of grief. Vanous'
response is more akin to one's reaction to a plate of bad clams.
</P>
<P>
   In his trek from town to town, Bowman gets help from his boss,
Burton Hardesty (Billy Dee Williams), but not much original wisdom.
When Bowman contemplates revenge against his nemesis, Hardesty
says: ``If you cross that line, you don't beat them, you become one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Thornhill provides the feminine touch _ what, you expected
an all-male revue? _ as Bowman's mechanic/tech wiz, Cie Baxter, who
is smart, sensitive and interested in keeping her charge from
becoming road kill.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``18 Wheels of Justice'' is that Bowman and his
truck help out the little people across America while staying a
step ahead of the bogeyman, but the reality is that his cargo of
uninspired programming is perishable, and it wilted a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   18 Wheels of Justice. One-hour action-drama series about a
Justice Department agent who goes undercover as a long-haul trucker
to avoid retribution from a crime boss he put behind bars. Starring
Lucky Vanous, Lisa Thornhill, Billy Dee Williams and G. Gordon
Liddy. Season premiere Wednesday on TNN. Parental guideline rating:
TV-G.

POACHED EGGS WITH DATE CHORIZO PASTE: SURPRISE FROM A 3-STAR
TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My summer vacation in Spain seems long ago now, but a dish I had
at lunch at Restaurante Arzak in San Sebastian has remained a
beguiling, delicious memory.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd dish. A poached egg with two sauces, it seemed to
belong more in a diner than in a restaurant that holds three
Michelin stars.
</P>
<P>
   Its basic flavors _ eggs, chorizo and bread _ are humble ones,
familiar in Spanish cooking. Each was finessed so that the whole
dish sparkled.
</P>
<P>
   The egg was poached in a plastic bag along with goose fat and
truffle oil. The bread was reduced to crumbs and mixed with ham and
olive oil, then spooned onto the plate like a relish next to the
egg. The chorizo was pureed with dates, which tamed its sharp edge
and gave the resulting orange paste a deep, tantalizing sweetness.
It was spread in a line by the egg.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the poached egg preparation was easy to replicate. I
substituted butter for goose fat and, following a hint from the
chef, Juan Arzak, let the eggs sit in little plastic-wrapped
packages of truffle oil and salt for two days before poaching them.
The paste was a matter of balancing acidity and sweetness, adding a
touch of vinegar and sugar syrup as I pureed it in the food
processor.
</P>
<P>
   The bread sauce would have been easy enough to make but would
turn this dish into a project. Serving toasted country bread
sprinkled with great olive oil on the side, I decided, would be a
fine alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A single taste will tell you that it is the date paste that
makes this dish. If you really want to take a shortcut, a little
dab of it rubbed on a hard-boiled egg is not a terrible thing. In
fact, it is a fantastic discovery, worth traveling to Spain to
learn.
</P>
<P>
   POACHED EGGS WITH DATE CHORIZO PASTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 2 days' refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   Butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   White truffle oil
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   { cup medjool dates, pitted and coarsely chopped (available at
stores with a good dried fruit selection)
</P>
<P>
   } cup chorizo, skinned and cut into thin slices
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, with more for the bread
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   6 thick slices rustic country bread.
</P>
<P>
   1. Two days before serving, prepare eggs. For each egg, lay out
a 12-inch square of plastic wrap. Generously grease it with butter,
and then sprinkle with truffle oil and salt. Crack an egg in center
of each, then quickly collect edges of plastic wrap. Twist ends of
wrap tightly, and tie with string. Refrigerate two days.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small pan, combine sugar with \ cup water and bring to a
boil. Let cool. Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine dates,
chorizo, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the sugar syrup. Season with
pepper. Puree until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl with a
spatula. The mixture should be thick but not stiff. Pulse in the
olive oil, and then water (a tablespoon at a time) as needed.
Taste, and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   3. Put paste on a large square of cheesecloth. Wrap in a ball,
and squeeze with your hands over a bowl. (This is messy and
time-consuming, but makes the resulting paste markedly smoother and
strains out any chewy pieces of chorizo.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Bring a medium pan of water to a simmer. Using a slotted
spoon, gently add egg packages to water. Simmer 3{ minutes, for a
runny yolk. Meanwhile, toast bread.
</P>
<P>
   5. When eggs are done, transfer packages to paper towels to
drain. Place one package on each of six plates, and cut open at top
with scissors. Discard plastic wrap, making sure all the oil stays
on the plate. Sprinkle egg with coarse salt. Spoon a little
date-chorizo paste around it. Sprinkle olive oil on toast, and
serve with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 appetizer servings.

 OOP'S AN EGGSHELL  
 WHAT MAKES EGGS VEGETARIAN?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife insists that there is no reason to refrigerate
butter. Plain as day the package says, ``Keep refrigerated.'' Who's
right? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Butter, especially sweet butter with no salt added to
preserve it, keeps longer in the refrigerator. Some people,
however, like to leave butter at room temperature to make it easy
to spread.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise might be to leave most of your butter in the
refrigerator and keep a few tablespoons out (in a covered dish) for
immediate use. If you have left the butter out for more than a few
days, smell it before using to make sure it has not turned rancid. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bake brownies until they are still a little gooey in the
middle. But when I cut them out of the pan, the top crust always
cracks and tears. What is the best method for making and cutting
brownies so that they look as nice as they taste?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several tricks for neatly cutting brownies and
other gooey bar cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure to cool the brownies completely before cutting them.
You can even place them in the freezer for a few minutes to make
slicing them into bars easier.
</P>
<P>
   For especially gooey brownies, use a knife that's been run under
hot water and wipe it off in between each cut.
</P>
<P>
   Larger brownies with a few cracks around the edges look much
neater than smaller brownies, where the cracks will take up a large
proportion of the surface area. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many calories are in wine, and how do they compare with
those in beer and liquor?
</P>
<P>
   A. Table wines, containing less than 15 percent alcohol, have
about 110 to 150 calories a glass, depending upon the style and
sweetness of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with the 150 calories you get on average from a
12-ounce bottle of pilsner or lager beer.
</P>
<P>
   A one-ounce shot of 80-proof liquor has 65 calories. Cocktails
made with juices, sugar, soda and other mixers will have more
calories than plain shots of liquor. A gin and tonic made with four
ounces of tonic to one ounce of gin, for example, has about 115
calories. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that if you drop a shard of eggshell into a
mixture you should use a larger piece of eggshell to scoop it up? I
have heard that the shard will gravitate to the larger piece like a
flea to a dog.
</P>
<P>
   A. This is just a culinary old wives' tale. In fact, Linda
Braun, the consumer service director of the American Egg Board,
warns against this practice, since there is a minute chance that
the egg shell might contain traces of salmonella. The best solution
is to fish the piece out with a clean utensil. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are eggs labeled vegetarian? Is there a difference in
the nutritional value or taste of these eggs vs. regular ones?
</P>
<P>
   A. Vegetarian eggs are laid by hens given only feed that
contains none of the meat products sometimes used. The standard mix
of corn and soybeans fed to laying hens often contains calcium to
strengthen the eggshells, which can be in the form of bone meal,
fish meal, ground oyster shells or limestone. Chicken feed may also
contain powdered beef for added protein.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetarian label refers only to the feed, but the
Agriculture Department does not disallow it for eggs from
free-range chickens.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of taste and nutrition, though, vegetarian eggs are the
same as other eggs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My English wife asks why we put waxed paper in tins with our
homemade cookies. It doesn't seem to make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some people place wax paper in between layers of cookies to
keep them from sticking to each other. You don't need to do this
with firm cookies, like chocolate chip or shortbread. But gooey or

`ESSENTIALS OF COOKING': A COOKING SCHOOL IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an inherent flaw in the way many people learn to cook.
They learn by practicing recipes. But as any professional cook will
tell you, cooking is about techniques, not recipes. And once you
master the basic techniques, you can not only cook almost anything,
but also cook it well.
</P>
<P>
   James Peterson, the author of award-winning cookbooks like
``Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making'' (John Wiley &AMP;
Sons, 1998), took this idea and made a book of it. ``Essentials of
Cooking'' (Artisan, $40) describes 250 cooking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   There is a critical difference between this book and others that
teach technique, like ``Le Cordon Bleu at Home'' and Jacques
Pepin's ``Technique.'' Though Peterson was once a restaurant chef,
he is now a home cook, and he approaches the subject like one. He
does not show five ways to truss a chicken or how to make veal
demiglace. He teaches an easy and proper way to tie chicken and
lays out the key steps for a basic, useful and flavorful broth.
</P>
<P>
   All the pictures were taken in Peterson's Brooklyn kitchen. By
him. The photography is particularly good and a strength of the
book. Many times, instructional books with pictures leave out
important steps. When showing how to crush garlic, for instance,
they might reduce the technique to three steps, when it needs four
to be clear. Peterson shows five, the last depicting the flat side
of a knife drawn across the chopped clove.
</P>
<P>
   In a book that depends on detailed instruction, these pictures
make all the difference. A section on poaching small fish contains
10 shots, from seasoning the raw fish to spooning sauce on at the
end. The pictures for rolling pasta are so clear that you can see
what the texture of the dough should be. The text is also soaked
with the fine detail that only an experienced, observant cook would
know to include.
</P>
<P>
   To find where to insert a knife to separate a chicken leg and
thigh, Peterson writes simply, ``The joint is farther into the
drumstick than you might think.'' It may sound vague, but it is
just what you need to master this simple task.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with basic techniques like trimming vegetables
and making broths, then moves on to specific subjects like fish and
shellfish and poultry and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   As I paged through, I found myself comparing what I knew against
his instructions and discovered new tricks. I learned, for
instance, to soak scored chestnuts in water for 15 minutes before
roasting, for easier peeling; to bake a coconut in the oven for a
few minutes after draining the milk from it to help separate the
shell from the skin; and to sprinkle basil leaves with a little
olive oil before cutting them so they don't turn black.
</P>
<P>
   I disagreed with Peterson, too. His technique for coring apples
from quartered pieces is, in my opinion, less efficient and more
wasteful than scooping out the cores from halves with a melon
baller.
</P>
<P>
   But such reactions were healthy disagreement, not vehement
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite chapter is ``Working From Scratch.'' In it, he shows
how to bone a fish through its back and trim and prepare a rack of
lamb French style. These are skills that most slaves to packaged
food from the grocery store miss. These are also the skills that
help you understand the bigger picture. A well-boned fish will be
easier to eat. Knowing how to do these tasks (even if you don't do
them regularly) will make you a better cook.
</P>
<P>
   I wish Peterson had included a section, with photographs, on
toasting and grinding spices, or on herbs. Many cooks do not know
what a sprig is and whether or not to strip the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   He also leaves out slow roasting and hardly mentions grains. He
could have omitted the outdated techniques of turning vegetables or
making bearnaise sauce in favor of making a duck confit or coffee
properly.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard for one book to cover all cooking techniques.
You might not be able to lift it. I hope Volume 2 is in the works.

 &HT;    BRITISH HISTORIAN ALLEGES ``CONSPIRACY'' TO SILENCE HIS
HOLOCAUST VIEWS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON, Jr. 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A maverick British historian testified Tuesday that a
book written by a professor at Atlanta's Emory University was part
of an international conspiracy to silence him and end his attempts
to challenge conventional understandings of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, who believes the Nazi campaign to exterminate Jews
has been greatly exaggerated, is suing Deborah Lipstadt and her
publisher Penguin Books for libel over assertions made about him in
her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory.'' They deny any libel.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt portrayed Irving as a prominent and dangerous
``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the familiar story of the
systematic murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis is untrue. She
also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and
falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening argument, Irving said the book is part of an
international effort to silence him because his research undermines
Jewish claims for compensation for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Lord, if we were to seek a title for this libel action, I
would venture to suggest 'Pictures at an Execution' _ my
execution,'' Irving said, addressing the wigged and robed judge
hearing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said he had counted on his writing to provide him money
to retire and a legacy for his four children. ''I have since 1996
seen one fearful publisher after another falling away from me,
declining to reprint my works, refusing to accept new commissions
and turning their backs on me,'' he said. ``In short, my pension
has vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the proceedings, Lipstadt sat silent at a table in
front of the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a navy-blue pin-striped suit, the articulate and
animated 62-year-old Irving read his remarks for more than two
hours in a cramped courtroom in the grand Royal Courts of Justice.
The self-taught historian rambled between sweeping assertions about
the damage done his reputation by what he characterized as an
international Jewish conspiracy, to detailed passages of private
notes of key Nazi leaders. He also shared a bizarre account of his
sneaking glass plates containing copies of Joseph Goebbels
handwritten diaries out of a Russian archive to London.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed the book's central point that he manipulated the
historic record to support his version of the Holocaust story. He
suggested that he may be guilty of being a ``rotten, lazy or
indolent'' historian, but not a dishonest one.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said that Lipstadt's use of the phrase ``Holocaust
denier'' to describe him has been deeply damaging. ``It is a poison
to which there is virtually no antidote,'' he said. ``It is like
being called a wife beater or a pedophile. It is enough for the
label to be attached, for the attachee to find himself designated
as a pariah, an outcast from normal society. It is a verbal Yellow
Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from being a 'Holocaust denier,' I have repeatedly drawn
attention to major aspects of the Holocaust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who said in a 1977 book that Hitler was unaware of the
mass slaughter of Jews until 1943, said the term ``Holocaust'' is
meaningless. ``The word 'Holocaust' is an artificial label commonly
attached to one of the greatest and still most unexplained
tragedies of this past century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Auschwitz was a slave labor camp but not death
camp. He argues that gas chambers at the camp were built after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   In response, lead defense attorney Richard Rampton, also in wig
and robe, attacked Irving directly. ``Mr. Irving calls himself an
historian,'' Rampton said. ``The truth is, however, that he is not
an historian at all, but a falsifier of history. To put it bluntly,
he is a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampton sought to support this assertion by detailing one
instance in which he said Irving misconstrued handwritten notes by
Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler to support his assertion that Hitler
ordered an end to the killing of Jews in 1941. Rampton read
translations of the notes that indicated only that Himmler ordered
that one trainload of Jews not be killed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Irving had, as he proudly announced, read the Himmler log
and he has very good German,'' Rampton said. ``One has to ask the
question: Does not this simple example condemn Mr. Irving as a liar
whose utterances about this awful episode in European history can
never be taken seriously?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also argued that Irving's statements during
appearances before ``radical right wing, neo-fascist, neo-Nazi
groups of people'' reveal something more about his motives.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1991 appearance in Canada, Rampton said, Irving harshly
disputed accepted versions of the Auschwitz story. ``It's baloney,
it's legend,'' Rampton quoted Irving as saying. ``I say quite
tastelessly, in fact, that more women died in the back seat of
Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas
chamber in Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is widely accepted that at least a million people died
at Auschwitz, Irving has argued that the number is closer to
100,000, and most fell victim to illness and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is being heard before a judge without a jury,
is expected to last three months. It is scheduled to continue
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, Lipstadt and Penguin books bear the burden
proving that statements about Irving contained in the book are
true.

FOX PROMISES RETURN TO ROOTS AFTER REALITY BITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You've seen the last of marauding grizzly
bears on Fox. But if a grizzly bear can maraud and tap dance at the
same time, Fox may still have a spot on its schedule for ``When
Entertaining Animals Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from Sandy Grushow, recently named chairman of
the Fox Television Entertainment Group to help the network turn
itself around from one of the most dismal free falls in memory.
Until recently, Grushow was head of 20th Century Fox Television,
the studio that has more shows on network TV than any other.
Problem is, a lot of those shows _ ``The Practice,'' ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' etc. _ are on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow Tuesday said Fox will be backing away from the cheesy
reality special, which he called a short-term ratings fix ``that
has come back to bite us on the behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've begun to see the dilution of our brand identity,''
Grushow said. He promised a recommitment to ``the principles that
brought us to the dance'': risk-taking entertainment that places a
premium on being different.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow and Doug Herzog, president of entertainment for Fox
Broadcasting Co., said the network won't abandon all reality
programming, but they said it will be focused on ``entertainment''
instead of ``blood 'n' guts shock value.''
</P>
<P>
   They also announced a long-term deal with producer David E.
Kelley, giving Fox first right of refusal on anything new from
Kelley's pen, and a single-series deal with ``ER'' and ``Jurassic
Park'' creator Michael Crichton.
</P>
<P>
   _If you don't count ``Malcom in the Middle,'' which Fox
actually unveiled last summer but didn't put on the schedule till
this week, the development slate is apparently so thin that Fox is
promoting only one new midseason series at the critics' winter
press tour in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   The series is called ``Titus,'' a half-hour comedy based on the
life of comedian Christopher Titus and his dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   It's eerily similar to NBC's ``Sammy,'' based on the
life-with-father recollections of comedian David Spade. But where
``Sammy'' is done in animation, ``Titus'' takes dead aim at
political correctness with an in-the-flesh production far more
risky than any cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Keach plays Titus' father, Ken, a drunk who's been married
to five different women, including a manic-depressive schizophrenic
who now resides in a mental institution or, as Ken puts it: ``She's
shacked up in the wacko basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes funny and often tasteless, ``Titus'' is the sort of
programming that Herzog says Fox needs to restore its reputation as
a risk-taking trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   _One show that was developed for Fox but ended up on The WB last
fall is ``Roswell,'' the love story/sci-fi drama about high school
kids coming of age in Roswell, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Jason Katims says he doesn't think the show
would have been much different had it aired on Fox, but when
critics visited the ``Roswell'' set Monday he did seemed relieved
to be on a smaller network that gives its shows more time to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a huge hit,'' Katims said, ``but we're doing well.
The WB has been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of ``Roswell'' is its loyalty to the legend of a UFO
crashing in the New Mexico desert in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy even pervades the props in the Crashdown Cafe,
where two of the principal characters work as waitresses. The
Tabasco sauce, a particular favorite of Roswell's alien element, is
real, and the menu board has the usual number of greasy-spoon
misspellings, such as ``Lunar Lunch Speacials'' and
``Extraterestral Taco Salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not all is as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The lemon meringue pie looks enticing, but it's made of rubber.

&HT;     WALSH PLANS TO STAY AS GM OF 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ While complaining he was the victim of age
discrimination and undue criticism of his job performance, Bill
Walsh reiterated his commitment to the San Francisco 49ers for at
least one more year and said he expects the team to win in 2000
with Jeff Garcia as quarterback playing as he did at the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview on Monday, the 68-year-old general
manager said he sees better days ahead for the club, if a number of
factors fall in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win next year,'' Walsh said. ``We can come back. We
showed signs of it toward the end of this last year, when our
quarterback began to really improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that quarterback is no longer the team's priority in
the offseason. The priority is finding an impact player on defense,
either an end with pass rush skills or a linebacker with pass rush
skills. Listening to Walsh, the 49ers seem prepared to go into the
2000 season with Garcia as their starting quarterback, although an
attempt will be made to acquire another quarterback in the draft or
through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off his last five games he played very, very well,'' Walsh
said. ``I see quarterbacks in playoff games that I wouldn't trade
for Jeff. ... As we sit here, right this minute, if we have a
choice, I'd rather take my chance with Jeff and get a great
defensive player (in the draft).''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of what would be a 4-12 season, Walsh knew the
49ers were doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 weeks left in the season,'' he said. ``I called
Steve (Mariucci) aside. I said, `Steve, hate to tell you this, but
we just don't have the players to win, so you're in for a rough
ride. But Steve, you're going to be Coach of
</P>
<P>
   the Year in the year 2000.' That's my honest feeling, because we
will come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you we'll be a dynasty again overnight. But this
team will be successful next year, and I think a team we can be
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern for Walsh is the dreaded salary cap.
The 49ers are $24 million over the projected per-team cap of $61
million and have until March 1 to be in compliance. To help with
the slash-and-burn, Walsh said he is attempting to cut the salaries
of six veteran players while offering them incentives that are
technically referred to as ``unlikely to be earned'' and thus will
not count against next season's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Those players are quarterback Steve Young, wide receiver Jerry
Rice, center Chris Dalman, left guard Ray Brown, linebacker Ken
Norton and strong safety Tim McDonald. All have expressed a desire
to return in 2000 _ with assurances from the club that winning is
still the objective.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have targeted another group of players, less than 10,
for restructured contracts in which they would receive large
signing bonuses and modest salaries _ precisely the sort of
practice, under the departed Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark, that
landed the club in salary-cap hell in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a fantasy, that all the men would get
together that I'm speaking of and say, `Let's take the cut; let's
win next year.' In some cases it'll work and some it won't,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the incentive plan attractive is it's based on team
and individual performances from 1999. A five-win season in 2000
might be an incentive. For Rice, catching 68 passes could be an
incentive because he had 67 this season. Likewise, Young passing
for 450 yards because he had 446 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Young expressed no interest in the salary cap, saying
it was something the club dealt with as a matter of course. Walsh
offered a sharp rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's utterly naive,'' he said. ``First criticism I've ever had
of him and the last one. Utterly naive. Utterly naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's situation is complicated by his uncertain medical
condition. He was not cleared to play in the last 13 games of the
season because of the effects of a Sept. 27 concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said there would have to be a consensus of ``noted
neurologists'' clearing Young to play again before the 49ers
consider him part of their plans for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While Walsh said the six players are receptive to the incentive
plan, ``they are asking does this mean that we're trying to stay in
business or does this mean we want to win? The players we're
speaking of ... are not looking to finish out their careers 4-12 or
6-10. They want assurances from ownership, myself ... that we're in
this to win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought Walsh had lost it last year when he made a
series of questionable personnel moves, such as acquiring a thug,
Lawrence Phillips, and a retiree, Charles Haley, while letting the
cornerback positions degenerate into nothing more than a parade of
clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really weren't any decisions made here that did not
include everyone on the coaching staff, everyone in administration,
the owner,'' Walsh said. ``This hasn't been a matter of my
personally being a dictatorial general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, Walsh's age often accompanied his name in
discussions about his performance in his first year as the club's
general manager. He has two years remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a form of discrimination related to my age
being used,'' he said, noting that St. Louis Rams coach Dick
Vermeil is 63 and Indianapolis Colts coach Jim Mora is 64. ``I
think those who know me fairly well see that I'm physically fit and
have my wits about me. There is some value in my maturity and my
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Walsh said, ``At this stage of life, I don't need grief.
Why should I take it on?''
</P>
<P>
   In his perfect world, Walsh slashes the salary cap while
retaining his six core veterans; selects an impact defensive player
with the third pick in the draft (defensive end Courtney Brown and
linebacker LaVar Arrington, both of Penn State, are the highest
rated prospects); picks starting-caliber cornerbacks in the second
and third rounds; adds a quarterback through free agency (say, Jeff
Blake of Cincinnati) to compete with Garcia; rids the roster of
salary-cap burdens like Gabe Wilkins ($5.1 million), Winfred Tubbs
($3.3 million), Haley ($1.6 million), Marvin Washington ($1.175
million) and Darnell Walker ($775,000); and presides over the
resurrection of the franchise with a proprietary smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Then again ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be the Titanic right now, sitting on the bridge just
sailing along,'' he said.

   SCOTUS-STATES (Washington) _ Continuing its march in the
direction of states' rights, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
Congress lacked authority to bind state governments to the federal
law that bars discrimination against older workers. The national
policy against age discrimination in employment could not overcome
the states' sovereign immunity from suit in federal court, the 5-4
majority said in the first of five federalism rulings the court is
due to hand down during its current term. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-WOMEN (Washington) _ If the Supreme Court wanted to
underscore the constitutional vulnerability of the Violence Against
Women Act, it could hardly have done more than it did Tuesday. Not
only did the justices open their session by declaring, in a
separate case argued three months ago, that Congress lacked
authority to make the federal law against age discrimination
binding on the states. But then, during arguments on the
constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, members of the
same five-justice majority in the age discrimination case made
abundantly clear their deep skepticism about whether Congress had
an adequate basis for opening federal courts to suits by victims of
violence ``motivated by gender'' against their attackers. By Linda
Greenhouse.

soup with a straw. With their $165 billion merger deal, America
Online and Time Warner intend to start handing out ladles. Monday's
merger agreement between America Online, the No. 1 Internet
provider, and Time Warner, the media and cable television titan, is
already sending shock waves through every precinct of the
communications and media industries. But the most important impact
for consumers may be how it jump-starts the deployment of

<P>
   Q: I have been trying for years without success to find
recordings of Luisa Tetrazzini, an opera singer from perhaps the
'20s or '30s. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.J.R., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: The classical and jazz retailer CD Choice sells seven
Tetrazzini releases, including a $74.68 five-CD collection titled
``Complete Recordings 1903-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Tetrazzini CDs include ``Luisa Tetrazzini Sings Italian
Opera (1907-14),'' ``Prima Voce'' and ``Italian and French Arias.''
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (800) 648-2224 or visit the Web site
www.cdchoice.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tetrazzini, an Italian soprano who performed for more than 40
years, lived from 1871 to 1940. In 1910, she performed a free
Christmas Eve concert before 250,000 people in San Francisco at
Kearny and Market streets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to '50/'60s heartthrob Jimmy Clanton?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D., Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The 61-year-old singer has started performing again in recent
years, including performances at Casino Rouge in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   Clanton, a native of Baton Rouge, had several hit records from
1958 to 1962 such as ``Just a Dream,'' ``Go, Jimmy, Go'' and
``Venus in Blue Jeans.'' He also starred in the movies ``Go,
Johnny, Go!'' and ``Teenage Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the Beatles and other British musicians dried
up his record sales, Clanton told the Baton Rouge Advocate in 1998.
``Everything changed overnight, so I just kind of went into
hiding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Houston resident, Clanton ran an insurance agency and
produced nostalgia radio shows after his performing career stalled.
You can write to him at 4425 Kingwood Drive, Kingwood, TX 77339.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Hollywood director/producer Paul
Mazursky?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.L., Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Mazursky in care of International Creative
Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Mazursky, 69, directed ``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice,'' ``An
Unmarried Woman,'' ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' and 13 other
films. He recently portrayed Sela Ward's father on the TV series
``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mazursky wrote ``Show Me the Magic,'' a memoir about
his four-decade career in Hollywood.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO BOARD CONSIDERS LAWSUIT TO BLOCK NEWSPAPER
MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Board of Supervisors is asking the city
attorney to explore whether San Francisco should take legal action
to block the proposed merger of the city's two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like the city attorney to evaluate the chances of
success and the costs,'' Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano
said Monday, when the board voted unanimously to consider action to
stop the merger of the San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said he wants to keep San Francisco a two-newspaper
city.
</P>
<P>
   The board action is in response to the Aug. 6 announcement by
the Hearst Corp., which owns the afternoon Examiner, that it would
purchase the morning Chronicle and seek a buyer for the Examiner.
To date, no qualified buyer has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   If a buyer is not found, the New York-based Hearst has said it
plans to merge the Examiner and the morning Chronicle, a division
of the Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice must approve the deal. A decision is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials promised staff members they would not lose
their jobs. Still, not all of the unions have signed off on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the supervisors, Denis Mosgofian, president
of Local 4, which represents some 300 people who work the presses
that print the Examiner and the Chronicle, said there is
disagreement among the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Local 4, he said, has ``concerns at many levels. In my union,
we're concerned about jobs.'' The other concern is losing a
newspaper and a diverse voice and forum for news and opinion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is not only do we need these living wage
newspaper jobs, but we need two newspapers,'' Mosgofian said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Carlson, a unionized driver for the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency _ the joint production and business arm of the two
papers _ also voiced fear, and urged the supervisors to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 200 (drivers') jobs, jobs lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Cuthberson, who heads the Conference of Newspaper
Unions, the umbrella group of the newspapers' unions, and who
serves as executive officer of the Northern California MediaWorkers
Union, said in an interview that he doesn't support litigation, or
any other measures that would stop the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the unions _ all the big ones _ are not in
favor of suing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the inevitability of the sale, we felt (the Hearst
Corp.'s pledge) represents the best deal for us in terms of
preserving the maximum number of jobs and keeping our contracts in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote stops short of endorsing a lawsuit, but does
put contemplation of litigation on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano called the board's vote ``the first step'' toward suing.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Louise Renne, who has final say on whether the
city files a lawsuit, would not comment on whether she would take
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Examiner and Hearst would not comment
on the board's action.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice and the state attorney general
also are looking into the proposed merger. Ammiano said that if one
or both of them file suit, the city could decide to file an brief
in support.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors last year passed a separate resolution
calling on state Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the San
Francisco district attorney to investigate the proposed Chronicle
sale for possible antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspapers have been operating under a federally
approved Joint Operating Agreement since 1965. Under the agreement,
the Examiner and Chronicle maintain separate news operations but
jointly operate all production, advertising and circulation. The
two companies share revenues and expenses 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. has interests in publishing, broadcasting,
syndication and the Internet. It owns daily newspapers in Albany,
N.Y.; Edwardsville, Ill.; Bad Axe and Midland, Mich.; Seattle; and
in the Texas cities of Beaumont, Houston, Laredo, Midland,
Plainview and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing owns several television stations as well as
the Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Worcester, Mass., and the Bloomington
Pantagraph in Illinois.

GUIDED TOUR OF HISTORIC SITES OFFERS VOICES FROM AREA'S FRONTIER
PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driving the back roads of Palo Pinto County, there are times
when you can look out through the dense cedars that darken the
hillsides and guess at what early frontier life was like in this
area of North Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the open pastures, you can almost see Oliver Loving and
Charles Goodnight inspecting their cattle, forming herds to trail
to distant markets.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear them talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can. You can hear them talk. Beginning this spring, the
Mineral Wells Area Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Historical
Commission will offer travelers a chance to hear about the history
of this area as if from the characters of Loving and Goodnight,
early ranchers C.L. ``Kit'' Carter and C.C. Slaughter, plus others.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can take a bus trip through the area, or pop a tape or
compact disc into their car's audio system and get a private
driving tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea really started with the Texas Forts Trail,'' said Bob
Jenkins, president of the Mineral Wells Area Chamber. ``They wanted
to know how we could tie in with them. I'm from Weatherford and
I've always been interested in Parker County history, so I began
thinking about our history here in Palo Pinto.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Texas Forts Trail people had in mind. Lisa
Sanders, who directs the trail's promotion, said the whole idea was
to get the Palo Pinto folks to look at their own historic sites to
determine how they could work together.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Forts Trail is one of 10 tourism trails established by the
state Transportation Department, and one of two trails under the
guidance of the Texas Historical Commission. The other is the Texas
Independence Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The new Palo Pinto guided tour will include Fort Richardson near
Jacksboro, and Fort Belknap south of Newcastle. Neither is in Palo
Pinto County, but both figured heavily in the county's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began to map this thing out, I called one of our local
historians, Bob Bellamy, and we took off on a drive,'' Jenkins
said. ``We kept driving and this guy never shut up. He kept telling
us this is where the old stage line went, here's where Cynthia Ann
Parker was recaptured; it went on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Staggered by the amount of information he had to absorb, Jenkins
drove the route again, this time mapping the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out we had about eight hours of some of the most
intriguing history in the state,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   A script of the trip was prepared and a dozen actors were hired
to do the voices of Goodnight, Loving and several other historical
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Two inaugural trips reserved for local dignitaries, historians
and tourism officials are scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have the program open to the public by the first of
April,'' Jenkins said. ``We're calling this one our `northern'
tour, and we are already starting plans for a `southern' tour as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said the southern route will include the coal mines of
Thurber and information on the oil fields that produced the big
Ranger boom.

TAKE DOWN THE FLAG AND PUT THE PAST TO REST

 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Following the recent presidential debate in their state, a group
of South Carolina voters filed a complaint with the Justice
Department that the Republican Party there has violated the Voting
Rights Act.
 &HT;    The complaint charged that the South Carolina Republican Party
had closed or consolidated polling places in black districts while
polls in white precincts remained open, leaving African-Americans
to travel some distance to cast their ballots.
 &HT;    This is, of course, the same Republican Party that continues to
fly the Confederate flag above the South Carolina state house to
honor their southern heritageeven in the face of a controversial
NAACP boycott against the state.
 &HT;    During the Republican debate, all the presidential candidates
sidestepped the flag issue by calling it a ``local concern'' or
affirming the valor of the Confederate war dead. Not one Republican
candidate said it was wrong.
 &HT;    Call it politics or cowardice, either way it is the same. The
bravery of Confederate soldiers is not the issue; many young
southern men proved themselves honorable during battle.
 &HT;    But their cause was wrong. They spent their valor on a cause
most contemporary Americans find reprehensible -- the defense of
slavery and the division of the nation.
 &HT;    By flying the Confederate flag atop the state house, South
Carolina is not honoring individual soldiers. It is proclaiming its
allegiance to a myth called ``southern heritage.''
 &HT;    According to this myth, the Old South was an enchanted place
where white folks and black folks got along real well until a bunch
of rabble-rousing abolitionists and northern politicians messed
things up. The Confederate flag celebrates a Gone-With-the-Wind
version of history: pretty belles, elegant gentlemen, and happy
darkies. It celebrates a South where everybody knew his or her
place. And for black people, that place was slavery.
 &HT;    The Confederate flag has not always flown over the state house.
South Carolina raised it in 1962 to commemorate the centennial of
the Civil War. It is no coincidence that this was also the height
of the Civil Rights movement.
 &HT;    Once raised, South Carolina saidin effectthat its
``traditional'' values of segregation would be maintained against
any national effort to enforce the rights of black Americans.
Although other southern states did the same, South Carolina is the
only one still flying the flag of resistance. And the
GOP-controlled House will vote to keep it that way.
 &HT;    This is not a ``local'' issue. The rest of the nation is rightly
offended by such blatant racism. Because we live in a union, no
single state has the right to undermine and insult black Americans.
 &HT;    Face it boys, the Confederacy lost. The flag under which your
brave soldiers fought represents a ``way of life'' rejected by the
rest of us. We are sorry you suffered, but we are not sorry that
your old ``way of life'' is disappearing.
 &HT;    Most southerners have adjusted to this. Even where I live, in
Memphis, people do not glorify the Confederacy. Memphians live with
the uneasy, dark knowledge that they were wrong. And today, the
city celebrates Martin Luther King Day with more enthusiasm than I
have ever witnessed in a community.
 &HT;    My native-southern neighbors and friends take pride in the long,
hard road they and their forebears have walked from the Civil War
to Civil Rights and beyond.
 &HT;    Race relations are not perfect here, but they were a lot worse
in the recent past. Many people of good faith are working to make
sure the Old South of racial hatred does not rise again.
 &HT;    And it is not just Memphisbut it is Atlanta and Birmingham and
Richmond and Charlotte as well.
 &HT;    If the South Carolina Republican Party has violated the Voting
Rights Act as charged, it certainly puts that Confederate flag in
perspective. Perhaps they are telling the truth: South Carolina
does fly the flag to defend southern heritage-- the same heritage
that systematically stripped African-Americans of their rights for
four centuries.
 &HT;    Sadly, lovely South Carolina has allowed itself to become the
Old South's Last Stand for a host of kooky historical revisionists,
religious right-types, neo-Confederates and racist rednecks.
 &HT;    With the dawn of a new century, it is time to put the past to
rest. Take down the flag, fellows. The Civil War is over; the Civil
Rights movement is even over. Whether you want to admit it or not,
that flag stands for what most of us hope is truly a Lost Cause--
racial oppression.
 &HT;    Come join the rest of the union, diverse and pluralistic as it
is. Believe it or not, many of us are finding we like it that way.

LIBEL TRIAL LINKED TO BOOK ON HOLOCAUST DENIAL OPENS IN LONDON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ga., Germany, Canada, Italy, Austria and Australia. )   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``I have no intentions, and neither is it the purpose
of this trial, to refight World War II.'' So declared the
revisionist historian David Irving in his impassioned opening
statement in High Court here Wednesday, first day of the libel case
he hopes will salvage his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, World War II is exactly what the case _ Irving vs.
Penguin Books Ltd. and Lipstadt _ is about.
</P>
<P>
   Irving _ who has said, among other things, that Hitler did not
approve the mass killing of Jews during the war and that Auschwitz
was merely a brutal labor camp with an unfortunately high death
rate _ is suing Deborah Lipstadt, author of ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,'' and her
British publisher, Penguin. His main claim is that his reputation
has been irrevocably damaged by the book's assertions that he is a
Holocaust denier who manipulates history to serve his own ends.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case about free speech and historical methods, and
about, peripherally, the magnitude and circumstances of the
Holocaust. It is being closely watched outside of Britain,
including the United States, where Ms. Lipstadt holds the Dorot
Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost inevitable that the major focus of the case will
be the crimes of the Holocaust, and whether they took place, and
how they're interpreted,'' said Efraim Zuroff, director of the
Israel office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem in an
interview. ``Any victory for Irving is a loss for historical
justice and a blow to the memory of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The case arises from Ms. Lipstadt's book, first published in the
United States in 1993, which examined Holocaust deniers and their
connections to a worldwide network of right-wing and neo-Nazi
groups. In the book, published in Britain by Penguin in 1994, Ms.
Lipstadt charged that Irving, the author of more than 30 books on
the Nazi era, was ``one of the most dangerous spokespersons for
Holocaust denial'' and a researcher who ``bends'' historical
evidence ``until it conforms with his ideological leanings and
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving brought the case, he said, because Ms. Lipstadt and
Penguin, supported by ``an organized international endeavor,'' set
about to destroy his career. As a result of their campaign against
him, he said, St. Martin's Press withdrew his 1996 biography of the
Nazi propagandist Josef Goebbels, which argues that Goebbels, not
Hitler, was behind the murder of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have since 1996 seen one fearful publisher after another
falling away from me, declining to reprint my works, refusing to
accept new commissions and turning their backs on me when I
approach,'' said Irving, who is representing himself in the case.
``Such is the nature of the odium that has been generated by the
waves of hatred recklessly propagated against me by the
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he is not a Holocaust denier, although he has
disputed standard accounts of how many people died in the war and
under what circumstances. ``No person in full command of his mental
faculties, and with even the slightest understanding of what
happened in World War II, can deny that the tragedy actually
happened, however much we dissident historians may wish to quibble
about the means, the scale, the dates and other minutiae,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving has had a curious career. Some of his works, especially
``Hitler's War'' (1977), have earned high praise from some
reviewers for the elegance of his writing and thoroughness of his
research.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, more and more questions have been raised
about his methods and ideology. In the United States, Publisher's
Weekly called his Goebbels biography ``repellant.'' In 1992, Irving
was convicted and fined by a court in Germany, where Holocaust
denial is a crime, after saying publicly that there were no gas
chambers at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his early reputation as a formidable historian,
Irving has confounded efforts to write him off as a simple
crackpot. The Nazi-era historian Gitta Sereny, who was sued by
Irving after she wrote that he was a ``brilliant propagandist''
made ``dangerous'' by his ``clever mixture of truth and untruth,''
said in an interview that it was hard for general readers to know
just how much he distorts the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rampton, the lawyer arguing on behalf of Ms. Lipstadt
and Penguin, charged that Irving was not a historian at all. ``To
put it bluntly, he is a liar,'' Rampton said in court.
</P>
<P>
   He said, as Irving himself had, that he did not intend to be
drawn into a debate about whether the Holocaust occurred, although
the question surely underlies the issue of whether Irving is a
Holocaust denier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the case is Irving's honesty and integrity as a
chronicler _ I shy away from the word `historian' _ of these
matters,'' Rampton said. ``By exposing that dangerous fraud in this
court, the defendants may properly be applauded for having
performed a significant public service, not just in this country,
but in all those places in the world were anti-Semitism is waiting
to be fed.''

WINE TALK: MEANWHILE, BACK IN ALSACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAYSERSBERG, France _ It had been raining for days. The low gray
clouds scudded in over the Vosges Mountains to the west and dumped
their sodden contents on the vineyards, then pushed eastward over
the Rhine and the Black Forest. It was a typical winter day in
Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   But at Domaine Weinbach, a handsome but understated chateau _
more a lived-in country house, actually _ just outside this
picture-book medieval town, all was warm and inviting. Here in the
paneled front parlor, with its heavy, dark furniture and fading
family photographs, Laurence Faller was pouring wine. For the last
seven years, she has been the winemaker at the domaine, one of
best-known wine estates in Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing regularly into the kitchen, she would reappear with
yet more bottles of her latest handiwork, the 1998 vintage. For
comparison purposes, there were a few 1997s, too, along with a
couple of 1999s, which were still mostly fermenting juice.
</P>
<P>
   Domaine Weinbach is famous not only for its wines, but also for
the fact that it is run entirely by women. Ms. Faller, 32, is
studying oenology at Beaune, in Burgundy, and has an MBA and a
degree in chemical engineering. Her sister, Catherine, who popped
in and out during our two-hour tasting, is 43 and handles sales and
marketing. Their mother, Colette, nominally the president and chief
executive, is better described as the dowager queen. Her age? ``Do
you have to publish that?'' Well, no, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   In the best tradition of French wine widows (Clicquot, Pommery,
Bollinger), she took charge on the death of her husband, Theo, in
1979, and transformed Domaine Weinbach into one of northeastern
France's most prominent wine names.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Faller was the winemaker; when he died, Colette took over
with the aid of a family friend, Jean Mercky. Photos show her in
boots and old sweaters, hard at work in the damp cellars. Laurence
joined the business in 1993; Catherine has always been in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Fallers have owned the property here since 1898, but in Alsace
they are relative newcomers. Families like the Trimbachs and Hugels
had been making wine in Alsace for 300 years when the Fallers,
tanners in Kaysersberg, got into the business.
</P>
<P>
   Domaine Weinbach was once part of church-owned vineyards.
Augustinian monks acquired the land in the ninth century. In 1612,
the Augustinians donated a part of their estates to Capucin
Franciscan friars, who built a convent and church on the land and
continued to develop its vineyards and farms. The ``home''
vineyard, surrounding the house and winery, is known as the Clos
des Capucins. Weinbach, in the Alsatian dialect, means ``wine
stream'' and is in fact the name of the small stream that flows
past the domaine on its way to the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   An inventory made by the Capucin friars in the 17th century
listed 14,000 to 15,000 vines, including muscat, ``riesselin''
(riesling) and ``chaselin'' (chasselas). The friars also raised
snails, and once a year gave a banquet for the local notables, at
which one of the important dishes was escargots au riesling. The
monks were ousted at the time of the French Revolution, and the
property passed through several hands before the Fallers acquired
it.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the estate consisted of the chateau and the 12-acre
vineyard within the estate walls, or clos. In the years since World
War II, the property has been expanded to about 150 acres, some of
it leased vineyards. As an owner-harvester, under French wine
regulations, the Domaine Weinbach is not allowed to buy grapes from
other growers. But the Fallers can and do rent vineyard property,
so long as they grow and harvest the grapes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like other French vineyard regions, the best Alsatian vineyards
are classified as grand cru, which translates _ badly _ into
``great growth,'' and as premier cru, or ``first growth.'' Domaine
Weinbach owns two grand cru parcels, about 40 acres on the
Schlossberg, a hilly slope just north of the domaine, and a piece
of an adjoining vineyard called the Furstentum. The Schlossberg
vines produce the domaine's best riesling; the Furstentum is the
source of its best gewuerztraminer. Other vineyards, including the
Altenbourg, which is unclassified, turn out pinot blanc, pinot gris
and muscat.
</P>
<P>
   The best grape in Alsace is the riesling; the best-known grape
is the gewuerztraminer. Gewuerztraminer produces a pungent, flowery
wine with a taste that some experts compare to litchi nuts. Even
when fermented completely dry, it can seem to be sweet, because of
the flowery bouquet. Riesling is Alsace's finest grape. It produces
wines that, at their best, display layers of complexity and nuance.
A good Alsatian riesling can last 15 years, and late-harvest
versions can live in superb condition for 30 to 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alsace produces a lot of wine, most of it indifferent stuff
that, fortunately, rarely makes it across the Atlantic. Michel
Bettane, the French critic who tasted with me at Domaine Weinbach,
contends that in Paris, even some of the grand cru wines are watery
and sugary. ``Less than 10 percent of Alsatian wines are
excellent,'' he said. ``The other 90 percent are sugar water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michel,'' Laurence Faller said, ``tends to get carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, too many of the best Alsatian
wines are being made in the sweet style. Some of the finest
producers are turning out wines that make fine aperitifs but very
poor companions for most meals. Even Ms. Faller acknowledged that
all of her 1998 gewuerztraminer could have qualified for the
vendange tardive, or late-harvest, designation. Late-harvest wines
are invariably much higher in sugar content than dry table wines.
</P>
<P>
   The total Domaine Weinbach production is about 15,000 cases,
about half of them exported to 23 countries. The United States is
the biggest customer. The domaine sells about a quarter of what it
makes to tourists, mostly German.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite Faller wines include the Riesling Schlossberg and
the Riesling Schlossberg Cuvee Ste. Catherine Cuvee du Centenaire,
both from 1997 and both in the $45-to-$65 price range. Perhaps the
best introduction to the Weinbach rieslings is the less subtle
Reserve Personnelle, which sells for around $24. The 1998 Riesling
Cuvee Ste. Catherine is a big, powerful wine that will last and
last. It hasn't been shipped yet, and it will be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The real gems in the Faller collection are the late-harvest
wines. The 1995 Pinot Gris Quintessence de Grains Nobles, Cuvee du
Centenaire, for example, is made from individually picked
late-harvest grapes and sells for around $300 a half bottle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to enjoy good Alsatian wine is with the
local cheese, Muenster. After our tasting, Colette Faller, elegant
in jewels and eyeliner, swept in to announce lunch. It was simple
fare, chicken and noodles and Muenster, accompanied by some of the
best Faller wines. Anyone who says no meal is complete without red
wine has never sat down to lunch in the big, warm kitchen at
Domaine Weinbach. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, winds gusted past 50 mph across portions of the
Northeast and Middle West in the wake of a potent storm over
eastern Canada. Wednesday, this storm will slowly weaken as it
reaches the Canadian Maritimes, causing winds to gradually lessen
over the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, gusts will locally exceed 40 mph in New England,
particularly during the morning. Generally dry weather will cover
much of the East with abundant sun expected along the Northeast and
Middle Atlantic seaboards as northwesterly winds dry on descent
from the Appalachians. Late Wednesday night and Thursday, an
accumulating snow is likely in portions of the Northeast as low
pressure forms near the Middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air associated with high pressure near the
Carolina coast will promote sunny skies and mild conditions over
the Southeast. Meanwhile, breezes from the southwest will direct
unseasonably warm air into Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley
where daytime readings will approach the record high of 80 degrees
in Dallas. Farther north, light snow will fall north of a weak
low-pressure system crossing the upper Mississippi Valley, though
only a modicum of accumulation is expected.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of Pacific moisture will continue to impact portions of
the Northwest and northern California Wednesday, causing mixed rain
and snow showers near the coast and heavy snow in the mountains.
Heavy snow will also fall near many of the west-facing mountain
slopes of the northern Rockies.

THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT FANNIE HURST'S LITERARY LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1960s, when Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett
performed the first of their bosom-buddy TV ``specials,'' there was
a mutually demeaning number in which Julie moaned about her
gentility and Carol loathed her commonness. It was a trade-off of
I'm-so-this-and-thats, and one of Burnett's deplorements was that
``I'm so Fannie Hurst.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Fannie Hurst is a kind of literary joke, fostered because
Fannie Hurst is a kind of name nicely set up to be a joke. But
Fannie Hurst (1889-1968) most certainly should not be a joke of any
kind. I've been spending time reading _ and reading about _ our
native authors who flourished in the 20th century's early decades.
I've concluded that the much-maligned Fannie Hurst rightly belongs
in the big league. She is regularly dismissed as a purveyor of
high-class soap opera, a genre her work easily transcends. Indeed,
she was far ahead of her time, as a social critic generally and as
a feminist in particular. Her fiction reflected her interests in
race relations, in music, the stage and the movies, and in the
status of women in those endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the earlier career phase, the critics were
forthrightly on her side. Surely the movies helped demean her.
During the medium's rhapsodized Golden Age, her novels were a
hit-yielding staple. The plight of the shop girl was probed in both
``Five and Ten'' (Marion Davies, Leslie Howard) and ``Mannequin''
(Joan Crawford, Spencer Tracy). ``Star Dust'' was a light pleasure
with the budding Linda Darnell. The first version of ``Imitation of
Life'' with Claudette Colbert was much praised, but the
race-related tale suggesting the origin of Aunt Jemima pancakes
belonged absolutely to the 1930s, and the 1959 remake with Lana
Turner was justifiably hooted. ``Humoresque,'' an early long story
about a violin prodigy, was initially filmed as a silent and was
fairly glorified by Clifford Odets in the 1946 edition with John
Garfield and Joan Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   However, Exhibit A in the Hurst canon definitely is ``Back
Street,'' filmed three times _ acclaimed in 1932 (Irene Dunne, John
Boles), politely applauded in 1941 (Margaret Sullavan, Charles
Boyer), and scorned in the ever-sudsier 1961 version (Susan
Hayward, John Gavin). The standard convention of soap opera finds
two strong, contrasted women in contention for a man who really
isn't worth it. ``Back Street,'' whose genuine tragedy was diluted
incrementally in the movie editions, is a variation on this theme.
Neither woman really is strong, although the man in question holds
little honor. Ray Schmidt, the beleaguered heroine, is a girl of
German extraction, first met in Cincinnati at the century's turn.
She and Walter Saxel fall in love, but Walter is Jewish and cannot
wed a gentile, so marries instead the colorless daughter of a great
Jewish banking family. (Herself Jewish, Hurst was born in St. Louis
but raised in Cincinnati, alert to the nuances of both the German
and Jewish communities there.) The spirited Ray literarily throws
away her life of great potential in dogged loving allegiance to
Walter, whom she meets regularly on the proverbial back street as
their affair spans three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Hurst's condemnation of Ray's life choices is conveyed
with well-measured compassion. Ray Schmidt has affinity with Alice
Adams in the Tarkington novel bearing that title and with Carol
Kennicott of Sinclair Lewis' ``Main Street.'' I'll contend that
``Back Street'' is an almost-great novel, on a par with ``Alice
Adams'' and far superior to ``Main Street.'' I wonder, though, if
it's still being read, as those others surely are. If ``Back
Street'' (1931) is the best of Hurst, it isn't an isolated jewel.
The impassioned ``Lumox,'' a critical success in 1923, focuses on a
Scandinavian servant girl and echoes Willa Cather's ``My Antonia.''
This author wrote ``contemporary'' stories that may shine anew as
period pieces, of which ``Imitation of Life'' may be the best
representative.
</P>
<P>
   The prolific Fannie Hurst filled eight short-story volumes with
entries of strong substance, but all are out of print and only
``Humoresque'' is anthologized. Perhaps her endurance will be only
as a joke, but during a recent preoccupation with fiction of our
passing century's first half, I've devised a distaff pecking order
that gathers Cather, Edith Wharton, Katherine Anne Porter, Ellen
Glasgow, Dorothy Parker, Betty Smith and Fannie Hurst, most
definitely.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Generous to a fault'' is a phrase surely invented
to describe Americans. When our philanthropic juices flow, it is
hard to shut them off. The objects of our affections alternate
between dazed gratitude and a creeping discomfort; indeed, the
weight of good deeds becomes often too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is why ``The Great Gatsby'' looks so small inside the
magnificent clothes the Metropolitan Opera has draped it in. John
Harbison's new opera has had the best that money can buy and that
talent can give. The sets are elegant, the dancing splendid, the
singers the best that they could be (well, almost).
</P>
<P>
   Presiding in the pit is James Levine. The ``Gatsby'' commission
is in one sense the house's gift to him. For his 25th anniversary
at the Met, Levine wanted a new opera, and he has gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to affix fault for this overblown adventure, if
indeed fault exists. The Met has behaved admirably from the start.
Although conscious of its reputation as a keeper of relics, it went
out in search of something new. Being an American opera house, it
quite properly wanted Americans to create it. Given these
guidelines, only the best would do, and quite possibly Harbison
stood a little higher than the American composers around him.
</P>
<P>
   He has been given the services of a splendid production team and
a backstage battalion of technicians that functions more smoothly
than any other known to me. This generosity has produced a modestly
attractive opera. ``Gatsby'' works diligently to be both original
and respectful of great literature, but it never grasps opera's
need for swift, ruthless narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison certainly understood that ``Gatsby'' the opera must
tell stories differently from ``Gatsby'' the F. Scott Fitzgerald
novel, but still he seems to have wanted it both ways. The result
is not bold invention but a kind of reactive timidity. His opera
spends too much time respecting a literary plot, and, musically,
that time tends to be slow and dull.
</P>
<P>
   A diligent search through the blizzard of press reports
preceding this December premiere makes it clear that we are dealing
with a talented, intelligent and eminently civilized composer,
though one not fully at home with opera.
</P>
<P>
   In a more perfect artistic world, ``The Great Gatsby'' would
have passed through more workshops than it evidently did and then
slipped quietly into the world (relatively quietly, that is) at
some regional opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Harbison would have changed his mind about a lot of
things, and the Met might have had a better piece. Maybe, on the
other hand, the composer likes his opera just the way it is. I am
only guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiring here is a second all-American construct: optimism. We
hope for the best and plan for the best. These are some of our most
helpful national traits, though sometimes they do us in.
</P>
<P>
   I think everyone _ musicians, singers, administrators and most
especially audience members _ had some doubt when this commission
was first announced, but we put it behind us and trotted out our
most optimistic thoughts. What a great story for an opera! What a
terrific opera house to play it in! What great singers: Dawn
Upshaw, Susan Graham, Dwayne Croft! What better conductor than
James Levine?
</P>
<P>
   One feels for a composer burdened by so many gifts. Thank-you
notes will not do. There is a need to respond in kind: the best in
return for the best. The public scrutiny, at least within the
relatively small classical music world, has been one long brutal
glare. Such pressures are perhaps not the kindnesses they were
meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   It is not much different down in Fort Worth, whose prosperous
citizens, brimming with good will, cannot seem to do enough for
contestants at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.
Some of this generosity is benign, if a little weird in its
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Families compete to take young performers into their homes, feed
and care for them, provide them with pianos and listen cheerfully
to their preparatory banging throughout the days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Less well-groomed candidates suddenly have new hairdos or emerge
from the Neiman Marcus department store with wardrobes fitting to
their musical talents. One family sent its orally challenged
Soviet-bloc candidate for a complete dental makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Fort Worth landscape is dotted with young
men and women from Eastern Europe who have gravitated back to the
city and settled there. Many had never known such kindness in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn winners, on the other hand, seem to suffer swift and
shortlived prominence. There was Radu Lupu, to be sure, but he
walked away from much of the Cliburn's munificence to go home and
study. Indeed, the average Cliburn gold medalist bears a striking
resemblance to Harbison at the Met, having been showered with gifts
of money and opportunity: cash awards, tours, recordings, managers
and, at the pinnacle, a Carnegie Hall recital.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it: Carnegie Hall, 2,800 seats, guaranteed press, the
chance to bring down fame with a single shot. Important managements
take over your career for a couple of years, even if they lose
long-term interest when the momentary celebrity dies down.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a connection between excessive generosity and the
ultimate obscurity into which pianists like Vladimir Viardo and
Jose Feghali have sunk? That is hard to demonstrate. But it is
interesting to note how many nonwinners at the Cliburn (Christian
Zacharias, Ian Hobson, Santiago Rodriguez) are doing rather well,
while winners (Andre-Michel Schub, Alexei Sultanov) are rarely
heard from.
</P>
<P>
   From the ashes of his failure to make the finals in 1993,
Frederic Chiu has reconstituted himself into a very salable piano
personality. Christopher Taylor, pretty nearly the only finalist
with the temerity not to choose Rachmaninoff for the concerto
finals that year (he played the Brahms B flat), keeps popping up
before the public with offbeat repertory. Yakov Kasman whose
reported histrionics brought him the silver medal in 1997,
resurfaced in New York not long ago with a winning sobriety of
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe getting less frees losers from the onus of getting too
much. There is a little more peace and quiet and the chance to grow
more slowly. Maybe winners are the music-business version of an
Aztec sacrifice, the sacramental victim who lives and dies in a
quick blaze of glory so that others can get on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn officials have recently espoused the idea that their
competition isn't about winning at all. It is a nice thought, but
it comes after a long string of loser-winners. What else are they
to say?
</P>
<P>
   Well, here is something they can do. Let there be a gold medal,
but send its bearer off to Terre Haute or Graz. Give less prize
money; a little hunger is not a bad thing. Discourage reviews at
least in major cities. An unknown 25-year-old pianist needs
Carnegie Hall like an inexperienced opera composer needs the Met.
Sometimes kindness kills.

CHILD'S SIMPLE LOGIC MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN JEWELRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a great new day in the new millennium, and I'm psyched.
</P>
<P>
   I've purchased this shiny new bracelet that's supposed to make
me healthier by ``activating'' my blood circulation and body
metabolism. I was surprised to learn that my circulation and
metabolism were inactive, but thank goodness there's a cure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lovely piece of jewelry made of white and yellow gold. It
also has copper in it and hidden magnets that regulate the magnetic
field in my body. I think there's some Hi-C and aloe vera mixed in
with it, too. Best of all, it only cost five bucks. What a deal!
</P>
<P>
   It's called a Tsunami bracelet, or Karma Sutra or something like
that, and it's supposed to promote well-being. It's just a
coincidence that soon after I got the bracelet, I came down with a
monsoon of a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it was even more awful than usual. It felt as if someone
had put a meat hook through my temples and hung me from a telephone
pole. I couldn't move without feeling excruciating pain. I took all
of my usual remedies but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   During the second day of my ordeal, my youngest son came into my
bedroom to check on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, are you still sick?'' he asked in a whisper, tiptoeing
to my side.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded as if he had screamed the question through a
bullhorn. I braced my head with my hands so that it would not
explode from the impact of his words, and I said, ``Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is still sick.''
</P>
<P>
   He scrutinized me awhile, then he said, ``Your hair looks funny.
Did you comb it today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is he here?'' I wondered. ``Why is that light on? Why is
he talking to me? Where is his father? Someone help me.''
</P>
<P>
   I squinted with my swollen eyelids until I could focus on his
precious little face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I said, ``Mommy's hair hurts. I can't comb it because
I will cry. Now run along and play with your brother. Come back
tomorrow, and I'll be all better.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a new bracelet?'' he asked, noticing the shiny bangle
on my wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I mumbled. ``It's supposed to make me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you get it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When did your headache start?''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Johnnie Cochran, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My headache started yesterday,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was all he said, but the inflection of his voice and the
look on his face clearly conveyed his thoughts. I've known this guy
his whole life, and it didn't take a map to figure out where he was
heading.
</P>
<P>
   I did my best imitation of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I give you the bracelet, will you turn that bright light
off and leave quietly?''
</P>
<P>
   He gave me a gentle hug and said, ``Yes, Mommy. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   I got better within hours of giving him that bracelet. I'm not
sure of the connection, but I'm going to order another one.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it doesn't cure me, I can always exchange it for a hug.

 &HT;    MEGA-MERGER MAY HASTEN A HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans yearning for an always-on high-speed
Internet link that makes watching live video or listening to music
a joy, the AOL-Time Warner merger brings the promised land closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about making a better world for people because we now
have the technology and the instruments to do that,'' Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin, who will be chief executive of the merged
company, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Levin joined Steve Case, who chairs America Online Inc. and who
will serve as chairman of the new colossus, in a series of upbeat
morning television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about whether AOL would continue to
press for giving Internet service providers easy access to
high-speed cable TV and telephone lines, the partners vowed to open
the vast Time Warner cable system to their online rivals. Such a
step would dramatically change the landscape for bringing
high-speed Internet connections to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   As the the world's largest media and entertainment company and
the nation's largest online company see it, the marketplace will
play a larger role and government regulators a smaller one as the
online and traditional media worlds converge. But just how this
will happen remains to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One question is what AOL will do with its control of the
pipe,'' said Mark Stevens, executive vice president of business
development at Excite(at)Home, a Time Warner cable rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe very strongly in an open Internet, letting
consumers access the full richness,'' Stevens added. ``AOL will
make its own decisions about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television services, such as DirectTV, are also
affected by the deal. They are now likely to expand their services
by gaining access to fresh content for what are already broadband
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the merger announcement, AOL made a $1.5 billion
investment in Hughes Electronics Corp., which owns of DirecTV.
Under that accord, Hughes and AOL have teamed up to develop a new
Internet TV product, dubbed AOL-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another complication is the potential role of competing
high-speed technologies, such as wireless links and the digital
subscriber lines (DSL), currently being championed by several large
phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, AOL began to offer Bell Atlantic's DSL access as a
premium upgrade for AOL members in the phone company's marketing
region. A Bell Atlantic spokeswoman said Tuesday that their
five-year contract will remain in force, even though AOL Time
Warner helped breed the cable modem technology.
</P>
<P>
   From its prior perch, AOL pressed for federal or local rules
that would require Time Warner and other cable-TV companies to open
their systems to rivals offering high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL has now backed away from the regulatory approach in
favor of having cable systems voluntarily commit to providing
access to their systems at market rates, leaving consumer advocates
wary.

 &HT;    MEGA-MERGER MAY HASTEN A HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans yearning for an always-on high-speed
Internet link that makes watching live video or listening to music
a joy, the AOL-Time Warner merger brings the promised land closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about making a better world for people because we now
have the technology and the instruments to do that,'' Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin, who will be chief executive of the merged
company, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Levin joined Steve Case, who chairs America Online Inc. and who
will serve as chairman of the new colossus, in a series of upbeat
morning television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about whether AOL would continue to
press for giving Internet service providers easy access to
high-speed cable TV and telephone lines, the partners vowed to open
the vast Time Warner cable system to their online rivals. Such a
step would dramatically change the landscape for bringing
high-speed Internet connections to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   As the the world's largest media and entertainment company and
the nation's largest online company see it, the marketplace will
play a larger role and government regulators a smaller one as the
online and traditional media worlds converge. But just how this
will happen remains to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One question is what AOL will do with its control of the
pipe,'' said Mark Stevens, executive vice president of business
development at Excite(at)Home, a Time Warner cable rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe very strongly in an open Internet, letting
consumers access the full richness,'' Stevens added. ``AOL will
make its own decisions about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television services, such as DirectTV, are also
affected by the deal. They are now likely to expand their services
by gaining access to fresh content for what are already broadband
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the merger announcement, AOL made a $1.5 billion
investment in Hughes Electronics Corp., which owns of DirecTV.
Under that accord, Hughes and AOL have teamed up to develop a new
Internet TV product, dubbed AOL-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another complication is the potential role of competing
high-speed technologies, such as wireless links and the digital
subscriber lines (DSL), currently being championed by several large
phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, AOL began to offer Bell Atlantic's DSL access as a
premium upgrade for AOL members in the phone company's marketing
region. A Bell Atlantic spokeswoman said Tuesday that their
five-year contract will remain in force, even though AOL Time
Warner helped breed the cable modem technology.
</P>
<P>
   From its prior perch, AOL pressed for federal or local rules
that would require Time Warner and other cable-TV companies to open
their systems to rivals offering high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL has now backed away from the regulatory approach in
favor of having cable systems voluntarily commit to providing
access to their systems at market rates, leaving consumer advocates
wary.
</P>
<P>
   David Butler, spokesman for Consumers Union, publisher of
Consumer Reports, said a broad alliance, minus AOL, will
nevertheless call on the Federal Communications Commission to
require open access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want long-term diversity of views and diversity of
choice, if we want good prices, we need public responsibility
rather than just wheeling and dealing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

Consumer Federation of America, Media Access Project, and Center
for Media Education.
</P>

beholden to a giant media-Internet dictatorship, even if it
promises to be a benevolent one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ One of television's unspoken rules is that hourlong
dramatic series dealing with race _ and dominated by black or
Hispanic actors _ do not appeal to white audiences. To prove their
case, network executives point to the handful of dramatic series
with minority casts that have failed.
</P>
<P>
   With television networks buffeted by criticism on the issue and
pledging to include more minority group members on their shows, a
high-profile hospital series called ``City of Angels'' is about to
test the premise. The show, which will start Sunday at 8 p.m. on
CBS, has a cast and _ perhaps without precedent on a drama _ a crew
and creative staff who are overwhelmingly black. The series centers
on a struggling county hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the support of the network, it had the clout of its
co-executive producer, Steven Bochco, who helped to create hit
series like ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``NYPD Blue.'' But for many
in the industry, such backing only ups the ante. A failure may well
be taken as a verdict on the prospects of dramas with a nonwhite
emphasis even if the story is not compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extra pressure? I don't think there's any way to escape it,''
said Blair Underwood, a star on ``City of Angels'' who is known to
many viewers for his prominent role on ``L.A. Law.'' ``We're
acutely aware of it. There's great pressure on this show to
succeed. And it will be highly scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   After its premiere, the series will move to a regular time slot,
Wednesday nights at 8, starting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Because white households make up 79 percent of the television
audience and black ones 12 percent, according to network analyses
of Nielsen Media Research, attracting a substantial white audience
will be crucial to the show's success.
</P>
<P>
   How large an audience it needs to succeed is to some extent a
judgment call for the network. Such highly promoted new dramas as
``West Wing'' and ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' have
generally attracted audiences of about 9 million households,
roughly 90 percent of them white. Television's top drama, ``ER'' on
NBC, attracts more than 18 million households, with more than 90
percent of them white, Nielsen figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Underwood, ``City of Angels'' includes
experienced actors like Vivica A. Fox, who has appeared in the
films ``Soul Food'' and ``Set It Off,'' and Michael Warren, who
played Officer Bobby Hill on ``Hill Street Blues.'' Despite past
successes, many black actors say they often have to wait months for
work because of a dearth of black roles. Warren, who said he was in
serious need of work when he won his ``City of Angels'' part,
described himself as overcome on his first day on the set.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``an amazing feeling,'' he said, ``to look across the
camera and see black, white, Hispanic and Asian actors, and to look
up at the rafters and see blacks and Hispanics doing jobs that
ordinarily went to white guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these guys were in positions of authority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine full-time cast members, seven are black and two are
white: Robert Morse, best remembered for his role in ``How to
Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' on Broadway, plays the
chairman of the hospital board of supervisors, and Phil Buckman a
first-year resident. At Bochco's insistence, about 70 percent of
the crew and staff members are black, Hispanic or female.
</P>
<P>
   The show's characters are a varied lot. Some are hard-edged or
streetwise, some upper class and Ivy League-educated. Underwood
seems to dominate the show as the deeply caring and handsome
physician who spends most of his time performing surgery on the
desperately ill and dealing with his sometimes difficult and
inexperienced staff of young doctors. There is also a past love
affair gone sour between the Underwood and Fox characters.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco and Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS
Television, said the series went into development before the NAACP
denounced the television networks six months ago and threatened
viewer boycotts. The organization cited a near-absence of minority
actors on the 26 new fall comedy and drama series on NBC, CBS, ABC
and Fox. Many of the networks soon began revamping shows, among
them NBC's ``West Wing,'' and hastily included black characters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week NBC and ABC signed agreements with the NAACP to employ
more black writers and to establish internships and scholarships
for black youths. Hispanic representatives and others were angry at
the NAACP for not including them in the agreement, but have since
made amends.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco, who created ``City of Angels'' with Paris Barclay, an
Emmy Award-winning director of ``NYPD Blue'' who is black, and
Nicholas Wootton, an ``NYPD Blue'' writer, said he was convinced
that previous dramatic series with mostly minority actors had
failed because they were family dramas dealing with the black
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstream white audiences aren't particularly comfortable
with that,'' Bochco said. ``The feeling was that they were being
taken to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco created one of the earlier mostly black dramas, ``Paris''
(not named for Barclay) on CBS, in which James Earl Jones played an
erudite police captain who taught criminology at night. The show
lasted less than four months during the 1979-80 season. Other shows
with black leads have included ``Fortune Dane'' on ABC in 1986,
with Carl Weathers as a San Francisco police officer, and ``Under
One Roof'' on CBS in 1995, in which Jones played a widowed Seattle
police officer who shared his home with his extended black family.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bochco said, he and his partners have created a drama
series that generally seeks to avoid addressing racial issues
directly and focuses instead on the life-and-death issues facing
doctors at a struggling hospital in a poor urban area. That most of
the doctors, staff and patients are minority characters is both
obvious and ignored, but the confluence of race, poverty and
medical extremis is the show's leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated failure of hourlong dramatic series with minority
casts contrasts with the success of many half-hour comedy series
with black characters, like ``The Cosby Show,'' ``The Jeffersons,''
``Sanford and Son'' and ``A Different World.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brooks, co-author of The Complete Directory to Prime-Time
Network and Cable TV Shows (Ballantine Books), said that some of
the dramas, as well as shows like the animated comedy ``The PJ's,''
about a housing project, floundered because they may have seemed
``exclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other groups felt uncomfortable watching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco said: ``How do you get people to watch a really terrific
black drama? You don't make it about the experience of being black.
You make it a really compelling drama, whether it's about cops,
doctors or lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of one's ethnicity is secondary to the necessity of
treating the sick,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On the set in Culver City, Ms. Fox said: ``We don't need to
pound you over the head. That turns off viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco said that ``Paris'' may have failed partly because white
audiences were unaccustomed to black characters in positions of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white audiences are sharply divided in their viewing
tastes, except for ``NFL Monday Night Football'' on ABC, ``ER'' on
NBC and ``60 Minutes'' on CBS, which attract large numbers of each.
The top shows for white households are ``ER,'' followed by
``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``NFL Monday Night Football.'' ``Sixty
Minutes'' is ranked No. 5. Among black households, the No. 1 show
is ``The Parkers,'' a comedy series on UPN, followed by ``NFL
Monday Night Football'' and ``Moesha,'' also on UPN. ``Sixty
Minutes'' and ``ER'' are tied at No. 7 with the comedy ``For Your
Love'' on WB.
</P>
<P>
   The audience division is stark. ``The Parkers,'' about a black
mother and daughter going to college together, has an
overwhelmingly minority audience: about 81 percent. But big hit
shows among white audiences like NBC's ``Friends'' and ``Frasier''
hold little interest for minority households, which make up only 6
percent of the audience for these comedies.
</P>
<P>
   To the black actors in ``City of Angels,'' especially older
ones, there is a special resonance in Bochco's decision to create
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who plays a stern chief executive at the hospital, has
been a friend of Bochco's since his days on ``Hill Street Blues,''
but said he had shied away from asking him for work. ``I had too
much pride to tell Steven I needed a job,'' he said. ``I didn't
want to infringe on our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his difficulties were similar to those faced by
many black actors. During the years of ``Hill Street,'' 1981 to
1987, he and Taurean Blacque, who is also black, were the only cast
members who were not offered roles in television commercials, he
said, adding that he also was never offered a part on a movie of
the week, in contrast to several white cast members.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, the CBS president, acknowledged that it was only
because of Bochco's reputation that the network proceeded so
swiftly on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Should it succeed, Moonves added, it could lead other networks
to create hourlong dramas with minority casts. ``We're a copycat
medium,'' said Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the cast and crew are far less optimistic. Warren
recalled that ``Roots'' in 1977 was one of the most watched
programs in television history, but not many opportunities
followed.
</P>
<P>
   If the show flops, some cast and crew members said, the effects
may be grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consequences if the show doesn't fly,'' Ms. Fox
said. ``It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. They'll say, `I told
you, no one wants to watch those people.'''

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ Lots of people want to invest in stocks
but are too scared to take the first step. There's so much to
learn, a great deal of it expressed in numbers and specialized
vocabulary. There's the fear that you will lose your money, mainly
because you don't know what you're doing. To be honest, there is
also the fear that people will giggle or smirk at your
amateurishness. One way to confront that fear is to build and track
a virtual portfolio _ an imaginary set of investments. (Ezell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I slipped into a corner booth, surrounded by
burnished wood and brass, gleaming white tile and silvery mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   No-nonsense waiters in white aprons threaded among the crowded
tables with platters held high. The mood was convivial, with the
clink of glasses and silverware against the buzz of conversation.
Plateaus of oysters glistened on the bar, charred steaks with
golden fries were being delivered to diners. I started on one of
the dishes I love most: frisee aux lardons, a salad of bitter curly
endive, poached egg and chunks of bacon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the quintessential Parisian experience. Except that I was
on lower Ninth Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so many brasseries have opened in New York that you can
think of almost any neighborhod as an arrondissement. Besides
Pastis in the meatpacking district, carefully detailed brasseries
have opened in the SoHo neighborhood, on the Upper East Side, in
Midtown Manhattan and in the theater district. And many more New
York restaurants are copying the brasserie in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's brasseries _ both in Paris and New York _ are
more about wine than beer, the word itself is actually French for
brewery. The first brasseries were beer halls at intersections in
Paris, opened by Alsatians, many of whom fled their province as the
Germans invaded in 1870. By the late 1800s, they had become
elaborate and fashionable late-night spots. Paris has hundreds of
brasseries, some with famous names like Lipp, La Coupole, Bofinger
and Julien.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a bit of a brasserie tradition in New York, with
places like L'Absinthe on the Upper East Side and Les Halles on
Park Avenue South, which have been around for about 10 years. Many
New York residents also remember the original Brasserie, in the
Seagram Building, which just reopened.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith McNally led the resurgence here. He set the standard
when he opened Balthazar, which captured the brasserie look and
spirit to perfection, down to the hours _ from breakfast through
late night _ and now he has expanded with Pastis. Since then, he
has been joined by others, including Restaurant Associates, which
in addition to the Brasserie, plans to open Brasserie 8{ next month
on West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Feret, who opened Brasserie Julien and Acacia Brasserie
last year on the Upper East Side, said: ``I was tired of formal
dining rooms, and I wanted to do something that was more fun, with
good food and reasonable prices. That's the way I think people like
to eat now, so it's becoming a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of brasseries shows how dining in New York has
relaxed, and not just downtown, where ties have always been
loosened, if not discarded. Meal times are no longer rigidly set,
with places like Gramercy Tavern offering a midafternoon menu.
Brasseries, with their anything, anytime attitude, fit right in.
They also reflect a growing appreciation of simple, everyday French
food.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bistros, which tend to be cozy and intimate neighborhood
spots, brasseries are large, noisy and throbbing with energy. The
menu is usually a compartmentalized broadsheet that invites
customers to pick and choose everything from steamed mussels to
rib-sticking cassoulet. Both bistros and brasseries emphasize basic
cooking _ escargots, duck confit, lamb shank and sole meuniere _
which may be one reason they are often confused. But brasseries
have a stronger Alsatian influence, with dishes like choucroute and
onion tart.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Bucher, the president of the Groupe Flo, which owns 16
brasseries in Paris, describes them as ``popular and democratic,
with big menus that always had something for everyone from laborers
to intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend the day in a brasserie from morning to night,''
he said. ``They're institutions that have evolved less than other
kinds of restaurants _ they're more or less unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Groupe Flo, whose historic properties in Paris include Balzar,
La Coupole, Vaudeville and Le Boeuf sur le Toit, plans to open its
first modern brasserie, Les Grandes Marches, at the Place de la
Bastille in September.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the original Brasserie, on East 53rd Street, was
developed by Restaurant Associates in 1959 and operated around the
clock. It may have been the first restaurant in America to serve
quiche, but the Philip Johnson design looked nothing like a
brasserie, with its table-height bar, Picasso plates on the walls
and modern woodwork. It closed after a fire in 1995 but has since
reopened with a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, other brasseries struggled for recognition. In
the 1980s, a New York version of Coupole in Paris opened on East
32nd Street and was a failure. (Reviewers skewered it for its
mediocre food and arrogant service.)
</P>
<P>
   Alan Stillman originally opened Cite, near Rockefeller Center,
as a brasserie in 1989, but it did not succeed until he changed the
concept to a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran up against the recession,'' Stillman said. ``But I'm
convinced New York was not ready. A brasserie is young, and not for
Midtown businessmen or tourists from the Midwest. I'm not sure even
Balthazar would have made it in Midtown in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Stillman's problems may have been that in trying to
create the ultimate brasserie he didn't achieve a classic look, and
wound up with a brasserie fit for Versailles, with prices to match.
</P>
<P>
   Even the original Brasserie had trouble communicating in that
earlier era, said Nick Valenti, the chairman of Restaurant
Associates. The Brasserie's $5 million makeover, by Liz Diller and
Ricardo Scofidio, now has a look that is both retro and sleekly
futuristic. It has Granny Smith-green resin tables, banquettes with
backs that soar to the ceiling at a rakish angle, a back-lit bar,
and video monitors that capture diners as they enter and start to
descend the floating glass staircase.

NEW YORK: glass staircase.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It borrows none of the Parisian references of the city's other
ones. Julien, Acacia and even L'Absinthe were do-it-yourself
projects by owners who used materials and accessories imported from
France.
</P>
<P>
   McNally designed Balthazar and Pastis himself, scouring flea
markets here and in France and having some details reproduced, like
the railings. Eric Demarchelier described the Houston Street branch
of Demarchelier, his bistro on the Upper East Side, as ``more
brasserie than bistro.'' And his design looks it.
</P>
<P>
   Although classic brasserie style is easy for restaurateurs to
replicate, some hire architects like David Colins, for Brasserie
Bit in the theater district, which looks air-lifted in from Paris,
and Morris Nathanson, for Rue 57, on West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The food is sometimes a little more difficult to keep on the
traditional track.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brasserie, now only open from 6:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., light
dishes like steamed mussels, croque monsieur sandwiches, fish soup
and burgers are e served through most of the day. But the chef, Luc
Dimnet, who is from Strasbourg in Alsace, has added more global
fare like lobster salad with sambal dressing, penne puttanesca, and
pho, the Vietnamese oxtail noodle soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic French stuff is pretty heavy, so I reworked the
brasserie concept with some French-colonial touches and Asian
spices,'' Dimnet said.
</P>
<P>
   At more traditional brasseries in New York, the classics
prevail, like quiche lorraine and cassoulet. Some places like Les
Halles and L'Absinthe and Acacia are trying to tempt New Yorkers
with time-honored but exotic items like tete de veau (calf's head
terrine), pig's feet and blood sausage. They also are venturing
into new territory. Julien serves ostrich burgers, Les Halles
offers hangersteak marinated in ginger and L'Absinthe teams tuna
steak with miso vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   True to their brewery roots, today's brasseries, here and in
Paris, offer an array of beers, mostly Belgian and many on tap. But
wine is the more popular beverage. ``We sell much more wine than
beer at Balthazar and Pastis,'' McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   But brasseries are still as much about drinking as eating. ``The
brasserie is emerging in New York now because of the rebirth of bar
life in a convivial atmosphere,'' said Michael Batterberry, a
co-founder of Food Arts magazine, who wrote ``On The Town in New
York,'' (Routledge, 1999) with his wife, Ariane. ``The tone of a
brasserie is set at the bar, not the table.''
</P>
<P>
   As for other reasons for the brasserie revival, Batterberry
said: ``They're great for young people who move in packs. The sushi
generation can understand the raw bar. Another factor has been the
evaporation of strict meal times.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the historic emphasis on beer, Belgian places like
Waterloo and Markt have the longest lists. Brasseriebit, a
partnership with a German brewery, Bitburger, features its beers on
tap and in a number of French dishes like roast chicken with a
black beer sauce. (Gerard Renny, one of the owners, also owns
Brasserie Americaine near Lincoln Center.)
</P>
<P>
   Feret, at Julien and Acacia, has four Belgian beers on tap. But
he has four inexpensive French varietal country wines also on tap,
sold by the glass and carafe.
</P>
<P>
   Even as traditional brasseries have taken hold in New York,
American translations have evolved as well. The Odeon in TriBeCa
opened nearly 20 years ago. ``We didn't think of it as a brasserie
when we opened it,'' said Lynn Wagenknecht, an owner. ``But it has
become one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Zagat survey, the sprawling Redeye Grill near
Carnegie Hall is identified as an American brasserie. It has the
space, the raw bar, the extended hours and the crowds. Metrazur,
opening next week in Grand Central Terminal, is billing itself as
an American brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   Even Guastavino, the 300-seat restaurant that Sir Terence Conran
is opening next month on the far East Side, is in brasserie mode,
as are many of the Conran megarestaurants in London, said Joel
Kissin, a partner. ``Before doing Quaglino, I sat in all the big
brasseries in Paris,'' he said. ``I wanted to take the energy and
the history of Parisian brasseries and reinterpret them in modern
terms.'' With a raw bar, a varied menu (from fish and chips to
Cuban stew) and an informal atmosphere, it could work.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lajaunie, an owner of Les Halles, said a brasserie does
not have to be French. He defined the Globe, a big restaurant
nearby with a diner-style menu, as a type of brasserie. ``It's the
spirit and the easygoing ambiance that counts,'' he said. ``If you
think about it, where a French town had a brasserie, in America,
you have diners.''

RUSSIAN FAILURE TO MODERNIZE ARMY HINDERS CHECHEN FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fresh from the front lines in Chechnya, a Russian
colonel was grumbling recently about the way his paratrooper
detachment was being used in the fighting against Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   His men are among the best-trained troops in Russia, highly
mobile units trained to move fast and capture the high ground, get
behind enemy lines, and cut off escape routes so the infantry can
move in and do its job.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, there is no Russian infantry, at least none that
the generals can count on. So when the main battle gets underway,
the paratroopers are ordered back into the fighting, only this time
in the unfamiliar role of cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular army cannot fight, so they use us,'' said the
colonel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Paratroopers should
not be fighting in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are being raised frequently by officers in the
better-trained units that have been scraped together from barracks
and police stations across Russia to fight in Chechnya. They get to
the heart of the unsightly truth behind a campaign that Russian
military and civilian leaders have presented not only as a military
success, but also as a symbol of the resurgence of Russia's armed
forces, even its national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the huge, draft-based Russian military desperately
needs to reform into a modern, flexible, well-trained fighting
force _ a fact that was widely recognized after the army was
battered and forced to withdraw during its 1994-1996 campaign in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But if the generals learned the lesson, nothing was ever done
about it. With the battle for Chechnya's capital, Grozny, raging,
plans to modernize and slim down the army to make it more effective
have been put off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a military reform is at this point too
uncertain,'' said Pavel Baev, a specialist on the Russian military
at the Institute of Peace Studies in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Baev said Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, who has built his
popularity on the war effort, ``speaks more about buildup and
modernization than about downsizing and restructuring, avoiding the
term `reform' like a bad omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev and other military analysts say the experience of Russia's
two wars in Chechnya demonstrates the need to upgrade mobile and
combat-capable components of the army. But there is nothing
reflecting this learning process in Russia's new Military Doctrine,
a document that barely mentions local conflicts like Chechnya and
reaffirms the commitment to a large, draft-based a   Some officers have argued that Russia's success in Chechnya
shows that the military does not need to remake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that Russia has an army, that it can do the
job,'' Colonel Sergei Skiba, commander of a reconnaissance unit,
said at the front near Grozny last month. ``We don't need to change
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why an officer like Skiba might feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a professional military to be a meaningful concept, the
Kremlin needs to raise salaries significantly, increase morale and
public prestige, and rebuild the military in a meaningful manner,''
said Dale Herrspring, a former US diplomat in Moscow an expert on
the Russian military. ``Reform is a very expensive proposition. It
is always cheaper to continue doing things the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, updating Russia's army has consisted mainly of
cutbacks in the number of military personnel, from about 420,000 to
about 350,000 ground troops, according to a report last fall issued
by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an
independent London think tank. Many of those demobilized have been
the junior officers and sergeants who are vital for training and
discipline in an army.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lack of funding, a 1996 plan to make the armed
forces a volunteer professional army was scrapped. The army lacks
resources for training, maintenance, and new equipment, the report
said, adding that except for the nuclear forces, the state of
readiness of Russian forces remains low.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of Russia's 1.2 million-strong military is
composed of relatively useless draftees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has a peacetime draft army, and a peacetime draft army
is not an army, it is an educational institution,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst in Moscow. ``No country
in the world can fight a war with a draft army. It's like sending a
high school team to the college national championship. The
Americans tried to do it in Vietnam and look where it got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that the Russian force in
Chechnya numbers 100,000 men, three times the size of the army that
was defeated in Moscow's 1994-1996 war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 percent of them are draftees, and only a few thousand are
considered to be part of dependable combat units. These have been
cobbled together from ``marines, paratroops, internal security
troops, and anything else that moves and can carry a rifle,'' as
Herrspring put it.
</P>
<P>
   Some units in Chechnya _ riot police, police antiterrorist
squads, and SWAT teams from across Russia _ are individually
well-trained and well-motivated, but they have never trained
together as a military force. They have been issued weapons that
are outdated and unfamiliar to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian command has played up the role of ``kontraktniki,''
veteran soldiers who have signed contracts to serve in Chechnya.
The idea is that these soldiers would fight better than green
draftees. But in the combat zone, the kontraktniki are valued only
slightly higher than raw recruits. A recent visit to the front
found one unit of contract soldiers begging for food and hankering
to get home as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just some bums from some slums who have no other way
to earn a living than joining the army,'' Felgenhauer said. ``You
have to have professional sergeants and officers to make good
soldiers out of bad people. The Russian Army doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the military rotated most of its experienced officers
and sergeants out of Chechnya, making matters worse, Felgenhauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been evident, even if state-controlled
television has kept silent about them. Commentators repeatedly have
mentioned the changes in tactics that have resulted in fewer
Russian casualties in the second Chechen war. But as the rebels'
resistance stiffens in their remaining strongholds _ Grozny and the
mountainous south _ Russian losses have mounted rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic that worked to push the separatists out of Chechnya's
northern plains, by pounding their positions with artillery and
warplanes and keeping the troops in the rear, won't work in the
city or the mountains. Lacking well-trained infantry, the Russians
have been forced to commit their best special-forces troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we were trained to do,'' an officer of a riot
police unit from the Siberian city of Yakutsk growled last week, as
his troops headed off to fight rebels in a Grozny suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they think they are being used the wrong way,''
Felgenhauer said. ``The whole armed forces is being used the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is a deep rift between the Ministry
of Defense, which gives priority to improving Russia's nuclear
weapons, and the General Staff, which is running the war. Defense
Minister Igor Sergeev, a former commander of Russia's strategic
rocket forces, is pushing for funds to deploy the new, highly
accurate Topol intercontintenal rocket. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of
the General Staff, wants the military budget to be spent on
outfitting the troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Karasik, who specializes on the Russian military for
the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., sees the Chechnya war
as ``one big military experiment for Russia.'' Karasik believes
that the fighting will lead to ``a more coherent plan to modernize,
and Kvashnin will lead the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But while analysts agree that Russia's generals are hoping to
parlay their perceived success in Chechnya into larger budgets,
some doubt the army will get enough to pay for real reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Putin had an extra $100 million transferred to the
defense budget. A Defense Ministry official said at the time that
the additional funds would be used to provide troops in the north
Caucasus with ``a wide range of reconnaissance and surveillance
equipment, night-vision equipment, new types of guns and
grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev said: ``The General Staff obviously tries to turn the war
into an instrument of getting more resources. Real reforms _ like
restructuring, downsizing, and modernizing the ground forces;
creating mobile forces; organizing a civilian Defense Ministry
dealing with a real military budget _ are completely forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Baev and others believe Putin could push for radical changes. To
do that, he would need money Russia does not have. And the reforms
can begin only after the fighting in Chechnya subsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hardly possible to reform the army in the middle of
war,'' Baev noted.

`NEXT FRIDAY': SOUNDS ARE LOUD AND IN STEREO (TYPES)
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af) 
By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most enjoyable moment of the cinematic lollipop that goes
by the title ``Next Friday,'' a father who has just ripped a tape
gag off the mouth of his captive son, slaps it right back on rather
than listen to any more of his foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' is a loud, low-level candy-colored sequel to the
juvenile 1995 comedy ``Friday.'' Produced and written by Ice Cube,
who is also one of its stars, it is notable chiefly for feeding a
stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts, interested mainly in
recreational drugs and irresponsible sex. Most of the principal
female characters are either sexually voracious, sexually
promiscuous, pregnant out of wedlock or angrily bent on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The principal villains of the film are members of a Hispanic
family who are violent criminals and bullies; the secondary villain
is a black man who has escaped from prison. From the standpoint of
the film's characters, the butt of comedy is a foul-mouthed Korean
woman, Miss Ho-Kym (Amy Hill).
</P>
<P>
   Even on its own terms, which include soundtrack credits for Ice
Cube, Wyclef Jean and Wu-Tang Clan, among others, ``Next Friday,''
directed by Steve Carr, can stake no claim to high achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The film picks up the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) at a time
when Debo, the hulking menace of ``Friday,'' has just broken out of
the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's father (John Witherspoon), still characterized mainly by
his penchant for hot sauce and his bathroom habits, decides it
would be a good idea to dispatch Craig from South-Central Los
Angeles to live in the suburbs with his Uncle Elroy (Don Curry,
known as D.C.) and his cousin, Day-Day (Mike Epps).
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Elroy, nearly broke though a lottery winner, lives with
the steamy Suga (Kym E. Whitley) across the way from the vicious
and terrifying Joker brothers. Day-Day and his BMW are under siege
from the angry, pregnant D'Wana (Tamala Jones) and her henchwoman,
Baby D' (Robin Allen).
</P>
<P>
   So on the very day that Uncle Elroy faces the seizure of his
$230,000 home for a $3,900 tax delinquency, Debo (Tommy Lister Jr.,
known as Tiny) has stowed away in Jones' dogcatcher's truck en
route to Rancho Cucamonga, so he can wreak vengeance on Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, meanwhile, has run afoul of the Joker brothers (Jacob
Vargas, Lobo Sebastian and Rolando Molina) and their pit bull while
falling for their beautiful and decent sister, Karla (Lisa
Rodriguez). Day-Day and his pal, Roach (Justin Pierce), have lost
their jobs in a record shop.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Craig to save the day, which involves a burglary.
But since it is a theft from the Joker brothers, who are thieves
and drug dealers themselves, the film takes the position that it's
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally everyone converges on the Jokers' home at the same
time. The conclusion has energy without much originality.
</P>

`HANK GREENBERG': HE FELL SHORT OF BABE RUTH, BUT NOT FOR JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the intolerant outbursts of the Atlanta Braves pitcher
John Rocker, a special timeliness surrounds the two-week run of the
documentary ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg,'' which begins
Wednesday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   With Rocker's derogatory remarks about various minorities still
fresh in our minds, this unabashed valentine by Aviva Kempner to
baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and
some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930s and '40s
and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation
founded on ideals like religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s and '40s were the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish
immigrants who came out of the Bronx to star with the Detroit
Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's home run record (with 58 home runs in
1938), become the first man to win most valuable player awards at
two positions, first base and left field, and become baseball's
first $100,000 player.
</P>
<P>
   In blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome
Greenberg became an idol of fellow Jews and a target of
anti-Semites. Some of the anti-Semitism, including at least one
attempt to cause injury, was aimed at him by other ballplayers;
some came from Tigers fans in Detroit, a hotbed of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' examines his remarkable
career from the standpoint of his Jewishness, although by his own
admission and by the evidence of one of his children he was not
particularly observant.
</P>
<P>
   But his stardom, his innate decency, his work ethic and his
World War II record made him a beacon of hope to many Jews in a
career that began in the Depression. It ended in 1947, the same
year Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier with the
Brooklyn Dodgers, while Greenberg was also playing in the National
League, with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, Ira Berkow, the New York Times
sportswriter, and Ralph Kiner, Greenberg's former teammate, recall
how he encouraged Robinson in the face of intense bigotry from
other players. ``He gave me encouragement,'' Berkow quotes Robinson
as saying of Greenberg. ``Greenberg is class. It stands out all
over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kempner's documentary is a compound of archival film and
feature film clippings and the talking heads of Greenberg, his
family, former teammates, fans, sportswriters and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Here are old stars like Hal Newhouser, Charlie Gehringer and Bob
Feller and fans like the actor Walter Matthau and the lawyer and
writer Alan Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Although scenes of old ballparks and bygone World Series pepper
``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg,'' the film is
simultaneously fascinating and vexing in ways that might tax
informed devotees of both baseball and film. Although its
illumination of Greenberg as athlete and man appears thorough and
rounded, the film's focus leaves scant time to place his powerful
Tiger teams in the context of baseball history, although there are
passing references to the potent Yankees of the same era.
</P>
<P>
   And the film's use of unidentified film clips, like ``The
Stratton Story'' (1949) with James Stewart, can be jarring and
confusing. Counterbalancing these flaws are some splendid swing
music and Mandy Patinkin's Yiddish rendition of ``Take Me Out to
the Ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, though, ``The Life and Times of Hank
Greenberg'' remains faithful to its title, valuable as history and
resonant with meaning for today. &QL;

`THE SECRET WAR AGAINST HANOI': COSTLY LESSONS FROM A COVERT
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January 1961, President John F. Kennedy, having just taken
office, was informed of intelligence estimates showing that North
Vietnam was intensifying a campaign of murder, kidnappings,
ambushes and armed attacks in its effort to take over South
Vietnam. Kennedy's angry response was to try to do to North Vietnam
what it was doing to the South. Kennedy initiated a set of covert
actions that, as Richard H. Shultz Jr. says in his illuminating
account of the consequences of Kennedy's decision, would ``put
Hanoi on notice that there was a price to be paid for its attempt
to subvert South Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, in typically bold but also impetuous fashion, believed
in unconventional warfare, which he felt needed to be developed to
respond to the unconventional methods of global communist
subversion. And, as Shultz explains in ``The Secret War Against
Hanoi,'' that tenet got the United States into the biggest set of
covert actions undertaken during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz subjects the secret effort, which lasted from the early
1960s to 1972, to a searching, critical, dispassionate analysis.
His book, which focuses on the multifarious activities of the
Studies and Observation Group, or SOG, as the secret warfare
organization was called, is impressively researched and soberly
presented, though not so soberly as to smother the passion that
Shultz has for this subject. The book shows above all that that
there are still things to be learned not just about clandestine
warfare but more generally about the Vietnam War, especially the
underlying flaws that bedeviled U.S. policy in Indochina from the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz, who directs the International Security Studies Program
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University,
describes the programs that were carried out and the troubled
bureaucratic history of many of them. Reading Shultz's book, one
cannot help but be impressed by the derring-do of many in the U.S.
armed forces. But reading it is also a 400-page lesson in how not
to wage special war against a determined and badly understood foe.
In Shultz's telling of it, the secret war, which was not so secret
to the North Vietnamese, was conceived almost without considering
the nature of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the almost contemporary Bay of Pigs fiasco, it was executed
at times with almost unbelievable ineptness. Even when the
execution was brave and highly skilled, it seemed burdened with the
insurmountable problems that were present from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Among the points made clear in this history is Kennedy's
critical role in increasing U.S. involvement in the war. Contrary
to the sentimental views of some historians _ and revisionist
filmmakers like Oliver Stone _ Kennedy showed no sign of souring on
the war and wishing shortly before his assassination to bring about
a U.S. disengagement. On the contrary, in Shultz's account, Kennedy
was so impatient to get results that when the CIA failed to do so,
he transferred the operation to the Pentagon, where Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara enthusiastically backed it.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's problem was hubris, a failure to understand that this
particular enemy was not going to give up its goals because some
special agents were dispatched across the border to foment
resistance to the Hanoi government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Secretary, I hear what you are saying, but it's not going
to work,'' William Colby, the chief of the CIA's Saigon station,
told McNamara at a meeting in 1963. North Vietnam was what one CIA
analyst aptly called a counterintelligence state where total
control of the population made the task of stirring up trouble
almost impossible. Over seven years, for example, the United States
inserted some 500 agents into North Vietnam. Not a single agent
returned. Every one was either killed or turned into a
disinformation tool by the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy's era was characterized by a reckless ignorance of
the Vietnamese reality, President Lyndon B. Johnson's was saturated
by political caution. The most effective covert operation,
especially in its early years, was the dispatching of
reconnaissance teams across the borders into Laos and Cambodia to
call in air strikes on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, North Vietnam's
essential infiltration route to South Vietnam. Shultz cites a North
Vietnamese general interviewed after the war who said that the only
way the United States could have prevailed was to cut the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz then elaborates on the bureaucratic obstructions of SOG's
cross-border reconnaissance. The most serious of these came from
the State Department and from major figures like W. Averell
Harriman and Kennedy's ambassador to Laos, William Sullivan, who
were concerned that cross-border excursions would ruin the
neutrality arrangements that Harriman had negotiated in Laos in
1962. That concern, combined with inconsistent and hesitant
policies by the Johnson administration, enabled Hanoi to increase
its defenses along the trail and to step up its operations while
SOG was inactive.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz attaches great importance to the 1962 Laotian accords,
which in his view essentially gave the game away to the North
Vietnamese. But he also shows, apart from U.S. bureaucratic
weakness, that SOG soon began to experience terrible casualties as
North Vietnam strengthened its defenses. In 1969 one American ended
up killed, wounded or missing in every other reconnaissance
mission. ``It was basically a waste of effort,'' the U.S. commander
in chief in Vietnam, Gen. William Westmoreland, told Shultz of the
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz believes that this need not have been the case. Still,
the unblinkered account he gives leads to the conclusion that,
however brave and potentially useful it may have been, the secret
war against Hanoi was close to a wasted effort the way it was
conducted during the long and tragic U.S. military engagement in
Indochina.

 &HT;    U.S. IN EYE OF A POLITICAL STORM AS IT WEIGHS FATE OF CUBAN BOY
 &HT;    760&AMP;add. With CUBABOY-TIMELINE.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Friday deadline nearing for a deal
returning 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba, U.S.
immigration officials said Tuesday they do not plan to return him
by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to take charge of him, and we have no plans
to forcibly remove him from the home,'' said Mike Gilhooly, an
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, INS and Justice Department officials worked
throughout the day on a response to Monday's ruling by Dade County
Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez that Elian should remain with his
relatives in Miami until a custody hearing March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials also were working on a response to a petition
filed by Spencer Eig, an attorney for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, asking INS to reconsider an asylum plea on the boy's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still reviewing the (Rodriguez) ruling to determine
what if any action we want to take,'' said Justice Department
spokesperson Carole Florman.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington said they have not departed from their
timetable _ announced by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner last week
_ that envisioned an agreement being reached by Friday to return
Elian to his father, Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said at the time that she hoped to avoid INS taking
custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Washington said the notion of suddenly removing
the boy from his great-uncle's care was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never, from the very beginning, considered forcibly
taking this child into custody,'' INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Washington, the political currents continued to
swirl around the case, as several interested parties wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno urging her to delay the boy's return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called
Meissner's decision ``premature'' and asked Reno to brief him on
``precisely what steps have been taken by the Department to ensure
the boy's best interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, whose committee oversees legislation related to the
Justice Department and the INS, said, ``I believe it is imperative
that we ensure that the boy's father's true wishes are followed,
even if it requires bringing his entire family here temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who last week subpoenaed Elian Gonzalez
to testify before a congressional committee in a bid to delay his
return, sent a letter signed by lawmakers from both parties urging
a delay.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that any ``attempt to enforce the INS's decision
without awaiting a ruling from the court would be a serious
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those signing Burton's letter were Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla.; House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; House International
Relations Committee Chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.Y.; Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., and Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who spoke with Elian Gonzalez on
Saturday at the Miami home of the boy's great-uncle, Lozaro
Gonzalez, also sent Reno a letter claiming that Elian does not want
to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, I believe there is strong evidence that he may very
well be afraid to go back to Cuba,'' Smith said in a letter
distributed to the media by the Cuban American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions, I asked Elian directly if he wanted to
go back to Cuba,'' Smith said. ``His reply repeatedly and
emotionally was 'no, no, no.' Elian further said to me 'Ayudame,
por favor,' (help me please).''
</P>
<P>
   Smith further claimed that Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez, knew
that his divorced wife was planning to flee Cuba with Elian because
the boy's paternal grandfather _ who lives in the same house as the
boy's father _ notified relatives in the United States that the two
had left Cuba and to be on the lookout for them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith added that two cousins of Elian's father said he told them
five or six months ago that he also planned to flee Cuba with his
new wife and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is reason to believe that intimidation tactics are being
used by the Castro government on Elian's father,'' Smith said.
``Reports by family members say that Mr. Gonzalez has been removed
from his home and is not speaking on his own free will.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Elian would already have been granted asylum had his
mother survived the voyage from Cuba, Smith told Reno, ``you are
punishing Elian for his mother's death.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., urged Pope John Paul II
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pope John Paul's intervention would, I believe, prove higher
ground than the political sliming that all of the political sides
are perpetrating in the name of fairness, while an innocent little
boy becomes more emotionally fragile by the day,'' Hastings said in
his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that ``divine intervention brought 6-year-old Elian to
the shores of the United States,'' Hastings said the pope's
intervention could resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumult and chaos have descended upon South Florida,'' Hastings
said, ``and while politicians, judges and bureaucrats seek
solutions, their efforts, meant to be curative, have proved
divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rep. Maxine Waters, the chief deputy Democratic House
whip, issued a letter to President Clinton signed by 15 Democratic
members, including Hastings, applauding the INS decision and
seeking support to have him returned to Cuba under the auspices of
a church group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been ardent in our efforts to ensure that Elian's
situation not be decided based on the politics of the day or the
sentiments of anti-Castro Cubans in Florida and the rest of the
United States. Rather, it should be based on the interests of the
child and the rights that any father would expect to have,'' Waters
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For some, reading about the old days at The New
Yorker is like listening to a friend tediously describe his plane
ticket being upgraded or the dream he had the night before. But for
others, the magazine has an ineffable fascination. Now, to please
them, there are no less than seven new books both about The New
Yorker and its contributors being published to coincide with its
75th anniversary next month.
</P>
<P>
   They range from sniping to straightforward. Random House is
publishing three of them, including ``Wonderful Town: New York
Stories from The New Yorker,'' and ``Life Stories: Profiles from
the New Yorker,'' both edited by David Remnick, who succeeded Tina
Brown as the magazine's editor in 1998. Random House's Modern
Library is bringing out ``Letters From the Editor,'' the words of
the magazine's founder, Harold Ross, edited by his biographer
Thomas Kunkel.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Yagoda's ``About Town: The New Yorker and the World it
Made,'' (Scribner) draws on the magazine's archives at the New York
Public Library. ``Some Times in America'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf), by
Alexander Chancellor, is about his year in the mid-1990s as editor
of the Talk of the Town section.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster is publishing ``Janet, My Mother and Me,'' by
William Murray, a New Yorker writer whose mother, Natalia Danesi
Murray, was a lover of the New Yorker columnist Janet Flanner, and
``Gone,'' a gossipy account by a former contributor to the
magazine, Renata Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler's book, which is causing the most stir, depicts The
New Yorker as a snake pit of intriguers and flatterers trying to
curry favor with successive editors. ``Gone'' is a catalog of
slights Ms. Adler she says she suffered when she worked at the
magazine intermittently from 1963 to 1989. (She also served as a
film critic for The New York Times in 1968.)
</P>
<P>
   Her complaints are specific, like recalling when William Shawn,
Ross' successor as the editor of The New Yorker, wanted to cut an
article, or when Shawn scheduled pieces and then dropped them. She
also says fellow staff members did not like her writing and that
the fiction department said that one story she wrote was not
fiction at all. Ms. Adler asserts that the fiction editors had
conflicts of interest because they were vying to publish their own
short stories in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Charles McGrath, a former New Yorker fiction editor
who is now editor of The New York Times Book Review, wrote a letter
to Ms. Adler's editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster, protesting that an event
described in the book never happened. The material was removed.
McGrath said he had decided to distance himself from reviews about
the current New Yorker books. Roger Angell, chief fiction editor
during Ms. Adler's tenure, called her depiction ``wildly
inaccurate.'' Ms. Adler declined to comment for this article. ``I
think I've said enough about my book,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her targets is Lillian Ross, whom Ms. Adler accuses
of making factual errors in ``Here but Not Here'' (Random House),
her 1998 memoir of her 40-year affair with Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Adler's jibes at Ms. Ross seem trivial. For
instance, Ms. Adler says Ms. Ross incorrectly described the
apartment of Hannah Arendt, a New Yorker contributor. But others
are more provocative. She says that Ms. Ross ``unconsciously,
disliked and even despised'' Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross said she had not read the Adler book. ``If they haven't
done any writing for 20 years or so, and they attack other people,
that's their business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler says that Robert Gottlieb, who succeeded Shawn as
editor in 1987, and Tina Brown, who followed Gottlieb in 1993,
caused the downfall of the magazine. Gottlieb was self-centered and
uncurious, she complains, and talked to her in his office with the
door open instead of closing it as Shawn did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoy Renata in her attack-dog mode,'' Gottlieb said,
``even when I'm one of the victims. I can't take this particular
attack very seriously because it's both so wacky and so bizarrely
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, whom Ms. Adler called a spendthrift who printed
gossip, did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A particular target of Ms. Adler is the writer Adam Gopnik, a
protege of Gottlieb. Gopnik was a hand-wringing sycophant, she
writes, who spoke in ``a strange alternating current of flattery
and self-promotion.'' Ms. Adler also complains that when Ms. Brown
took over, she made Gopnik her protege, too.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gopnik said he had no intention of reading Ms. Adler's book.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Adler's book is personal, Yagoda's ``About Town'' is a
traditional history. He describes the young John Updike trying to
sell his cartoons to the magazine. ``I would like some information
on those little filler drawin you publish and, I presume, buy,'' he
wrote when he was 17, leaving the last two letters off
``drawings.'' William Maxwell, an editor at The New Yorker,
described Updike then as a ``shy, intelligent humorous youngster,
slightly gawky in his manner and already beginning, being an
artist, to turn it into a kind of style.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Maxwell's judgment wasn't always foolproof. When W.H. Auden
sent him the famous poem that became ``Sept. 1, 1939,'' he turned
it down, writing, ``It is an effective poem but in its entirety not
right for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel's book recounts that even James Thurber's drawings were
subject to the magazine's fact-checking process. ``There is an
actual fish called the pout,'' Ross wrote Thurber about a series of
drawings he did of imaginary animals. ``There is a bee called a
lapidary, but you have drawn an animal. You have a clock tick.
There is, of course, a tick. No matter, I say. There is a bird
called a ragamuffin. You have drawn a ragamuffin plant. No real
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether at least 22 books have been written about The New
Yorker. What is it that makes the magazine so fascinating, at least
to those who have worked there? It has always cultivated an aura of
mystery, said Yagoda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no table of contents, no author bylines, no
masthead,'' he said. ``There was this thing that would appear not
made by human hands.'' (A table of contents and bylines have been
added in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of any people who consider themselves writers
in the United States have a collection of New Yorker rejection
letters,'' Yagoda continued. ``A club that won't have you as a
member, how wonderful that seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders imagined that the magazine was a writers' paradise of
unlimited space, time and good money. But there were endless, quite
human psychodramas as Shawn maneuvered among sensitive and
ambitious egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was full of affection and attention to his writers,'' said
Angell. But then, ``you realized he was saying the same thing at
the same time to others,'' and ``he constantly ran down other
editors.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn ``was difficult and capable of lying,'' Angell said, but
also ``an extraordinary editor and an extraordinary man.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the magazine that once published Joseph Mitchell and E.B.
White is still home to what is considered some of America's best
writing. Its particular style, a mixture of ``the urbane and the
informal,'' has profoundly influenced American letters, said Daniel
Menaker, a former fiction editor and writer at the magazine who
edited the Random House anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent The New Yorker has lost its identity, Yagoda said
in an interview. Now an article that appears in The New Yorker
``could be in Vanity Fair or Harper's,'' he said. It is as if
former contributors to The New Yorker are writing their books to
recapture a vanished past, a paradise where Shawn nurtured them as
if they were children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really believe that the public at large is as
fascinated with these details as the participants are,'' Gottlieb
said. ``I may write about the magazine someday, too, but I don't
deceive myself that the rest of the world is likely to be all that
interested.''

&HT;     NEW YORK GROUP HOPES FOR BETTER TIES WITH CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATE GURNETT  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A humanitarian delegation that is scheduled to
depart for Cuba on Wednesday hopes to change history during the
latest mercurial moment in U.S.-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of delays, the group's trip coincides with the
contentious feud over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who is
trapped in a custody battle between relatives in Florida and his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But delegation members from upstate New York hope calm heads
prevail as they provide medical supplies to Cuba and gather
information that could lead to better relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is, this is an unbiased fact-finding mission,'' said
Dr. Jose Gonzalez Posada, an Albany surgeon and one of three Cuban
emigres making the trip. ``You may imagine that anybody that left
(Cuba) has to be biased against it. But after 30 years you change
your mind and you say, `What is the truth? What is the real need
for the people?' They (Cubans) know what's best for them. I can't
say that I do know anymore. I think we should find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation will be in Havana for one week. It will visit
schools, hospitals, churches and markets, meet with Cuban officials
and attend a meeting of the National Assembly. Members hope they
can convince leaders in the United States to boost shipments of
medical supplies to the beleaguered island and possibly improve
trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we need to take a look at the human side of
things,'' said Joseph Gomez, an Albany electrical contractor and
Cuban emigre who is leading the delegation. ``Right now there are
not enough medical supplies to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez would know. Two years ago his cousin Jose Martinez, who
suffered from asthma, died in a hospital in Cuba because of a lack
of bronchial dilators.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Zwack, the Rensselaer County executive and a member of the
delegation, wants U.S. policy changed to allow trade with the
Cubans. Zwack and Rensselaer County Economic Development Director
Robert Pasinella Jr. intend to observe the economy and sow seeds
for future agreements, but they won't be sealing any deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strictly a humanitarian visit,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip might be called penicillin diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The group is collecting antibiotics, salt tablets, anti-viral
drugs, bronchial dilators and intravenous vitamins to donate to the
Calixto Garcia Hospital in Havana, said Caroline Gomez, a nurse, a
delegation member and Joseph Gomez' wife.
</P>
<P>
   Posada secured a donation of three blood recovery machines,
worth $15,000 each. The Disarm Education Fund based in New York
City will ship the machines once they are cleared, director Bob
Schwartz said. The fund is the world's largest shipper of
humanitarian aid to Cuba. It has sent more than $43 million in
medicine and medical supplies to the island since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian delegation from upstate New York is the latest
in a wave of national bridge-building visits to Cuba from diverse
public and private envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Such visits reflect the slow pace of change in U.S. policy
toward Cuba, said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group in New York City.
``It is very clear that the (Clinton) administration intends to
modify its Cuban policy only incrementally. The change is gradual
but steady.''

</P>
<P>
   The group, 24 delegates and a handful of reporters, is a
microcosm of the Americans who have gone before them: from
politicians to business owners to doctors, nurses, teachers and
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Zwack, along with state Assemblyman Robert Prentiss, R-Latham,
and Prentiss' wife, Albany County Legislator Marlene Prentiss, will
help the rest of the group gather information and prepare reports
for Congress and the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interaction with people is always helpful,'' said Barbara
DiTommaso, director of the Roman Catholic diocese's Peace &AMP; Justice
Commission and a member of the delegation. ``The embargo reinforces
Castro's power because it gives Cuba a siege mentality; they feel
that they're under attack. This is like Ping-Pong diplomacy used by
the U.S. and China 30 years ago. You find something you can
cooperate on and it engenders good will.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the delegates from the Albany area are paying their own
way, an estimated $1,200 each.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting adult confusion over what to do about
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, U.S. authorities have sent contradictory
signals ever since the Cuban boy was rescued off the coast of
Florida on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has taken no official position on whether to
send Elian back, saying that he didn't want ``politics'' to play a
role. But pressures are building, as Florida's Cuban community,
diplomats, members of Congress and presidential candidates take
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an emotional tug-of-war across the Florida
Straits, with no certain outcome for the youngster, who is
occasionally glimpsed by the public as he rides atop his
great-uncle's shoulders or romps with his puppy, a gift of
Cuban-born Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the often conflicting actions so far:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 25 . A fisherman finds the boy floating in an inner tube.
His mother and stepfather had both died after their ship sank in an
attempted escape from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 1. In its first public statement on Elian, the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service says that ``the issue of
legal custody must be decided by (Florida's) state court.'' The INS
added that the boy would remain in Miami with his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, until the custody issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 5 Cuban President Fidel Castro threatens to ``move heaven
and earth'' and organize a ``world battle'' unless the boy is
returned to Cuba within 72 hours. Thousands of Cubans begin massive
protests outside of the U.S. mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 6. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart says that the
administration takes ``a dim view'' of Castro's threats and demands
security for American personnel in the mission. Lockhart takes no
position on whether Elian should be returned. ``Obviously, this
case ...may eventually end up in court, but for right at this
moment is an immigration matter,'' he says of the youngster, who
turns six years old this day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 7. The State Department appears to overrule the INS on
allowing a court to determine custody of the boy. ``The regulations
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) recognize the
right of a parent to assert parental interests in an immigration
proceeding,'' a department statement says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 8. During an exchange with reporters, Clinton declines to
express a view. ``I don't think that politics or threats should
have anything to do with it, and if I have my way, it won't. We
should let the people who are responsible for this, who have a
legal responsibility, to try to do the right thing by the child.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 13. Two INS officials meet with Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 5. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner announces that her
agency has determined that the father has ``sole legal authority to
speak on behalf of his son Elian.'' She says the department is
satisfied that the father's wishes are to have the boy return to
Cuba. ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' Meissner said, setting a target date for a reunion by
Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Clinton endorsed the INS procedure. ``I
told you, when we started this, that I would do my best to keep
this decision out of politics,'' he said. ``And we have done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Florida relatives appeal to Miami-Dade's Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 6. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and a handful of
Democratic colleagues make public a letter urging that Elian be
reunited with his father in Cuba. Among the signers are Sanford
Bishop, D-Ga., Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and Alcee Hastings,
D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 7. House Government Reform Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
announces that his panel was issuing a subpoena to Elian so that he
could remain in the United States at least long enough for a
hearing on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 10. Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Rosa Rodriguez,
reversing the INS decision five days earlier, rules that she had
jurisdiction over the custody question. She scheduled a hearing for
March 6. That ruling appears to guarantee that the boy stays with
his Florida relatives until then.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, parting company with the official
Clinton administration line, says on NBC's Today program that he
doubts that INS has the ``experience and expertise'' to determine
what's best for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Elian's father, Gore says, ``There's no evidence
that he is expressing a sincere, genuine feeling about what is in
his child's best interest. So here's how we should resolve it. Let
him come to a place where he can speak freely and settle the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who is
running for president, sends a letter to Attorney General Janet
Reno asking her to delay sending the boy to Cuba and to consider
``bringing his entire family here temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 11. An INS spokeswoman in Miami says the agency has no
plans to force Elian's return to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to take charge of him, and we have no plans
to forcibly remove him from the home,'' INS spokesman Mike Gilhooly
told the Associated Press. The INS has been silent on whether it
will attempt to overturn the Florida court ruling.

   BUSH-THEATER _ GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ A quiet exchange between George
W. Bush and a Texas reporter here recently revealed more than any
pundit could about how the Texas governor's life has changed since
he moved to the national stage. Flanked by police officers and
sheriffs, Bush took the podium and delivered brief remarks after
winning their endorsement. Then he conducted a news conference _
the roughly 15 minutes of questioning he permits, usually daily,
when he is on the campaign trail. He wrapped up the Q&AMP;A session,
then made his way through the crowd. That's when the reporter
sidled up, knowing he was breaking an unwritten Bush campaign rule,
one an aide is usually at the candidate's elbow to enforce:
limiting unguarded conversation outside brief, scheduled news
conferences and approved interviews. ``One more question,'' the
reporter said to Bush. ``It doesn't work that way anymore,'' the
governor said quietly. Surrounded by onlookers, Bush answered the
question that day. But the exchange put the spotlight on how much
more closely controlled and tightly produced Bush has become as he
has evolved into the Republican presidential front-runner. (Heath,

the GBI entered Department of Family and Children's Services
offices in 7 counties Tuesday seeking records on 13 children who
died after the child protection agency had investigated abuse
complaints against their families. They were said to be
investigating possible falsification of DFACS documents, a felony,
perhaps other criminal activity. The raids upstaged flamboyant
attorney Don Keenan, who filed suit and staged a news conference
earlier Tuesday to demand that a federal judge take control of
DFACS, saying Barnes' plan for an ombudsman doesn't go far enough.

TV NOTES: VIOLENCE ON FOX; `MALCOLM'; GAME SHOW STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox to Lower Dose of `Reality'
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Writing off what he called the ``blood and
guts'' reality shows that his network has relied on so heavily in
the last few years, Sandy Grushow, the new chairman of Fox
Television Entertainment, has announced that a plan by the Fox
specials department to crash a 747 plane live in the Mojave Desert
has been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, he said at a news conference, will viewers see any more
specials called ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' or ``When Animals
Attack'' on Fox, although he excluded what he termed
``entertainment specials'' from the group that he said had become a
kind of ``ratings heroin'' for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Grushow and the man he superseded as the top Fox
entertainment executive, Doug Herzog (he's still president of Fox
Entertainment but now reports to Grushow) announced a series of
deals with some of the more celebrated creators of previous
television hits. Most important, Fox has signed Michael Crichton,
the prolific best-selling author of ``Jurassic Park,'' et al., and
television's biggest hit of the last decade, ``ER,'' to create a
new drama for the network. No terms were announced because Crichton
has not determined what sort of show he'll be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has also extended a deal with David E. Kelley, the equally
prolific television writer, now producing ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice,'' to give Fox first claim on any new series he creates.
One senior Fox executive said that Kelley had not firmly committed
to creating a new show for next fall's television season but that
the network believed that he would .
</P>
<P>
   Among others Grushow and Herzog said Fox has signed to deals are
Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz of the new ABC series ``Once and
Again'' and previously of ``Thirtysomething''; Darren Star, who
created ``Melrose Place'' for Fox before going on to create the
current hit ``Sex and the City'' for HBO; and the comedy production
company Carsey-Werner, which has generated a long string of hits
including the current ``That '70s Show'' for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But Grushow, who acknowledged that Fox had suffered a disastrous
fall and still had numerous problems to solve, was not able to
announce any resolution to the most ominous threat to the network:
the possible end of its long-running hit ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said that Fox still did not know whether the show would
return. The network is still negotiating with agents for the star
David Duchovny as well as with the show's creator, Chris Carter.
``I'm reasonably optimistic,'' Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that there was ``a lot of posturing going on'' and
that Duchovny's representatives had been saying that he does not
want to return. Grushow said it was too early to say whether the
show could be back with a new star if Duchovny could not be
persuaded to continue. ``Our agenda is to bring it back with him in
it,'' Grushow said. ``If we get to a point that it's clear David
Duchovny absolutely, categorically refuses to do another season,
that decision is going to rest with Chris Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   But time is running short. Grushow said Fox had ``about a
month'' to resolve the issue before Carter would have to write an
episode for a series finale.
</P>
<P>
   `Malcolm' Thrives
</P>
<P>
   Fox did receive its best news of the current season over the
weekend in the performance of its new comedy, ``Malcolm in the
Middle,'' which soared to the second-best rating for any new series
in Fox's 14-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm,'' which also received the best reviews of any new
comedy this season, was watched by more than 22 million people and
had the second highest rating of last week (trailing only ``ER'')
among the 18-to-49-year-old viewers that most networks prize so
highly.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Games
</P>
<P>
   NBC's chief entertainment executives have begun to take a new
tack in their quest to keep ABC's raging-hit game show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' from laying waste to their hopes of winning
another television season.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cowering, the network is attacking. First NBC
executives refused to concede the season title to ABC, as they
pretty much had back in November, pointing to the onslaught of
``Millionaire'' editions three times a week for the rest of the
season as well as to ABC's two monster ratings magnets, the Super
Bowl and the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives are also now openly questioning ABC's decision to
rely on ``Millionaire'' to fill holes on three nights the rest of
the television season, suggesting that ABC may be becoming addicted
to the heady ratings the show is attracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like crack,'' said NBC Entertainment president Garth
Ancier, at a news conference in Pasadena, taking a page from
Grushow's descriptive phrase for reality shows, a wording he first
used last year. ``Once you're on it, it's wonderful because you get
those giant ratings, but no one believes it's going to work
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   While it does, NBC now argues, ABC is not developing the comedy
and drama shows it is going to need when the ``Millionaire''
phenomenon wears off. ``These shows are very, very hard to
develop,'' said Scott Sassa, the president of NBC's West Coast
division. ``I think what's going to be interesting when you come to
the other end of this, and this thing ends, you're going to have a
heck of a lot of development to fill in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at the same time, NBC has started up its own game
show, ``Twenty-One,'' which did well enough in its first outing
last Sunday for NBC to rush out a news release bragging about the
ratings, improving NBC's performance Sunday at 8 by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NBC became fond of ``Twenty-One'' after a short, intense
development period, so fond that it no longer considers the show
merely an effort at, as one NBC executive put it, ``genre kill.''
That term refers to the openly cynical idea that the game
phenomenon can be killed entirely by saturating the airwaves with
such shows.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Millionaire,'' it came roaring back onto ABC's
schedule, scoring its second-best rating ever on Sunday and
following that with another big performance on Monday. But it also
indirectly helped support one point made by Sassa about ABC's
chances to win the season.
</P>
<P>
   He said ABC would have trouble replacing the ratings attained by
``Monday Night Football.'' In its first movie on Monday night,
ABC's rating collapsed. In fact, it helped prove another prevailing
theory about ``Millionaire,'' that it does not necessarily help the
shows around it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ``Millionaire'' was seen by about 25 million people.
Then a movie about the life and career of Muhammad Ali lost 16
million of those viewers: essentially more than enough people
needed to make a show a hit disappeared from ABC.

   I'll say this much for Skip, the antic terrier whose adventures
are the subject of Jay Russell's new movie: He does not use a
computer-animated mouth to recite cute catch phrases. He is not
affiliated with a videogame, a line of action figures or a

Little.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Skip is an old-fashioned, flesh-and-blood dog, ``My Dog
Skip'' is a resolutely old-fashioned movie: a relaxed, modest
evocation of the mythology of small-town mid-20th-century American
childhood, with its lazy summers, its front porches and picket
fences, and its fat-tired, chromed-plated bicycles. The mementos we
see during the opening credits are emblems of childhood in an
earlier, simpler time: a slingshot, a jar of marbles, a battered
copy of ``Huckleberry Finn,'' a football signed by Sammy Baugh.
See, parents will say to their children, this is how it was before
television, before Ritalin, before Doom. There were no play dates
back then, just play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip,'' set in a small Mississippi town during World
War II, is shot through with nostalgia for the lost innocence of
childhood and full of rumination (thanks to Harry Connick Jr.'s
raspy-throated voice-over) about the deep wisdom a dog can impart
to a boy. Since children seldom regard themselves as innocent, and
since they are incapable of nostalgia for a time of life they have
yet to see slip away, they may find themselves mystified and a
little bored by a movie designed to leave their adult companions
misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger ones will at least be amused by Skip's charming
pet tricks: He drives the family car, cadges bologna from the
butcher and tries to enlist in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Older children, meanwhile, will sympathize with Skip's young
master as he grapples with the irrationality of adults, the cruelty
of his peers and the advent of puppy love in both its literal and
its metaphorical incarnations. Some, of course, may wonder just
what was so innocent about a time of strict racial segregation,
when grown black men addressed 9-year-old boys _ and their dogs _
as ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' is based on Willie Morris' slender anecdotal
memoir of his carefree youth in Yazoo City, ``an unhurried,
isolated place'' on the edge of the Mississippi Delta. Morris' wry,
inconsequential vignettes _ about spending the night in the town
cemetery, about Skip's performances in backyard football games _
have been threaded together into a narrative bustling with
complication and laden with emotion, and a great deal has been
invented outright.
</P>
<P>
   Willie has been given a next-door neighbor named Dink Jenkins
(Luke Wilson), who leaves for the service a hometown sports hero
and returns home in disgrace, dogged by rumors of overseas
cowardice. Willie's father, Jack (Kevin Bacon), himself an
embittered war veteran _ he lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War _
is at once remote and overprotective. When Willie receives Skip as
a birthday present, Jack threatens, for reasons that are not
terribly clear or convincing, to send the poor pooch away. But
Skip's frolicsome good nature is enough to melt the stoniest heart,
and Jack and Willie learn important lessons about love, loyalty and
the bonds between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is in the book, but Russell and his screenwriter,
Gail Gilchriest, clearly felt they needed more drama than Morris'
leisurely narrative could supply.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, stoically disregarding the wild implausibility of his
character's past, delivers a beautifully understated performance,
as does Diane Lane, who plays Willie's mother, Ellen. As Willie,
the squinchy-faced Frankie Muniz _ who may become the first child
media sensation of the new century, thanks to his starring role in
the new Fox television series ``Malcolm in the Middle'' _ is nearly
as irresistible as Skip, who is impersonated by no fewer than six
eminently capable Jack Russell terriers. Caitlin Wachs is witty and
appealing as Rivers Applewhite, a sympathetic Becky Thatcher to
Willie's tame Tom Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   These performances, and the lovely Mississippi locations (the
film was shot in picturesque Canton, just up the road from Yazoo
City, which has apparently grown too big and too modern to pass for
its old self), help to make the film's relentless sentimentality
more bearable than it otherwise might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' works best when it sticks with the gentle humor
and pathos of its literary source. But the filmmakers are prone, as
the adult Morris rarely was, to moralizing overstatement.
Everything that happens to young Willie becomes a rite of passage,
and the stages of his life are measured in absurdly precise
increments: His adult voice informs us when he completes the
transit from child to boy, and then from boy to young man. (Morris'
later life included a scholarship to Oxford University, the
editorship of Harper's magazine and a distinguished career as
writer, raconteur and colorful local character.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point the voice-over, needlessly embellishing Morris'
prose, tells us that Skip seemed ``possessed of a wisdom as old as
time itself.'' This seems more than a bit hyperbolic, given that it
describes a creature whose greatest ambition is to reach the toilet
bowl and who chases his tail when commanded to play dead.
</P>

   PINOCHET-BRITAIN (London) _ The British government intends to
release former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet after medical
tests showed he was ``at present unfit to stand trial, and that no
change to that position can be expected.'' The Home Office said
Pinochet's release was subject to legal challenge by Spain, Chile
and other interested parties within the next seven days. (Summary

   GERMANY-POLITICS (Berlin) _ A streak of obstinacy helped Helmut
Kohl unify Germany and persuade his countrymen to abandon their
beloved mark for the euro. But now the same stubbornness that
elevated him to statesmanship appears to be unhinging his Christian
Democratic party and unraveling Kohl's reputation. By Roger Cohen.

   SCOTUS-STATES (Washington) _ Continuing its march in the
direction of states' rights, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
Congress lacked authority to bind state governments to the federal
law that bars discrimination against older workers. The national
policy against age discrimination in employment could not overcome
the states' sovereign immunity from suit in federal court, the 5-4
majority said in the first of five federalism rulings the court is
due to hand down during its current term. By Linda Greenhouse.

   STOWAWAYS-U.S. (Seattle) _ Three people are found dead inside a

   MCCAIN-FLAG (Atlanta) _ Having spent several months saying he
sees both sides of the Confederate Flag issue now raging within
South Carolina, Sen. John McCain has now firmly embraced the
philosophy of the white Southerners trying to keep the old battle
flag flying over the capitol in Columbia. The flag, he said in a
statement distributed to reporters on Monday, is ``a symbol of
heritage.'' By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-MICROSOFT (Undated) _ To the company's adversaries, the
very name ``Microsoft'' suggests menacing power. It has been called
the Death Star, an 800-pound gorilla and worse. And in the
government's sweeping antitrust case, Microsoft was portrayed in
convincing detail as a monopolistic bully. America Online Inc., in
particular, was bent to Microsoft's will, according to court
testimony. But after America Online's move on Monday to buy Time
Warner Inc., the largest merger in history, Microsoft suddenly
seems less threatening. The deal, to be sure, changes none of the
facts in the antitrust case. But antitrust experts say it could
figure into the calculations the court makes on sanctions against
Microsoft, if it loses the case, or in settlement talks. By Steve
Lohr.

nearly identical bid. By Richard Sandomir.

`KING HEDLEY II': GRANDEUR, BETRAYAL AND MURDER, BUT IT'S NO
OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Numbers hover like vultures over the lives
portrayed in ``King Hedley II,'' August Wilson's exhilarating and
unwieldy comic tragedy at the O'Reilly Theater here. The cost of a
coffin, a Greyhound bus ticket, a wedding license, a pearl-handled
revolver: exact prices, often complete with decimal points, glow
demandingly through almost every conversation in this tale of
getting, spending and dying in the Hill District of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hedley II,'' the latest in Wilson's extraordinary cycle
of plays chronicling the black American experience through each
decade of the 20th century, is set in the mid-1980s. It is a time
in which it seems you are what you own, and if you're as poor as
the characters are here, that means your sense of identity is
pretty shaky. Small wonder that in this universe, money clouds the
vision and strangles relationships; indeed, money kills.
</P>
<P>
   Though set in the Age of Reagan, ``Hedley'' directly recalls
another play of a half-century ago: a work in which economic
failure and unpaid bills gnaw like cancer, and an insignificant man
is accorded the stature of a Greek tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Death of a Salesman,'' of course, Arthur Miller's
immortal indictment of a country's worship of success. Whether
consciously or not, Wilson is, on his own terms, answering Miller
here, translating the same themes into a later time and a harsher
economic stratum, where the link between death and lucre is a
shorter, straighter line.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is once again a salesman of sorts, in this
case peddling stolen refrigerators, and a man whose self-worth is
built on self-delusion. And once again, we find him scraping in the
dirt of an urban back yard, desperately planting seeds in a soil
where little grows.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``King Hedley II,'' the inaugural production of the
new O'Reilly Theater, a jewel in the renovation program of the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, feels neither bleak nor depressing. And
though its characters sense their futures shrinking around them,
they themselves never, ever seem small.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Wilson has endowed his struggling souls with a
metaphysical grandeur and a titanic vigor of language that is like
no other dramatist's. As in his finest work to date, ``Joe Turner's
Come and Gone,'' he takes the idea of tragedy and the common man, a
central preoccupation of Miller, to Olympian heights all his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hedley II,'' which is directed by Marion Isaac McClinton,
isn't yet on a level with ``Joe Turner''; it is still very much a
work in progress. At three and a half hours, it feels overly
crowded with ideas and images that finally blunt the impact of one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Embroidering on plot strands and characters established in
Wilson's ``Seven Guitars,'' Hedley's local history and genealogy
may baffle theatergoers new to this playwright. And McClinton
hasn't found a satisfactory way of dealing with the work's reliance
on long, uninterrupted monologues, especially in its second act,
and its lack of fluid transitions to the melodramatic plot moving
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But, ah, what monologues they are: a 35-year-old grandmother's
moment-by-moment speculation on what life must be like for a woman
who hears her son has just been killed in a drive-by shooting; a
66-year-old gambler's recollection of taking inventory of all his
possessions before shooting a man who has cheated him; a
long-retired nightclub singer's description of a rough, satisfying
sexual encounter that still leaves her feeling depleted.
</P>
<P>
   In such speeches, Wilson boldly tackles the big philosophical
questions that most contemporary playwrights shrink from. He
articulates these questions with grounding, often witty detail and
in an inner-city vernacular that soars into both unabashed lyricism
and earthy anecdote. You never feel the language doesn't match the
characters.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, whatever the play's current flaws, it is hard to
imagine a cast better equipped than this one to do justice to that
language. There is pulsing energy in every sentence spoken, and the
arialike monologues are all handled with the assurance of opera
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The plot itself, which unravels before David Gallo's poetically
gritty urban backyard of a set, would seem to be the stuff of
opera: a tale of a mysterious birthright, mystical prophecies,
betrayal and murder. Yet for Wilson's characters, this is in fact
the stuff of everyday life. Accounts of armed robberies and
violent, early deaths run throughout ``Hedley.'' The urge to murder
is part of the emotional fabric of the title character, an
unemployed former convict, played by the imposing Tony Todd.
Speaking of a now dead lover, he says that she made him laugh.
``Everybody else,'' he continues, ``makes me want to kill.''

 PITTSBURGH: to kill.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, more than any of Wilson's other plays, ``Hedley''
ponders what it means to kill in a culture where killing is
commonplace. When you pull a trigger, says one character, you
``know more than most people,'' because you've taken on God's role.
And this play makes searingly clear the heady feeling that such
power affords someone who sees himself as powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedley,'' accordingly, unfolds as a counterpoint of
defeatedness and self-assertion, and it is less a straightforward
narrative than a resonant group portrait of characters whose
relationships with one another and with their pasts summon an
entire, highly complex ethos. There is Todd's Hedley, combustible
with a sense of being thwarted, and the sexually vivid women in his
life, his wife, Tonya (Ella Joyce), who is unhappily pregnant, and
his mother, Ruby (Marlene Warfield), who has fascinating memories
of her promiscuous past.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby has a suitor, Elmore (Charles Brown), who jilted her years
ago and later killed her husband. (It says much about the play that
you don't question Ruby's willingness to take Elmore back.)
Finally, there are Mister (Russell Andrews), Hedley's charmingly
droll best friend, and Stool Pigeon (Mel Winkler), this play's
variation on the mad prophet figure who shows up in all of Wilson's
works.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors inhabit their roles with profound conviction.
They are equally home with their characters' instinctive acceptance
of a brutal reality and of a supernatural order that pervades daily
life. It doesn't jolt when it's announced that an old woman who has
just died was 336 years old, or that Mister keeps asking people in
all earnestness if they see a halo around his head. God is a
frequently invoked figure, and, as Stool Pigeon observes, he is one
mean guy.
</P>
<P>
   So much of ``Hedley'' keeps you airborne that it is disturbing
to find yourself touching ground bumpily as the play draws to its
end. You become aware that Wilson may have justified his
devastating conclusion in thematic terms, but that the catalytic
friction among the characters has been more spoken of than
demonstrated in actual encounters. In particular, the play needs to
elaborate on the significance of its title, of Hedley's
relationship with the long-dead man he believes to have been his
father.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is no denying the transporting, natural
music of ``Hedley,'' and phrases from it haunt the memory, as lines
from Tennessee Williams plays can. It is significant that the
recorded jazz that is used to underscore certain speeches here
feels superfluous. Wilson's characters make their own music, in
symphonies that never fail to exalt, even as they break your heart.

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The actor Charlton Heston and representatives of the
Rev. Fred Phelps took a break from the hectic business of defiling
the memories of murder victims to help Arizona lawmakers open the
state's 2000 legislative session Monday.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Politics would be a boring show if not for entertaining private
citizens willing to step forward and perform lively acts of
community service on the public platform.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Phelps sent parishioners from his Westboro Baptist Church
in Topeka, Kan., to protest the very existence of state Rep. Steve
May, who happens to be a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the reverend and his crew were in town, they
picketed the funeral of former Sen. Barry Goldwater, declaring the
one-time presidential candidate a ``supporter of Sodomites'' who
was destined for hell.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire the pluck of a man who manages to keep one
foot in the computer age and the other solidly in the Stone Age
through a Web site called www.godhatesfags.com.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps' organization also protested at the funeral of gay murder
victim Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Rep. May and the only other openly gay member
of the Legislature, Rep. Ken Cheuvront, weren't even at the Capitol
on Monday. This was fine with the protesters, as long as the TV
cameras showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Phelps and Charlton Heston didn't coordinate their efforts
and have no connection except for one small coincidence: Phelps is
a media-savvy windbag and Heston was invited by a media-savvy
windbag _ House Speaker Jeff Groscost.
</P>
<P>
   Heston appeared before the combined Legislature to deliver the
invocation. In introducing him, Groscost mentioned Heston's films,
his war record, civil rights record, and the positions he's held
with the Screen Actors Guild, a presidential task force and the
American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   What slipped his mind, apparently, was the fact that Heston
happens to be president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   I watched him speak last year at the NRA convention in Denver,
which was held a few weeks after the slaughter at a high school in
nearby Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Many people had asked the NRA to stay away, out of respect for
the dead, to which Heston said, ``Don't come here? . . . This
community is our home.''
</P>
<P>
   At a protest held outside the convention site, the father of one
of the murder victims disagreed, saying, ``The time has come to
understand that the TEC-9 semiautomatic weapon . . . like the one
that killed my son, is not used to kill deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the actor who portrayed Moses descended from the
mountaintop to address the burning bush-leaguers at our
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish for you the courage to be unpopular,'' Heston told the
politicians, apparently unaware how well they maintain their
unpopularity without it.
</P>
<P>
   These are men and women who say 2000 is the year they'll begin
rebuilding Arizona's crumbling schools and supplying them with the
latest technology. They decided to do this after first having spent
a fortune creating and redecorating caucus rooms at the Capitol and
giving each legislator a fancy new laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hey _ maybe our politicians are entertaining after all.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they're not, there's always next session, when
they'll have to put on another opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver the invocation, perhaps Speaker Groscost will invite
that well-known violin player and classical music expert Louis
Farrakhan. &QL;

   PHOENIX - The actor Charlton Heston and representatives of the
Rev. Fred Phelps took a break from the hectic business of defiling
the memories of murder victims to help Arizona lawmakers open the
state's 2000 legislative session Monday.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Politics would be a boring show if not for entertaining private
citizens willing to step forward and perform lively acts of
community service on the public platform.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Phelps sent parishioners from his Westboro Baptist Church
in Topeka, Kan., to protest the very existence of state Rep. Steve
May, who happens to be a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the reverend and his crew were in town, they
picketed the funeral of former Sen. Barry Goldwater, declaring the
one-time presidential candidate a ``supof Sodomites'' who
was destined for hell.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire the pluck of a man who manages to keep one
foot in the computer age and the other solidly in the Stone Age
through a Web site called www.godhatesfags.com.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps' organization also protested at the funeral of gay murder
victim Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Rep. May and the only other openly gay member
of the Legislature, Rep. Ken Cheuvront, weren't even at the Capitol
on Monday. This was fine with the protesters, as long as the TV
cameras showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Phelps and Charlton Heston didn't coordinate their efforts
and have no connection except for one small coincidence: Phelps is
a media-savvy windbag and Heston was invited by a media-savvy
windbag _ House Speaker Jeff Groscost.
</P>
<P>
   Heston appeared before the combined Legislature to deliver the
invocation. In introducing him, Groscost mentioned Heston's films,
his war record, civil rights record, and the positions he's held
with the Screen Actors Guild, a presidential task force and the
American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   What slipped his mind, apparently, was the fact that Heston
happens to be president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   I watched him speak last year at the NRA convention in Denver,
which was held a few weeks after the slaughter at a high school in
nearby Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Many people had asked the NRA to stay away, out of respect for
the dead, to which Heston said, ``Don't come here? . . . This
community is our home.''
</P>
<P>
   At a protest held outside the convention site, the father of one
of the murder victims disagreed, saying, ``The time has come to
understand that the TEC-9 semiautomatic weapon . . . like the one
that killed my son, is not used to kill deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the actor who portrayed Moses descended from the
mountaintop to address the burning bush-leaguers at our
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish for you the courage to be unpopular,'' Heston told the
politicians, apparently unaware how well they maintain their
unpopularity without it.
</P>
<P>
   These are men and women who say 2000 is the year they'll begin
rebuilding Arizona's crumbling schools and supplying them with the
latest technology. They decided to do this after first having spent
a fortune creating and redecorating caucus rooms at the Capitol and
giving each legislator a fancy new laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hey _ maybe our politicians are entertaining after all.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they're not, there's always next session, when
they'll have to put on another opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver the invocation, perhaps Speaker Groscost will invite
that well-known violin player and classical music expert Louis
Farrakhan. &QL;

JETS OWNERSHIP SETTLED, IT'S TIME FOR BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The $635 million question: With the NFL Finance
Committee having approved the sale of the New York Jets to Robert
Wood Johnson IV for that price Tuesday, will committee chairman Bob
Kraft and Johnson discuss the issue of compensation for Bill
Belichick in the near future?
</P>
<P>
   No answer was coming from either side Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least now Kraft knows which owner he'll be dealing with in
this matter. Will Johnson appreciate that Kraft helped get the sale
through without a hitch and in turn work out a compensation package
to free Belichick of his Jets contract before Thursday's grievance
hearing before commissioner Paul Tagliabue?
</P>
<P>
   Belichick will insist that the remaining three years on his
contract are now void because Johnson, not the late Leon Hess, is
the owner of the franchise, and Belichick is being illegally
prevented from negotiating with other teams for a bigger title and
paycheck. The Jets will argue that the contract is binding.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a person close to Belichick's legal situation floated
the possibility that there has been some singlemindedness
concerning Belichick and the Patriots _ that he, in fact, may be
interested in other teams. Posturing on behalf of Belichick?
Perhaps, but the source said there are openings in New Orleans and
Green Bay and there may be others in Pittsburgh and Oakland. Dallas
also opened up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Would Belichick pull an end-around on the Patriots as he is
doing with the Jets? This is an interesting but improbable
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson must go through the formality of league approval next
Tuesday in New York; 24 of 31 teams must vote in favor of the sale.
The heir to the Johnson &AMP; Johnson pharmaceutical empire got
unanimous approval from the eight-man Finance Committee, beating
out the bid of Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan. Technically,
Johnson isn't supposed to conduct any team business until after
Tuesday's vote, but the old ``wink and handshake'' that NFL owners
are famous for could take place before that. The league does allow
Johnson to speak to his top man, Bill Parcells, on team issues.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may not want to start his tenure with a dispute over
someone who will never coach the Jets, anyway. Especially if
Parcells returns to coach for another season to make the new
owner's transition smooth. If that's the case, Johnson may want to
get a quick settlement with Belichick and try to build the Jets
through prime draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said through the Jets' public relations staff, ``I'm
looking forward to meeting Mr. Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess's son, John, who inherited the team from his late father,
said, ``The late Leon Hess was the proud owner of the Jets since
1963. He had a special love for the team and its many loyal fans.
The Hess family will remain strong supporters of the Jets and wish
Mr. Johnson, Bill Parcells and the entire Jets organization and
players every success in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who was contractually promoted to head coach when
Parcells stepped aside at season's end, said he resigned from the
Jets organization in part because the sale was dragging on and he
didn't know what to expect from the new owner. After Hess's death
last May, the team was appraised at $360 million, but Johnson and
Dolan kept upping the ante, competing with each other, until the
bids were finally sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dolan already owns the New York Rangers, New York
Knicks, and Madison Square Garden, NFL owners were hoping to avoid
a multi-ownership scenario; in the end they did. Under Dolan, the
Rangers and Knicks managers must report to Dave Checketts, who runs
Dolan's sports operation. Belichick is said to have frowned upon
such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots have been waiting for the Belichick issue to
work itself out, they have been interviewing other candidates such
as Chicago offensive coordinator Gary Crowton, Oakland defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw, Baltimore defensive coordinator Marvin
Lewis, and Patriots defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   They also interviewed Marv Levy, the 74-year-old former coach of
the Buffalo Bills, who wanted to speak to Kraft about coaching the
Patriots. The team doesn't appear to be interested in Levy in that
capacity, but wouldn't mind having him as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still twisting in the wind, at least from a public perspective,
is Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier, who may
already know his fate. Grier has been part of the interview process
in Foxborough, while the Krafts have conducted interviews at their
office in Boston. Grier is the only football man who has
interviewed candidates for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't stay in New England, Grier may be a candidate for
the GM jobs in New Orleans and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the head of football operations in the organization _
which Grier has been _ interviews coaching candidates, and the
finalist meets with the owner. In this case, the owner has been the
primary interviewer. Kraft has been trying to dispel the perception
that he is too involved in football matters, but this process has
not helped that. It was Kraft who fired Pete Carroll, standing
alone at the announcement.

 &HT;    Fisk, Perez voted into MLB's Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They are rivals, and later one-year teammates, who
will be linked forever by one of the most memorable World Series.
This summer, Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez will be inducted into the
Baseball Hall of Fame together.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk is a 24-year veteran who played more games (2,226) and hit
more homers (351) than any other catcher. He was named on 79.6
percent of the 499 ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball
Writers' Association of America; the minimum requirement was 75
percent. Still uncertain over whether he will wear a White Sox or
Red Sox cap on his plaque, Fisk is just the 12th catcher admitted
to the Hall and the first since Johnny Bench in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a 23-year veteran who endured a nine-year wait before
drawing enough votes, made the Hall with 10 votes to spare (385).
His RBI total (1,652) was the highest by any player not already in
the Hall of Fame. The third member of the Big Red Machine era, with
Bench and Joe Morgan, Perez spent 1980 as a teammate of Fisk in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if nine years was too long to wait for admittance, Perez
said, ``No, it doesn't matter. It's sweet now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing third in this year's vote was Jim Rice with 257 (118
votes short of admission), followed by Gary Carter (248), Bruce
Sutter (192) and Goose Gossage, whose 166 votes were the most by
any of the 14 first-year eligible players.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Brave Dale Murphy, in his second year of
consideration, was 10th at 116 votes. Murphy picked up 20 new votes
over his 1999 total. He hit 398 homers and drove in 1,266 runs, was
named on 23 percent of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Induction ceremonies will be held July 23 in Cooperstown, N.Y.
The veterans committee, which conducts a separate vote on
overlooked players, meets Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk received the news in the kitchen of his Lockport, Ill.,
home. Although his career forever will be linked to his
12th-inning, game-winning home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World
Series, he recalled that Perez's two-run homer in Game 7 was
instrumental in Cincinnati winning the series.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk becomes just the six catcher voted in by the BBWAA, and
only the fourth voted in over the last 45 years. In Tuesday's
tally, Carter, an 11-time All Star, received just 49.6 percent of
the vote, while Bob Boone did not receive the requisite 5 percent
to remain on the ballot and will not appear on future ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes lost in the transition is just how hard catching
is,'' said Fisk, who estimated that he missed the equivalent of six
seasons because of injury. ``And when you have people who perform
it with some competency and make it look easy, it's not. And as a
result, some of what you do gets lost in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who was in his apartment in Puerto Rico when he was
informed of the vote, celebrated first with a phone call to his
88-year-old mother Teodora, who lives in Cuba. Although a special
media campaign might have helped the former first baseman in the
ninth ballot, he would not qualify the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Perez said, ``I feel so good, it's like I didn't
wait so long.''

FISK'S NEW ENGLAND ROOTS GO DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He grew up in a culture of covered bridges, dairy
farms, cordwood, maple syrup, and screened-in porches. The houses
are far apart, the nights Kafka black, and Carlton Fisk is old
enough to remember the voice of Curt Gowdy crackling through the
darkness in delightful description of Ted Williams's latest
upper-deck shot in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up hating the Yankees. More than anything, that's what
makes him a true New Englander, and that's why no matter what he
says, he'll represent the Boston Red Sox when he strolls into
Cooperstown in July.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and former teammate and rival Tony Perez got the
much-awaited phone call Tuesday afternoon, informing them that the
Baseball Writers of America had elected them to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his lifetime in baseball, Fisk said, ``You try
to pay attention to what you're supposed to be doing, playing the
game. To get the ultimate recognition, the vote to the Hall of
Fame, after growing up in small town of 800 people and playing 12
high school games a year, well, you never dream this will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk actually played more games for the White Sox than he did
for the Carmine Hose, and he's coy about his Cooperstown identity,
saying, ``I have thought about it. I think I have to think about it
a little more. I'm going to reserve the final decision on that for
a little while. Both places are places I enjoyed playing. Chicago
and Boston. Too bad I couldn't wear both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. We'll give him a little while to have his fun with the folks
of Chicago. But we know he's ours. Carlton Fisk is a New Englander,
and that's why his July induction should be a summer holiday for
every New England ball fan. He was born in Bellows Falls, Vt., and
grew up in Charlestown, N.H., where his proud parents, Cecil and
Leona, still live.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Alan Shepard was the biggest thing to hit New
Hampshire when Fisk was in grade school. Derry citizens put a
mini-rocket in the center of downtown after homeboy Shepard flew
into space. Maybe in Charlestown they'll honor Fisk with a yellow
facsimile Fenway foul pole _ like the one he struck on that October
night a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was a tall catcher who could run, hit, and throw. His
baseball gifts were initially veiled by the nasty April-May climate
of our region. The theory holds that there are not enough games to
produce Hall of Famer hitters around here. Tony Conigliaro might
have been one, but he was felled by a headhunting fastball.
Post-'50s New England has been fertile ground for some nifty middle
infielders (Mark Belanger, Jerry Remy, Greg Gagne, Gary DiSarcina)
and considerable pitching talent (Tom Glavine, Jeff Reardon, Steve
Bedrosian, John Tudor, Ken Hill, Brian Rose), but hitters are hard
to find. There's not enough warmth and too many rainouts. Our lads
simply don't get enough swings against live pitching.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Fisk was best-known for basketball when he played in
Charlestown and his hoop game earned him a scholarship to the
University of New Hamspshire. He was almost two full years out of
high school when the Red Sox selected him in the 1967 January
draft. Five years later, he was American League Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   His career numbers are staggering. Fisk played in 2,499 games,
including a record 2,226 behind the plate. He hit 376 home runs, a
recored 351 as a catcher. He played 24 seasons and drove home 1,330
runs. He won a Gold Glove and led the league in triples as a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Though he won't commit to the Red Sox, he has been employed by
the Boston organization and still has hard feelings toward the
Chicago organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that is water under the bridge, but some of the issues
have never been adressed,'' he said. ``There are still scars. It's
not all the water under the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strained relationship has nothing to do with the people in
Chicago, the fans. The community has been so nice and so receptive.
The strained relationship is with nobody other than the White Sox.
As far as it being resolved, I do not know whether it will happen
or ever be approached.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk is the first catcher elected to the Hall since Johnny Bench
got the call with Carl Yastrzemski in 1988. Nice symmetry there.
Bench and Yaz were warriors in the 1975 World Series, a landmark
baseball event that forever will thank Fisk for its signature
moment. Now we have Fisk and Perez walking hand-in-hand to
baseball's promised land. And you can expect 1975 Reds manager
Sparky Anderson to get the nod when the Hall's Veterans Committee
convenes in March.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 World Series is sure to be stamped all over this
summer's induction. Fisk is remembered for his historic homer
(voted the No. 1 sports video clip of all time by TV Guide), but
Sox fans regrettably remember that it was Perez's Game 7 homer one
day later on a Bill Lee eephus pitch that cut Boston's 3-0 lead to
3-2. Fisk and Perez later became Red Sox teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a crusher when Tony hit that home run,''
Fisk said. ``That's why he's so valuable. He was always driving in
big runs. We came up with the wrong formula on that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez makes the Hall after an arduous nine years on the ballot.
Fisk goes in on his second try. He missed election last year by a
mere 43 votes while George Brett, Nolan Ryan, and Robin Yount all
gained first year-induction. Fisk was disappointed when he didn't
make the cut with the three greats, but by waiting a year he'll get
more attention at the 2000 induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat disappointed last year,'' he acknowledged. ``I
was as good at my position in the same period of time as they were
at their positions. And catching is such a unique position. This is
the culmination of waiting 35 years since I started playing this
game. It's quite a proud moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Fisk was named one of the top 100 players of the
century when the All-Star Game came to Boston. He said the honor
made the hair on his arms stand up. He caught Williams's first
pitch when the Splendid Splinter threw out the first ball at the
All-Star Game, then came back to make his own first-ball toss when
the Sox played the Yankees in the American League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   He still has a lively dislike of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rivalry between New Youk and Boston was great,'' he said.
``I think it's a good competitive feeling. When we get done
playing, that's the feeling we miss most.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's a New Englander. That's why he goes into the
Hall as a member of the Red Sox.

SOCIALIST CANDIDATE IN CHILE COURTS WOMEN VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (With PINOCHET-BRITAIN) 
(mg) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Ricardo Lagos, the Socialist presidential
candidate in the runoff election on Sunday, has a new campaign
poster showing his wife, Luisa, leaning her head on his shoulder in
a pose that suggests a traditional dependency on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In a new television ad, Carmen, Lagos' 35-year-old daughter,
speaks of the man behind her father's somber veneer. ``My father is
tremendously sensitive,'' she said, a camera close-up accentuating
her earnest eyes. ``He is moved emotionally by the smallest
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos is making an 11th-hour effort to win women voters in order
to salvage his chances in the runoff against Joaquin Lavin, the
conservative candidate once considered the darkest of dark horses.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Lagos was viewed as a virtual shoo-in to
become the first Socialist president elected in Chile since
Salvador Allende was overthrown in a military coup 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters had another idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the first-round balloting, on Dec. 12, men gave 50.9 percent
of their votes to Lagos and 44.1 percent to Lavin, a former aide to
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the coup leader, who also served as mayor of
a Santiago neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But women favored Lavin by 50.6 percent to 45.4 percent for
Lagos, denying Lagos a majority and forcing a second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lagos does not fit the perfect profile for many Chilean
women,'' said Loreta Rebolledo, an anthropologist at the University
of Chile. ``He comes from the world of radical politics, he's known
as an agnostic and he's been married two times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chilean society it's the woman who takes the children to
church and catechism,'' she said, ``and Lagos does not fit their
model of the monogamous, conservative man.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilean women have traditionally favored conservative
candidates, and they had consistently voted against Allende when he
ran four times for president between 1952 and 1970. In a 1988
referendum on whether to allow Pinochet to have a second term as
president, men voted by 3-to-2 against him, while women voted
against him by the slimmest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   But the gender gap displayed last month was much wider than in
recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say about two-thirds of the people who voted for the
governing Socialist-Christian Democratic coalition in the 1993
presidential election, but who switched to Lavin in the first-round
balloting in December, were women. According to polling, they were
mostly disadvantaged women who are religious and concerned about
crime, health care, education and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos is fighting back by revamping his campaign. He is touting
his record as education minister, when he worked to expand college
scholarships for the needy and special help for pregnant teen-age
students. He is making more direct appeals to religious groups,
particularly Evangelical Christian ministers who are increasingly
popular among poor women.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos also fired his campaign manager and replaced him with a
woman, former Justice Minister Soledad Alvear, a respected
Christian Democrat with ties to the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach these women voters with a more caring, warmer
message,'' said Eugenio Tironi, the communications director of the
Lagos campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tironi conceded that many women were concerned that electing a
Socialist president could return Chile to a cycle of polarization
harking back to Pinochet's overthrow of Allende. ``They are afraid
of confrontation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To calm those concerns, Lagos has overhauled his campaign with
messages of peace and unity blended with soft music and bright,
happy colors. In one ad, Ms. Alvear talks about women flocking to
Lagos while she carries a bunch of red roses. The new ads are an
amalgam of images of working women _ a housekeeper merrily stirring
a pot in the kitchen, tomato packers dancing while they work,
laughing beauty parlor workers, a Mapuche Indian woman making a
phone call and a breast-feeding mother.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the men who are shown _ a Catholic priest, a
military cadet, a man making his wedding vows _ are intended to
warm the hearts of more traditional women.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes in campaign tactics have been more than style.
During the first-round campaign, Lagos caused a stir by suggesting
that he might move to liberalize Chile's strict bans on abortion
and divorce. But in recent weeks, he reiterated several times that
he does not intend to try to change the laws, a move that has
frustrated some of his younger, more affluent women supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's supporters say Lagos' campaign tinkering will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility comes with consistency, and they are creating the
impression of incoherence,'' said Francisco de la Maza, Lavin's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' aides say the women's vote can be turned around, noting
that President Eduardo Frei, who ran on the same center-left
coalition as Lagos, won 66.6 percent of the women's vote in 1993 _
only 3 percentage points less than his 69.4 percent vote among men.
Still, Frei is a Christian Democrat, not a Socialist like Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent campaign swing through the farm region south of
Santiago, Lagos tailored his message to women. Volunteers passed
out bright yellow campaign buttons that said ``Women for Lagos''
and pamphlets that listed a panoply of women-oriented initiatives
launched by the ruling center-left coalition _ including plans to
punish family violence, pay higher wages to teachers and extend
full legal rights to children born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   After walking through the town of Chimbarongo arm in arm with
his wife, Lagos told a rally that he will make rural health care
and education his top priority. And he added, ``We have to make the
lives of women seasonal workers better _ giving them dignified work
and good child care during their work hours.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finished, he lifted a Mapuche woman up to the platform,
gave her a hug and kissed her on the cheek. As a television camera
swung closer, he kissed her again.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lagos traveled to the town of Chepica, where he walked the
dirt streets in search for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Navarro, one of Chepica's 5,000 fruit farmers, told him
his vote was solid because he liked Lago's economic plank. But
Navarro's pregnant wife, Jimena Uvilla, said that she had voted for
Lavin in the first round because she liked his easy-going style and
his big handsome family.
</P>
<P>
   Under the shade of a grape arbor in front of their wooden shack,
Lagos did some gentle arm-twisting, promising Ms. Uvilla that he
would bring little Chepica more jobs and better schools. She gave
in, and pledged to switch her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the men's vote,'' Lagos said as he climbed back in his
van for more door to door campaigning. ``The women's vote is more
work.''

STATE DEPARTMENT FAULTS CHINA ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that
China's human rights record has continued to deteriorate and that
the United States would again sponsor a United Nations resolution
criticizing the Beijing government for its crackdown on political
dissent and religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the State Department is sure to offend China
at a time when the United States is seeking to improve diplomatic
and economic ties with Beijing. Just Monday, President Clinton
urged Congress to vote ``at the earliest possible time'' for a
trade deal with China that was negotiated in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's human rights record has continued to deteriorate,''
said State Department spokesman James P. Rubin. ``The goal here,
through this international action, is to shine an international
spotlight directly on China's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year, the government of China intensified its
crackdown on political dissent, initiated a campaign to suppress
the Falun Gong and intensified controls on unregistered churches
and on the political and religious expression of ethnic minority
groups, especially Tibetans.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which has
attracted millions of followers in China, have recently been
sentenced to harsh prison sentences in Chinese courts.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution will be introduced before the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, which meets each March in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, including last year, the United States was an
annual sponsor of a resolution to condemn China's human rights
record. Washington did not sponsor a resolution in 1998, citing
what it said at the time were improvements in the record. The
resolution sponsored by the United States last year was rejected by
the full commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the State Department announcement Tuesday may annoy
Chinese leaders, it may make it easier for the administration to
win congressional endorsement for the trade deal, which would allow
China to join the World Trade Organization in exchange for dramatic
reforms in Chinese trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers have suggested that they will oppose the trade
deal as coddling a nation with an abysmal human rights record.
Tuesday's announcement appears to have been timed to show Congress
that the administration is prepared to get tough on China's record
at the same time that it is pushing for closer trade ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can have a relationship with China and still have a
fundamental disagreement with China on specific issues,'' Rubin
said. ``We engage with China to advance our national interests. As
the president said yesterday, we are going to pursue the World
Trade Organization issue with respect to normal trade relations.
But that doesn't meant that we have to forgo our principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Chinese leaders were informed Tuesday of the
administration's intention to support a new resolution to condemn
Beijing's record. ``That was done at a fairly high level this
morning'' he said. ``China clearly doesn't want this to happen. But
the best way for China to not have this happen is for it to make
improvements in its record, significant improvements.''

THINKING GREAT THOUGHTS WITHOUT GREAT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mont., Mo., Ariz., Calif., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dwight MacDonald, the acerbic essayist, once described the Ford
Foundation as a large body of money surrounded by people who want
some. The Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management,
with little money, is a pool of management wisdom for all who
choose to dip their cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Drucker Foundation, a decade old, survives on the quality of
its educational offerings, spending less than $2 million a year,
living without the security of an endowment. Its staff of six works
out of donated offices at Mutual of America headquarters on Park
Avenue in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an anomaly,'' said Frances Hesselbein, the founding
president and now board chairman of the foundation. ``We have no
money. We deal only in intellectual capital. We don't make grants.
We bring great thought leaders together with the leaders of the
nonprofit sector.''
</P>
<P>
   By a conservative count, the nonprofit sector in this country
includes more than a million organizations, employing 10 million
people, from the president of Harvard to the blood bank director to
the parish priest. Since Tocqueville's day, astute observers have
pronounced this web of voluntary associations, also called the
social sector, the fabric of American democracy. Almost certainly,
more people _ one out of two adults _ will serve as volunteers in
nonprofit groups this year than will vote for president. ``It is
not business, it is not government, it is the social sector that
may yet save the society,'' Mrs. Hesselbein declared in an
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's inspiration and honorary chairman is Drucker,
the management thinker. But it is Mrs. Hesselbein who has made
things happen. In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom for her achievements as head of the Girl Scouts from 1976
through 1990, including tripling minority membership. Undoubtedly,
she is the only chief executive to appear on the cover of Business
Week surrounded by Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The medal also cited her Drucker Foundation contributions to the
discipline of managing nonprofits. Her primary advice to these
service groups is to ``revisit the mission'' _ to sharpen and
clarify what they are all about. Even more than in business, the
mission statement is critical to a nonprofit's cause, because its
purpose, not paychecks or profits, is what motivates people to
work. It is ``the most powerful way to mobilize people,'' she said.
And the message should be short. ``Peter says it should fit on a
T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drucker Foundation is known for the self-assessment program
it developed for nonprofit organizations around five questions that
one participant called ``as sharply edged as a bayonet'': What is
our mission? Who is our customer? What does the customer value?
What are our results? What is our plan?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with financial support from Dayton Hudson, the
foundation conducted more than 60 workshops all around the country,
attracting some 3,000 leaders of nonprofit groups. The exercise can
last from two months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole focus is on performance and results,'' Mrs.
Hesselbein said. Without profit as a yardstick, service groups are
compelled to devise other effective measures, not only as a compass
for themselves but as a way to demonstrate results to those who
provide the money. ``Donors do not reward good intentions,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation throws a spotlight on outstanding community
groups through an annual $25,000 award for nonprofit innovation.
Last year it went to the California Emergency Foodlink of
Sacramento for a program that trained the hardcore unemployed as
truck drivers and bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's Web site (www.pfdf.org) attracts 1,200 to 1,300
hits a day, triple the rate of a year ago. It features the
self-assessment process as well as the foundation's Leader to
Leader magazine and the writings of Mrs. Hesselbein and Drucker. It
has introduced an ``innovation of the week,'' a capsule profile
drawn from the hundreds of successful community programs submitted
for the annual award.
</P>
<P>
   A key objective at the foundation is to dismantle the walls
separating the nonprofit, business and government sectors. It
contends that good management is good management, in no matter what
sector, and it has pushed leaders of nonprofits to think of
themselves in the same league as their business counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   With that stance, the foundation's constituency has evolved into
an unusual communion of pragmatic community organizations and
cerebral management theorists. Thinkers like Peter M. Senge (who
wrote ``The Fifth Discipline'') and popular authors like Stephen R.
Covey (who wrote ``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'')
speak at the foundation's conferences and contribute to its
published works.
</P>
<P>
   Their audience is more down to earth _ groups like the
Intermountain Children's Home in Helena, Mont.; the Arizona
Cactus-Pine Girl Scout Council in Phoenix, and the Central
Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis. Delegates from these groups
were among 400 participants at the foundation's annual conference
in Los Angeles in November.
</P>
<P>
   Leader to Leader, the foundation's quarterly, brims with
high-toned reflections on management. It is not cheap ($99 a year
to nonprofit subscribers, $149 to others); it has a paid
circulation of 7,000. The current issue features Stephen Jay Gould,
the Harvard paleontologist, on lessons for organizational theory
from biology and evolution. In an essay, Dee Hock, chief executive
emeritus of Visa International, applies chaos theory to management.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's latest anthology, ``Leading Beyond the Walls''
(Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco, 1999), includes such
management authors as Jim Collins, C.K. Prahalad, Regina E.
Herzlinger and Arun Gandhi, along with Senge and Covey. The
collection is rich with provocative and visionary points of view.
Collins, for instance, argues that hierarchical organization is
sorely out of date. Authority will flow more from peer recognition
than from rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a leader,'' he wrote, ``if and only if people follow
your leadership when they have freedom not to.'' One day, Collins
predicted, we will look back on the present system of a single job
with a fixed employer as ``a somewhat barbaric form of
organization, much the way we view indentured servitude today.''

 &HT;    Democrats look for ways to implement reforms while inticing
voters
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Bill Bradley returns to New Hampshire
today after a week in Iowa to participate in a presidential forum
on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of organizers, Bradley will be the only
presidential candidate in attendance. Vice President Al Gore,
Bradley's rival, will be in Iowa. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the
only Republican candidate to aggressively promote campaign finance
reform, will be in New Hampshire promoting a new tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that (Gore) might take advantage of this
opportunity,'' said New Hampshire Common Cause president Scott
Harshbarger, who will moderate the forum. ``It would have been an
advantage to him to come and engage on this topic.''
</P>
<P>
   How to repair public trust in elections and limit the influence
of special interests in Washington has become a central issue
between Gore and Bradley in the race for the Democratic nomination.
With the help of McCain on the Republican side, campaign finance
reform has been debated and discussed more in campaign 2000 than in
any other presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Bradley and Gore have championed the cause of
reform in office and on the campaign trail, there are sharp
differences between the two on what the next president should do.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is pushing a plan for public financing of Congressional
elections which would give candidates a fixed sum to spend in the
general election in return for accepting spending limits. Bradley
is also pushing for free television time for candidates in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary, Bradley would still allow donors to contribute
up to $1,000 to candidates, but he would subsidize contributions of
up to $250 with a two to one federal match. A condition of
receiving public subsidies would be that candidates would have to
appear together on the same stage at least twice during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his proposal would cost taxpayers $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he is also in favor of public financing. But unlike
Bradley, he has not outlined a specific plan, or said how much it
would cost. Gore also says he supports reform modeled on
legislation sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.).
The legislation would ban soft money and force third party groups
to collect and spend money under the same restrictions candidates
face when they run advertising that features a particular candidate
60 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings scholar Thomas Mann, an expert on campaign finance
reform, said that Bradley has emphasized campaign finance reform
more in his campaign, but noted that both candidates had supported
a range of campaign finance proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley instinctively finds all private money in politics
inappropriate even though he's very good at raising it and Gore
probably sees a role for private money,'' Mann said. ``You can
choose between them on intensity and centrality, but you can't
really do so on the basis of their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sought to deflect the campaign finance issue by
challenging Bradley to voluntarily end television advertising
during their campaign and instead hold twice weekly debates.
Although Bradley has dismissed the offer as a ploy, it has gained
favor among some voters, according to the Washington Post, which
gauged reaction to it in voter focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that senator Bradley, after talking and talking,
isn't willing to walk the walk,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also asserted that Bradley didn't actually sponsor
campaign finance reform legislation until he was preparing to leave
the Senate in 1996. Gore sponsored campaign finance measures both
in the House and in the Senate beginning in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bradley co-sponsored campaign finance legislation in
the Senate beginning in 1986 with Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and
Joe Biden (D-Del.). The legislation provided for public financing
and curtailed contributions from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley was actively involved from at least 1985,'' said
Jonathan Winer, a Gore supporter and Kerry's Senate counsel from
1985 to 1994, who drafted the legislation. ``He was there when we
needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Congress passed the first campaign finance reform bill
to reach the president's desk since the post-Watergate reforms.
President Bush vetoed the bill. Bradley was a Senate co-sponsor of
the bill. Gore was not, although he voted for the bill and, along
with Bradley, later voted to override Bush's veto. The override
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has been making claims about Bradley's record that are
simply not true,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21,
which advocates public financing of elections. ``He is misstating
Bradley's campaign finance position and exaggerating his own role
in the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said it is fair to criticize Bradley's
Senate record because Bradley was not the original sponsor of any
reform legislation until 1996, while Gore authored several pieces
of reform legislation over his Congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of his stand on public financing, Bradley has
emerged as the favorite among the hard-core activists in the
campaign finance reform movement. But even they note that Bradley's
plan doesn't provide for pubic financing in primaries, meaning that
candidates will still be soliciting private sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have a system where early hard money is something
the candidates have to chase,'' said Nick Nyhart, deputy director
of Public Campaign, a Washington group that advocates complete
public financing of elections.

   Someone who's had much influence on my life is Sister
Marcellina, my eighth-grade teacher. She would say, ``For you to
get 100 on a test is average, so you have to do extra work.'' I
thought this was grossly unfair. I told her she was ruining my
life. But I did it. She taught me to go the extra mile. I still
write her at least once a year. When we talk, it's not about
business. It's about what I'm doing as a human being. This summer
when my mother died, she was incredibly helpful to me. When I
received the Sara Lee Frontrunner Award this year, I took Sister
Marcellina with me to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Northwest Washington. My mom wasn't keen on me
riding a bike on the sidewalk, so I never learned. But then my
husband, Rich, who's a great biker, taught my kids how to ride, and
they'd always tell me I had to learn. Finally, my husband got me a
bike and it sat in the garage for two years. Then two years ago, on
July 4 weekend, I decided I was going to learn to ride it. I wanted
to go on a biking trip through India. We'd go out early in the
morning because I didn't want anyone to see me, and my poor husband
would run alongside me, holding me up. I fell a few times, but by
the third day I could ride it. Once I decide I want to do
something, I do it. I'm fearless.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marcellina pushed for me to go to a challenging high
school, so I left my friends and went to an all-girls school,
Immaculata Preparatory School in Washington. After that I swore I
would go to a coed college. But I met a woman one summer in
Washington who was a student at Simmons College, a woman's college
in Boston, and she convinced me it wasn't so bad. Going to Simmons
was the best thing I could have done. Everything you read about
all-girls schools giving girls more confidence was true for me.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after I got to Simmons I went up to Bowdoin College,
a men's school in Brunswick, Maine, for homecoming. I met Rich
there, and we got married in my sophomore year. I had my two boys
young _ I was still in college when my older son was born _ and I'm
glad I did it that way. I was very organized; I'd cook on Sundays
for the rest of the week. When I went away on a weeklong business
trip, I'd line up the boys' outfits for each day of the week on a
big cedar chest we had in the hallway. I'd leave notes all over the
house for my husband. Part of my talent for organizing comes from
having chores when I was growing up. I remember Sister Marcellina
saying ``Use your minutes _ there's always enough time for
everything if you use your minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm still trying to figure out why I went into business. My
three best friends in the world _ whom I know from elementary
school _ used to say I'd end up being a boss, because I was always
telling them what to do. The first job I had was at Hecht's
department store in Washington. I was one of five or six teen-agers
who would advise teen customers on what fashions were hot. The only
experience I had with business was retailing. But by the time I
finished at Simmons, I thought about business more broadly, and
went to Harvard to get my MBA.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Bixby, a former general manager at General Mills, taught me
to look at failure as a pathway to success. Ned used to give
Raspberry Awards to recognize people who'd done something bad or
stupid. But, thank God, I never got that award.

 &HT;    Delta finishes Comair deal; new unit will run regionals
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines has completed its buyout of regional
affiliate Comair and created a subsidiary to oversee all regional
connection operations.
</P>
<P>
   Delta paid about $1.8 billion, or $23.50 a share, for
Cincinnati-based Comair, which primarily provides connecting
service in the Midwest and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions on how to receive payment will be mailed soon to
Comair's former shareholders, Delta said.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout, announced in October, followed a similar deal last
spring in which Delta took control of Atlanta-based regional
affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines. Delta paid about $650
million for ASA, also through a tender offer to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's goal was to absorb the smaller carriers' strong balance
sheets, improve their service and gain control of their growing
fleets of new regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-jets are redefining the relationship between major
carriers and their regional feeders, which traditionally flew
turboprops between hubs and smaller cities in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   Regional jets fly faster and farther, allowing more routing
flexibility. For instance, ASA just started nonstop flights in
50-seat jets between Atlanta and Manchester, N.H. _ a route Delta
could not justify with larger planes. Regional jets also are used
on busy routes at off-peak times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regional jets support growth of Delta's mainline service
through enhanced traffic feed to our hubs, while freeing Delta jets
for more profitable and efficient use on longer-haul flights and
new destinations,'' said Fred Reid, Delta's marketing chief.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is chairman of the newly formed subsidiary, Delta
Connection Inc., which will manage regional connection operations.
It will manage Comair and ASA, and will oversee Delta's contractual
deals with other independent regional airlines, such as Utah-based
SkyWest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Comair chief David Siebenburgen will be chief executive
officer of the subsidiary.

LOWFARE AIRLINE AIMS TO BUILD ON ATTITUDE AND HOSTILITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jetblue Airways, the new low-fare airline scheduled
to begin service out of John F. Kennedy International Airport next
month, is relying on a heavy dose of New York attitude to promote
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Feb. 11, the carrier will initially operate two
round-trip flights daily from JFK to both Buffalo and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. The flights, which will be on new Airbus A320
planes, will offer an average fare discount of 65 percent,
satellite television and faster check-in.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the airline will introduce the first in a yearlong,
$10 million series of ads. The ads, created by Merkley Newman
Harty, a unit of the Omnicom Group, address what carrier and agency
officials describe as travelers' general hostility toward the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are furious with the airlines,'' said Anthony R.
Brescia, executive group director at Merkley Newman. ``They feel
powerless to do anything about it. They don't believe it will be
better. They need a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Curtis-McIntyre, JetBlue's vice president for marketing,
said: ``This is New York _ a little attitude will help set us
apart. The time is right to bring humor into the face of travelers'
anger and skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, JetBlue's first print ad features the head of an
ordinary-looking, somewhat disgruntled man floating on a largely
blank, white page. The copy reads: ``A new airline with low fares
and new planes? What am I, an idiot?''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the carrier's service and fares are also included.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads adopt a similarly jaundiced tone. One, depicting a
rather homely man, says, ``A new airline that's cheap and
comfortable? Sure, and I'm dating the tooth fairy,'' while another
says, ``$79 to Fort Lauderdale? What, as a stowaway?'' Several
others verge on the obscene; for example, one reads, ``TV for every
seat? You can kiss my'' with the conclusion to the sentence
omitted. All ads contain the tagline, ``JetBlue Airways.
Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial ads will appear in daily newspapers in New York,
Buffalo, Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue will also buy space in late January and early February
on highway billboards and in commuter train and subway stations in
the New York metropolitan area. Spending on these ads could reach
$700,000, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue is backed by a hefty $130 million investment from Weston
Presidio, a San Francisco venture capital firm; Chase Capital
Partners, the venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan Bank; and
Soros Private Equity Partners LLC, an investment affiliate of Soros
Fund Management LLC. Later this year, the airline plans to add one
new city and one new plane every six weeks. As it builds its
system, it will also step up advertising, adding television to its
media mix in New York and perhaps radio in several markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put people in seats, build our brand, and fill 10
planes to 11 destinations by the end of the year,'' Ms.
Curtis-McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   She described JetBlue's target market as ``very democratic,
people who weren't going to travel, people who are disgusted with
their current choices, people who would drive, or people who
wouldn't go at all. Our competition is the couch, television,
rental car companies, Amtrak, Greyhound and other airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts for the most part applauded Merkley Newman's creative
work but questioned JetBlue's long-term ability to succeed in the
highly competitive New York market, which, unlike most other large
U.S. markets, has little discount airline service.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``New York is a thick-skinned market,'' Sam
Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber, called it ``the
biggest market with the smallest discount carrier presence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the history of start-ups _ most of which have failed _
speaks for itself.'' he added. ``JetBlue has lots of money by
start-up standards and a decent management team; New York's a big
market. Against daunting odds, they've got a shot at some level of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harris, an airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney,
predicted the new entrant's advertising ``is likely to strike a
chord, but, of course, it requires that they deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fly out of Kennedy at noncongested, nonpeak periods,
they may have a niche that appeals to folks,'' he said. ``You can't
fault them on their approach or logic. But there are always more
problems flying into New York than other airports, and it's not
clear whether they'll be significantly better.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Randall Malin, an air transportation consultant in Los
Gatos, Calif., who was once executive vice president for marketing
at USAir, said JetBlue's advertising ``sounds fairly clever for the
marketplace and what they're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be noticed,'' he added. ``The fact of life today is
that the airline industry in general is treating its passengers
badly. But the strategic challenge will be whether they can get New
Yorkers to go to JFK for domestic service when the same fare is
available _ with frequent flier points _ from Continental at Newark
and USAirways at LaGuardia.''

 &HT;    EarthLink starts TV, radio advertising campaign
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Network rolled out its first nationwide TV
and radio advertising campaign Tuesday, featuring a cast of dancing
hamsters and a karaoke lounge lizard.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink will become the nation's largest independent Internet
service provider following its merger with Atlanta-based MindSpring
in February. It will run ads in 70 markets over the next two weeks.
The spots will air during network and cable programming and will
include the tag line: ``It's your Internet. We just connect you to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Brinton Young, EarthLink's senior vice president of
marketing, the ads are designed to give consumers a sense of what
EarthLink is all about and sign up new subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort is designed to generate immediate results, while
giving prospective EarthLink members a good feel for what we're all
about: We're a company of dedicated folks who take our jobs
seriously, but not ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The quirky ads emphasize the fun of surfing the Internet and
surfing at high speeds with the latest technologies. They also use
real Web sites to drive home their point. For instance, one ad
shows a Web site called ``Hamster Dance,'' (www. hamsterdance.com)
which is nothing but a page of dancing hamsters. The voice-over
points out the fun of being online and surfing the Web. ``The
Internet can change the way you live, you work ... and the way you
annoy the person in the next cubicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad shows a karaoke lounge lizard
(www.KaraokeCenterUSA.com) to emphasize EarthLink's high-speed and
broadband capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising recognizes the mindset of our consumers,''
said Ken Mandelbaum, chief creative officer for BBDO West. ``These
are people who turn to the Internet for fun, escape and
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink is well-known to consumers in the western part of the
country but needs to increase its awareness across the United
States if it wants to meet its desired goal of 8 million
subscribers by the end of 2001. The combined MindSpring and
EarthLink subscriber base now stands at 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even though EarthLink lags far behind America Online's 20
million subscribers, some analysts say the new ad campaign will
attract the attention of a different kind of Internet user, with
more offbeat interests, some Net savvy and something of an
independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that EarthLink is going to overcome AOL in
AOL's arena,'' Rob Norcross, vice president in the
telecommunications practice of Mercer Management Consulting in
Washington, told the Los Angeles Times. ``It's got too much of a
lead. But EarthLink can tell people that it has faster links, that
it's easier to use, that it's a different kind of company.''

BERTELSMANN CHAIRMAN WILL RESIGN FROM AOL BOARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Australia)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The chairman of Bertelsmann AG, Thomas
Middelhoff, said Tuesday that he would step down from the board of
America Online as a result of its proposed takeover of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   His decision is a suggestion of the jolt that the extraordinary
deal has inflicted on Bertelsmann, which is the world's
fourth-largest media company and which has a joint venture with
America Online in Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bertlesmann executives insist that they want to
maintain their partnership with AOL and reiterated that Middelhoff
had voted in favor of the deal with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview with CNBC, Middelhoff said he would
have to resign as a director of America Online because ``you can't
have a competitor sitting on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann and America Online are equal partners in AOL Europe
and an AOL network in Australia. Bertelsmann owns seven-tenths of 1
percent of America Online, a stake it apparently intends to hold
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelsmann and Time Warner are both major magazine
publishers, though generally not in the same markets, and they
compete in the distribution of music as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann has been pushing hard into Internet services. It is
the biggest shareholder in Barnesandnoble.com, which went public
last year, and operates Bertelsmann Online, a German-language
vendor of books and music. Bertelsmann, which owns the book
publisher Random House, derives about 35 percent of its roughly $13
billion in revenue from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its large size, Bertelsmann remains a closely held
company controlled by the family of Reinhard Mohn. This makes it
difficult to acquire Internet companies using stock, which has
become the currency of mergers in a superheated market.

CLUB MED EARNINGS JUMP 44 PERCENT, DIVIDEND PLANNED
</HEADLINE>
   (mg) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Almost two years after a management shake-up, Club
Mediterranee SA on Tuesday announced a 48 percent increase in
fiscal 1999 earnings and said it would resume paying a dividend for
the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Club Med, the biggest European resort operator, rose
more than 4 percent to 129.8 euros, or $133.69, the highest level
ever, before plummeting to end 4.4 percent lower at 119 euros, or
$122.57, as investors sought to lock in profits. Club Med's
American depository receipts rose 50 cents, to $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the drop, Club Med shares have risen more than 70
percent over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Bourguignon, the former Disney executive who was named
chairman and chief executive of Club Med in 1997 after several
years of losses, said the company's goal is to double in size by
2003 and to become a ``services company with activities in the
fields of leisure and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourguignon said that earnings in the year that ended Oct. 31
rose by 48 percent to 38.6 million euros, or $39.8 million, on a
15.6 percent increase in revenue to 1.47 billion euros or $1.51
billion. He said Club Med would propose to a shareholder meeting in
March that it begin paying a .50 euro dividend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Club Med shareholders led by the Agnelli family of
Italy, which owns about 23 percent of the company, hired
Bourguignon after losing patience with Serge Trigano, Club Med's
chief executive and a son of Gilbert Trigano, who developed in the
1950s the concept of vacation clubs that later made Club Med
synonymous with fake Polynesian villages and organized fun. In
1997, sluggish sales in important markets like France and Germany,
but also vacation villages badly in need of renovation, caused Club
Med to report a loss of almost $210 million, its third loss in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguignon, a former hotel executive, had made his mark by
returning Euro Disney SA, the company that runs Disneyland Paris,
to profitability after heavy losses in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He turned Club Med around by cutting prices and broadening the
resort's appeal beyond just single people to include families and
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strength in Club Med shares over the past year has
come from speculation that the company would be bought by a larger
tourism company, like Accor SA, the French hotel group where
Bourguignon had worked before joining Disney, or ally itself with
another tour operator, like Alpitour SpA of Italy, which is also
controlled by the Agnelli family.
</P>
<P>
   But Bourguignon predicted that Club Med might do some buying
itself, asserting that the company would play an ``active role'' in
the movement of consolidation gripping European tourism.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its target, he said, Club Med would begin testing an
urban vacation center under the name Club Med World and would open
a first site in Paris this spring. He also announced a subsidiary,
Club Med On-Line, to sell vacations and also related products like
sportswear, watches, sunglasses and suntan lotion over the
Internet.

DEMAND FOR NEW X5 KEEPS BMW BUSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ A year after BMW unveiled its first sport
activity vehicle, the carmaker is working hard to meet a driving
demand.
</P>
<P>
   After just more than a month on the open market, the X5 has
officials of Spartanburg County's BMW Manufacturing Corp.
struggling to satisfy customers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW officials thought from the start that the X5 would be a big
hit, but it was tough to predict how strong demand would be. The X5
was first put in front of the public at the 1999 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit. This week at the 2000 auto
show, BMW unveiled a six-cylinder version of the X5, along with a 3
Series convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the X5 totaled 1,311 _ nearly 53 a day _ in its first
25 days on the market last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it was received by the press last year, we knew we had
a good car,'' said BMW spokesman Bobby Hitt. ``We've been told that
every car we can get into the showrooms is being sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The X5's popularity is forcing BMW to increase production as
quickly as it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do plan to aggressively ramp up production as soon as
possible,'' Hitt said.
</P>
<P>
   BMW manufactures approximately 75 of the X5s a day. Officials
hope that by the end of the year, they will be making 300 X5s a
day. To accomplish that goal, BMW must expand its operations here.
The expansion begins this week, when an additional 100 employees
start working, pushing the number of employees to 2,900. By the end
of the quarter, Hitt said, BMW plans to have 3,000 employees at the
plant, its only production facility in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by the beginning of April, BMW plans to add a second shift
to work on the X5. At the same time, Hitt said it's tough to
predict how the expansion rate because BMW suppliers must increase
their production as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to predict, but we're looking at having a pretty
good year,'' Hitt said.

 &HT;    Kimberly-Clark, Southern Co. settle case involving power plant
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. have agreed to
settle a bankruptcy case involving a small power plant that lost
its major customer when Kimberly-Clark closed a Mobile, Ala., pulp
mill last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement terms were outlined in papers filed Tuesday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly-Clark agreed to pay Mobile Energy Services Co. at least
$53 million and to give that Southern subsidiary rights to purchase
the assets of the pulp mill it closed in September. A large part of
the money would go to bondholders of Mobile Energy Services, which
has been under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Southern would get rights to build a small natural gas-fired
power generator at the 11-acre industrial site shared by
Kimberly-Clark and Mobile Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Southern is negotiating with another paper company to open a new
mill at the site, using equipment from the mill that was closed in
September, said company spokesman David Mould. The new operation
would employ about 150 people and operate at half of the capacity
as the Kimberly-Clark facility, which employed 450 workers when it
closed in September. Mould declined to identify the company.
</P>
<P>
   Closure of the mill not only deprived Mobile Energy of its
largest customer, but also cut off the power plant's main source of
fuel, which is black liquor, a by-product of pulp production.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile Energy has in the meantime switched over to more
expensive natural gas to produce electricity for the other two
customers at the site. They are a Kimberly-Clark tissue plant and
an office paper plant operated by S.D. Warren Co., a subsidiary of
Sappi, a South African paper company.
</P>
<P>
   By opening a new mill at the site through a third party, Mobile
Energy anticipates regaining its supply of black liquor and being
able to provide electricity and steam to all three customers at the
complex. Any surplus electricity from the existing 111-megawatt
plant and the proposed new 165-megawatt unit would be sold in
wholesale energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile Energy's revenue was estimated at $84.6 million in 1997,
the last year for which figures are available. Southern took a $70
million write-down last year to reflect a decline in value of its
investment.

   Thousands of trucks stayed backed up at France's borders on the
second day of a blockade by truck owners protesting higher fuel
prices and a government-imposed move to reduce the workweek,
without reducing wages. The owners have vowed to keep the
barricades in place unless talks with officials produce results.

   An appeals court has confirmed that President Jacques Chirac
cannot face criminal charges, or be questioned, over a Paris City
Hall job scandal while he remains in office. But it left open the
possibility that he could be summoned once he left his post. Chirac
has come under scrutiny over accusations that some City Hall

PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDY STRESS LINKED TO BUSINESS AIR TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Seattle)   (Duplication notice: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Business travel is stressful,'' said Jonathan Bricker of the
University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Well,  &UR; duh, &LR;  you're probably saying, just as I did upon
encountering ``Something Stressful in the Air: Personality and
Business Air Travel Stress,'' a research report by Bricker, who is
a doctoral student in clinical psychology, and Dr. Irwin Sarason, a
professor of psychology at the university.
</P>
<P>
   But the next time you're stuck in that dingy departure lounge at
O'Hare, stewing over that missed connection and wondering what new
abomination the airline, hotel or car rental industries might be
planning to send your way before you get to that meeting in Munich,
it might help to consider that somebody at least is paying
attention to your psychological plight. (Of course, it might help a
lot more if the corporate travel department would simply toss you a
first-class ticket, but that's beyond the purview of an academic
study).
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was presented last August at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Society, was partially
suggested by a study in 1997 of the health-insurance records of
10,800 employees of the World Bank. This study found that World
Bank employees who routinely traveled on business accounted for 80
percent more medical claims than employees who didn't travel. Among
the common problems found at higher levels in the frequent
travelers: intestinal and diet complaints, vascular troubles,
respiratory infections (perhaps caused by airplane cabin air, the
study suggested), back aches _ and higher levels of clinical
complaints about occupational stress and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bricker, whose curiosity about the peculiar psychological
universe of business travel had already been piqued when he worked
for several years at a travel agency in San Francisco, while he was
an undergraduate student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would talk to business travelers about the occupational
stresses of being on the road _ making arrangements, packing,
rushing off to the airport, waiting in line, trying to keep tight
schedules, overcrowding on airplanes _ all the pervasive hassles
they routinely encounter,'' he recalled. ``I was intrigued because
it seemed that so little was known about the psychological stress
of business travel, and also the effective ways to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington, Bricker hooked up with Sarason,
his academic adviser. The two soon began work on a project designed
to come to a better understanding of how to manage business-travel
stress, especially as it is perceived by the driven, Type-A
personality types who form the hard core of business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   To design a survey questionnaire, Bricker hung around airport
departure lounges interviewing business travelers. He and Sarason
then surveyed 329 frequent business travelers _ some of whom made
more than 120 business trips a year _ at two West Coast offices of
a large international consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   They found that in general, men tend to externalize travel
stress as anger or overt frustration; women tend to internalize it
as anxiety or apprehension. People prone to anger are most
susceptible to business-travel stress. And the perception of a
``lack of control'' when traveling is one of the greatest stress
inducers of all.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, any hard-charging business person accustomed to
getting things done could be ``prone to anger'' in an environment
as frustrating as air travel, Bricker concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive, hard working, tends to demand a lot from others _
those are great traits in a manager,'' he said. But unfortunate
traits for someone stuck in air-travel limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an authoritarian environment in which almost
everything is out of your control,'' Bricker said. ``In air travel,
you can be pretty certain to find a delay, a large crowd of people
in a very confined space in which you're going to have to queue.
You're competing with other people, scrambling when they call your
section for boarding, worried, tense, nervous. It's an environment
in which you're almost guaranteed to find a plane at least 75
percent full. You have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, the ideal environment for a scientist to study
the psychological effects of stress. It would be nice to be able to
put in a scientist's mad cackle of delight here, but Bricker is
soft-spoken, analytical, and calmly focused on the opportunities.
He and Sarason are now planning to design some practical programs
to help travelers, corporations and the travel industry (including
air crews) deal with the problems of travel stress.
</P>
<P>
   They have set up a Web site (www.survey123.com) with a
questionnaire for business travelers to share their own
perspectives. ``Most people who fly agree that travel is stressful,
and what people really want to know now is how to make it less
stressful,'' Bricker said, adding that he's open to all
suggestions. &QL;

NEW WAYS TO PRAY JUST A MOUSE-CLICK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to fix Charlestown, Mass. in 9th graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when those who wanted to communicate with a higher
power clasped their hands, perhaps kneeling in a hallowed
sanctuary, and fervently appealed for divine aid.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can sit at their computer screens, tap out keyboard
prayers, and, in at least some cases, genuinely feel they are
reaching their Maker on line.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, introducing: God.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is an e-mail address for ``God,'' and many
homepages. Also, several Web sites claim they can link the computer
user directly to God. Sometimes, this God even responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply click on the PRAY button and transmit your prayer to
the only known location of GOD,'' says one of the most audacious
Web sites, newprayer.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those who set up these nondenominational Web sites say they
appeal to people turned off by stuffy churches and stern-faced
clergymen. But the sites trouble some theologians, who say they
serve up an easy, noncommittal version of religion for Internet
surfers who shun the traditional obligations of communities of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Foerst, a Lutheran theologian who teaches at MIT, said
interaction with God on the Internet lacks depth and serious
confrontation with questions of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is comfortable, convenient religion, completely
individualized: Just go on the Web and pray,'' Foerst said.
``Religion should be about commitment and community and
self-doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Levin, a business consultant, Charlestown, Mass., found
consolation on Godspeaks.net, one of the most popular of the Web
sites, after his brother died of lymphoma. Godspeaks, which
reproduces direct, provocative billboard messages from an outdoor
religious advertising campaign in Florida, captured his interest.
</P>
<P>
   One such message read, ``That `love thy neighbor' thing? I meant
it. _ God' Another said, ``Let's meet at my house Sunday before the
game _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not standing over you like a religious teacher with a
ruler in hand,'' said Levin, 31. ``It doesn't ask for a donation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of an anonymous Florida donor, the Godspeaks sites
were started in 1998 by Mark MacDonald, 35, a technology
consultant, and the Smith advertising agency in Ft. Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   The donor was saddened by the White House sex scandal and school
violence, and wanted to find a creative way to bring God into
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   With the ad agency's help, the donor agreed to create billboards
with the sayings ``signed'' by God. The Web sites _ Godspeaks.net
and Godspeaks.org _ were formed to display the sayings and to
establish other ways for users to connect with God.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said the creators of the site are presumptuous
in attempting to speak for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being flippant,'' MacDonald acknowledged. ``But our God
has a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald estimated that the Web site gets at least 150,000 hits
a month, mainly from ``people who are crying out for help, or
others who are celebrating that they were reminded of God in a
unique, fun way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Jones, 55, a retired Army inventory specialist and a
committed Catholic from Darby, Pa., logged on to Godspeaks.net
about nine months ago, out of curiosity. She enjoyed the humor of
the site and has now sent the addresses to ``a couple hundred
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me think about ways to make God more central to my
life,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Newprayer.com makes an even bolder claim _ that it can send
prayers via a radio transmitter to God's last known location, a
star cluster called M13 believed to be one of the oldest in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   One theologian, Charles Henderson, called the claim
``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scientific mumbo jumbo,'' said Henderson, executive
director of the Association for Religion and Intellectual Life in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall Stone, 50, a Cambridge, Mass. engineer and freelance
consultant, set up the site last winter after a night of sipping
brandy and philosophizing with friends in Vermont. The conversation
turned to Big Bang theories of creation, and someone suggested that
if everything was in one place at the time of the explosion, then
God must have been there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one place where we could be sure He was,'' Stone
said. ``Then we thought that if we could find that location and had
a radio transmitter, we could send a  to God.''
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with NASA scientists, the friends settled on
M13 as the likely location. They chipped in about $20,000, and
built a radio-wave-transmitting Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they charged $5 a prayer to help recoup part of the
costs. But when some critics cried scam, they provided the service
for free.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stone says, they transmit about 50,000 prayers a week from
seekers around the globe. Most supplicants pray for someone else _
to help an ill relative or a troubled friend, for instance, or to
end war.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent have later sent e-mail testimonials saying
their prayers were answered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if this form of prayer is more effective than
any other. There aren't any comparative data,'' Stone said. ``But
it appears that most people take our service seriously and that a
large number are gratified by the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Stone, professor of theology at Boston University,
described the newprayer site as unusual and probably harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most theistic traditions believe God is everywhere, not in one
place or direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Godspeaks and newprayer are free-of-charge now, but some
more-suspect God-centered Web sites sell products like
``forgiveness'' for $50 or ``divine protection certificates'' for
$9.99.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Boston University's Stone was reluctant to criticize
the new Web sites, saying they reach people more traditional
denominations often miss.
</P>
<P>
   The sites ``probably touch a large and growing group . . . on a
spiritual quest.''

San Fernando Valley are on the rise, as illustrated by the case of
86-year-old Leonard Eichner who was knocked down by another
motorist who felt the Woodland Hills man had jumped his parking
space. He is lying in the very hospital where he was critically
injured with a broken hip after a motorist punched him out and
knocked him to the ground over a handicapped parking space last
week. ``People argue and fight over parking spaces like they're

BARAK, BACK IN ISRAEL, SAYS SYRIAN TALKS ARE AT `DECISIVE STAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On his return from West Virginia on Tuesday night,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak broke the silence that governed
the closed-door negotiations with Syria to say that the peace talks
had reached a ``decisive stage'' in which both sides would have to
make difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a television interview, Barak said it was impossible
to predict whether the round of talks that begins next week would
be ``conclusive.'' He said that he had witnessed ``certain fissures
in the Syrian rigidity'' but that he wasn't reading much into them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak dismissed concerns in Israel that Syrian President Hafez
Assad was disrespecting him by sending Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa as his emissary to the talks. At the same time, he
suggested that the persistent monitoring of whether he and
al-Sharaa had shaken hands was a misplaced focus.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that President Clinton had reminded him that Yitzhak
Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister, had refused to
shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat until after their
breakthrough peace agreement was signed. And the Americans, he
said, ``did not make a big deal out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the issues of manners and the culture of dialogue and
discourse are secondary,'' Barak said. ``If the agreement should
progress toward a decision, it is clear that the stage will arrive
in which President Assad will have to see us and also to shake
hands. If we do not succeed, then there is no value to the question
of whether we sat with him 10 times or whether we hugged seven
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that no in-depth discussion of borders had taken
place and that the Israelis had made no political commitment to
Syria about a withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   He was indirectly denying reports that Israel had presented a
working proposition that it would cede the Golan down to the 1923
international border with Syria. It was widely asserted here that
Barak had made clear Israel's willingness to withdraw, and that his
action had changed the tenor of the talks, opening up the Syrians
and making them more flexible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his return, Barak faced right-wing charges that he was overly
eager to make concessions to secure a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his quest for an agreement with the Syrian dictator, he
seems prepared to do anything, to say anything and even to give
away everything,'' Moshe Arens, a hawkish former defense minister,
wrote in the Haaretz newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, the prime minister stressed his
position that the depth of the withdrawal would equal the depth of
security and the normalization of relations. No one issue would be
decided until every issue was decided, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that despite all the difficulties, we can and must
exhaust the possibility to put the wars behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts declared that a subtle shift had transpired
in West Virginia, setting the stage for more substantive progress
next week, others simply noted that there had been neither
breakthrough nor setback.
</P>
<P>
   And many questioned whether the round had accomplished much
beyond December's meetings, when both sides resumed contact after a
freeze of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the talks continue at the pace set by the negotiations this
week, pro-Golan Heights demonstrators may yet be forced to cancel
rallies because of the summer heat,'' Akiva Eldar wrote in Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   A large opposition rally in Tel Aviv on Monday protested any
withdrawal from the Golan. In the interview, Barak praised the
moderate tenor of the rally, calling it ``dignified'' and very
different from the volatile, right-wing demonstrations of Rabin's
era.
</P>
<P>
   Television reporters asserted that it was pictures of the mass
demonstration _ realistic estimates ranged from 100,000 to 200,000
participants _ that propelled Barak to give the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could win over enough Israelis to make the
referendum succeed, Barak sketched some of the points that are
expected to evolve into his domestic campaign for peace: He said a
good agreement would make Israel stronger and freer to concentrate
on its internal problems; it would open ``an avenue to the entire
Arabian peninsula''; and it would allow Israel to bring its
soldiers home from southern Lebanon, where Syria is the
powerbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those honest and pained people that we saw yesterday
in the square will vote in favor of the agreement,'' Barak said,
predicting a ``sweeping majority.''

BANK ONE ISSUES THIRD PROFIT WARNING IN 5 MONTHS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Bank One Corp. issued another profit warning
Tuesday, its third in the last five months, saying that earnings
could decline by about 19 percent this year, largely because of
continuing troubles in its credit card division.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One, the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company and
one of the world's largest issuers of Visa credit cards, also said
it would take a $725 million charge in the fourth quarter of 1999,
in part to cover one-time losses at its First USA credit card and
consumer lending division, which accounts for about one-third of
the bank's earnings. The company is also taking charges related to
reorganization, the closing of various bank branches and severance
packages, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was just the latest in a series of troublesome
developments at Bank One, which just a few weeks ago said that its
longtime chief executive, John B. McCoy, was stepping down in the
wake of continuing troubles at First USA and a huge sell-off of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank One dropped 25 cents Tuesday, to $30, on the New
York Stock Exchange. Less than a year ago, shares were trading as
high as $63.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One expects to earn about 79 cents a share when it
announces fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 18. For 1999, earnings
are expected to be $3.45 a share. A few months ago, analysts had
been estimating profits of $3.92 a share.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bank One said earnings were projected to be about
$2.80 a share, down from recent Wall Street estimates of $3.42 a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
company earnings. After Bank One and the First Chicago NDB Corp.
agreed to merge in 1998, earnings for 2000 were projected at nearly
$5 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at a meeting in New York with investors and Wall Street
analysts, the company's top executives said they were moving
aggressively to rejuvenate the credit card division, whose market
share has shrunk because of poor customer service, increased
competition and growing attrition rates that were tied in part to
high penalty fees.
</P>
<P>
   But Verne G. Istock, the interim chief executive at Bank One,
which is based in Chicago, said the company did not expect the
credit card division to return to profitability until late this
year or early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts greeted the announcement Tuesday with
skepticism, saying their confidence has been largely blunted by
repeated warnings and earnings revisions that suggest Bank One may
have deep-seated problems in an increasingly difficult competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of convincing yet to be done,'' said
Nancy Bush, a banking analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``I don't think
anyone heard anything today that will send them out to buy up the
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that the company will have difficulty turning
its credit card division around at a time when competition is stiff
and the economy could be facing a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's problems are primarily in the credit card
division, analysts said, there could be weakness and management
problems in other areas, like retail banking. But company
executives insists that other divisions are performing as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our businesses, except credit card, continue to be solidly
in line with our stated growth and return goals,'' Istock said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected earnings growth of about 10 percent
to 12 percent outside its credit card division on revenue growth of
about 5 percent to 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   To improve Bank One's prospects and restore confidence,
executives said the company would strengthen customer service in
its credit card division and devote more resources to marketing,
retaining customers and maintaining discipline its financial
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had also reorganized some of its operations,
reshuffled management in recent months and repriced some of its
credit card offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know where some of the problems are in the credit card
division, and they're addressing them,'' said Henry Dickson, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``But there is a healthy degree of
skepticism about whether they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Tuesday that it had retained Russell
Reynolds Associates to conduct a search for a chief executive to
replace McCoy. Istock, the former chief executive at First Chicago
NDB, is also a contender for that post, the company says.

   EURO-ENGLISH-FILMS (Paris) _ For all the ardent nationalists
battling American cultural and capitalist incursions, a new
generation of Europeans is living and working across the 15 borders
of the European Union, using the Internet, speaking American-style
English to their children the way the Russian aristocracy used to
speak French _ global citizens whose lives take place, at least
some of the time, in English. One arena for the struggle to create
a cultural identity for a united Europe is the European film. If
defining it now is more elusive culturally, financially and
geographically than ever before, one thing is certain: it will be
in English. By Kristin Hohenadel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACKIE-SUSANN-FILM (Undated) _ Before she started writing
fiction, ``Valley of the Dolls''; ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once
Is Not Enough,'' Jackie Susann spent the better part of three
decades trying to be a star before she died at 56, so it would no
doubt delight her that she's the subject of ``Isn't She Great,'' a
near-slapstick comedy with a melancholy undertow written by Paul
Rudnick and directed by Andrew Bergman. Loosely based on ``Wasn't
She Great?,'' a 1995 New Yorker article by Michael Korda, who
edited ``The Love Machine,'' the film opens Jan. 28 and stars Bette
Midler as Susann. By Karen Durbin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAMES-TOBACK-FILMS (New York) _ Few film directors can boast a
career like James Toback's. Fewer still might want to. Half a dozen
movies that have not always rubbed critics the right way, or
translated into huge box office profits (or losses, for that
matter). And yet, at 55, this idiosyncratic writer-director still
makes the movies he wants to, lures marquee stars, finds the money
men and, lately, makes the cut at the big film festivals. By Rick
Marin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NINTH-GATE-FILM (Rome) _ Seated at a corner table at Il
Matriciano, one of his favorite haunts during the dolce vita of the
'70s, Roman Polanski was discussing his desire to make an
important, lasting film. Almost impatiently, he explained that his
latest release, ``The Ninth Gate,'' was not it. ```Ninth Gate' is
fun, it's nice, I think it's a good movie, but after all, what is
it about?'' asked Polanski, 66, the Polish-born director whose
repertory includes ``Repulsion,'' ``Rosemary's Baby'' and
``Chinatown.'' ``It's like every other movie that is made nowadays.
It may be different in style, but it doesn't make any important
statement.'' Actually, ``The Ninth Gate,'' is an occult thriller
opening March 31 that features satanic rituals, exotic locales and
gruesome deaths, and stars Johnny Depp. By Alessandra Stanley.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEAUTIFUL-PEOPLE-FILM (London) _ ``Beautiful People,'' is Jasmin
Dizdar's first feature film, which opens in New York in February.
The film by the young Yugoslav who has become a British citizen, is
a humorous, affectionate and poignant portrayal of a cross section
of Britons whose lives are unexpectedly disrupted by the Bosnian
nightmare in the fall of 1993. ``Beautiful People'' won the Certain
Regard competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. By Alan
Riding.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ZANDER-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about Boston and musical
cult figures? The opera producer Sarah Caldwell and the pianist
Russell Sherman are merely the more prominent of recent decades. If
a musician can make it there, in that hotbed of musical culture and
tradition, you might think, he or she can make it anywhere. The
quintessential cult figure of the moment is Benjamin Zander, 60, a
conductor and the founding music director of the Boston
Philharmonic Orchestra. By James R. Oestreich. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEPORELLO-MUSIC-FILM (Toronto) _ On the principle that every
exit is an entrance somewhere else, Tom Stoppard once wrote
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's dim college pals from
Wittenberg, title roles in a show of their own. Now Barbara Willis
Sweete, a founding partner of the Canadian film production company
Rhombus Media, is doing the same for Leporello, the sidekick of
Mozart's Don Giovanni. Her hourlong film-within-a-film
``Leporello,'' which strings together in their original order
excerpts from Mozart's sulfur-singed operatic masterpiece, will be
introduced at festivals next fall, with television broadcasts to
follow on PBS and cultural channels around the world. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.  &QL;

<P>
   ARCADES-PROJECT (Undated) _ Some of us don't read fiction. We
live on history, biography, criticism, reporting and what used to
be called belles lettres. We will be feasting on Walter Benjamin's
``Arcades Project'' for years to come. Just published by Harvard
University Press in the first full English-language edition, ``The
Arcades Project'' should also win readers with broader tastes. A
sprawling, fragmented meditation on the ethos of 19th-century
Paris, ``The Arcades Project'' was left incomplete on Benjamin's
death in 1940. In recent decades, as portions of the book have
appeared in English, the unfinished opus has acquired legendary
status. ``The Arcades Project'' surpasses its legend. It captures
the relationship between a writer and a city in a form as richly
developed as those presented in the great cosmopolitan novels of
Proust, Joyce, Musil and Isherwood. By Herbert Muschamp.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COURT-PAINTERS-ART (Madrid, Spain) From the 15th century to the
18th century, many fine painters were wooed with money, security
and status and in exchange spent their time glorifying the
``ideology'' of the Roman Catholic Church and exalting assorted
popes, monarchs and military heroes. They also produced prodigious
art. This was certainly the case with three masters of the
post-Renaissance, whose relationship with power is the subject of
``Velazquez, Rubens, Van Dyck: Court Painters of the 17th
Century,'' a new exhibition at the Prado Museum in Madrid that runs
through March 5. Each artist had his own style of painting, but
they nonetheless had much in common: their careers coincided during
two decades; they supported the Catholic Counter-Reformation;
Velazquez and Van Dyck looked up to Rubens, 22 years their senior;
and all revered Titian, who died in 1576, the year before Rubens'
birth. But what most united them was that they were first and
foremost court painters. By Alan Riding.

THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF BOSTON'S LATEST CULT FIGURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about Boston and musical cult figures? The opera
producer Sarah Caldwell and the pianist Russell Sherman are merely
the more prominent of recent decades. If a musician can make it
there, in that hotbed of musical culture and tradition, you might
think, he or she can make it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But such has not always been the case. And that circumstance may
suit Boston just fine, for the city's musical mavens seem to enjoy
being in the know, remaining ahead of the curve, focusing an
obviously superior eye on the prize.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential cult figure of the moment is Benjamin Zander,
60, a conductor and the founding music director of the Boston
Philharmonic Orchestra. Zander, who was born in England, has become
a mythic figure in Boston and, more recently, London (another city
with sometimes arcane musical predilections) for idiosyncratic
interpretations of Beethoven and Mahler that some find revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Zander will take the Boston Philharmonic
and several New England choruses to Carnegie Hall for the
orchestra's first New York concert in 16 years, a performance of
Mahler's monumental ``Symphony of a Thousand.'' Some 450 performers
are promised in a reprise of a presentation given to great acclaim
last March at Boston's Symphony Hall, completing the orchestra's
survey of the Mahler symphonies over its 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In a further bid for broader recognition, Zander has begun to
record Beethoven and Mahler symphonies with the Philharmonia
Orchestra of London for Telarc. The first products are performances
and (on bonus CDs) extended discussions of Mahler's Ninth Symphony
(CD-80527; two music CDs) and Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh
Symphonies (CD-80471). Whatever else they may be, they are not
redundant even in the most crowded of markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Beethoven Fifth, in particular, will shock most listeners
with a rush through the famous opening motto that flouts not only
performance custom but also accrued extramusical meanings, whether
suggested by the composer (fate knocks at the door) or appended by
history (V for victory). Zander was a lonely early advocate of
Beethoven's original metronome marks, which have long been
disputed, because they result in performances far faster than
modern listeners are used to hearing _ faster indeed, some
insisted, than the works could be played. If it was not Beethoven's
metronome, a primitive model, that failed him, the argument runs,
then it must have been his inner ear, as deafness progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Zander's tempos tend to outstrip even those of more recent
converts to the cause of kineticism, like Roger Norrington and
David Zinman, and the Philharmonia players show that the music can
not only be played at such tempos but also played virtuosically.
The eighth-note rumblings in the third-movement trio section that
Beethoven's original double bassists bemoaned for their difficulty
are a walk in the park for the British bull fiddlers.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Zander showed in a 1992 release of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, reissued two years ago in England by Carlton
Classics, that even the Boston Philharmonic _ consisting in roughly
equal parts of professional, student and amateur players _ could
presentably negotiate a blistering pace. At 58 minutes, this
performance would have fitted comfortably on an LP, let alone a CD,
with its 75-minute capacity expressly determined by the typical
length of a Beethoven Ninth performance.
</P>
<P>
   What musical sense those tempos make, especially so rigidly
pursued, is another matter. These well-worn ears, for reasons
perhaps unsound in terms of a literal reading of the score,
continue to prefer a certain deliberation, flexibility and weight
in Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Despite wonderful moments in Zander's renditions, a listener
often has the sense of hydroplaning over the music, unable to get a
firm grip on its substance. Though exhausting in their sheer
freneticism, the performances seem lightweight, at times even
perky. (Beethoven may have been frenetic on occasion, but perky?)
</P>
<P>
   Mahler, happily, did not trade in metronome marks. In this
music, Zander professes to value ``enormous freedom'' above all.
``The music cries out for this,'' he once told a Boston
interviewer. ``It is not about being precise and clean. It is about
being (italics)expressive.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the performance of Mahler's Ninth Symphony could
hardly diverge more from those Beethoven interpretations _ except
in its zeal to make points. Tempos tend to be broad, threatening at
times to bog down altogether. Dynamics are often exaggerated at
either extreme in typically wide-ranging sound from Telarc.
Mahler's copious expressive markings receive full attention.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Telarc's Beethoven disc, the Mahler Ninth stems from a
concert performance, in 1996. Partly for that reason, no doubt, the
Philharmonia's playing is generally less cohesive. This is, too, a
bigger and more sprawling work than either of the others.
</P>
<P>
   And as Zander told the Boston interviewer, of a performance with
the Boston Philharmonic, ``To play with this kind of freedom, we
had to rehearse a lot.'' Having lavished 22 rehearsals on that
performance, he undoubtedly got far fewer with the Philharmonia.
</P>
<P>
   What the Telarc discs ultimately provide, in lieu of fully
satisfying performances, is an interesting provocation, though not
necessarily any of those signaled in the conductor's detailed
explanations, spoken, ``sung'' and played. Taken together, the
recordings make one wonder why it should be assumed that because
Beethoven, in keeping with the practice of his time, used fewer
expressive markings than Mahler, he cared less about expression.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, in keeping with the practice of (italics)his(end italics)
time, used fewer markings still, and we can hardly doubt that he
expected many expressive touches _ even whole flourishes _ not
printed in the score.
</P>
<P>
   In music, as in so many other areas, the deeper we venture into
the past, the fewer the certitudes. Numbers mesmerize the modern
mind, seeming to offer fixity, clarity, a direct and indisputable
measure of ``right'' and ``wrong.'' From there it becomes a short
step to valuing a quality that can be pinned down in numbers above
all others, as Zander seems to do in his Beethoven performances.
</P>
<P>
   With Mahler, he is on firmer ground. More impressive than any of
these recordings is another earlier release reissued by Carlton,
this one of Mahler's Sixth Symphony, from 1995. The quality and
conviction of that performance, with the Boston Philharmonic
obviously rehearsed to within an inch of its life, bode well for a
reading of the ``Symphony of a Thousand'' to win over even the most
skeptical New Yorker.

JUSTICES CUT BACK ON FEDERAL LAW AGAINST AGE BIAS

   WASHINGTON _ Saying older Americans enjoy only limited
constitutional protection, the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down
part of a federal law that had enabled state workers to sue
employers for age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the justices ruled that Congress exceeded its
constitutional authority when it said in the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act that workers who are at least 40 years old may sue
their public employers for illegal bias.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision, however, has no direct effect on
state laws banning age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas state workers may still sue their employer under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's decision might cause a substantial reduction in
the amount of compensation Texas state employees receive in
successful age bias cases, said Hal Gillespie, an employment-law
attorney in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state law, alleged victims of age bias can sue _ and
collect _ under both the federal and Texas statutes.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of the high court's decision, state workers can
now recover only under the Texas law, which like the federal
statute begins to protect workers when they reach age 40, Gillespie
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas state workers who suffer willful age bias on
the job will no longer be able to collect the double damages
available under the federal law, he said. The employees will still
be able to recover the additional compensation for mental anguish
available under Texas law, the lawyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Private employees, by contrast, will continue to enjoy the
protection of both the federal and state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision today definitely makes Texas state employees
second-class citizens,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in its two-part ruling, first held that the
Constitution bars states from being sued for money damages unless
Congress expressly says they can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   Then the justices lowered the boom on older workers, ruling that
Congress lacked the constitutional authority to enable the
employees to sue state employers for age bias.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie McCann, an attorney with the American Association of
Retired Persons, assailed the court's ruling as a blow to older
workers, who now must rely on state laws to protect them from
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``State employees are left with no federal protection,'' said
McCann, who filed a legal brief with the court on AARP's behalf
urging the justices to rule for the workers. ``Your protection from
age discrimination depends on where you live and work.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision also marks the latest in a string of
rulings during the past year in which the justices have struck down
federal laws that sought to give individuals and businesses the
right to sue states for money damages.
</P>
<P>
   In those rulings, the court held 5-4 that the Constitution's
11th Amendment grants states ``sovereign immunity'' from being sued
in federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the court ruled Tuesday that, even in limited cases
when individuals can sue states, Congress lacks the constitutional
authority to allow them to litigate claims of age discrimination on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The same five justices who formed the majority in those earlier
cases also united in ruling against older workers. They are Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters in those earlier cases also were together
Tuesday: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H.
Souter and John Paul Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   At issue before the Supreme Court was whether state employees,
in this case state university workers in Florida and Alabama, could
sue their employers under the federal law banning age bias. The
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled against the workers,
saying the states enjoyed sovereign immunity and that the
Constitution does not prohibit age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The workers claimed that because of their age they were paid
less than their younger colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with the 11th Circuit, the Supreme Court said Congress
can override sovereign immunity and enable individuals to sue
states only when the federal lawmakers have the Constitutional
authority to enact such a law. But Congress cannot enable older
workers to sue state agencies because the Constitution provides
such little protection from age discrimination, the court added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the court said, the Constitution does not bar
states from making ``broad generalizations'' about how age ravages
the physical and mental abilities of employees.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause strongly
prohibits states from making generalizations about minority and
female employees. Congress, therefore, can and does by statute
enable minorities and women to sue state employers, the high court
said.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the justices defended the constitutional
distinction they have drawn between age discrimination and bias
based on race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older persons ... unlike those who suffer discrimination on
the basis of race or gender, have not been subjected to a history
of purposeful unequal treatment,'' O'Connor wrote for the majority.
``Old age also does not define a discrete and insular minority
because all persons, if they live out their normal life spans, will
experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, states can discriminate against older workers
merely by showing that the discrimination is rationally related to
a legitimate state interest, the court said. For example, a state
can have a mandatory retirement age of 50 for police based on its
desire to ensure that all of its officers are in top physical
shape, the court added.

TERRORISM SUSPECT DOESN'T FIT THE PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ She's the part of the puzzle that just won't fit.
</P>
<P>
   To federal prosecutors, Lucia Garofalo _ the 35-year-old
Quebecer arrested in Vermont last month while allegedly trying to
smuggle an Algerian into the United States _ is a key link in a
terrorist conspiracy stretching from the overseas hideaways of a
violent Islamic radical group to isolated border crossings between
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The US attorney is expected to argue in US District Court in
Burlington, Vt., Wednesday that the Montreal woman should be kept
in custody at a secret Vermont location because of ``sinister''
connections to a suspected terrorist conspiracy against the United
States. But Garofalo's lawyer is seeking her release on bail,
saying Garofalo is little more than a victim of paranoia and
prejudice against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the portrait of Garofalo painted by friends and
family differs dramatically from the usual profiles of
international terrorists. Those who know her scoff at suggestions
she might be a witting participant in any violent plot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they described a sad, chronically ill, and deeply
troubled woman dependent on welfare and charity from a mosque to
support herself, three children, and her adoptive mother in a
cramped two-room apartment _ a woman dedicated to the Muslim faith,
despite her Roman Catholic upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   But one close acquaintance said that Garofalo, desperate for
money and perhaps hoping to win approval from her estranged
Algerian husband, last month boasted of being offered $1,000 to
smuggle an Arab man into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me she'd agreed to take this man into the US because
she needs money so badly,'' said Michel Issa El-Khoury, a neighbor
and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Issa El-Khoury added, however: ``I know Lucia well, and in my
mind it is absolutely impossible she is a terrorist or dangerous
fanatic. It isn't in her nature. Perhaps she was misled or made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Issa El-Khoury also said Garofalo gave him the impression
that her Algerian husband, Yamin Rachek _ living in Europe after
being deported from Canada for suspicious activities and possession
of false papers _ had urged her to spirit a man named Bouabide
Chamchi, and perhaps others, into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi, 20, was arrested with Garofalo on the night of Dec. 19
after attempting to enter the country at a remote border station at
Beecher Falls, Vt. They were detained, searched, and finally
charged with an array of immigration offenses, including illegal
entry and possession of false documents. Chamchi carried a false
French passport allegedly provided him by Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   Those are serious offenses, but hardly unusual ones _ roughly
2,000 illegal aliens, along with scores of ``people smugglers,''
are caught each year trying to sneak into the United States along a
border sector stretching from Ogdensburg, N.Y., to New Hampshire.
Almost all are released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor Charles R. Tetzlaff says Garofalo's case is
different. He contends that ``substantial areas of her life are
sponsored by terrorists'' _ and that she is highly likely to flee
to Libya or some other country.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be merely that Garofalo's timing was stupendously
bad.
</P>
<P>
   She made her thwarted border crossing attempt just five days
after a much more spectacular arrest on the other side of North
America, when Ahmed Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian also with ties
to Montreal, was caught entering Washington state from Canada with
explosives and other bomb materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are frightened of terrorists and bombs, and my
mother got caught in the middle,'' said Melissa Garofalo, 14, one
of Garofalo's three children. ``She could barely manage to take
care of us _ how could she be plotting with bombs?''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the Garofalo case seems riddled with
contradiction. At the time of her arrest, Garofalo had $8 in her
checking account. But she was driving a brand new Chrysler and
carrying a cellular phone on which hundreds of dollars worth of
overseas calls had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Her passport bears entry stamps of France, Germany, Morocco, and
Libya _ costly getaways _ yet her sole reported income is $520 a
month in welfare and occasional loans from the charity fund of
Montreal's Assunna Annabawtyah Mosque, where she worships and
occasionally volunteers to care for elderly or sick members.
</P>
<P>
   Of four individuals arrested so far in a massive cross-border
terrorist probe, Garofalo is the only non-Algerian.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Montreal on Sept. 11, 1964, Garofalo was adopted by
Italian immigrants to Canada. Her adoptive mother, Sebastiana, is
looking after the three children, Melissa, Sabrina, 12, and
Youssef, 3. ``I am crying every night because my Lucia is behind
bars,'' said the mother. ``She is very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   According to her family, Garofalo suffers from recently
diagnosed lupus _ a blood disorder _ as well as anemia, arthritis,
and chronic insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19, Garofalo married her first husband, Nagib Dufaan, a
Libyan living in Montreal. She also converted to Islam. The two
daughters are from this marriage, which ended in divorce in 1991.
At about this time, she became obsessed with seeking her birth
parents, who may have been Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   According to neighbors and friends in Montreal, Garofalo dresses
in chador, the head-to-toe clothing in which women are required to
conceal themselves in some Muslim cultures. Her daughters also wear
Muslim head coverings, although her adoptive mother remains
faithfully Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors contend that Garofalo is connected to Ahmed
Ressam and, beyond him, to the Armed Islamic Group _ usually known
by its French acronym, GIA _ a notoriously violent movement seeking
to turn Algeria into a fundamentalist Muslim theocracy. But the
skein of connections prosecutors describe in court documents is
tangled, and based heavily on snippets of information provided by
unidentified foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   But all the connections do seem to lead back to Montreal, home
to a large Algerian community and _ according to intelligence
sources _ base for growing numbers of Algerian criminals affiliated
with the GIA.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, US prosecutors suggest, Garofalo served as a
human-transporting ``mule'' for the Islamic Group, smuggling
Algerians into the country at the apparent behest of her second
husband, Yamin Rachek, an Algerian deported from Canada in 1996.
Rachek, in turn, is allegedly an associate of Said Atmani, leader
of an extremist cell of GIA radicals. Atmani completes the link to
Ressam, in the federal version of events, since the two men once
shared an apartment in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's family say they've never heard of Atmani. But on one
occasion, US prosecutors allege, she took $700 in cash from Atmani
during a meeting on a Montreal street corner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite labeling her a ``national security threat,'' US
prosecutors so far have charged Garofalo only with fairly humdrum
immigration violations. Defense lawyer Maryanne Kampmann says that
her client's forays to the United States represent nothing more
sinister than shopping trips _ and she has entered into evidence a
receipt from Filene's to buttress the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo is believed to have made at least two journeys into New
England last month, both times accompanied by men of Middle Eastern
appearance and both times entering the country at lonely crossings
in northern New England _ neither on a direct route from Montreal
to Boston, which she claimed as her destination. She and a man were
also turned back from the border on one occasion. And witnesses in
a Quebec border town describe a woman fitting her description
asking questions about unguarded roads crossing to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her arrest in Vermont, Garofalo said she had accidentally
strayed to the border while seeking a restaurant. But according to
prosecutors, she was carrying precise written directions to
``douane Americaine Beecher Falls,'' the border crossing point.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Montreal, Garofalo's mother and children pray for her
release nightly, beseeching God in the language of two faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping America will let her go,'' said daughter
Melissa. ``We have to believe she will come home to us.''

AN OPERATIC SIDEKICK HAS HIS DAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ On the principle that every exit is an entrance
somewhere else, Tom Stoppard once wrote Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, Hamlet's dim college pals from Wittenberg, title
roles in a show of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barbara Willis Sweete, a founding partner of the Canadian
film production company Rhombus Media, is doing the same for
Leporello, the sidekick of Mozart's Don Giovanni.
</P>
<P>
   In the best known of many previous projects, Ms. Sweete has
pushed the cinematic envelope with superstar performers including
Mark Morris and Yo-Yo Ma. Her hourlong film-within-a-film
``Leporello,'' which strings together in their original order
excerpts from Mozart's sulfur-singed operatic masterpiece, will be
introduced at festivals next fall, with television broadcasts to
follow on PBS and cultural channels around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In his film debut, the silver-haired Siberian baritone Dmitri
Hvorostovsky, 37, stars as both the obdurate libertine of legend
and his grumbling man Friday. Richard Bradshaw, the general
director of the Canadian Opera Company, conducts his company's
orchestra and a Canadian supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp morning here, Hvorostovsky is ready for his close-up,
one of dozens. Don Giovanni, as we know from the opera, can scent a
woman a long way off, but today the note in every nostril is
poultry. When I arrived the previous morning, the star was working
up an appetite with a balletic serenade to a raven-haired,
fine-boned beauty who might have modeled for Balenciaga. She was
Donna Elvira's silent maid, portrayed by the mezzo-soprano Florence
Illi, Hvorostovsky's real-life companion, in a glamorous film
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the action had cut to the banquet scene, and
Hvorostovsky promptly went through four golden-brown birds, each
roasted to a turn. Today, he has already sunk his teeth into 11,
and the caterer has one more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do one more take,'' Hvorostovsky roars. ``Finish the
chicken!'' As he well knows, it is pheasant, in scrupulous
deference to the libretto. With the camera perhaps a foot from his
face, in a collar and vest out of a Velazquez portrait,
lip-synching lustily to the sound of his own voice in two roles, he
puts the last one away, losing chunks of food all over the table.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone watching agrees that it is great sport to watch a grown
man have so much fun behaving badly, though after several hours the
crew's stomachs are growling for something solid.
</P>
<P>
   Time moves in fits and starts, as usual on a film set. Out of
doldrums of seeming inactivity, activity erupts in fiercely focused
bursts, loops back on itself for no reason a visitor can discern,
then quietly expires of exhaustion. Ask Hvorostovsky what's up
next, and he shrugs. Another take, blocking for the next one:
whatever it is, he is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the camera, and he comes to life, eyes aglitter, savage or
seductive, outrageous or polished as the moment demands. When
released for the evening, he and Ms. Illi head straight to their
hotel. No detour through Ms. Sweete's office, where the top
technical staff reviews the day's rushes over glasses of Scotch.
Hvorostovsky needs his rest. Besides, he worries about becoming
self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Between takes, he lets go, ices a knee injured in a fall on the
set, chats with visitors or takes a scene partner aside to perfect
any tricky new business. A decade ago, when he arrived in the West,
gaunt and moody, his manner onstage and off struck many as ill at
ease, remote and arrogant: a far cry from the bulked-up, bullish
confidence he projects so effortlessly today on the concert stage
and in operas that call for it. On the set of ``Leporello,'' his
star quality is lost on no one, but he saves it for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the crew is so highly professional and
concentrated,'' he says in his dressing room. ``They set the best
example how to behave and how to work in the film. And this is
important for me, because I'm the new person here.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Ms. Sweete, a slight, trim figure in black, with
a neat brown ponytail, burns with the intensity of one whose mind
is a sea of detail, never at rest. Inevitably, tensions mount now
and again; when she tucks her chin down and to the left and her
forehead lowers, she is best not interrupted. But then, in a flash,
she turns girlish, as when the choreographer, Donna Feore, sweeps
her off her feet to show the cinematographer, Rene Ohashi, a whirl
she has devised for Hvorostovsky and his Donna Elvira.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweete is no Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you help?'' Ms. Feore sings out, laughing as she hoists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how,'' Ms. Sweete replies in a burst of giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the star limps from dressing room to soundstage
on a bandaged leg, and executes the step like a ballroom dancer,
over and over, lifting his soprano like a doll, again lip-synching
to perfection. These are not moments one expects to see at the
opera house. Could Hvorostovsky dance and lift this way while
actually producing sound? His raised eyebrows answer that it would
be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   By now, after three years of what Ms. Sweete calls her
``excavations'' into Mozart and da Ponte's Rake's Progress, she
could center a separate tale on each character, a la ``Rashomon.''
But her first idea, and the one that got financing, is the one she
might have called ``Leporello's Revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the servant gets his wish _ stated in the opening
lines of the opera _ to be a gentleman, to cut free from servitude
and take control.
</P>
<P>
   How? By making a movie of ``Don Giovanni'' from his own,
Leporello's, point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound more like the conceit of a director hellbent on
``making it new'' than it actually is. ``Whether it will be
received this way I don't know, but for me, every idea in
`Leporello' is supported by the music, because I found it in the
music,'' Ms. Sweete says. ``Everything was there in blueprint form.
When you do a lot of listening, the work tells you what it wants to
be. Imposing an idea, which happens when people think they have to
(italics)say(end italics) something, just makes things pretentious
and confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Sweete's ingenious scenario, Leporello _ producer,
director and star _ previews his magnum opus for the cast in a
Hollywood screening room of the mind, circa 1930. His
film-within-the-film, in sleek black-and-white, is a costume drama
played out among the abstract arcades and staircases of a surreal
17th-century Seville.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As Don Giovanni in the film-within-the-film, Leporello plays his
first several scenes masked like Zorro, giving his jealous erotic
fantasies and deep-seated resentments free rein. The Leporello of
the film-within-the-film, meanwhile, remains an off-screen
presence, heard but not seen. The screening-room sequences, in
color, reveal the cast members' ambiguous complicity with Leporello
the director, an exact parallel to their characters' guilty
love-hate relationship to Don Giovanni in the movie they are
watching with mounting anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Ms. Sweete takes liberties that card-carrying
Mozarteans may find baffling. Take the passage in which Don
Giovanni trades clothes with Leporello. Each dressed as the other,
the servant entertains his master's discarded lover while the boss
woos her maid. As da Ponte scripts the sequence, no single Romeo
could do double duty with both Juliets, but Ms. Sweete decrees
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she changes not a line. Unlike Stoppard, who in
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' stretched a dram of
Shakespeare with a magnum of his own vintage, Ms. Sweete distills,
losing nearly two hours of music. Only what bears directly on the
edgy symbiosis of man and master remains, and even their parts come
in for trimming.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the cuts, the highborn Donna Anna and the peasant
bride Zerlina, objects of Don Giovanni's insatiable libido, fade in
importance, while Donna Elvira, his self-styled wife, moves to the
center. At the same time, Ms. Sweete manages, without violating the
material, to develop not a take on ``Don Giovanni'' but a fresh
theme of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her Leporello is an artist consumed by his creation. He becomes
what he beholds, at the cost of his soul. As in the opera, a
supernatural avenger drags the Don Giovanni of the
film-within-the-film to hell, but he does not stop there. He blazes
his way into the screening room, wreaking an identical fate on
Leporello.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweete thinks of Don Giovanni and Leporello as two persons
within a single body. ``The imagery begins with the fact that
Dmitri is singing both roles, which wasn't the original idea,'' she
explains. ``At first we were trying to develop a project for Welsh
television about double baritones in Mozart, built around Bryn
Terfel. I'm not sure it was ever presented to Bryn, so that fell
apart. Still, Dmitri was so keen that we kept the idea alive. We
always knew he would do Don Giovanni, so I was looking for a
Leporello of the same stature. And then I thought, if there's no
one of his stature, let's get him to do both. Don Giovanni could be
Leporello's fantasy, an alter ego.''
</P>
<P>
   On the soundtrack, Hvorostovsky manages to create two distinct
voices within his own voice by subtleties of diction, attack and
timbre.
</P>
<P>
   In switching between the roles of servant and master,
Hvorostovsky joins a distinguished list of predecessors, including
Jose van Dam and Ferruccio Furlanetto. Samuel Ramey and Terfel have
not only performed both parts on stage but also recorded them for
leading labels. Fusing the parts in a single performance,
impossible in live theater, involves, for the singer, new technical
hurdles, not to mention a certain metaphysical frisson.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sellars was aiming at something of the sort when he cast
Eugene Perry as Don Giovanni opposite the Leporello of Herbert
Perry, Eugene's twin brother. Now, with the help of cinematic
illusion, Ms. Sweete goes Sellars one better.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky came to Toronto fresh from appearances in the
opera's title role in Geneva and Salzburg, but he had no stage
experience as Leporello. Not that he was unprepared. ``I had to
learn a lot,'' he says. ``I read a lot of literature. I listened to
every existing recording or film.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recording studio, where the soundtrack was prepared
before the shooting, Leporello's recitatives proved Hvorostovsky's
greatest challenge. The dialogues between Don Giovanni and
Leporello were laid down in stages. First Hvorostovsky sang Don
Giovanni's lines, with another singer filling in as Leporello. Then
Hvorostovsky overdubbed Leporello's lines. ``To match the other
guy's timing and to get my own ideas across,'' he says, ``that was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweete, now deep into the editing process, goes further:
``What Dmitri has done is heroic. I can't imagine anyone else in
the world who could have done it. Singing the parts the way he
does. Hitting his marks every time. He just has such an instinct
for the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the film is in the can, Hvorostovsky has dared to look
at some footage. His assessment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not an expert, but the professional people said I
look pretty natural in front of the camera,'' he allows. ``All I
had to adjust is the variety and the scale of my reactions. In
front of the camera you just think and your face shows expression.
Apart from stage work, it was helpful that I've done so many
recitals, which I've always considered a kind of theatrical show,
much more intimate than opera, with the semitones of chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm afraid I was giving too much. A lot could have
been even smaller. I had to sing, so things come out with an
operatic impact. But then we are talking about an opera movie, not
a movie movie.''

$1.6B US COLOMBIAN AID PLAN   DRAWS CRITICISM

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Putting most of its bets on Blackhawk helicopters
and US intelligence assistance, the Clinton administration proposed
Tuesday a $1.6 billion plan to help the besieged government of
Colombia attack the multiplying producers of cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which drew criticism from human rights groups and
some US congressmen for its dependence on military solutions, would
make Colombia the third largest recipient of US foreign aid, behind
Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the aid was ``urgently needed'' to keep
``illegal drugs off our shores'' and to ``help Colombia promote
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   While the plan includes $219 million in economic, social
development, and human rights assistance, the centerpieces of the
proposal were impossible to miss: 84 percent of $954 million in
this year's emergency request would go toward 30 Blackhawk
helicopters; 33 Huey helicopters; training two battalions;
providing aircraft and intelligence for drug interdiction; and
equipment to destroy coca and poppy fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a military-heavy package,'' acknowledged one senior
administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``But we are trying to right the balance in Colombia.'' He said
there would not be a substantial increase in the number of US
military advisers in Colombia, which now varies from 100 to 200.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes $238 million under the heading of
intelligence to help with locating drug labs and intercepting drug
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which bears some similarities to a Republican
congressional proposal and won qualified support Tuesday from House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, was unveiled just before the Central
Intelligence Agency is due to release its estimates of Colombian
cocaine production in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate is likely to be a shocker: it could be three times
higher than the 1998 figure of 165 metric tons of cocaine, the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the retired four-star Army general who heads
the drug control policy office, said Tuesday that four-fifths of
cocaine and heroin entering the United States either comes from
Colombia or is shipped through the Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said Americans shouldn't look at the plan as fighting
a distant battle in Colombia, but as something that directly
affects their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the program is not just to benefit the 35 million
people of Colombia, but it is to also benefit American children,''
he told reporters in the White House's Roosevelt Room, with a
painting of Theodore Roosevelt riding a stallion at one end.
``These drugs are a threat to our children in American, and in
Europe'' and elsewhere around the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of Colombia is now controlled by guerrillas in
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
FARC-controlled territory includes the two largest areas of coca
production, the Putumayo and Guaviare provinces. US officials said
the first step must be for Colombian police, with assistance from
the military, to reclaim control of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the Clinton
administration hopes that peace negotiations between FARC and the
government can be restarted. ``This is not a counter-insurgency
program,'' Albright said. ``This is a counter-narcotrafficking
program.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, Colombian President Andres Pastrana said he was
``satisfied'' with the administration's assistance package, which
he discussed with Clinton by telephone Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With this aid, Pastrana said, Clinton ``recognizes that drug
trafficking is a responsibility shared by both producers and
consumers,'' a point made commonly by Colombians who blame the drug
problems on demand from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana added that the package showed the administration's full
support for Colombia's new plan to reduce drug trafficking and its
related violence. That proposal, known as the Colombia Plan, has
drawn some fire for its emphasis on fumigation and other strategies
to reduce drug flow, rather than crop substitution projects for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Other Colombians feared that the heavy emphasis on weaponry and
military-style equipment would result in an escalation of the
country's 40-year-old civil war between the government, leftist
guerrillas, and right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the worst path we could take right now,'' said
Ricardo vargas Meza, director of Accion Andina, one of Colombia's
leading anti-drug advocacy groups. ``This looks like a decision to
completely involve the military in the war on drugs, and clearly
this package will strengthen the army. But in what direction? To
fight drugs or to fight guerrillas?''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat who
has traveled to Colombia twice in the last year, said he feared the
military emphasis could hurt the peace process. ``We will never
achieve our goal of reducing the flow of drugs into our country
until peace is achieved there,'' Delahunt said. ``It isn't going to
be done with bullets and helicopters.''

BUSH PUSHES TAX PLAN IN DEEP SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ First he went from a navy-blue business suit
to a casual windbreaker. Then Texas Governor George W. Bush, flying
by private plane from Michigan to South Carolina, shifted into a
deep Southern drawl during campaign stops with hundreds of seniors
and loyal Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, however, Bush hammered away at a single message:
That his tax plan was superior to the one released Tuesday by
Senator John McCain. Basking in the warm reception of a group of
barbecue-fed elderly supporters at the Florence Civic Center, he
also declared himself the candidate more devoted to saving the
Social Security program. Earlier in the day, he released a campaign
ad to the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my cats and my dog. I love my home. But I love my
country more,'' Bush said to the crowd, explaining his decision to
run for president. ``I believe it's important for us to make sure
the Social Security system is safe and secure today, and safe and
secure tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain in recent days has focused his criticism of Bush's tax
plan on how it would use the federal budget surplus. Under the Bush
plan, the surplus would translate into a five-year, $483 billion
tax cut for earners in all tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan, however, would use the budget surplus to
earmark $700 billion to shore up Social Security. His five-year,
$237 billion tax-cut plan would also encourage savings among
members of the middle class, work to protect Medicare and aim to
reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush took aim at McCain, ridiculing him for changing
his tax plan to appear more like the one the Texas governor
released months ago. But the thrust of his argument was that the
budget surplus belonged to taxpayers. Under his own plan, Bush
said, excess funds ``would be passed back to hard-working
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain's plan would leave more money in Washington to
be spent on more government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also repeated his familiar aims of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' closing the ``gap of hope,'' and bolstering the
nation's armed forces, all of which drew applause. He pledged to
return education funds to states, telling supporters: ``Rarely is
the question asked: Is our children learning?''
</P>
<P>
   Taxes ruled the day, however, and Bush swiftly dismissed
McCain's expansion of the 15 percent tax bracket as a trick of the
eye. ``If you simply expand the 15 percent tax bracket, there are a
lot of people who are not going to get tax relief ,'' Bush said.
According to a statement released by the Bush campaign just hours
after McCain announced his proposal, 70 million taxpayers are
already in the 15 percent tax bracket. Therefore, expanding that
bracket to other taxpayers would deny a huge swath of the country
the benefits of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan is nearly double in size and is far more sweeping,
with proposals to double the $500 per child tax credit and cut all
income taxes throughout the country. He has not designated any of
his tax plan for Medicare. A campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer,
said to do so would be premature until all Medicare fraud has been
eradicated. As for Social Security, Bush has devised a separate $2
trillion Social Security ``lock box.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the differences between the two, both candidates kept
their promise, made during a debate Monday night, to refrain from
negative remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, relaxed and confident after arriving in a state where he
is well ahead of McCain in the polls, told reporters: ``We've had a
difference and now he's revising his tax plan and I've always felt
it was important to lay out a plan that I could defend from
beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   He began the day in Grand Rapids, Mich., with Republican
Governor John Engler, one of Bush's most successful campaign
fund-raisers and a potential candidate for a Bush administration.
After flying to a barbecue in Florence, S.C., he flew to an oyster
roast in Charleston before returning to Columbia, the state
capital, for the night. Later this week he will travel to Delaware,
New Hampshire and Iowa _ his longest campaign swing to date.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will not, however, participate in a series of one-on-one
debates with McCain before the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1,
although McCain on Monday had accepted the invitation from a Boston
television station. To do so, Bush said, would ``let a TV station
winnow down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's fair,'' he said.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Hoping to gain ground on Vice President Al
Gore in this crucial primary state, former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley sharpened his usually mild campaign Tuesday, highlighting
his own anti-smoking record and pointing out inconsistencies in
Gore's record dating back several years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also described the Gore campaign's theatrics _ such as
the presence of a costumed volunteer known as ``Corn Man'' at his
events _ as ``adolescent,'' and sarcastically called it a show of
``real class.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Democratic contest growing more acrimonious by the day,
Gore responded harshly on the tobacco issue, saying Bradley is
breaking his pledge to run ``a different kind of campaign'' with no
negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've led the fight against smoking and against, you
know, the efforts by the companies to lure children into smoking,''
Gore said in a telephone interview with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of think that smacks of sort of desperate,
negative campaigning,'' said Gore, who spent the day talking with
senior citizens in Davenport, Iowa, about the high cost of
prescription drugs and rallying his troops in Muscatane, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   With the critical Iowa caucuses less than two weeks away, and
with both candidates' major policy proposals on the table,
hand-to-hand political combat is coming to dominate the race.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case here in Iowa, where Bradley lags far
behind Gore and has sought to recover from a lackluster debate
performance Saturday. Although Bradley has surged in New Hampshire
and elsewhere in the Northeast, the former senator and New York
Knicks player has been slower to catch on in the region around his
native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A day after describing Gore's education proposals as being in a
bureaucratic ``box,'' Bradley visited a Des Moines elementary
school to decry the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley denounced smoking as a cause of widespread illness and
death, and said its control was key to the health care plan at the
center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suggested he could save billions to pay for his health
care plan with measures like spending an extra $1 billion on
anti-smoking programs at the Centers for Disease Control, doubling
funding for community health care centers, and supporting new
research into the cause of youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters later, Bradley said he was not attacking
Gore but rather drawing natural contrasts required by a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some time, this was going to become competitive,'' said
Bradley. ``The issue is . . . consistency over time, and intensity
of feeling,'' on tobacco, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign press release, Bradley described himself as a
``leader'' of anti-tobacco efforts while he was a US Senator. The
release also targeted Gore's record, however, citing a 1985 vote by
then-Senator Gore against an amendment introduced by Bradley to
prevent a drop in the tobacco tax.
</P>
<P>
   And it included a quote from a letter Gore wrote to the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette in 1988 saying he does not think tobacco
advertising bans are the solution to smoking addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, a key leader in the national anti-smoking
battle rose to Gore's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supported strong tobacco-control efforts before anyone else
did,'' said David Kessler, a former head of the Food and Drug
Administration in the Clinton-Gore administration. Kessler, now
Dean of the Yale School of Medicine, praised Gore for ``remarkable
acts of courage'' in the anti-smoking fight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been criticized by opponents in the past for his
tobacco record. After a dramatic speech at the 1996 Democratic
National Convention in which he spoke about his sister's death from
smoking-related lung cancer, critics pointed out that Gore's family
had reaped profits from tobacco farming in Tennessee and Gore was
slammed for being hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's critique of Gore's tobacco record underscored the
difficulty he is having running a wholly positive campaign _
especially when he finds himself on the defensive and trailing in
the Iowa polls.
</P>
<P>
   Before raising the tobacco issue Tuesday morning, Bradley gave
an audience in Mason City his standard assessment of negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you've got to give people something to vote for, not
something to vote against,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has recently become frustrated with Gore's criticism
of his Senate votes on ethanol, farm relief and Ronald Reagan's
budget cuts, pointing out that some were cast 15 years ago or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among the Gore positions noted by the Bradley campaign's
release were a vote Gore made as a Senator 14 years ago, and two
quotations dating from 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser defended such jibes, saying that
Gore's attacks to date have been hypocritical and far nastier in
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of civility and consistency,'' Hauser said.

AGENCY THAT HELPS U.S. FIRMS ABROAD TRANSFORMS ITSELF IN GOP EYES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ohio, N.C., Fla., Colo.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly four years ago, the Republican-led House
voted to abolish the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a small
federal agency that provides insurance and loan guarantees to U.S.
companies that invest in developing nations, branding it as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   After barely surviving that brush with legislative death because
of support in the Senate, the agency culminated a startling
turnaround last fall when Congress renewed its lending and insuring
authority for four years, a rare example of bipartisanship in
foreign policy on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   How OPIC went from being the symbol for a Republican crusade
against government subsidies to being the champion of American
entrepreneurs in the global economy is also a story of how the
agency's new, politically astute leaders used a grass-roots
campaign to translate its business projects and policy goals into
something that all lawmakers understand: jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's been any kind of common-denominator issue over the
last year or so, where Democrats and Republicans were able to
agree, it's been on international trade,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., who as a businessman in the early 1990s used loans and
insurance from OPIC to help build one of the first fiber optic
telephone systems in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stewardship of George Munoz, OPIC's president and a
former chief financial officer at the Treasury Department, the
agency stifled its biggest critic in the House, Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio. It has at least momentarily converted its biggest opponent
in the Senate, Wayne Allard, R-Colo. And it won the support of
House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Since its near-demise in 1996, the agency has joined in
important Clinton administration goals abroad, from providing loan
guarantees for a pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil across Turkey to
establishing a $150 million investment fund for the Balkans after
the air war over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strategic regions like sub-Saharan Africa, Central America
and, most recently, Southeast Europe, OPIC is a significant
component of our foreign policy initiatives,'' said President
Clinton in December.
</P>
<P>
   For a little-known agency with an $18 billion portfolio and 200
employees _ with a main business of selling U.S. companies
insurance against political violence, expropriation and currency
inconvertibility overseas _ the turnaround strategy has been fairly
simple: redefine an agency sometimes confused with OPEC and repair
the political damage in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both jobs fell to Munoz, a 48-year-old former international
investment lawyer and skilled political infighter who was once the
president of the Chicago Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz sees his agency's role as supporting projects that pave
the way for broad private American investment. ``It's not our job
to be with every investor and to be in every deal,'' Munoz said in
an interview. ``We show by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking over the agency in late 1997, Munoz made
Capitol Hill his first stop. He and his deputy, Kirk Robertson, a
former top Senate Democratic aide, met with critics to address
concerns that their agency was another savings-and-loan crisis in
the making. OPIC's loan default rate is below 1 percent, and it
recovers from foreign governments 95 percent of insurance claims
paid out.
</P>
<P>
   Combatting the corporate welfare criticism, Munoz noted that
OPIC reaps more than $140 million in net income each year in fees
and premiums from corporate clients whose projects range from
shrimp farms to electric power companies. Munoz revamped how
managers were selected to h agency's emerging-market
investment funds, after being stung by criticism two years ago that
large political donors were landing the choice positions.
</P>
<P>
   OPIC is now courting small businesses more aggressively,
lowering the minimum loan size to $250,000 from $2 million and
streamlining the application for political risk insurance to five
pages from 20.
</P>
<P>
   One entrepreneur, Boris Shlommc, owner of Amicale Industries in
New York, said insurance from OPIC had been instrumental in helping
build a joint venture in Mongolia that sorts, scours, dries and
bales raw camel and goat hair to make yarn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, OPIC was looked on as an organization there to help
big business, and big business needs very little help,'' said Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who heads the House international
relations subcommittee that oversees OPIC.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Munoz and Robertson have packed up their
glossy brochures and spreadsheets and hit the road, visiting more
than 30 states, often at locally sponsored export conferences. They
also come armed with new statistics, posted on an expanded Web
site, that promote a state-by-state breakdown of jobs and exports
created by agency projects in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take an agency that a lot of people didn't
understand and bring it down to cases, so members can see you doing
well at home,'' said Edmund Rice, president of the Coalition for
Employment Through Exports, an association of 35 major American
exporters and banks. ``To me, that's good politics.''
</P>
<P>
   One early supporter was Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``Private investment supported
by OPIC does far more to promote growth and to ensure economic and
political stability in developing countries than does any amount of
wasteful foreign aid,'' Helms told a group of Charlotte business
leaders in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend, however, that special interests are pressing
lawmakers to support OPIC ventures that private companies consider
too risky to support. ``The agency finds people in members'
districts who get OPIC loans to raise hell and calls it
education,'' said Myron Ebell, an international policy analyst at
the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an economic research group
here. ``Arm twisting is what I'd call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Munoz's changes have panned out, like ensuring that
OPIC projects do not hurt the environment in host countries. ``On
paper, their environmental standards look good, but their record
for implementation is spotty,'' said Jon Sohn, an international
policy analyst for Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most congressional critics have backed off. ``They
were very organized,'' acknowledged Kasich, who remains
philosophically opposed to the government's providing loans or
insurance to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Allard, after meeting Munoz several times, agreed: ``I still
have some concerns about OPIC, but we'll give him a year and check
back. He's trying.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ One of the crafty pleasures of Peter Shaffer's
``Amadeus'' is that it is constructed in such a way that it seems
to be about _ and to reveal _ someone who, in life, would have
possessed the profound inscrutability of genius: Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart (1756-1791), child prodigy and tireless performer at
European courts, composer of some of the most sublime music ever
written, dead at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart appears to be the chief concern of ``Amadeus,'' at stage
center much of the time, running, jumping, whining and whinnying. A
rude, overbearing fellow, in his mid-20s when first met, he creates
his master-works with an ease that he dismisses with arrogance, or
with the kinds of apologies designed to insult by being so patently
insincere.
</P>
<P>
   He's still a child, but a holy one. Mozart has no idea why he
irritates so many people and, worse, he doesn't care. Most
maddening: he takes his astonishing gifts for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Standing off to one side, seeing all and hearing Mozart's music,
which only he understands to be a manifestation of God's love, is
Antonio Salieri, the ambitious Italian-born composer and conductor,
a favorite at the imperial court in Vienna in 1781.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart may be the center of ``Amadeus,'' but Salieri is its
dominant, mesmerizing presence, the conductor of this drama, a
desperate, tragic figure who provides us with the means to see
Mozart's genius in a recognizable human dimension. Salieri is the
nearly perfect prism through which a character as complex and
mysterious as Mozart can be evoked in a piece of dramatic fiction
written by a mere mortal.
</P>
<P>
   This is Shaffer's achievement in ``Amadeus,'' which first opened
in New York in 1980 and played nearly three years, and has now come
back, in slightly altered form, to take up residence at the Music
Box Theater. Sir Peter Hall, who directed the first production, has
also staged the new one, which stars David Suchet as Salieri and
Michael Sheen, a young Welsh actor, in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   The production was first done at the Old Vic in London in
October 1998 and comes to New York via an engagement at the
Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer has been quoted as saying that the changes he has made
have been intended to tone down all that was too ``splendidly
melodramatic'' in the original production. He has also muted
Mozart's manic giggle, which I rather liked, though it baffled and
confused many others.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the changes, most of them won't be recognized by
someone who hasn't compared the scripts of the two productions. For
anyone seeing ``Amadeus'' for the first time, the play should be a
terrifically entertaining, highly theatrical discovery.
</P>
<P>
   It also adds tone to a Broadway season parched for nonmusical
pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of tortured genius have always brought out the worst of
those in the popular arts who would explain the phenomenon. Think
of Charlton Heston as Michelangelo in ``The Agony and the
Ecstasy,'' a moody windbag with well-oiled pectorals and an intense
gaze made possible by the pin spots that light his deep-set eyes.
Or Kirk Douglas as a red-bearded macho van Gogh in ``Lust for
Life'' and Cornel Wilde as a gormless Chopin in ``A Song to
Remember.'' Instant camp, all.
</P>
<P>
   Genius, for good reason, isn't often met in either theater or
films these days. It too easily looks like self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   As if in respect for the singularity of his subject, Shaffer,
who was a music critic in London before he became a successful
playwright, stands at a distance from Mozart, using Salieri almost
in the way that a medium uses a familiar to communicate with the
dead. It's a brilliant theatrical ploy. It allows him to consider
the frenzied life of someone cursed with unimaginable gifts without
being required to analyze them as a conventional biographer might.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who feel that Shaffer has fiddled with facts in
``Amadeus'' by using the gossip that Salieri poisoned Mozart, which
figures in Rimsky-Korsakov's 1897 opera, ``Mozart and Salieri.''
Though that story has apparently long since been discredited,
Shaffer uses it not as fact but as one of the elements in the fever
dreams that Salieri shares with the audience on what he expects to
be the last night of his life in 1823.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on this terrible night, ``Amadeus'' is mostly a series
of interlocking hallucinations that bounce around in time from 1823
to 1781, back to 1823 and finally to 1825.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadeus'' isn't really ``about'' the poison plot or about the
decline, after his death, in Salieri's once-formidable reputation
as a composer and conductor. Rather, it is about Salieri's fury
with God when he is forced to acknowledge to himself that his own
talents as a composer come to nothing when compared to those of
Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadeus'' is about Salieri's fantastic, futile refusal to
accept his fate. ``They say that God is not mocked,'' he calls out
to the one he calls Signore. ``I tell you, Man is not mocked! ... I
am not mocked!''
</P>
<P>
   Early on he confides to the audience that he first recognized
God as ``the candle-smoked'' figure ``staring at the world with
dealer's eyes,'' an image on the wall of a church in his native
Lombardy. ``Tradesmen had put him up there,'' he says. ``Those eyes
made bargains real and irreversible. `You give me so _ I'll give
you so! No more. No less!'''
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Salieri made a bargain with that dealer-God. He
asked to become a composer and to have ``sufficient fame to enjoy
it.'' In return, he vowed to live in virtue, to better the lot of
his fellow creatures and to honor God with music all the days of
his life. Salieri is taken up by the court in Vienna, where he
flourishes, securing God's blessings, until Mozart arrives seeking
royal patronage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, the older man dismisses Mozart as a gross,
ill-mannered parvenu. Then, in one stunning sequence, the audience
sees Salieri as he responds to a Mozart serenade being played by
the composer offstage.
</P>
<P>
   Salieri describes his feelings with an intensity and a passion
that, we realize, must be missing from his own work. He makes
comprehensible the glories of the music, but without damaging the
integrity of the mystery of its creation. It is as if he had been
double-crossed by the shifty figure with a dealer's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was suddenly frightened,'' Salieri says. ``It seemed to me
that I had heard the voice of God _ and that it issued from a
creature whose own voice I had also heard _ and it was the voice of
an obscene child.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Salieri isn't meant to be a comic character, there is
something essentially comic about his schemes to discredit the
younger man, who initially considers Salieri nothing more than a
stuffed shirt. Salieri's plots are often successful but, as he
knows, he will lose in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   There is a superb scene near the end of the first act when
Salieri studies a batch of Mozart's original manuscripts, which, to
his horror, look ``like fair copies,'' containing no corrections of
any kind. ``It was puzzling _ then suddenly alarming,'' he says.
Mozart, he realizes, wasn't composing like anyone else, but
``simply transcribing music completely finished in his head.''
Finally, ``I was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink
strokes at _ an Absolute Beauty!''
</P>
<P>
   What illuminates ``Amadeus'' as much as anything else is the
playwright's passion for Mozart's work, expressed, indirectly,
through Salieri's jealousy and spiritual desolation. Only Salieri
understands the melancholy that informs even the most effervescent
of Mozart's operas, and the triumphs that are yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, I suppose, if you bring along to the theater your own
preconditioned responses to Mozart's music, which we hear in short
excerpts at important moments. Yet the play is so cannily
constructed that, I suspect, it is not even necessary to have that
baggage to experience the play's full emotional and intellectual
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sir Peter's revival of ``An Ideal Husband,'' one of the
hits of the 1996 Broadway season, the new production is nearly
flawless, so fluidly staged that it has the movement and pacing of
choreography. There are even moments when it suggests a piece as
elegant and dark as ``Cosi Fan Tutte.''
</P>
<P>
   Suchet is best known in this country for his television
performances as Agatha Christie's pursed-lipped, impeccably groomed
Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. If one is not used to seeing him
play other roles, it is something of a shock to find him filling
the shoes of Ian McKellen, Broadway's original, raging Salieri, and
F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for his diabolical Salieri in
Milos Forman's 1984 film adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Suchet's performance is softer, less brutally crazed than those
of any of the predecessors I have seen in the role, maybe because
of Shaffer's rewrites. This production is thus sadder and more
introspective.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen realizes all of the uproarious, randy outrageousness of
Mozart. He also exudes the kind of breathless energy that, one
assumes, Mozart must have possessed to create such a huge body of
work in such a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable cast members: Cindy Katz, who plays Mozart's
somewhat foolish but sexy wife, Constanze, and David McCallum, who
is quite funny as the Hapsburg king, Joseph II, not a stupid man
and, when he attends to a situation, often astute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadeus'' is poetically attuned to one of the most haunting
characters of modern European civilization. You might suspect that
Mozart knew his time was running out even when, at the age of 8, he
was being shown off at the court of Louis XV at Versailles. All his
life he was running to meet his obligations, to keep ahead of time,
driven by his father, by his economic circumstances, by his wife,
by the sounds inside his head that Salieri could have killed for,
but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Shaffer: don't forget Salieri. He called out to God,
and God laughed.

MEDIA ESTIMATES VARY ON TOTAL WORTH OF AOL-TIME WARNER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no question that the deal proposed on Monday by America
Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. would be the biggest corporate
combination in American history. How much it would be worth is a
different matter.
</P>
<P>
   A press release issued by the companies called it a $350 billion
deal. But few, if any, media reports published Tuesday agreed on
the value of the deal. Their pricetags ranged from $156.14 billion
to $335 billion, depending on how the math was done.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimates were close to the $165 billion value that The New
York Times placed on the deal. That figure was reached by
multiplying the price of America Online's stock before the deal was
announced, $73.4375 a share, by the number of shares America Online
is offering for each Time Warner share, 1.5, by Time Warner's
estimate of all the shares of its stock that people have claims on,
1.5 billion. That total rounds off to $165 billion and, because it
is based on a pre-announcement price, will remain constant until
the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers used different formulas: The Wall Street
Journal's calculation of $156.14 billion was based on a lower
number of shares, 1.461 billion, and America Online's closing price
Monday, $71.25. The Washington Post added in $17 billion of Time
Warner debt to arrive at $183 billion. The Financial Times added
the stock-market values of the two companies to get $335 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the deal knocked off the previous holder of the
title of biggest American corporate combination, MCI WorldCom
Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Sprint Corp., which has an estimated
value of $115 billion. But at least by some calculations, the lead
narrowed Tuesday when shares of America Online dropped almost 10
percent.

RATES RISE AMID CONCERNS ON RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Interest rates surged Tuesday as investors worried
about how fast the economy is growing and how hard the Federal
Reserve will have to step on the brakes to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.67 percent, from 6.59
percent Thursday, its highest level since September 1997. The
price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 3/32, to 92
31/32. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to
coming rate moves by the Fed, rose to 6.43 percent, from 6.35
percent, its highest since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a Fed move to raise short-term interest rates is
also narrowing sharply the difference, or spread, between short-
and long-term Treasury maturities. The spread between the yield on
the two-year note and the 30-year bond is now just under a quarter
of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The usual monitors of market sentiment indicate that investors
expect Fed policy makers to make two increases of a quarter
percentage point in its short-term interest rate target, the first
on Feb. 2 and the second in March. The Fed's current short-term
rate, known as the federal funds target, is 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the April federal funds futures contract, which
reflects a bet on what that short-term rate will average in that
month, is now 6.005 percent, half a percentage point higher.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of a half a percentage point increase in February is
increasing. ``Yes, there is panic in the street,'' said Ward
McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J. ``And much of it is psychologically
related to the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the unease is the anticipation of three important
economic reports this week: the Producer Price Index and retail
sales on Thursday and the Consumer Price Index on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important is retail sales, which are expected
to rise about 1 percent for December, showing that consumers are
still spending. With the economy growing at an annual rate of about
5 percent for the last six months, strong consumer spending makes a
slowdown much less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would just like to see some clear sign that consumer
spending is leveling off,'' McCarthy said. But the stock market,
which had its fifth year in a row of double-digit returns last
year, may have to cool so that consumers feel just a little less
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is only predicting two quarter-point rate increases
by the Fed right now, Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase
Asset Management, said, ``The Fed will keep tightening until they
see definitive signs of this economy slowing to a noninflationary
pace.'' And, he added, the only sector showing any hint of slowing
now is housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price index is expected to rise by 0.3 percent for
December. That increase would bring the inflation rate for 1999 to
2.7 percent, up from 1.6 percent in 1998. Much of that increase,
however, can be attributed to a doubling in the price of oil. The
core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy costs, would
still come in at about 2 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Because the core rate of inflation has actually declined, the
jump in the headline rate is considered less worrisome to Fed
officials than the continued strong economic growth and the
tightening labor market, which is threatening to push wages higher.
</P>
<P>
   All of this good news on growth is leading analysts to raise
their expectations of Fed rate increases. McCarthy now expects
three-quarters of a percentage point rise, and other analysts say
that the yield on the 30-year bond will easily get to 7 percent
before the Fed is finished.

McCAIN TOUTS TAX PLAN `A LEADER CAN KEEP' 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain suggested Tuesday that his tax
plan was more realistic than that proposed by George W. Bush
because it still leaves a significant chunk of the surplus to shore
up Social Security and whittle down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   With tax policy rapidly become the central point of contention
between the leading Republican presidential contenders, McCain told
a Chamber of Commerce audience that his $240 billion tax cut would
leave funds available to extend the life of Social Security by
phasing in private retirement investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to make up lost ground in this fiscally
conservative state by aggressively pitching a $483 billion tax
plan, which the Texas governor has claimed would help more
lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Michigan and South Carolina on Tuesday, Bush
criticized McCain again for not proposing enough tax relief, and he
chided the Arizona senator for revising his tax plan to include the
same expansion of the child tax credit as Bush has offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a difference, and he's now revising his tax plan,''
Bush said in Grand Rapids, Mich. ``I've always felt it was
important to lay out one (plan) I was willing to defend from
beginning to end, and that's what I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain countered that his plan should be more appealing to
conservatives because it would not rely on overly optimistic fiscal
projections and would meet commitments to children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake. We can afford a tax cut, and the American
taxpayers deserve one. But it must be a tax cut promise a leader
can keep,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``others suggest that we should use every penny
for tax cuts, forgetting we have promises to keep and a fleeting
opportunity to keep our word without imperiling the economic future
of our children and generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was important to use the budget surplus for tax
relief and not give Congress additional money to spend for unneeded
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set the promise bar on taxes high last week when he vowed
that he would offer ``tax cuts, so help me God.'' While the Texas
governor was clearly making a pitch to tax-averse New Hampshire
Republicans, it also revived memories of his father's broken
pledge: ``Read my lips: No new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain proposed that the government use about two-thirds of the
surplus that is not devoted to Social Security to ensure the
retirement fund has enough money to pay out benefits as the baby
boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   To generate better retirement benefits McCain proposed allowing
people to divert 20 percent of the Social Security payroll tax to
privately invested retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said his proposal would extend the life of Social
Security by 11 years. Currently the retirement fund is expected to
take in less money than it pays out by 2014 and to be unable to pay
full benefits by 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Private retirement accounts have been popular among Republican
lawmakers, but Democrats have criticized such plans as risky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has embraced the concept of private retirement accounts,
but he has not offered details of how such a plan would work and
how it would be paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his plan does not offer tax cuts at the expense of
Social Security. ``My plan honors the base lines of the (federal)
budget over the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Bush began running a new television commercial in
South Carolina, which will hold its primary Feb. 19, touting his
efforts to ``save and strengthen Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   An announcer in the 30-second spot promises that under Bush's
plan there will be ``no reduction of benefits for retirees and
those nearing retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing proposals offered by President Clinton and congressional
Democrats, McCain said he wanted to use a portion of the surplus
for Medicare and to pay down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said there still would be enough money left for a tax cut
that would begin to ease the burden on married people and expand
the number of taxpayers in the lowest 15 percent tax bracket. His
plan would also expand the child tax credit and eliminate income
tax for military personnel stationed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said McCain's proposal to broaden the number of people
covered by the lowest federal tax bracket of 15 percent wouldn't
provide enough tax relief for lower-income Americans, such as the
working poor and single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went an important step farther by dropping the (lowest
bracket) rate from 15 percent to 10 percent,'' Bush added. ``That's
important to knock down the toll booth to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   To help defray the costs of tax cuts, McCain also vowed to
eliminate $151 billion in tax breaks for big business, as part of
his campaign theme of reducing the influence of special interests
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tax dollar now wasted on special breaks for oil
companies, ethanol giants, insurance companies and the multitude of
other powerful special interests with their armies of lobbyists is
now at risk,'' he said. ``We are going to take that money back and
end the corporate welfare bonanza and give tax relief to the
American people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For most Americans, linking to cyberspace from home is akin to
trying to eat a vat of thick, rich soup with a straw. With their
$165 billion merger deal, America Online and Time Warner intend to
start handing out ladles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's merger agreement between America Online, the No. 1
Internet provider, and Time Warner, the media and cable television
titan, is reverberating throughout the communications and media
industries. But the most important impact for consumers may be how
the deal advances the deployment of high-speed Internet access,
enabling people to zip about the Internet at speeds previously
enjoyed mostly by well-heeled businesses.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is hoping to use Time Warner's extensive cable
television systems to deliver torrents of digital data. Time
Warner's systems reach only about a fifth of the nation's homes _
roughly 22 million households _ but Monday's deal may well set off
a chain reaction among local phone companies, long-distance giants,
other cable providers and wireless carriers to step up their
high-speed Internet strategies.
</P>
<P>
   That scramble will include companies ranging from AT&AMP;T to Bell
Atlantic, though all of them face serious technical, finanical and
regulatory challenges before they can make high-speed, or
broadband, access as pervasive as the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as the America Online-Time Warner deal reshapes the
competitive landscape within the communications business, many
analysts believe that consumers stand to benefit from the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race to provide broadband access will only accelerate from
here,'' said Daniel P. Reingold, chief telecommunications analyst
for Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. ``It's always
been in AOL's interest to have multiple suppliers of high-speed
access, and that interest dovetails with the consumers' interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's cable systems range across the nation, but New
York City appears set to become a prime battleground. Time Warner
provides cable television service in parts of Brooklyn and Queens
and is the dominant cable provider in Staten Island and Manhattan,
considered a prime market because of its heavy population of
wealthy, technology-savvy consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its deal with America Online, Time Warner was
planning to offer high-speed Internet service throughout Manhattan
by this fall _ a plan the company says has not changed as a result
of the deal. But Time Warner's linking with America Online may
prompt Bell Atlantic and other smaller companies to accelerate
their own high-speed Internet agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal creates new energy about access to the Internet, and
if you peel back the onion a little bit it's really about
high-speed access to the Internet,'' said David Gallemore,
executive vice president for strategic planning and marketing for
SBC Communications Inc., the Bell local phone giant that does
business as Ameritech, Pacific Bell, Southern New England
Telecommunications and Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, America Online's interests appeared to reflect Time
Warner's. The owner of high-profile media products ranging from
People magazine to the Cable News Network, Time Warner wants to
extend the reach of those brands into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with expanded availability of lightning-quick data
connections, the migration of Time Warner's media properties into
cyberspace could help remake the Internet over the next few years
from a largely static environment of pictures and text to a dynamic
arena of television-quality video and CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   But in forging a merger with Time Warner, the No. 2 cable
provider, America Online's interests did not necessarily dovetail
with those of the other communications behemoths jockeying to lead
the digital revolution. How these other companies cope with the new
giant in their midst will have important implications for how, when
and from whom consumers are finally able to buy a ticket to the
digital future.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing questions, and the murkiest answers, are
about AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Since C. Michael Armstrong, former chairman of General Motors'
Hughes Electronics unit, took over as AT&AMP;T's chairman in 1997, the
company has agreed to spend more than $100 billion of its
shareholders' money in deals to acquire the cable giants
Tele-Communications Inc. and Mediaone Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With those deals, AT&AMP;T, already the biggest phone company, has
become the biggest cable television provider in the nation. But
AT&AMP;T wants to use the systems it has acquired to deliver far more
than television. It also wants to offer local telephone service and
high-speed Internet links using the same systems.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, AT&AMP;T and America Online have been at odds through the
last year over whether AT&AMP;T should have to open its cable systems
to allow other Internet companies, like America Online, easy access
to AT&AMP;T's cable subscribers. Late last year, AT&AMP;T tried to
forestall any potential new regulation by announcing a set of
principles for open access supported by Mindspring, the big
independent Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, AT&AMP;T has been working hard, at least since
last summer, to cut a side deal with America Online, according to
executives close to the talks. Such a deal would help AT&AMP;T drive
penetration of its high-speed Internet service by marketing it to
America Online's 22 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that America Online is set to control millions of cable
lines of its own, AT&AMP;T may find its bargaining position weakened,
some analysts said Tuesday. If AT&AMP;T fails to make a deal with
America Online, it could become more difficult for AT&AMP;T to sign up
millions of customers for its cable modem service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, AT&AMP;T, Time Warner and America Online appear
to have a common interest. Because most cable systems are local
monopolies, AT&AMP;T's cable operation does not compete directly
against Time Warner's. And despite the size of the deal, merging
with Time Warner still will get America Online direct cable access
to only about 20 percent of the nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, many analysts expect the three companies to form
at least a loose alliance, especially since AT&AMP;T can help a
combined AOL Time Warner deliver telephone service over its cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Such an alliance, however, could further strain America Online's
relationship with the Bell local telephone giants.
</P>
<P>
   Even as cable television companies across the nation are
upgrading their systems to deliver advanced Internet services,
local phone companies are racing to beat them to the punch using
DSL, or digital subscriber lines, a technology that transmits huge
volumes of digital data over standard phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, America Online announced agreements with the two
biggest local phone carriers, Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications
Inc., to market the Bells' DSL Internet service to America Online's
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But now, America Online is set to own cable systems in New York
City, in the heart of Bell Atlantic's territory, and in Houston, in
the heart of SBC's. Not surprisingly, executives close to Bell
Atlantic and SBC said Tuesday that they were somewhat disappointed
in the Time Warner deal because it could impede their plans to
deliver high-speed Internet service over phone lines. (However, the
overall level of overlap between Time Warner's systems and those of
Bell Atlantic and SBC is low.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably pushes AOL closer to AT&AMP;T and other cable
operators and away from the Bell operating companies in terms of
broadband distribution,'' said Eric Strumingher, a communications
analyst for Paine Webber. ``I think AOL's vision is to have the
type of customer experience that is going to require massive
amounts of broadband capacity, and the cable industry is well ahead
of where the Bells are in terms of delivering this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the merger was seen as a general vote of
confidence in high-speed Internet service over cable buoyed the
stocks of many cable companies Monday. But even that could not help
Excite(at)Home, the cable modem venture, Tuesday as many
communications analysts and executives said the venture, which has
tried to compete against America Online, appeared to have been
outmaneuvered. Excite(at)Home's shares fell $2.875, to $37.25, in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(at)Home has exclusive deals to offer Internet services
over the lines of a roster of cable companies, including AT&AMP;T (and
not including Time Warner), but many of those deals run out in two
years. Excite(at)Home has signed up about 1 million customers, but
now America Online has waded into the cable business with its 22
million users and a great chance to seduce Excite(at)Home's cable
partners when the exclusive arrangements expire.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell, Excite(at)Home's president, said Tuesday that the
America Online-Time Warner deal underscored the imporance in the
communications industry of broadband and of owning popular media
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This places broadband at the center of how these content forms
are delivered,'' Bell said. ``The broadband platform becomes very
much a centerpiece for any company that wants to be a leader in any
sort of media in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many analysts, what the deal truly underscores is the
value of customers. America Online has them, and as communications
carriers of every description vie to offer high-speed Internet
service, they are all waiting to see just how the company chooses
to throw its customers' weight around.

 &HT;    Analysts differ over effect merger will have on industry
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With its $166 billion purchase of Time Warner, America
Online recasts the battle over which kind of company _ cable or
telephone _ will run the ``fat pipe'' carrying Internet, television
and telephone into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The massive merger, combining the content of a massive media
company with the Internet heft of AOL _ and the 13 million homes
reached by Time Warner cable _ reaches across boundaries of
geography, markets and technology, threatening to outflank the
likes of BellSouth and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement itself changes things,'' Jeanne Schaaf,
senior telecom analyst at Forrester Research. ``The battleground
was pipes _ the delivery vehicle. Now, maybe the battleground is
content. It has the potential to turn telecommunications on its
head.''
</P>
<P>
   The potentially gigantic market for high-speed Internet
connections is a chain of content, context and access, he said:
Access is the delivery method, like the high-speed digital
subscriber lines offered by BellSouth. Context is the service like
AOL, MindSpring, Excite At Home that gets people to the Net.
Content includes the programming _ video, audio, data _ that people
will go to the Internet for.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on infrastructure puts telecom companies at a
disadvantage, said Rolf De Vegt, vice president of Renaissance
International, a Boston-based consulting company. ``Customers are
more interested in content than in who their provider is. This
makes it much harder for the telecommunications companies to
differentiate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That could leave the telecom companies looking for more muscular
content providers, like Walt Disney Co. or Yahoo. But each of the
big telecom companies has a distinct perspective. BellSouth, for
example, has an alliance with Disney to provide digital television
in some markets, and another deal with MyWay.com for some localized
Internet content. BellSouth also has its own Internet unit _
BellSouth.net_ as does Bell Atlantic. All regional Bells offer
digital subscriber lines, DSL, as the path for high-speed access to
the Net. But the ``telcos'' have had a harder time than expected
deploying the fast lines widely.
</P>
<P>
   The cable modem will have a lead for at least the next several
years, according to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   And although users of high-speed access _ broadband _ remain a
fraction of the online population, the numbers will grow swiftly,
predicts Jupiter analyst Zia Daniell Wigder.
</P>
<P>
   DSL now represents about 1 million people, compared to about 2.8
million users of cable modems. Cable modem use will increase to 7.7
million by 2003, with 5.7 million on DSL.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there are about 46.4 million dial-up users now,
including nearly all AOL subscribers. However, growth of that group
has slowed and will increase only to 52.3 million in 2003,
according to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Without content, the telecom companies are selling speed only _
and that is not enough, said Wigder. ``You'll get the early
adopters, but when you get to the mass market, you will hit a brick
wall. The average person will say, 'why should I pay $40 a month
more just to have the same Internet experience only faster?'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the new behemoth will still need access to tens of millions
of homes not served by Time Warner's cable unit. That can mean
alliances with other cable companies or with phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher said that's why the deal could
be good news. ``They are going to be a large customer for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With BellSouth already providing content, he shrugged off the
notion that the gigantic merger reshapes the industry. ``I don't
think it changes anything as to the direction we are going. We
constantly crank out good earnings, quarter after quarter, to our
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on content is overblown, he said. ``I would say
that content is one of many pieces. Customer care is critical to
us. Okay, you've got content, but what is the customers' experience
once they go on there?''

MCCAIN SAYS US MILITARY IN DISARRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His grandfather was a four-star admiral during the
Second World War. His father, also an admiral, was chief of U.S.
forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War. And in that war, he
himself was held prisoner in Hanoi for more than five years, and
emerged a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Senator John McCain whether he'd suggest a career in the
military for his own children, and he gives a sad look and says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you asked the question, I really am,'' he said
Tuesday at a meeting with Boston Globe editors and reporters. ``I
would encourage all of my children to serve, but I could not at
this moment say that I'd recommend a career.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain would not want his children to choose the path that has
defined his family for three generations because the military is in
such disarray, he said. Troops are misdeployed, resources are
wasted, and infighting among officials has hindered effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the worst conditions are the men and women,'' McCain said.
``It's just not believable that we as a nation would have 12,000
proud young men and women in uniform on food stamps''
</P>
<P>
   If his reluctance to see his children follow his example was
unexpected, it was hardly out of character. For McCain is a
candidate who frequently surprises with his views, and the wry or
pointed way he prefers to frame them.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he labels himself a conservative but comes
across, on many issues, as a ringing moderate _ a pattern he
repeated in his remarks and that his GOP rivals have been keen to
point out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the issues he is most passionate about -- preserving
Head Start and WIC; bringing an end to the soft money contributions
that have sustained both parties in recent years; diminishing the
gaps between the haves and the have-nots; restructuring the
military rather than pouring more money into it -- are all
positions a Democrat might gladly own.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain defends his conservative credentials, and speaks
to his more conservative positions -- like his opposition to
abortion -- when asked about them, he is clearly trying to present
himself as a more of a moderate or centrist than his leading rival,
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain criticized Bush for presenting a tax cut plan that gives
too many concessions to the rich, and not enough to poor and
working-class people. The Texas governor has proposed cuts of $483
billion over five years, whereas McCain would cut taxes by $237
billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've got some money, let's try to take care of these
obligations we've incurred and at the same time give low and middle
income Americans a better deal than they've been getting,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would take 62 percent of the projected budget
surplus to shore up social security, pour 10 percent of it into
Medicare, use 5 percent for the national debt, and put 23 percent
of the surplus towards tax cuts, which would also be funded by
``closing corporate loopholes and eliminating wasteful spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We give a millionaire a $2,000 return, and Governor Bush gives
them $50,000,'' McCain said. ``We give the rich some money back,
but we're trying to help working and middle-class americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have criticized McCain's tax plan for being
too timid. In a press release Tuesday, Bush was quoted as saying
McCain's plans for the surplus would ``leave more money in
Washington to be spent on more government.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a charge that is often leveled at Democrats. But McCain
insists it is more conservative course to want to pay down debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator holds other positions that make him
similarly vulnerable to criticism from more emphatic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He believes special education funding should be increased, and
is a fan of programs like Head Start and WIC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head Start works, WIC programs work,'' McCain said. ``I agree
with my friend John Kerry who's done a lot of work on the issue
early childhood development. We're finding that has a greater and
greater impact on how students and children perform later in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was very uncomfortable with public discussions over
policies toward gays in the military, an issue that has sparked
some of the most passionate exchanges in candidate debates so far.
He said he believes it is a matter best left to a sitting president
and his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain conceded that his message might not be quite as
traditionally conservative as some Republican voters might like.
``I'm not so sure that what I'm saying is going to be enough to
take enough conservative voters...in some states, but we'll have to
find out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he would match his conservative credentials
against anyone's. He noted several areas where he would differ with
liberals _ his desire for smaller government, the fact that he has
never voted for a tax increase, his wish to strengthen the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But only when a Globe columnist suggested his pro-life stance as
a possible point of contrast did he mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Roe v Wade,'' McCain said. ``I'm for the repeal of Roe v
Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, McCain rarely raises his pro-life
position unless he is questioned about it directly. And sometimes,
his answers on the issue _ his refusal to use a pro-life litmus
test for supreme court judges or a running-mate -- have not pleased
pro-life activists. McCain said one pro-life group has just made an
advertisement attacking him.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was philosophical about such critics, and suggested
his approach might prove a tactical advantage in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only run on what I believe, and on what's best for
America,'' he said. ``I won't have to shift as they have in other
campaigns, round to the right and then to the left. I won't have to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not softened his position on campaign finance reform _
another issue on which he has been accused of not being tough
enough on Democrats _ since it was revealed by the Globe last week
that he intervened with the Federal Communications Commission on
behalf of a large donor. McCain continued to maintain he had done
nothing wrong, and cited the opinions of several campaign finance
and consumer watchdogs who held him blameless in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was putting their feet in the fire. People who deal with
bureaucracies always feel a great frustration,'' McCain said. ``I
was frustrated. I wrote them a letter advising them to react and
they didn't reply.''

JUSTICES EXPRESS SKEPTICISM ABOUT LAW AIMED AT GENDER VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (With SCOTUS-STATES) 
(sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the Supreme Court wanted to underscore the
constitutional vulnerability of the Violence Against Women Act, it
could hardly have orchestrated a more convincing demonstration than
it put on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the justices open their session by declaring, in a
separate case argued three months ago, that Congress lacked
authority to make the federal law against age discrimination
binding on the states. But then, during arguments on the
constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, members of the
same five-justice majority in the age discrimination case made
abundantly clear their deep skepticism about whether Congress had
an adequate basis for opening federal courts to suits by victims of
violence ``motivated by gender'' against their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, just
before the Supreme Court set itself on its current course of
subjecting to searching scrutiny any congressional action that
could conceivably impinge on state sovereignty or traditional
prerogatives. In a sense, the statute and the court's growing list
of federalism rulings have been on an inevitable collision course
that ended in the courtroom on Tuesday morning, with little
evidence that the 5-4 states' rights majority would shift course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your approach would justify a federal remedy for alimony,
child support, even contract disputes,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said disapprovingly to Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman,
who was arguing the government's appeal from a ruling that the
law's civil damages provision was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Some students of the court have speculated that O'Connor's
record of solicitude for women's interests might, in this case,
trump her demonstrated commitment to keeping federal power within
distinct boundaries. But she gave little sign that she saw this
case as in any way different from the other federalism cases,
including the age discrimination case in which she announced the
court's majority opinion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act case is an appeal by a former
Virginia college student, and by the Clinton administration on her
behalf, from a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in
Richmond that barred her from using the law to sue two fellow
students, football players who she contended had raped her in her
dormitory room. The woman, Christy Brzonkala, sued after Virginia
Polytechnic Institute took no action against one of the men and
gave the other a deferred suspension that permitted him to keep
playing varsity football.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law has several other provisions, including a criminal
section that provides for federal prosecution of interstate crimes
of gender-motivated violence. The court last year refused to hear a
constitutional challenge to the criminal provision.
</P>
<P>
   The section at issue on Tuesday in U.S. vs. Morrison, No. 99-5,
providing for private civil suits for damages, does not depend on
whether a defendant has crossed state lines, because Congress
wanted to provide a remedy for violence in or near homes. The
absence of an interstate ``hook,'' as O'Connor described it, is a
decided liability before a court that has taken a limited view of
Congress' power to act under its authority to regulate interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Both Waxman and Julie Goldscheid, representing Ms. Brzonkala on
behalf of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, told the
justices that violence against women has a substantial impact on
interstate commerce by deterring women from taking certain jobs or
continuing their education. ``Gender-based violence reduces
national productivity'' and remained ``one of the most persistent
barriers to women's full participation in the economy,'' Ms.
Goldscheid said.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the civil damages provision, the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said the law did not come within Congress'
power to regulate interstate commerce because it did not address
commercial activity. The court on Tuesday appeared wary of adopting
quite such a hard and fast rule, particularly after Michael E.
Rosman, representing the defendants in Ms. Brzonkala's lawsuit,
Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, said that in his view,
Congress lacked constitutional authority to prohibit possession of
narcotics for personal use because the activity was not commercial.
</P>
<P>
   However, even under a more elastic definition of activity that
affects the economy, the justices appeared dubious about accepting
the congressional findings on the economic impact of violence
against women. There was considerable sparring during the argument
over whether and to what extent courts should defer to Congress'
factual predicates for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices find the Violence Against Women Act provision to
be invalid under Congress' commerce authority, they could
nonetheless uphold it under Congress' authority to enforce the
equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, a basis that the
4th Circuit also rejected. Rosman, the defendants' lawyer, argued
on Tuesday that the 14th amendment, which governs only official
action, could not be a basis for a law that applies to private
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The law's defenders argue that the statute is aimed at the
failure of states to provide adequate remedies for violence against
women, an aspect of official action, or inaction, that is
appropriately the subject of legislation under the 14th Amendment.
However, Ms. Goldscheid's and Waxman's time at the podium ran out
before they could address this aspect of their argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rosman, general counsel of the Center for Individual Rights, a
conservative public interest law firm here, warned the justices
that if they upheld this law, ``Congress could pass virtually any
law'' and ``relegate the states to a trivial and unimportant role
in our federal structure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged that depiction. ``What is
the clash here?'' she asked. She said Congress' goal was not to
displace state authority but ``just to provide an alternate remedy,
an alternate forum.'' She continued: ``We are just complementing
what the states do. Why can't Congress do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The power to regulate is the power to pre-empt,'' Rosman
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg persisted, noting that ``we have so many parallels in
discrimination legislation,'' with both the states and the federal
government barring discrimination in employment and in public
accommodations. Why can't the Violence Against Women Act coexist
with parallel state laws, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is not commerce,'' Rosman replied. ``This is
violence, interpersonal violence, the kind of thing states have had
as their exclusive province ever since the start of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act has generally been welcomed on
the state level, with 36 states joining a brief in this case in
support of the law. Only one, Alabama, filed a brief asking the
court to declare the provision unconstitutional.

release former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet after medical
tests showed he was ``at present unfit to stand trial, and that no
change to that position can be expected.'' The Home Office said
Pinochet's release was subject to legal challenge by Spain, Chile
and other interested parties within the next seven days. (Summary

   AOL-TIME-MICROSOFT (Undated) _ To the company's adversaries, the
very name ``Microsoft'' suggests menacing power. It has been called
the Death Star, an 800-pound gorilla and worse. And in the
government's sweeping antitrust case, Microsoft was portrayed in
convincing detail as a monopolistic bully. America Online Inc., in
particular, was bent to Microsoft's will, according to court
testimony. But after America Online's move on Monday to buy Time
Warner Inc., the largest merger in history, Microsoft suddenly
seems less threatening. The deal, to be sure, changes none of the
facts in the antitrust case. But antitrust experts say it could
figure into the calculations the court makes on sanctions against
Microsoft, if it loses the case, or in settlement talks. By Steve

   SCOTUS-WOMEN (Washington) _ If the Supreme Court wanted to
underscore the constitutional vulnerability of the Violence Against
Women Act, it could hardly have done more than it did Tuesday. Not
only did the justices open their session by declaring, in a
separate case argued three months ago, that Congress lacked
authority to make the federal law against age discrimination
binding on the states. But then, during arguments on the
constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, members of the
same five-justice majority in the age discrimination case made
abundantly clear their deep skepticism about whether Congress had
an adequate basis for opening federal courts to suits by victims of
violence ``motivated by gender'' against their attackers. By Linda
Greenhouse.

A PRINCESS OF PULP RETURNS TO EVEN THE SCORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Karen Durbin is the film critic for Mirabella magazine.  
 By KAREN DURBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1969 Bantam released the paperback edition of Jacqueline
Susann's ``Love Machine,'' with an initial print order of 2.5
million. The novel promptly hit warp speed, selling 60,000 copies a
day in the weeks following its release. How could it not, with
lines like this from its snappy prologue?
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Robin Stone was a handsome man.
</P>
<P>
   He could smile with his lips.
</P>
<P>
   He could think without emotion.
</P>
<P>
   He could make love to her with his body.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Stone was The Love Machine.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   This isn't great literature. It's not even good writing. (``He
could smile with his lips''? Who can't?) But it's prime pulp
fiction. In 32 words, Susann tells her readers that they're about
to tangle with a man as cold as he is hot, and that there will be
lots of suffering and plenty of sex, much of it packaged in short,
punchy sentences.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1973, Jackie Susann made publishing history as the
first writer to hit No. 1 on the best-seller list three times in a
row, starting with ``Valley of the Dolls,'' followed by ``The Love
Machine'' and ``Once Is Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of World Records still lists ``Valley of the
Dolls'' as the top-selling American novel ((italics)its(end
italics) paperback edition sold at a rate of 100,000 copies a day).
There might well have been more such blockbusters, but a year
later, Susann, whose life was as colorful and afflicted as that of
any of her characters, died at the age of 56 from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Before she started writing fiction, Susann spent the better part
of three decades trying to be a star, so it would no doubt delight
her that she's the subject of ``Isn't She Great,'' a near-slapstick
comedy with a melancholy undertow written by Paul Rudnick and
directed by Andrew Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on ``Wasn't She Great?,'' a 1995 New Yorker
article by Michael Korda, who edited ``The Love Machine,'' the film
opens Jan. 28 and stars Bette Midler as Susann, Stockard Channing
as a flamboyant actress who's her best friend, David Hyde-Pierce as
her uptight editor and Nathan Lane as Irving Mansfield, her devoted
husband and indefatigable publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Susann's fiction is the very essence of that excellent bad
thing, the guilty pleasure. Her books read like gossip; they may
not be high-minded, although, like most gossip, they proceed from
an implicitly moral point of view. But who needs high-minded when
you're getting the lowdown? Reading her books, you feel that you're
watching how people behave _ badly, as often as not, but
believably. If this isn't literature, it's pretty good sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her limitations as a writer _ and according to her
editors, they were severe _ Susann was an avid, unshockable
observer of her own and everyone else's life, and she put it all in
her novels. She also had a fine talent for free-floating malice _
my favorite instance being the two-fisted Maileresque novelist in
``Once Is Not Enough'' whom she endowed with a small penis. Setting
her stories in the show business world that she loved, she served
up a canny combination of glamour, mischief and dirty realism.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of Susann's novels is that, despite their lastingly
lurid reputation, they contain very little in the way of
bodice-ripping sex scenes. When the emotionally fragile fashion
model Amanda first goes to bed with Robin Stone (now, there's a
match made in potboiler hell), the most vivid details aren't about
pleasure, but anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   She worries that her androgynous body will repel him as it had a
previous lover. Not, as it turns out, a problem. Suave tosses her
padded bra across the room and exclaims, ``Only cows need boobs!''
Eeeew, gross, I thought, and settled in to read the other 492
pages.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to guilty pleasures, my taste runs to murder
mysteries and apocalyptic science fiction. But, even today, Susann
can hook me with what surely lured the multitudes 30 years ago.
Instead of steamy fantasy, she offered her mainly female readers
something most of them probably couldn't get anywhere else: the
kind of blunt talk about the realities of sex that barely existed
outside the precincts of the newborn women's liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
   Like that movement, her novels talk back to the sexual
revolution that helped make them possible. They're full of restless
women who want a lot more from life than sexual satisfaction,
although they want that, too, and they walk away from difficult men
at least as often as they swoon _ or, in one cautionary instance,
die _ for them. Appropriately for someone as ambitious as Susann,
some of the most vibrant passages in her fiction are about work.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia in August 1918, just as World War I was
drawing to a close and two years before women got the vote, Susann
was a woman almost unimaginably ahead of her time. It took another
half-century for the culture to begin to catch up with her; at her
death, it still hadn't quite.
</P>
<P>
   What she knew about art pretty much began and ended with her
artist father's glibly flattering society portraits. Nevertheless,
she was what would come to be called in 1980s cutting-edge
performance circles a transgressive woman. As boldly as Lydia Lunch
or Karen Finley, Susann threw off the restraints of conventional
femininity, and she started young. She was a daredevil child who
informed her best friend that she would be famous some day.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years before there were consciousness-raising groups,
Susann had her Hockey Club, a half-dozen female friends in show
business who got together to trade professional scuttlebutt and
sexual confidences, covered for each other's affairs and spied on
each other's husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their loyalty to each other was almost frightening,'' Barbara
Seaman wrote in ``Lovely Me,'' her excellent 1987 biography of
Susann.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Seaman, the group was the object of much
paranoid speculation, and Jules Feiffer scolded its thinly
disguised members in ``Harry, the Rat With Women,'' his 1963 novel.
``Their single interest lay in the area they liked to describe as
`The Battle of the Sexes,''' he wrote. ``Men were a social
convenience: Things to date when they went out with the girls at
night. Marriage was condoned as either an early mistake, a career
necessity or a financial arrangement. As a group, they lived for
themselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like her life, Susann's books were fueled by a kind of gutbucket
feminism, and they offered a subversive answer to the question,
``What do women want?''
</P>
<P>
   Early in her acting career, Susann was told to forget about
movies because her hands were too large for close-ups. Her greatest
television success was a long-running gig selling Schiffli lace and
embroidery products, and these commercials, featuring Susann
surrounded by, and in some cases wearing, yards of the ruffly,
semisheer needlework, made for eccentric viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and big-boned, with strong facial features and a bold
stare, Loretta Young she wasn't. Try as she might, and for the
camera she tried desperately hard, Jackie Susann couldn't possibly
fulfill anyone's image of '50s femininity.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of sexual role reversal in Susann's life is truly
striking. Even her marriage was gender-bending, with Mansfield the
ever-supportive spouse dedicated to furthering his beloved's
career. She cheated on him, just as her father had cheated on his
proper, schoolteacher wife, and her tastes were not delicate. Ethel
Merman (the model for Helen Lawson, the ruthless show business
harridan in ``Valley of the Dolls'') and George Jessel were two of
her passions.
</P>
<P>
   Susann's man-sized ambition was matched by an equally man-sized
confidence; she's the only woman I've ever come across who believed
herself to be prettier than she actually was. At 15, watching a
wrestler she had a crush on going down to defeat, she cursed his
opponent, threw a chair at him and jumped into the ring and did her
best to beat him up before the police carted her off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later as a would-be actress in New York, she slugged
an agent who tried to get her on his casting couch; she would
eventually belt a newspaper critic who panned a play she wrote and
throw a drink on Johnny Carson after they exchanged insults in a
bar. Throughout her life, for good and ill, she availed herself of
masculine prerogatives and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Capote picked up on this in a famous 1969 attack on the
``Tonight Show,'' calling Susann a transvestite and ``a truck
driver in drag.'' She got her own back when Carson gave her the
chance for an on-air retort. ``What do you think of Truman?'' he
asked. She paused for effect and said, ``Truman? I think history
will prove he's one of the best presidents we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda wrote that ``Jackie was in many ways a much livelier
creation than her novels.'' This is true as far as it goes,
although I suspect my regard for Susann's pulp fiction goes further
than Korda's. The books have a rough vitality that is rare in this
kind of market-minded novel. Unlike Judith Krantz, say, or Jackie
Collins, Susann never used brand names as shorthand for character,
and she didn't write with a cookie cutter. Her novels are lively
creations, in other words, much livelier than the tepidly trashy
films that have been made of them.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Andrew Sarris put his finger on the problem when he
called the 1975 movie of ``Once Is Not Enough'' ``inexplicably
timorous.'' Susann never met a sexual taboo she didn't like to
break, but even in the wild and woolly 1960s and '70s, when the
sound of taboos breaking grew loud enough to wake the dead,
Hollywood was shocked, shocked. Any film with Alexis Smith and
Melina Mercouri as lesbian lovers has its charms, but this ``Once''
really isn't enough, since the incestuous father-daughter
attachment that drives the plot has been neutered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valley of the Dolls,'' about a trio of glamorous, pill-popping
career girls, has the advantage of being awesomely bad, with Patty
Duke's scenery-gnawing impression of Judy Garland and Sharon Tate's
eerie impersonation of the world's most beautiful zombie. But even
this cult favorite chickens out in the end, replacing Susann's
sophisticated conclusion _ a once passionate wife's chilling,
drugged-out acceptance of a marriage going rotten _ with some inane
studio pap about a sadder but wiser ex-virgin fleeing the city for
the purity of her New England home.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bergman's ``Isn't She Great'' (the phrase is Mansfield's
constant paean to his wife, frequently uttered under grotesque
circumstances) has a chance to make up for the bad Susann movies
that have come before it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lot to ask of a comedy, even one written by Paul
Rudnick, but the raw material is more than promising. The movie's
funniest and most memorable sequence is lifted straight from life:
the Mansfields' brash _ and brilliant _ barnstorming campaign
through bookstores around the country to promote ``Valley of the
Dolls.'' They are widely credited with transforming the way books
were marketed, propelling a stuffy gentlemen's business into the
modern era of hard-sell razzle-dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Like most larger-than-life people, Jacqueline Susann wasn't a
particularly lovable human being. She had a brutal streak, which
included episodes of vindictive rage against her perceived enemies
so ugly that recalling them gave some of Barbara Seaman's interview
subjects the shakes 10 years after Susann's death.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, she could be seriously ungreat, but Ms. Seaman, who
maintains a judicious tone in her biography, records frequent acts
of generosity, both thoughtful and time-consuming, and all the more
unexpected in someone so self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' passes lightly over Susann's more egregious
habits. We don't, I'm sorry to say, get to see her deck anybody.
There's not even a scene where she dumps ice on her husband when he
fails to pay sufficiently close attention. Bergman is at pains to
point out that ``Isn't She Great'' is not a true biopic.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie does not skimp on Susann's abrasiveness or her
galloping case of garbage mouth. Ms. Midler is a master at making
both raunch and overweening narcissism hilarious, and many of
Rudnick's best lines cannot be repeated in a daily newspaper. It's
worth a ticket just to hear Ms. Midler's and Ms. Channing's
scabrous exchange about ``Ozzie and Harriet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman counts himself among Susann's defenders, saying, ``You
try to keep her as lovable as possible while still being true to
who she was.'' She may have been an ego monster, but, he points
out, she was a gallant ego monster. There is an approximately
factual scene from 1962 in ``Isn't She Great'' in which Susann
marches over to what she called her ``wishing hill'' in Central
Park and, glaring up through the branches of a tall tree, rails at
God.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She had reason to. For more than a decade she and Mansfield had
been living with the anguish of their only child's severe autism;
her show business career was at a dismal end; her first book, a
tribute to her pet poodle called ``Every Night, Josephine!,'' was
still unpublished and her breast cancer had just been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had this one-on-one relationship with God,'' Bergman says,
sounding amused. ``So she says, `You owe me.' And then, `I can't do
everything myself,' which is one of my favorite lines in the
script. `You've got to help.' And after that the book gets
bought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' may not strictly follow the facts, but it
captures the pathos of what Bergman calls Susann's Job-like
circumstances (she concealed both her son's condition and her own
because she did not want to seem like a loser).
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of her life is that she was desperate to be famous,''
he says. ``So whether or not she's admirable depends on how you see
that ambition. I admire the bravery of it. People have children,
among other reasons, to live forever. But a child who is affectless
and doesn't know who you are _ it's like she couldn't even get that
right. And she just had this incredible desire to be immortal,
knowing that she was on a very short string in terms of her life
span.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well that Jackie Susann could take a punch as well
as land one, because once she reached the best-seller list, the
blows rained down. Capote had a lot of company _ harsh reviews,
nasty articles and gratuitous potshots from established writers
like Gore Vidal, who is credited with saying, ``She doesn't write,
she types.''
</P>
<P>
   Even her editors could be stunningly mean. Don Preston, who
edited ``Valley of the Dolls,'' sent a report to his boss on how
much work the manuscript required that reads less like an editor's
memo than a Puritan's denunciation of the village witch. Michael
Korda is friendlier, but the impression you get from both men is
that Susann was a hard-working no-talent whose success was the
product of tough editing and the Mansfields' relentless promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the writing that got her many critics riled up. It
was the writer, and the fact that millions of people were listening
to what she had to say. Astonished by the intensity of the attacks
on his friend, Rex Reed told Ms. Seaman, ``People were driven mad
by her success.''
</P>
<P>
   Such transgressive women have the power to disturb and disrupt,
and there was nothing subtle about Susann's transgressions. She was
shameless, as few women are able to be, even today. At a time when
the social order was trembling on its foundations, and with no more
noble intention than to see her name in lights, she gave it an
extra shake. Her vulgarity was a strength as well as a flaw; it
took her places she couldn't have got to any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Korda's humorous, occasionally condescending New Yorker article
ends on a note of somber finality. ``She once predicted that the
'60s would be remembered for Andy Warhol, the Beatles, and Jackie
Susann, but, alas, she was wrong,'' he wrote. ``It's nearly
impossible to find a copy of any of her books in New York _ a fate
that would have been sadder for Jackie than anything else. She had
always counted on her books for immortality, and, in the end, they
failed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Today _ five years after that article appeared _ one can all but
hear the raucous laughter wafting from the book-shaped urn that
contains Susann's ashes. Her best sellers are once more available
and selling well in a wittily designed edition of trade paperbacks
from Grove/Atlantic, and Crown Books has commissioned a sequel to
``Valley of the Dolls'' from the writer Rae Lawrence, to be called
``Shadow of the Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   A remake of the 1969 movie is in the works. Ms. Seaman's
biography is back in print, and _ for all the world as if Irving
Mansfield, who died in 1988, were still on the job _ the January
issue of Vanity Fair devoted 17{ lavishly illustrated pages to
recapping the life and career of the woman its cover line called a
``pulp goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   Raucous laughter? That urn just put on a Pucci shift and started
doing the frug.

SALES STRONG AT BIOGEN, GENZYME IN 4TH QUARTER

<P>
   Biogen Inc. shares fell 7.2 percent Tuesday to 74 15/16,
although the company reported strong sales of its leading drug,
Avonex, during last year's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Genzyme Corp. said its 1999 revenues rose 11.6
percent to $635 million. Genzyme's stock was little changed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambridge, Mass. biotechnology companies made their
disclosures _ which foreshadowed formal earnings announcements _ at
the Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
Biogen plans to officially report its year-end results Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For Biogen, whose shares have doubled over the past year,
Tuesday's sharp drop came a day after the company's stock rose more
than four points Monday to 80 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts said the drop was due to profit taking
by investors after Monday's run-up.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen president James C. Mullen told analysts that sales of
Avonex, the top-selling injectable drug to treat multiple
sclerosis, were $180 million worldwide in the final quarter of last
year. Most of those sales _ $128 million _ were in the United
States. For all of 1998, Avonex sales in the United States were $85
million. Mullen said 83,000 multiple sclerosis patients worldwide
are taking Avonex, compared to 57,000 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said earnings for the fourth quarter rose to
about 44 cents a share, beating the 42-cent average forecast of
analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. In the fourth
quarter of 1998, profit was 39 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme also reported financial results but noted that an
audited financial statement won't be available until March 9.
Fourth-quarter revenues grew to $173 million from $155 million for
the same period the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genzyme General, the biggest unit of Genzyme, closed
at 48 3/4, down 1/8. Genzyme shares fell eight percent in 1999,
making it the worst performer among large biotechnology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme president Henri Termeer said 1999 was a banner year for
the company's leading drug, Cerezyme, used to treat Gaucher
disease, a rare genetic disorder. Last year, Cerezyme sales grew 16
percent to $479 million. In the fourth quarter, Cerezyme sales were
up 12 percent to $127 million.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer forecasted that Cerezyme revenues will grow by up to $65
million this year. He added that the company should earn $2.20 per
share in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company expects to file for US Food and Drug
Administration approval for three new products, including Fabrase,
an enzyme replacement drug to treat Fabry disease, a rare disorder.

BUSH PUSHES TAX PLAN IN DEEP SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CQ's ungrammatical quote in 8th graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ First he went from a navy-blue business suit
to a casual windbreaker. Then Texas Governor George W. Bush, flying
by private plane from Michigan to South Carolina, shifted into a
deep Southern drawl during campaign stops with hundreds of seniors
and loyal Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, however, Bush hammered away at a single message:
That his tax plan was superior to the one released Tuesday by
Senator John McCain. Basking in the warm reception of a group of
barbecue-fed elderly supporters at the Florence Civic Center, he
also declared himself the candidate more devoted to saving the
Social Security program. Earlier in the day, he released a campaign
ad to the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my cats and my dog. I love my home. But I love my
country more,'' Bush said to the crowd, explaining his decision to
run for president. ``I believe it's important for us to make sure
the Social Security system is safe and secure today, and safe and
secure tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain in recent days has focused his criticism of Bush's tax
plan on how it would use the federal budget surplus. Under the Bush
plan, the surplus would translate into a five-year, $483 billion
tax cut for earners in all tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan, however, would use the budget surplus to
earmark $700 billion to shore up Social Security. His five-year,
$237 billion tax-cut plan would also encourage savings among
members of the middle class, work to protect Medicare and aim to
reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush took aim at McCain, ridiculing him for changing
his tax plan to appear more like the one the Texas governor
released months ago. But the thrust of his argument was that the
budget surplus belonged to taxpayers. Under his own plan, Bush
said, excess funds ``would be passed back to hard-working
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain's plan would leave more money in Washington to
be spent on more government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also repeated his familiar aims of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' closing the ``gap of hope,'' and bolstering the
nation's armed forces, all of which drew applause. He pledged to
return education funds to states, telling supporters: ``Rarely is
the question asked: Is (sic) our children learning?''
</P>
<P>
   Taxes ruled the day, however, and Bush swiftly dismissed
McCain's expansion of the 15 percent tax bracket as a trick of the
eye. ``If you simply expand the 15 percent tax bracket, there are a
lot of people who are not going to get tax relief ,'' Bush said.
According to a statement released by the Bush campaign just hours
after McCain announced his proposal, 70 million taxpayers are
already in the 15 percent tax bracket. Therefore, expanding that
bracket to other taxpayers would deny a huge swath of the country
the benefits of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan is nearly double in size and is far more sweeping,
with proposals to double the $500 per child tax credit and cut all
income taxes throughout the country. He has not designated any of
his tax plan for Medicare. A campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer,
said to do so would be premature until all Medicare fraud has been
eradicated. As for Social Security, Bush has devised a separate $2
trillion Social Security ``lock box.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the differences between the two, both candidates kept
their promise, made during a debate Monday night, to refrain from
negative remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, relaxed and confident after arriving in a state where he
is well ahead of McCain in the polls, told reporters: ``We've had a
difference and now he's revising his tax plan and I've always felt
it was important to lay out a plan that I could defend from
beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   He began the day in Grand Rapids, Mich., with Republican
Governor John Engler, one of Bush's most successful campaign
fund-raisers and a potential candidate for a Bush administration.
After flying to a barbecue in Florence, S.C., he flew to an oyster
roast in Charleston before returning to Columbia, the state
capital, for the night. Later this week he will travel to Delaware,
New Hampshire and Iowa _ his longest campaign swing to date.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will not, however, participate in a series of one-on-one
debates with McCain before the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1,
although McCain on Monday had accepted the invitation from a Boston
television station. To do so, Bush said, would ``let a TV station
winnow down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's fair,'' he said.

JUSTICES DEFEND STATES' RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN. : Ala ., Fla . , Ga.)  (With SCOTUS-WOMEN) 
(mg) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing its march in the direction of states'
rights, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Congress did not
have the authority to bind state governments to the federal law
that bars discrimination against older workers.
</P>
<P>
   The national policy against age discrimination in employment
could not overcome the states' sovereign immunity from being sued
in federal court, the justices, in a 5-4 majority, said in the
first of five federalism rulings that the court is expected to hand
down in this term.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the same as in other rebuffs that justices have
dealt Congress in the last five years on issues ranging from the
regulation of gun possession near schools to the right of state
employees to sue for overtime and of patent holders to sue states
for patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time was a notable hardening of tone, with
both the majority and dissenting opinions conveying the impression
that the two sides, wedded to dramatically opposing views of the
authentic nature of the federal system, had little left to say to
one another across one of the great divides in the court's recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters, led by Justice John Paul Stevens, accused the
majority of substituting its will for that of Congress and of
displaying ``the kind of judicial activism'' that ``represents such
a radical departure from the proper role of this court that it
should be opposed whenever the opportunity arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor responded for the majority, writing
that the dissenters' refusal to accept the court's recent rulings
``makes it difficult to engage in additional meaningful debate on
the place of state sovereign immunity in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The others in the majority were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas. Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor announced the decision just before the court began to
hear arguments in another of the term's federalism cases, the
government's effort to defend a provision of the Violence Against
Women Act as a proper exercise of congressional authority. The
provision, authorizing victims of rape to sue their attackers for
damages in federal court, met with considerable skepticism from the
justices who formed the majority in the latest ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967
and extended it to state governments in 1974. The law protects
employees against discrimination on the basis of age beginning at
age 40 and authorizes suits for damages in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   While all states offer their employees some form of state-court
redress for age discrimination, the remedies vary and in many cases
are not as useful as the federal law, which provides for
reimbursement of attorneys' fees and for double damages in cases of
willful violations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, state employees may sue, but only in the Court of
Claims, which does not have jury trials; attorneys' fees are not
reimbursed and there are no double damages. New Jersey state
employees can take their complaints to the state Department of
Labor, which may order reimbursement for lost pay. Connecticut
employees have redress in the state's Commission on Human Rights
and Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision, affirming a 1998 ruling by the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, came in a consolidated appeal on behalf
of a group of faculty members and librarians employed by state
universities in Alabama and Florida. The plaintiffs had argued that
younger faculty members had been treated more favorably when it
came to salaries and promotions. The Clinton administration joined
the appeal to defend the constitutionality of the law as applied to
the state employers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Kimel vs. Florida Board of Regents, No. 98-791,
came against a background of several recent rulings interpreting
the 11th Amendment, which gave states immunity from suit in federal
court and circumscribed the ability of Congress to overcome that
immunity. In a 1996 ruling, Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, the court
ruled that Congress could not breach state immunity while trying to
regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That left only one route for Congress: Section 5 of the 14th
Amendment, under which Congress may act through ``appropriate
legislation'' to carry out the amendment's guarantees of due
process and equal protection. On this basis, the administration
defended the application of the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act to the states, and on this basis the court's majority rejected
it.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``is not `appropriate legislation' under Section 5 of
the 14th Amendment,'' O'Connor said, because age discrimination was
not inherently unconstitutional and because the law imposed
requirements that ``are disproportional to any unconstitutional
conduct that conceivably could be targeted by the act.'' The
extension of the law to the states ``was an unwarranted response to
a perhaps inconsequential problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor noted that the court over the last 25 years has
rejected constitutional challenges to mandatory retirement ages for
various groups of public employees, including state judges, Foreign
Service officers and state police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of these cases was that states were free to make
distinctions on the basis of age as long as the policy was
rational, she said, adding that there was no constitutional
requirement that states ``match age distinctions and the legitimate
interests they serve with razor-like precision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the 14th Amendment, a state may rely on age as a proxy
for other qualities, abilities or characteristics that are relevant
to the state's legitimate interests,'' O'Connor continued. Drawing
a distinction between age discrimination and discrimination on the
basis of race or sex, she said that old age ``does not define a
discrete and insular minority because all persons, if they live out
their normal life spans, will experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   This distinction raised the question of the fate of provisions
in other federal laws that bar states from other forms of
discrimination, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act or the
prohibition in the Equal Pay Act against sex discrimination in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Cases questioning whether these laws can be applied to the
states as employers have been appealed to the Supreme Court, and
the justices may announce within a week whether they will hear any
of them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion left open the possibility that other federal
anti-discrimination laws might still apply to the states as
employers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the majority opinion also made clear that to sustain
such an application, the court would have to be persuaded that
Congress had acted not only in response to discrimination in
general, but to proof of a pattern of discrimination by the states.
There was no such evidence of age discrimination by the states,
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   It was this part of the opinion, as much as anything else, that
appeared to provoke the anger of dissenters. Stevens accused the
majority of relying on its own legislative judgments and of
ignoring ``the importance of respecting the framers' decision to
assign the business of lawmaking to the Congress.'' Stevens said
the court should recognize that the Constitution adequately
protects state interests against federal intrusion by giving each
state equal representation in the Senate and by apportioning the
House of Representatives along state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
issued a statement denouncing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphatically disagree that Congress has overstepped its
powers in extending to public employees the same legal protections
as private employees,'' said Gerald W. McEntee, the federation's
president. ``Public employees are not second-class citizens.''

CARGO CONTAINERS UNLOADED ON WEST COAST HELD HUMAN CARGO _ CHINESE
STOWAWAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Accommodations for the 15-day trip from Hong Kong were
a metal cargo container, covered by canvas and stacked atop several
other such tractor-trailer-size boxes in the hold of a giant
freighter called the Cape May. The only light was from flashlights.
Human waste was deposited in buckets. Food, primarily boxes of
vegetables, ran out at some point. The seas were particularly
rough.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cape May pulled into Seattle and the containers were
taken off late Monday afternoon, 15 men from China stumbled out of
the metal box, dazed, dehydrated and gravely hungry. The stowaways,
illegal immigrants who had agreed to pay tens of thousands of
dollars in future wages to smugglers, pointed to the garbage-strewn
container, indicating even grimmer news. Inside were the bodies of
three men who had died during the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These containers were designed to carry machinery and cargo _
not people,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. ``The people aboard the Cape May were
effectively entombed.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 times in recent weeks, officials at ports on the
west coast of the United States and Canada have found human beings
in cargo containers, a reflection of an alarming new trend in
smuggling that has now turned deadly and of the extraordinary steps
that Chinese laborers are willing to take to reach North America
and the jobs they are promised here.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost certainly more instances in which such
travelers have managed to make it across without detection, as some
freighters carry 1,000 containers or more. There is no question
that more such human-laden boxes are on the way, officials say. At
5 a.m. Tuesday, another 19 Chinese men, all relatively young and in
apparent good health, were discovered in a cargo container aboard
the Hanjin Yokohma, which had also sailed from Hong Kong. With
American and Canadian officials expressing shock at the recent
discoveries, Hong Kong authorities pledged a crackdown Tuesday on
the illegal trafficking, which has been detected so far in
freighters arriving here and in Long Beach, Calif., and Vancouver,
B.C. Conditions in the containers vary widely: some, with
ventilation punched through the canvas tops and with furniture and
electric heaters and lights, seem to be somewhat endurable. But in
other cases, particularly aboard the Cape May, they are
nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Coleman, the acting director of the immigration service
in Seattle, of the Cape May stowaways: ``I've simply never seen
people so disoriented, so distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet whether the three dead people aboard the
freighter perished from exposure to the cold in their unheated
containers, lack of water, or perhaps a combination of the two,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 who survived the journey in the 40-foot-long, 8-foot
wide metal box, seven remain in Harborview Medical Center in
satisfactory condition, all being treated for dehydration or
malnutrition, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for the hospital. Eight
others, able to eat solid food, were released Tuesday into the
custody of the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   Under American immigration laws, unless they can establish a
well-grounded fear of persecution in their native country, the
stowaways will likely be deported to China in weeks. In recent
days, U. S. authorities have repatriated at least 246 recent
stowaways to China, some who arrived in containers and others
elsewhere on ships.
</P>
<P>
   American officials hope that word of the repatriations may deter
others from making the hazardous journeys, but such actions have
hardly stemmed the tide in the past. As unemployment increases in
China and the demand for cheap labor continues in this country,
some experts think it will only increase.

RETAILER SUES ON-LINE MERCHANT WITH SIMILAR NAME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a legal challenge that may help define how traditional
trademark rules will apply to the Internet, a New England sporting
goods retailer has sued a high-profile on-line merchant with a
similar name and business.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports Stores Inc., a Wilmington, Mass. athletic equipment
and clothing seller, sued MVP.com Inc., a Web-based sporting goods
company launched last month by athletic icons John Elway, Michael
Jordan, and Wayne Gretzky in conjunction with CBS Corp. and a
Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports, a bricks-and-mortar retailer with 19 outlets in four
New England states, charged MVP.com with unfair competition,
trademark dilution, and ``cyberpiracy,'' or poaching of its
Internet identity, among other violations.
</P>
<P>
   The action, filed in US District Court in Boston, is the latest
in a raft of lawsuits that are raising big questions over how
companies should conduct business in the Internet age. It comes
several days after the body overseeing the Internet's address
system revoked scores of new domain names after a computer glitch
allowed people to register addresses similar to established Web
sites. President Clinton signed a law banning ``cybersquatting'' _
the practice of registering trademark names as domain addresses
with an ill-intentioned view to selling them later at a big profit
_ in November.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports, in operation since 1984, registered the domain name
mvp-sports.com in May 1997. The company eventually plans to use its
Web site, which now provides only information, to sell goods on
line.
</P>
<P>
   MVP.com bought the registration for its domain name last
December and plans to begin direct sales this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If allowed to begin selling sporting goods on the Internet,
MVP.com will be competing directly with MVP Sports using (trade)
marks which are identical, nearly identical, and/or confusingly
similar to the MVP (trade) marks,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   A Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar lawyer representing MVP Sports did not
return calls for comment. Eric Rannala, a spokesman for MVP.com,
said that ``we thoroughly analyzed all the trademark issues and are
confident that our right to the name and the domain is free and
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Three independent attorneys specializing in Internet law said
Tuesday that it was unclear whether MVP Sports had legitimate
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes that we can simply take all the old trademark
rules and apply them to domain names,'' said Evan Slavitt of Gadsby
&AMP; Hannah of Boston. ``And one question is whether MVP Sports owns
every variation of its name.'' Slavitt also questioned why MVP
Sports had not originally moved to register the mvp.com name.
</P>
<P>
   ``MVP'' is an acronym for Most Valuable Player, a common sports
term.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Ellerbach, a Palo Alto, Calif. lawyer, said MVP.com's
activities did not appear to be those of a cybersquatter, since the
on-line merchant had a legitimate business and was not looking to
sell its domain name to MVP Sports. She added that the Wilmington
retailer would have to prove that its customers were confused by
the MVP.com Web site and name. Ellerbach also said that since MVP
Sports had registered two of its trademarks _ ``MVP'' and ``MVP
Sporting Goods'' _ in Massachusetts, and not, apparently, under
federal laws, the company might not have control over their use in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Sharie Steele, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
said that MVP.com's activities would not be legitimate if targeted
directly at MVP Sports customers. But she said that ``for MVP
Sports to think that it has the only right to the name `MVP' is
absurd.'' Unlike some other industry participants, the foundation
has opposed cybersquatting laws, saying that they unfairly
privilege trademark holders over domain holders and stifle
competition.

CLINTON SIGNS PROCLAMATION PROTECTING MORE LAND NEAR GRAND CANYON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. _ With the Grand Canyon behind
him and Arizona officials and congressional Republicans against
him, President Clinton signed a proclamation Tuesday that almost
doubles the amount of federally protected land around the Grand
Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   At a wooden desk set amid sagebrush and scattered splotches of
snow near the canyon's otherwise desolate north rim, Clinton signed
four proclamations designating two national monuments in Arizona,
another along the California coast and expanding an existing
monument south of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The signing _ followed by a ceremony on the canyon's heavily
visited south rim _ came 92 years to the day after President
Theodore Roosevelt gave national monument status to the acreage
that eventually became the Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of you who can see what's behind me can doubt the wisdom
of that decision,'' Clinton said later in a ceremony announcing the
new national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded his audience that Roosevelt had said ``we
cannot improve upon this landscape, so the only thing we can add to
it is our protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the areas already are owned by the federal government,
Clinton's assigning them national monument status puts them
off-limits to mining, commercial development and off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about locking lands up,'' Clinton said. ``It's
about freeing them up from the pressures of development and the
threat of sprawl for all Americans for all times.''
</P>
<P>
   The president rebuffed assertions that he was trying to burnish
his legacy with Tuesday's proclamations. ``Everything you do in
your last year looks like a legacy thing,'' Clinton told reporters.
``But we've been at this a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The national monuments were designated under authority granted
by Congress in the Antiquities Act of 1906. With the four
proclamations, Clinton joined President Carter as having set aside
more acreage than any president since the act was passed. The only
20th-century presidents not creating national monuments under the
act were Nixon, Reagan and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The monument designations Tuesday grew out of recommendations by
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former Democratic governor of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fabulous moment in the history of this country,''
Babbitt said during a dedication ceremony at Hopi Point on the
Grand Canyon's south rim.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, a native of nearby Flagstaff, Ariz., called creation of
the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument ``the full, final
chapter in the protection of this canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   When notified last month of the impending designations, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican running for president, said
Clinton has no right to make such a move ``unilaterally'' and urged
a delay to allow for public input.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona officials _ led by Republican Gov. Jane Hull _ have
criticized Clinton and Babbitt for not including state residents in
discussions of additional protections for federal lands in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of our state have a long and distinguished record
of working to preserve and protect some of the most beautiful
natural wonders in the United States,'' Hull wrote last week in a
letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by members of the Arizona congressional
delegation, urged Clinton ``to refrain from this unilateral action
and instead work with us to develop a solution reflecting the
wishes of the people of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who chairs
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Clinton has
misused the Antiquities Act, and Congress should consider whether
to curb the president's authority except in cases of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists who applauded Clinton's action accused the
Republicans of engaging in partisanship. ``They don't want this
president to get credit for a popular decision,'' said Rob Smith,
southwestern regional director for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Robinson, governmental affairs director for the Grand Canyon
Trust, dismissed assertions that the public had no input in the
national monument designations in Arizona. ``There were two
hearings in the state, one in Washington,'' Robinson said. ``No
monuments have ever had more public hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a recent survey that found almost 80 percent of
Arizona residents favored federal protections for the two areas
designated Tuesday, Robinson said state officials and congressional
Republicans ``just don't like the results'' of having public input.
</P>
<P>
   In the proclamations signed Tuesday, Clinton designated almost 1
million acres north of the canyon as the Grand Canyon-Parashant
National Monument. The new monument is slightly smaller than the
1.1 million acres currently included in the Grand Canyon National
Park, which stretches for 277 miles along the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Also designated as a national monument was a 71,000-acre area in
the patch of the northward development of Phoenix. The publicly
owned region about 40 miles from the city's center includes two
mesas and the canyon of the Agua Fria River. More than 450
prehistoric sites have been found in the area, which includes a
cliff-dwelling of more than 100 rooms and dozens of intact
petroglyphs.
</P>
<P>
   The third national monument includes thousands of small islands,
rocks and reefs along the California coast that are inhabited by
birds and sea otters. Clinton also expanded the Pinnacles National
Monument near San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's visit to the canyon was not Clinton's first. Shortly
before the 1996 presidential election, Clinton signed a similar
proclamation on the canyon rim creating the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. The move angered
Utah lawmakers who said it would hurt the economy and block
development of a key coal mine.

   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the professional football teams in Florida finally
have caught up with the college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, Florida State, Florida and Miami ranked
among the dominant teams in college football. Several times in the
'90s, at least two of those schools _ and sometimes all three _ had
a chance to win the national championship as the season was
building to its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the three NFL teams in the Sunshine State are showing they
also can hang in there with the best and compete for a championship
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, Tampa Bay and Miami are three of the eight teams
that still have a chance to reach the Super Bowl. It's the first
time all three NFL franchises in Florida have made it to the
divisional round of the NFL playoffs in the same season, and it's
the first time an all-Florida Super Bowl is a realistic
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And it couldn't be more convenient. Florida State made the short
trip from Tallahassee to New Orleans to win the national
championship game last week against Virginia Tech in the Sugar
Bowl. The NFL teams in Florida would only have to travel one state
north for Super Bowl XXXIV, which will be played at the Georgia
Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Florida teams will be eliminated Saturday when Miami
travels to Jacksonville to play the Jaguars, who finished the
regular season with an NFL-best 14-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Just 200 miles south that day, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will
host the Washington Redskins. A victory by the Bucs would put them
in the NFC Championship Game for only the second time in franchise
history and the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has the best defense in the NFC, allowing 267.5 yards
per game. Cornerback Donnie Abraham tied four other players for the
most interceptions in the league with seven.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bucs will face a Washington team that had the
second-best offense in the NFL this season, averaging 372.8 yards
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of success at home this season against
high-powered offenses, like Minnesota and Green Bay,'' said Tampa
Bay coach Tony Dungy. ``If we can hold the Redskins to 17 points or
less, I think it enhances our chances of advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars thought their chances of advancing were greatly
enhanced when Miami defeated Seattle and moved Tennessee out of
Jacksonville's playoff bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans gave the Jaguars both of their losses this season.
But Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin has warned his team to stay
focused. He reminded them how Jacksonville was a No. 5 seed _ like
Miami is this season _ in 1996, but the Jaguars went to Denv
upset the top-seeded Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any big deal who we play,'' said
Jacksonville receiver Keenan McCardell. ``This is single
elimination, so no matter who it was, we knew it was going to be a
tough challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars enter the game with the NFL's top receiver in Jimmy
Smith, who caught 116 passes this season. In his past seven games,
Smith has caught 60 passes for 934 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the real strength of Jacksonville's offense is a running
game that averaged a league-best 130.7 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars will go against a Miami defense that may have played
its best game of the season at Seattle last weekend in a 20-17
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins held Seattle to one offensive touchdown and 32
yards of offense in the second half. The Seahawks had 41 yards
rushing on 20 carries, including three yards rushing in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL player of the weekend had to be Miami quarterback
Dan Marino, who silenced his critics and guided the Dolphins on a
game-winning 85-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 37th time in his 17-year career that Marino had led
his team on a game-winning drive in the final quarter. It also
helped end the talk about whether the 38-year-old veteran still
could get the job done and helped heal the rift between Marino and
coach Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One win can do a lot of things,'' Johnson said, ``especially
when it comes in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino failed to throw a TD pass in five of his last 11 starts,
which caused friction with his coach. Miami also had 19 turnovers
in its last six regular-season games, when the team went 1-5.
Sunday was the first turnover-free game for the Dolphins since an
Oct. 31 victory at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Marino met with Johnson before the Seattle game and agreed the
team needed a more conservative approach to try to establish the
run. The Dolphins had 37 rushing plays at Seattle, the highest
total for Miami in the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked all week about running the ball, and we ran it a
lot,'' Marino said. ``We probably could have thrown the ball more
on first down, but we wanted to be patient and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's experience paid off in the end when he led the Dolphins
to their first road playoff win since 1972. Now they hope to make
it two in a row with their future Hall of Fame quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a man on this team more loved and respected than
Dan,'' said Miami defensive end Trace Armstrong. ``No one here lost
faith in him. We knew we just needed to support him. Any time
someone starts to doubt him, he always comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to the Super Bowl for Marino leads through Florida,
while Jacksonville and Tampa Bay are trying to reach the big game
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Football in Florida has never been better.

EARLY HARVARD PILGRIM FINANCIALS UNRELIABLE, STATE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Underscoring the confused state of Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care's tangled finances, regulators said their first
snapshot of the HMO's daily cash situation has turned out to be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   State officials trying to get a handle on Harvard Pilgrim's
ability to pay day-to-day bills had asked the health plan to
provide a detailed account of money collected and paid out by the
insurer on a given day.
</P>
<P>
   The report was considered a small but crucial first step in
getting the state's management of the $2.8 billion-a-year health
plan under &UR;  &LR; way. But after receiving it late Monday and having it
examined by accountants from KPMG Peat Marwick, ``we are not
satisfied that the information is complete or accurate,'' attorney
general Thomas Reilly said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get a clearer picture, Reilly said regulators are
subjecting the report to a ``higher level'' of examination. Among
other measures, he said regulators are asking hospitals and other
Harvard Pilgrim creditors to verify that the health plan's numbers
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing beginning to what is already proving to
be a complex task of unraveling Harvard Pilgrim's knotted
accounting. And the limited information the report provided didn't
offer much encouragement, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every bit as serious as we thought last week'' when
Harvard Pilgrim officials said they discovered some $58.5 million
in previously unknown 1999 losses, prompting a judge to order the
health plan into state receivership, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   With the newly discovered losses _ a result of software problems
in the health plan's computer accounting systems, according to
Harvard Pilgrim officials _ total losses for 1999 are expected to
be as much as $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reilly and other state officials working on a plan to get
Harvard Pilgrim back on its feet sought to put the situation in the
best light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has realized that Harvard Pilgrim is conducting
business as usual,'' Reilly said, adding that after fielding more
than 1,000 calls a day from nervous members last week, the number
of calls to the state insurance division and attorney general's
office dwindled to just 45 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great deal of angst, a great deal of concern,'' he
said. ``Now, there's a level of calm that didn't exist before.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the court order that placed Harvard Pilgrim in
receivership, the health plan is paying all current bills as they
come due, officials said. But whether Harvard Pilgrim can afford to
do that and dig out of its debts remains an open question.
Officials are still awaiting a report on how much Harvard Pilgrim
owes its 10 largest creditors and, ultimately, a more detailed
account of the health plan's overall financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Massachusetts officials Tuesday met with regulators
in Rhode Island, where Harvard Pilgrim went into receivership in
the fall, Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Harvard Pilgrim is in receivership (in
Massachusetts), they needed to make sure certain administrative
things will get done,'' she said. ``Those conversations were
productive and collegial.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond
announced a plan for physicians and small health clinics affected
by the collapse of Harvard Pilgrim in the Ocean State to receive
low-interest loans under a government-sponsored program.
</P>
<P>
   Some small providers have been contemplating closing for lack of
funds, Almond said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Ruthardt said she is allowing Harvard Pilgrim
to proceed with its long-planned move next month into a new $47
million headquarters building in Wellesley and, later on, into a
Quincy building now under construction, Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves into new, visible locations have drawn fire from
some consumers who criticized Harvard Pilgrim for spending money on
relocation while suffering large losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruthardt said money Harvard Pilgrim slotted for the moves is
not coming from funds they set aside to pay providers. She said she
reserved the right to halt the moves later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, that will continue,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, which negotiated leases on the new buildings
three years ago, will save $5 million a year by consolidating 2,870
administrative employees in two buildings rather than six
currently, health plan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Ruthardt said that as regulators delve deeper
into Harvard Pilgrim's difficulties and become more involved with
inevitable management decisions, the state may have to hire outside
experts to assist with decisions about possible layoffs and other
cost-cutting moves at Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have staff that are looking at those issues,'' she said.
``We're asking questions like, `Do we have sufficient staff for the
next step of this? Or do we need help.' ''

 &HT;    CNN, AOL to gain advantage sharing big, wide audience
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN, already a big online player, stands to gain an
even bigger presence with the merger of America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based cable news network could use AOL's vast
audience _ 20 million-plus subscribers worldwide _ to strengthen
and extend its reach online.
</P>
<P>
   And CNN could return the favor. AOL is pushing hard to establish
itself overseas, where CNN has a strong reputation. CNN has one of
the most widely recognized names outside the United States,
according to various marketing studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is not just a U.S. play,'' said Bruce Leichtman,
analyst with the Yankee Group, a media consultant in Boston. ``The
international play is perhaps even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, any talk of collaboration between CNN and AOL is just
that _ talk. CNN and AOL officials both declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for reticence is stunned exhaustion. Turner
Broadcasting executives are still digesting news of the merger,
which would create a company with an estimated worth of $350
billion.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has had time to sit down and work out a clear plan.
Nor could they put it into effect for at least 11 months, when the
deal is expected to close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL executives have hinted strongly they have big plans
for businesses such as CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accelerate the extension of Time Warner brands to the
digital world,'' declared Robert Pittman, AOL's chief operating
officer, when the deal was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The key to doing that, of course, is the Internet _ and AOL's
huge presence in the medium.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting executives
have said recently that they intend to greatly beef up their
Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be a huge _ and I mean huge _ Internet player,''
Turner Broadcasting Chairman Terence McGuirk said in a recent
interview. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but the winner in this
game will either have Time Warner as a partner or it will be Time
Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   As testimony to McGurik's statement, CNN Interactive recently
said it would add 150 positions  &Cx1f; _ a doubling of its staffing_ this
year.
</P>
<P>
   One option being speculated about: AOL might make CNN the anchor
of its news area. It would have the look and feel of the 24-hour
cable TV channel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a problem with that scenario: AOL already has an
agreement with CBS as its news anchor in the United States. The
agreement with CBS is finite, although no one would disclose when
it expires. AOL could, however, use CNN as an anchor for an
international service or a service for international news.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential area of cooperation is cross-promotion,
something CNN already does with many other partners. Those partners
include WebMD, a healthcare Web site, and IDG, which owns PC World.
</P>
<P>
   CNN tags certain news reports with the brand names of these
companies. It could now do the same with AOL. And it could promote
the online service on its various Web sites, which are among the
top ones for news.
</P>
<P>
   AOL could reciprocate, promoting CNN and its various Web sites
to its subscribers.

LIFE IN LONDON, AS VIEWED THROUGH BALKAN EYES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jasmin Dizdar was following his heart when he moved to
London in the summer of 1989. Two years earlier, the young Yugoslav
had met an English film student, Hilary Dunn, at the annual film
festival in the Czech spa of Karlovy Vary.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having graduated from Prague's prestigious film school,
Dizdar chose romance over reason and moved in with Ms. Dunn. She is
now his wife and the mother of their 2-year-old daughter. But
Britain was not the best place for an untested 28-year-old movie
director who spoke no English.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he stuck to his decision, even as he saw communism
collapse across Eastern Europe and his own nation disintegrate into
ethnic conflict. He learned English, worked on screenplays and, in
1993, became a British subject. Yet to his new identity was added
another: when he left his hometown, Zenica, 70 miles north of
Sarajevo, in 1984, he was a Yugoslav; now he was from Bosnia, a
country that was shown daily on British television being torn apart
by war. And it was with Bosnian eyes that he began to observe his
adopted land.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Beautiful People,'' Dizdar's first feature film,
which opens in New York on Feb. 18. A humorous, affectionate and
poignant portrayal of a cross section of Britons whose lives are
unexpectedly disrupted by the Bosnian nightmare in the fall of
1993, ``Beautiful People'' won the Certain Regard competition at
the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a film that goes straight to the heart so that people
would say it would be a shame if it was not made,'' the tall,
soft-spoken Dizdar said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious movie, with some 20 principal characters and six
story lines that overlap or echo one another, it opens with a
Bosnian Croat and a Bosnian Serb recognizing each other on a London
bus. Once friends from the same village, they are now sworn enemies
and immediately get into a fight; thrown off the bus, they chase
each other through Whitehall, pummeling each other beneath a statue
of Winston Churchill until both end up hospitalized, in adjacent
beds; soon the third bed in the ward is occupied by a Welsh
nationalist, who cheerfully boasts about firebombing English-owned
homes in Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, the Bosnian refugee Pero (Edin Dzandzanovic),
has been hit by a car, but he is luckier than the others. Portia
(Charlotte Coleman), a trainee nurse, falls for him and later
introduces him to her prim mother and her father, a Tory member of
Parliament. They treat Pero with a (italics)how interesting(end
italics) mixture of sympathy and condescension. Meanwhile, Dr.
Mouldy (Nicholas Farrell), an obstetrician, is treating Dzemila
(Walentine Giogiewa), a heavily pregnant Bosnian refugee who wants
an abortion because her condition is a result of a rape. ``Baby is
my enemy,'' she tells the distraught doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, a movie with so many mini-plots needs time to
introduce its characters, but Bosnia provides the connections.
Jerry Higgins (Gilbert Martin), for instance, is a BBC television
reporter with a troubled marriage who is about to leave on
assignment to cover the war. Griffin (Danny Nussbaum), a racist
soccer hooligan, also finds himself in Bosnia, but by mistake. He
and two pals go to the Netherlands to watch a soccer game and cause
trouble; at the Rotterdam airport for the return flight, Griffin
wanders off in a drugged stupor and falls asleep on a pallet loaded
with food aid; he wakes up to find himself being parachuted into
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the echoes of the Balkan conflict (and even of the
Balkan magic realism seen in films by, say, Emir Kusturica and
Goran Paskaljevic), ``Beautiful People'' is about ordinary Britons,
with Bosnia merely mirroring their arguments, violence and
prejudices as well as the generosity, loyalty and love of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   As James Christopher wrote in The Times of London after the
movie was released here last year: ``What reads like a list of
foreign crises is actually a familiar maze of emotional and moral
cul-de-sacs. Dizdar's argument is that we are all swimming in the
same big muddled stew.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizdar, who didn't return to Bosnia until 1996, when his mother
died, said: ``I didn't want to speculate about the Balkans,
something I didn't know anything about. I wanted to make this film
about London. I wanted to create a film about my surroundings as
seen by people like me. I believe in first impressions, the first
impression is the most powerful, and that is the impression of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizdar's own first impression occasioned no small culture shock,
as he struggled to adjust to the restrained emotions of daily life
here. ``The English don't like to be thrown off their normal
routine,'' he said over lunch in an Italian restaurant near Oxford
Circus. ``If you're impulsive or spontaneous, that's shocking here.
They find it very unnatural. You have to look at people's faces and
presume how they are reacting. If someone says something that could
lead to an argument, they immediately change the subject. For me,
it's healthy to have a row. But they run away from anything that is
not mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When new acquaintances discovered he was Bosnian, he said, they
often seemed embarrassed, unsure how to respond to the atrocities
being suffered by his countrymen. ``It's like they'd say, `I'm
aware of what's happening to your country, it's very sad, would you
like some more tea?''' he recalled. ``At most, they'd say, `How's
your family? OK?' Then, `Would you like some more tea?' People
didn't know how to deal with shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dizdar did not want tea. Rather, he wanted to break into
movies. As a young man in Zenica, he made 15 short films, several
of which won prizes in festivals. At the Prague film school, he
made three more shorts, including ``After Silence,'' about a deaf
man whose faith in the world is shattered after his hearing is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Once in London, he wrote a book, ``Milos Forman: King of
Satire,'' and a radio play broadcast by the BBC. But it was not
until 1995 that the British Film Institute commissioned him to
write a screenplay. The following year, the institute backed the
project to the tune of $400,000 and put Dizdar in touch with Ben
Woolford, a partner in an independent production company, Tall
Stories.
</P>
<P>
   What I liked about the screenplay was its energy and humor,''
Woolford recalled. ``It was a take on London like none I had ever
read, a familiar London viewed from an oblique angle by an
outsider. But I knew it would be a difficult film to finance. It
was a multi-stranded story, full of ideas but with no big stars. It
is very funny, but it is not a comedy, sad but not a tragedy, a
film about war but not a war film.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Woolford was unable to raise any private money, but
several institutions, including the arts council, were willing to
cover the film's $1.8 million budget as part of the British
government's new policy of stepped-up support for moviemaking.
Dizdar cast professional actors for most of the British parts, but
he hired nonactors _ two Bulgarians and three Bosnians _ for the
Bosnian roles.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ackroyd, Ken Loach's regular cameraman, came on board as
the director of photography. In another piece of good fortune, when
the Rotterdam airport scene was filmed at two Royal Air Force bases
in spring 1998, transport planes were being readied to drop food
supplies into Kosovo (the pilots in the film are real pilots).
</P>
<P>
   The movie took just 35 days to shoot, but in a sense it took
more than a decade to make: now 38, Dizdar is where he had hoped to
be in 1989. Still, the film's prize at Cannes and its subsequent
sale in 25 countries mean that he should have less difficulty
finding backing for his next project, which Tall Stories is also
producing, and which sounds even more English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a London business executive seen through the eyes
of his personal assistant, his wife and his au pair,'' he said of
his screenplay. ``It's sort of humorous, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is as if, having made ``Beautiful People,'' Dizdar
can finally move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been wanting to so say so much for so many years after
arriving in this country and suddenly it all came out, an explosion
of ideas and motives,'' he said. ``I feel much better now. I feel
discharged. Actually, I feel quite British.''

EARLY HARVARD PILGRIM FINANCIALS UNRELIABLE, STATE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Underscoring the confused state of Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care's tangled finances, regulators said their first
snapshot of the HMO's daily cash situation has turned out to be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   State officials trying to get a handle on Harvard Pilgrim's
ability to pay day-to-day bills had asked the health plan to
provide a detailed account of money collected and paid out by the
insurer on a given day.
</P>
<P>
   The report was considered a small but crucial first step in
getting the state's management of the $2.8 billion-a-year health
plan under &UR;  &LR; way. But after receiving it late Monday and having it
examined by accountants from KPMG Peat Marwick, ``we are not
satisfied that the information is complete or accurate,'' attorney
general Thomas Reilly said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get a clearer picture, Reilly said regulators are
subjecting the report to a ``higher level'' of examination. Among
other measures, he said regulators are asking hospitals and other
Harvard Pilgrim creditors to verify that the health plan's numbers
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing beginning to what is already proving to
be a complex task of unraveling Harvard Pilgrim's knotted
accounting. And the limited information the report provided didn't
offer much encouragement, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every bit as serious as we thought last week'' when
Harvard Pilgrim officials said they discovered some $58.5 million
in previously unknown 1999 losses, prompting a judge to order the
health plan into state receivership, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   With the newly discovered losses _ a result of software problems
in the health plan's computer accounting systems, according to
Harvard Pilgrim officials _ total losses for 1999 are expected to
be as much as $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reilly and other state officials working on a plan to get
Harvard Pilgrim back on its feet sought to put the situation in the
best light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has realized that Harvard Pilgrim is conducting
business as usual,'' Reilly said, adding that after fielding more
than 1,000 calls a day from nervous members last week, the number
of calls to the state insurance division and attorney general's
office dwindled to just 45 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great deal of angst, a great deal of concern,'' he
said. ``Now, there's a level of calm that didn't exist before.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the court order that placed Harvard Pilgrim in
receivership, the health plan is paying all current bills as they
come due, officials said. But whether Harvard Pilgrim can afford to
do that and dig out of its debts remains an open question.
Officials are still awaiting a report on how much Harvard Pilgrim
owes its 10 largest creditors and, ultimately, a more detailed
account of the health plan's overall financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Massachusetts officials Tuesday met with regulators
in Rhode Island, where Harvard Pilgrim went into receivership in
the fall, Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Harvard Pilgrim is in receivership (in
Massachusetts), they needed to make sure certain administrative
things will get done,'' she said. ``Those conversations were
productive and collegial.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond
announced a plan for physicians and small health clinics affected
by the collapse of Harvard Pilgrim in the Ocean State to receive
low-interest loans under a government-sponsored program.
</P>
<P>
   Some small providers have been contemplating closing for lack of
funds, Almond said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Ruthardt said she is allowing Harvard Pilgrim
to proceed with its long-planned move next month into a new $47
million headquarters building in Wellesley and, later on, into a
Quincy building now under construction, Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves into new, visible locations have drawn fire from
some consumers who criticized Harvard Pilgrim for spending money on
relocation while suffering large losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruthardt said money Harvard Pilgrim slotted for the moves is
not coming from funds they set aside to pay providers. She said she
reserved the right to halt the moves later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, that will continue,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, which negotiated leases on the new buildings
three years ago, will save $5 million a year by consolidating 2,870
administrative employees in two buildings rather than six
currently, health plan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Ruthardt said that as regulators delve deeper
into Harvard Pilgrim's difficulties and become more involved with
inevitable management decisions, the state may have to hire outside
experts to assist with decisions about possible layoffs and other
cost-cutting moves at Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have staff that are looking at those issues,'' she said.
``We're asking questions like, `Do we have sufficient staff for the
next step of this? Or do we need help.' ''

RETAILER SUES ON-LINE MERCHANT WITH SIMILAR NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a legal challenge that may help define how traditional
trademark rules will apply to the Internet, a New England sporting
goods retailer has sued a high-profile on-line merchant with a
similar name and business.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports Stores Inc., a Wilmington, Mass. athletic equipment
and clothing seller, sued MVP.com Inc., a Web-based sporting goods
company launched last month by athletic icons John Elway, Michael
Jordan, and Wayne Gretzky in conjunction with CBS Corp. and a
Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports, a bricks-and-mortar retailer with 19 outlets in four
New England states, charged MVP.com with unfair competition,
trademark dilution, and ``cyberpiracy,'' or poaching of its
Internet identity, among other violations.
</P>
<P>
   The action, filed in US District Court in Boston, is the latest
in a raft of lawsuits that are raising big questions over how
companies should conduct business in the Internet age. It comes
several days after the body overseeing the Internet's address
system revoked scores of new domain names after a computer glitch
allowed people to register addresses similar to established Web
sites. President Clinton signed a law banning ``cybersquatting'' _
the practice of registering trademark names as domain addresses
with an ill-intentioned view to selling them later at a big profit
_ in November.
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sports, in operation since 1984, registered the domain name
mvp-sports.com in May 1997. The company eventually plans to use its
Web site, which now provides only information, to sell goods on
line.
</P>
<P>
   MVP.com bought the registration for its domain name last
December and plans to begin direct sales this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If allowed to begin selling sporting goods on the Internet,
MVP.com will be competing directly with MVP Sports using (trade)
marks which are identical, nearly identical, and/or confusingly
similar to the MVP (trade) marks,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   A Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar lawyer representing MVP Sports did not
return calls for comment. Eric Rannala, a spokesman for MVP.com,
said that ``we thoroughly analyzed all the trademark issues and are
confident that our right to the name and the domain is free and
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Three independent attorneys specializing in Internet law said
Tuesday that it was unclear whether MVP Sports had legitimate
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes that we can simply take all the old trademark
rules and apply them to domain names,'' said Evan Slavitt of Gadsby
&AMP; Hannah of Boston. ``And one question is whether MVP Sports owns
every variation of its name.'' Slavitt also questioned why MVP
Sports had not originally moved to register the mvp.com name.
</P>
<P>
   ``MVP'' is an acronym for Most Valuable Player, a common sports
term.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Ellerbach, a Palo Alto, Calif. lawyer, said MVP.com's
activities did not appear to be those of a cybersquatter, since the
on-line merchant had a legitimate business and was not looking to
sell its domain name to MVP Sports. She added that the Wilmington
retailer would have to prove that its customers were confused by
the MVP.com Web site and name. Ellerbach also said that since MVP
Sports had registered two of its trademarks _ ``MVP'' and ``MVP
Sporting Goods'' _ in Massachusetts, and not, apparently, under
federal laws, the company might not have control over their use in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Sharie Steele, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
said that MVP.com's activities would not be legitimate if targeted
directly at MVP Sports customers. But she said that ``for MVP
Sports to think that it has the only right to the name `MVP' is
absurd.'' Unlike some other industry participants, the foundation
has opposed cybersquatting laws, saying that they unfairly
privilege trademark holders over domain holders and stifle
competition.

 &HT;    McCain floats tax relief plan
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) rolled out a proposed
tax package Tuesday half the size of that of his chief rival, but
one that McCain called more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes have quickly become a major topic in the Republican
primary race, and McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are each
trying to convince voters that they have the more responsible plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called for cutting taxes to the middle class by $237
billion and setting aside $231 billion of expected budget surpluses
for the Social Security system over five years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would raise the ceiling for the 15 percent tax bracket
from $43,050 to $70,000 for couples who file a joint tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a $483 billion income tax reduction with hefty
savings for the wealthy from a drop in the top tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   For lower-income taxpayers, he would cut the bottom tax rate
from 15 percent to 10 percent. Bush would not set aside any of the
non-Social Security surplus to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   And it was on this point that McCain made his strongest comments
before a packed and friendly house at the Concord Chamber of
Commerce luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others suggest that we should use every penny for tax cuts,
forgetting we have promises to keep and a fleeting opportunity to
keep our word without imperiling the economic future of our
children and generations to come,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made what sounded like a reference to Bush when he
said, ``We can afford a tax cut. . . . But it must be a tax cut
promise a leader can keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he insisted he was not taking a shot at Bush, whom he
otherwise praised as being qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his campaign aides insisted again Tuesday that the
surplus would be more than large enough to accommodate his larger
tax cut and provide unspecified help to Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe surpluses should be passed back to hardworking
Americans,'' Bush said. McCain's rhetoric Tuesday was strikingly
similar at some points to traditional Democratic themes.
</P>
<P>
   He proudly noted that a millionaire would get just a $3,500 tax
cut under his plan. ``Under Governor Bush's plan, the tax cut is
worth $50,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And he took on one of his favorite targets, saying he would come
up with $150 billion to pay for the bulk of his tax cuts by ending
``special breaks for oil companies, ethanol giants, insurance
companies and the multitude of other powerful special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain said he would devote nearly two-thirds of the
surplus to Social Security, his economic advisers conceded that
that money would only extend the system's solvency by 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that a more comprehensive solution is
needed, but he said any details would await the first week of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said that ``under no circumstances'' would he support
raising the retirement age or basing benefits on recipients' other
income, so-called means testing.
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the Social Security system proposed by McCain
would allow taxpayers to invest up to 20 percent of their payroll
taxes in private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also would end the earnings test that reduces benefits
for Social Security recipients who continue to work.

SHAREHOLDERS NOT SO SURE ABOUT MERGED AOL-TIME WARNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial pundits may like the proposed merger between Internet
company America Online Inc. and media company Time Warner Inc., but
investors aren't so sure. Their doubts led to sizable declines in
shares of both companies Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   AOL stock fell 8 5/8 to 64 on the New York Stock Exchange, while
Time Warner, which had soared 27 1/2 points on Monday, fell 6 1/4
to 86.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may be concerned that America Online overpaid for
Time Warner, said Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst Fred Moran. There's
``concern that they're paying an 71 percent premium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others appear to be concerned about how Wall Street will view
the merged company. ``The big question for shareholders is whether
the market will accord the new entity a traditional valuation or an
`Internet valuation,' '' Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. analyst Henry Blodget
said in a research note. ``Our answer to this is not surprising:
Probably somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers are still trying to figure out how AOL and
Time Warner could combine their old and new media empires to create
new business opportunities. ``In the short term, I would expect far
more cross-marketing,'' said Ross Rubin, vice president of research
development for Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York. That means
more advertising of Time Warner products on AOL, and pointers to
AOL Internet resources in Time Warner publications and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   But companies don't spend $164 billion for extra promotion. In
the long run, it's expected that AOL Time Warner will roll out a
number of new media products that leverage the resources of the two
firms. For example, AOL can take advantage of Time Warner's
publishing expertise to develop its own entry in the Internet
magazine market. And Time Warner can build upon AOL's ongoing
investments in the interactive television business.
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, AOL showed
off a television set-top box called AOL TV. The product, similar to
Microsoft's Web TV, will enable the integration of television and
Internet content. Users will have access to the usual features
available from AOL, including e-mail and instant messaging. The
service will also allow the addition of interactive features in the
television signal, so that a user of AOL TV will be able to
participate in TV game shows or chat with other viewers of a
favorite TV program.
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Time Warner gives could enable the new firm to
create programs with built-in data content, accessible to users of
AOL TV boxes. ``You could be watching an HBO program and have a
chat with the star of the show at the same time,'' said Mitchell
Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies Inc., which
makes the software for AOL TV.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is experimenting with a similar feature in WebTV, but
despite the company's immense power in the PC market, it's never
been strong in marketing to consumers. AOL already has 20 million
subscribers and a reputation for masterful marketing, and Time
Warner has a cable TV system that serves 13 million households.
Between them, they could make AOL TV a de facto national standard,
just as AOL has become a standard for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Lippman, associate director of the MIT Media Lab, sees
interactive TV as a powerful marketing tool. Presently, there's a
gap between viewing a commercial on TV and actually buying
something. ``You can't go to the ABC Web site and buy everything
that's advertised on ABC,'' Lippman noted. A future consumer,
watching a Time Warner channel like TBS with an AOL TV set-top box
might be able to do exactly that, with a point-and-click purchase
feature embedded into every ad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AOL is likely to benefit from Time Warner's power in
print media. Two of the world's top Web sites _ Yahoo and eBay _
now publish print magazines. ``Yahoo Internet Life has been one of
the most successful, growing magazines,'' said Samir Husni,
professor of journalism at the University of Mississippi and an
expert on the magazine industry. ``eBay magazine has a good
future.'' Samir thinks that with Time Warner behind it, AOL will be
well placed to begin a print publication of its own, one that will
start with at least 20 million potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's AOL, the television show. Time Warner may well
create such a program, said Ross Rubin, vice president of research
development at Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York. ``I would
expect it would tend to focus on fun things you can do on line (or)
focus on life on the Net,'' said Rubin. An AOL television show
would have to compete with existing Internet-oriented TV programs
produced by Web companies like CNet Inc.

BESIDE MICROSOFT, A NEW 800-POUND GORILLA LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the company's adversaries, the very name ``Microsoft''
suggests menacing power. It has been called the Death Star, an
800-pound gorilla and worse.
</P>
<P>
   And in the government's sweeping antitrust case, the Microsoft
Corp. was portrayed in convincing detail as a monopolistic bully.
America Online Inc., in particular, was bent to Microsoft's will,
according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But after America Online's move on Monday to buy Time Warner
Inc., at $165 billion the largest merger in history, Microsoft
suddenly seems less threatening _ less the irresistible army of the
Internet era. AOL Time Warner, as the new company will be called,
promises to be a formidable power in its own right, perhaps more
powerful in some ways than Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to be sure, quickly gained the upper hand in its
first Internet battle _ against the Netscape Communications Corp.,
which America Online bought last year. Microsoft saw Netscape, the
pioneer in Web browsing software, as a threat to its dominance of
personal computing. Microsoft's response was swift and aggressive,
and, according to the Justice Department and 19 states, against the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner deal changes none of the facts in
the antitrust case. But antitrust experts say it could figure into
the calculations the court makes on sanctions against Microsoft, if
it loses the case, or in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft is an 800-pound gorilla, then there is certainly
another beefy gorilla out there now,'' observed William Kovacic,
professor at the George Washington University law school. ``This
deal does underline the possibilities for upheaval and
transformation in this industry. That could well make it more
difficult for a judge to choose a remedy that has dramatic,
irreversible effects, like breaking up the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger, if completed, would
create a powerhouse for the next phase of Internet business:
selling information and entertainment services to consumers who may
tap into them using digital cell phones, handheld devices and
television set-top boxes in addition to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Time Warner deal, America Online had been
bulking itself up to prepare for this so-called post-PC era with a
multibillion-dollar investment campaign over the last couple of
years, since the Microsoft antitrust suit was filed, to strengthen
its network technology and to add services. The acquisitions
include Netscape, Compuserve, MapQuest.com, MovieFone and a
$1.5-billion investment in Hughes Electronics to promote satellite
delivery of Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has gone on its own multibillion-dollar investment
spree, much of it to secure assured distribution for high-speed
Internet access over telecommunications and cable television
networks, both in the United States and abroad. In the last year
alone, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, $660 million in
Nextel, $500 million in NTL and $300 million in United Pan-European
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the online business, Microsoft finds itself in the
unfamiliar position of being David to America Online's Goliath. In
the online access market, in which subscribers pay fees,
Microsoft's MSN service had 1.9 million members in the third
quarter of last year, compared with 18 million for America Online,
according to Jupiter Communications, a research firm. America
Online says it now has 20 million subscribers, while Microsoft did
not disclose its current numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does have some popular sites on the World Wide Web,
like its Expedia travel site and Carpoint auto site, which can be
reached by users through any Internet access service. Yet even by
the measure of number of visitors to its Web sites, Microsoft is
well behind America Online. According to Media Metrix, which
monitors Web traffic, America Online had 54 million visitors in
November, compared with 38 million for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made some media investments including its joint
venture with NBC for a cable television and online news service,
MSNBC, but recently it had been shifting away from trying to become
a media company. Instead, it has been trying to build up its Web
offerings as delivering personalized information online _ e-mail,
news, stock prices, travel advice, even horoscopes _ that people
use to make them ``more productive,'' just as Microsoft's popular
Office software makes people more productive at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new strategy for MSN is about taking us back to our roots
but twisted and adopted for the Internet,'' Brad Chase, a senior
vice president explained in a recent interview before the America
Online-Time Warner deal was announced. ``There are parts of the
media business that we do, selling ads and so forth. But our main
focus is not going to be on creating content and media, which is
what we had been trying to do for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's senior executive team met on Monday to discuss the
implications of America Online's move, which is a big step in
becoming a media company. So is Microsoft rethinking its strategy
yet again _ as the richest company in the world, it could afford
virtually any acquisition _ or does it plan to stick to pursuing
its very different Internet strategy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear in mind, we've had one day to chew on it,'' Chase said
Tuesday, ``but I think this deal is kind of positive for us in a
way. It reinforces the very different road we're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is saying that its primary anchor is going to be media,''
he added. ``Our primary anchor is going to be services and software
distributed over the Internet that will help consumers run their
lives better, make them more productive.''

   To help revive its online business, Microsoft recruited a new
executive last fall, Richard Belluzo, to head its consumer group.
He came from Silicon Graphics, where he had been chief executive,
but Belluzo was probably best known for his previous work at
Hewlett-Packard, where he built the consumer printer and consumer
personal computer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists it is still very early in the Internet
business and that America Online's lead is by no means
insurmountable. ``As a mass-market consumer medium, the Internet is
just beginning to emerge and it will be accessed from many devices
other than the PC,'' Belluzo said. ``People talk about all the
subscribers AOL has, but in a few years we will look back and say
those numbers are trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the markets where Microsoft has engineered come-from-behind
winners, the company has followed a formula: make competitive
products, but also change the economics of the target market. In
office productivity software, Microsoft once trailed Lotus in
spreadsheets and Wordperfect in word processing. Microsoft steadily
improved its offerings, Excel and Word, but also bundled them into
a single Office suite and priced the bundled offering at about the
same price as rivals were charging for a single office application.

   LONDON _ ``I have no intentions, and neither is it the purpose
of this trial, to refight World War II.'' So declared the
revisionist historian David Irving in his impassioned opening
statement in High Court here Tuesday, the first day of the libel
case he hopes will salvage his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, World War II is exactly what the case _ Irving vs.
Penguin Books Ltd. and Lipstadt _ is about.
</P>
<P>
   Irving _ who has said, among other things, that Hitler did not
approve the mass killing of Jews during the war and that Auschwitz
was merely a brutal labor camp with an unfortunately high death
rate _ is suing Deborah Lipstadt, author of ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,'' and her
British publisher, Penguin. His main claim is that his reputation
has been irrevocably damaged by the book's assertions that he is a
Holocaust denier who manipulates history to serve his own ends.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case about free speech and historical methods, and
about, peripherally, the magnitude and circumstances of the
Holocaust. It is being closely watched outside of Britain,
including the United States, where Ms. Lipstadt holds the Dorot
Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost inevitable that the major focus of the case will
be the crimes of the Holocaust, and whether they took place, and
how they're interpreted,'' said Efraim Zuroff, director of the
Israel office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem in an
interview. ``Any victory for Irving is a loss for historical
justice and a blow to the memory of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The case arises from Ms. Lipstadt's book, first published in the
United States in 1993, which examined Holocaust deniers and their
connections to a worldwide network of right-wing and neo-Nazi
groups. In the book, published in Britain by Penguin in 1994, Ms.
Lipstadt charged that Irving, the author of more than 30 books on
the Nazi era, was ``one of the most dangerous spokespersons for
Holocaust denial'' and a researcher who ``bends'' historical
evidence ``until it conforms with his ideological leanings and
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving brought the case, he said, because Ms. Lipstadt and
Penguin, supported by ``an organized international endeavor,'' set
about to destroy his career. As a result of their campaign against
him, he said, St. Martin's Press withdrew his 1996 biography of the
Nazi propagandist Josef Goebbels, which argues that Goebbels, not
Hitler, was behind the murder of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have since 1996 seen one fearful publisher after another
falling away from me, declining to reprint my works, refusing to
accept new commissions and turning their backs on me when I
approach,'' said Irving, who is representing himself in the case.
``Such is the nature of the odium that has been generated by the
waves of hatred recklessly propagated against me by the
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he is not a Holocaust denier, although he has
disputed standard accounts of how many people died in the war and
under what circumstances. ``No person in full command of his mental
faculties, and with even the slightest understanding of what
happened in World War II, can deny that the tragedy actually
happened, however much we dissident historians may wish to quibble
about the means, the scale, the dates and other minutiae,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving has had a curious career. Some of his works, especially
``Hitler's War'' (1977), have earned high praise from some
reviewers for the elegance of his writing and thoroughness of his
research.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, more and more questions have been raised
about his methods and ideology. In the United States, Publisher's
Weekly called his Goebbels biography ``repellant.'' In 1992, Irving
was convicted and fined by a court in Germany, where Holocaust
denial is a crime, after saying publicly that there were no gas
chambers at Auschwitz. He has also been banned from Canada, Italy,
Austria and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his early reputation as a formidable historian,
Irving has confounded efforts to write him off as a simple
crackpot. The Nazi-era historian Gitta Sereny, who is involved in a
lawsuit filed by Irving after she wrote that he was a ``brilliant
propagandist'' made ``dangerous'' by his ``clever mixture of truth
and untruth,'' said in an interview that it was hard for general
readers to know just how much he distorts the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rampton, the lawyer arguing on behalf of Ms. Lipstadt
and Penguin, charged that Irving was not a historian at all. ``To
put it bluntly, he is a liar,'' Rampton said in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the case is Irving's honesty and integrity as a
chronicler _ I shy away from the word `historian' _ of these
matters,'' Rampton said. ``By exposing that dangerous fraud in this
court, the defendants may properly be applauded for having
performed a significant public service, not just in this country,
but in all those places in the world were anti-Semitism is waiting
to be fed.''

BRITISH CALL PINOCHET UNFIT FOR TRIAL AND MAY SEND HIM HOME TO
CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Tuesday night that new medical tests
showed that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand trial in Spain
and that it was now inclined to abandon the case against him,
allowing him to return home to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw released the results of a Jan. 5
examination of the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator by four
British specialists and said he was ``minded ... to take the view
that no purpose would be served by continuing the present
extradition proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for nearly 15
months awaiting the outcome of complicated legal and judicial moves
surrounding the request to send him to Madrid to face 35 charges of
torture and conspiracy to torture stemming from the days of his
strongman rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Straw, who has the right to end to the extradition proceedings
on compassionate grounds of age and health, did not make it clear
how soon he might act. But he said he was writing to various rights
groups that have been party to the case and countries like France,
Belgium and Switzerland that have made extradition requests of
their own and was asking for replies within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The next formal hearing in the drawn out case had been scheduled
for the end of March, but it is based on an appeal of the
extradition order that would become irrelevant if Straw takes the
likely step of intervening before then.
</P>
<P>
   The medical report and Straw's reaction to it appeared to mark
the closing stages of a case that has shaken international law,
galvanized human rights and exile groups and stirred bitter and
passionate old antagonisms in Chile and other countries with recent
experiences of dictatorial regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In obtaining a decision from Britain's highest court, the Law
Lords of the House of Lords, formally throwing out Pinochet's claim
that he could not be tried for acts during the time that he was a
head of state, the case has fundamentally altered the law of
sovereign immunity and established new international powers for
people seeking redress of human rights abuses, even in courts
outside the country where the crimes were allegedly committed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's medical tests were scheduled after the Chilean
embassy in October submitted evidence from Pinochet's doctors that
his health had undergone a marked decline during the fall. He was
said to have suffered a series of small strokes in September.
</P>
<P>
   Straw then asked Pinochet to consent to an independent
examination, and his office selected the four doctors, specialists
respectively in gerontology, geriatric medicine, neurology and
neuropsychology. The seven-hour examination was conducted in
Spanish _ Pinochet does not speak English _ and two of the
physicians, Straw said, were fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said it was the ``unequivocal and unanimous conclusion ...
that following recent deterioration in the state of Senator
Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during
September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial,
and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The general was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, as he lay
in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. British police
made their surprise move in response to an application from a
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, seeking his extradition to Madrid
to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and
murder in connection with the disappearance of more than 3,000
people in the years after he seized power in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish
judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into
the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s. The Spanish
government, though forced by circumstance to pursue the case, has
shown little enthusiasm for it from the outset, and tonight Spain's
foreign ministry said it would ``respect the decisions of the
British government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges in a
ruling by the High Court that upheld his claim to sovereign
immunity. But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the
Law Lords overturned that decision, saying that being a head of
state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned was to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty
International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision
was even more emphatic on the principle than the first one, though
it drastically reduced the number of charges and narrowed the scope
to torture and conspiracy to torture. The case then moved on to the
validity of the actual extradition order itself, which was upheld
by a London magistrate last October and then appealed, leading to
the current planning of the next hearing for March 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the one appearance in court that Pinochet has been obliged to
make, he maintained the defiant attitude he adopted at the
beginning, saying he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any
court outside of Chile to try him, and saying he was innocent of
``all the lies of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Every hearing and court date over the 14 months has seen crowds
of supporters and opponents behind barricades angrily facing down
one another , hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 13 months, the general has been living under house
arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's
exclusive southern suburbs. He has had periodic visits from Chilean
supporters and backers in Britain, the most visible and voluble of
whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She has
argued that, far from holding him in custody, Britain instead owes
him its gratitude for the support he gave the British during the
1982 Falkland Islands war with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Her office said Tuesday night that she was delighted with the
doctors' report and that she expected Straw to be a ``very fair
man'' and order the general's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reyes, a former journalist imprisoned by the Pinochet
regime who speaks for a group representing Chileans abroad, said,
``We're shocked with this news. It's unbelievable that a criminal
should escape justice because perhaps he is ill or in pain. The
pain of my Chilean people is worse than what Pinochet is
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Amnesty International said it respected the
legal right of defendants to have their fitness to stand trial
assessed but it still wanted to study the way the decision had been
reached. ``What is important is the way this process has been
carried out so we need to examine the documents,'' she said.

 &HT;    Hacker puts glitch in university's Web site
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Internet ``hijacking'' that redirected thousands of
Emory University Web site visitors to another location should be
fixed by today.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arose Friday when a computer hacker apparently
changed the Internet addresses, or URLs, of at least nine
institutions, including Emory. The glitch resulted in thousands of
people being redirected to a company in New Jersey when they tried
to call up Emory's Web site. It also meant that as many as 20,000
e-mails to and from the university each day went unanswered or were
returned to the sender as undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hacker attack, basically. The network got hijacked,''
said Jan Gleason, Emory's assistant vice president of university
communications. ``It's like somebody went to the post office and
pretended they were you, changed your address and had your mail
sent to another address.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials were particularly miffed at the hacker's
timing. The problems started Friday, eight days before the deadline
for undergraduate applications. Students who planned to apply via
the Internet could not access the material they needed. At least 60
people contacted Emory on Monday and Tuesday to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Students, professors and staff on Emory's computer network could
still send e-mail among themselves but had trouble sending or
receiving outside mail.
</P>
<P>
   Outside users who tried to access the site were redirected to
HighSpeedNET.net, a New Jersey computer software company.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of HighSpeedNET.net, 19-year-old Ralph Hughes, told
the Internet newspaper CNET that he was not responsible for the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for anyone to believe me,'' Hughes said,
``but somebody got ahold of my password and authorized all these
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at Network Solutions, the company that issues
domains or addresses to Internet Web sites, including the Emory
site, said investigators are trying to determine what happened.

FOR OLDER-MEDIA COMPANIES, VINDICATION OR WAKE-UP CALL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of a deal in which Time Warner Inc., an
established media company, became the prospective junior partner of
a new media giant, America Online, executives of other older-media
companies are proclaiming that the value of their unique
information had been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Private conversations, however, made it clear that there is
nervousness amid the public jubilation. At least one executive
speculated on the danger that an older-media company that moved too
slowly would become marginalized, ending up a wallflower at the
global dance, while the likes of Gannett Inc., Times Mirror or Dow
Jones &AMP; Co. might be waltzing with Yahoo, AT&AMP;T or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The triumphant statements of the people who run companies built
around the compilation and sale of unique information tended to
have a similar ring. As Tim Stautberg, the vice president of
investor relations at E.W. Scripps, said, ``The deal as announced
yesterday validates the value of content. And we've said all along
that we're a content company. And so were excited to see others
confirming the value of our vision.'' Scripps owns 19 newspapers,
nine network-affiliated television stations and three cable
channels, including the Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   A recurring question, however, is whether the AOL-Time Warner
deal proved that no company could live by content alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think this is the wave of the future and there is
no getting around it,'' said Mortimer Zuckerman, whose media
holdings include the Daily News of New York and the magazines Fast
Co. and U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, the stock prices of AOL and Time Warner fell
Tuesday, indicating that shareholders are concerned about the
merger. Yes, he said, the companies that are slow to move may find
themselves with few options. ``But you have to understand,'' he
said, ``that a new technology is emerging that is going to be
increasingly dominant in distributing that information.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, however, doesn't mean that they have information to
distribute. Both sides, in my judgement, have not choice'' but to
get together, he said. ``And it is a tremendous opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ma, named last week as a vice president of The
Washington Post Co. in charge of business development, agreed that
``the AOL-Time Warner deal really underscores in a dramatic way
that, even as big and AOL and Time Warner are separately, neither
felt that they had all the pieces necessary to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited his company's agreement to share some news reports with
NBC News and with MSNBC, the cable news and Internet outlets that
are, in turn, a joint venture between the television network and
Microsoft. ``That has been what has driven our involvement with NBC
and MSNBC,'' Ma said. ``Those are other big players. It
corroborates the thinking that this is a big, complex, expensive
game and you need to have really strong partners to do it and to do
it as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its flagship newspaper, the Post owns Newsweek
magazine, six television stations in five markets, some cable
networks and Kaplan, an educational unit whose products range from
test preparation to college admissions course.
</P>
<P>
   But not every old-media executive saw new media mergers as
manifest destiny. The biggest dissenter appeared to be Rupert
Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp. The Australian, one of his
global collection of newspapers, on Wednesday wrote that Murdoch
``has ruled out buying or merging with an Internet company.'' The
newspaper quoted its owner as saying, ``We don't see anything out
there at an attractive price.''
</P>
<P>
   But appearances can be deceiving. After Murdoch's remarks were
transmitted by Bloomberg News, and News Corp.'s share price
dropped, a spokesman for the company issued a clarification. He
said Murdoch had told an investor conference in Palm Springs that
the company would consider any deal that was good for the
enterprise and its shareholders. ``Right now he doesn't see that
deal out there,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four older-media companies _ Tribune, Dow Jones, Knight Ridder
and The New York Times Co. _ have made preliminary moves that could
lead to their issuing a new class of securities based on their
Internet holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder's chief executive, P. Anthony Ridder, said Tuesday
that ``Our company's primary product is local content; our Internet
strategy _ one of the most aggressive in the newspaper industry _
is to exploit that local market content into a national network of
regional hubs. In this emerging world, they will be perceived as
increasingly valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Lewis, president and chief executive of The New York
Times Co., said in a statement, ``The AOL-Time Warner deal
validates the time-tested notion that content is critical to
success in any medium, including the Internet. That is consistent
with our strategy of providing high-quality news, information and
interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what content will prove most valuable, either to a
corporate suitor or an investor, is not yet clear, however. ``What
is desirable? I wish I had an easy answer,'' said Lauren Rich Fine,
an analyst for Merrill Lynch. She said Tuesday that there is likely
to be an advantage for companies with name brands, like the Times
Co., with The New York Times newspaper, or Dow Jones, with The Wall
Street Journal.

BOEING TO INCREASE 747 PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. plans to increase production of its
flagship 747 before the end of the year, possibly as soon as the
third quarter, the Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Production rates for the 777 also may be increased a little
sooner than had been expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said any such production boost by Boeing would
be further evidence that Asia, a key market for the two planes, is
returning to economic health faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing not long ago faced the possibility of having to further
slash production this year of the 747, the company's most
profitable plane, because of the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if employment at Boeing's Everett, Wash., plant,
where widebody jets are built, would go up if production rates are
increased. A Boeing machinist at the plant said it would not be
possible to bump up production without adding more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to bring people back to go to the higher
rates,'' said the machinist, who did not want to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Employment at the Everett plant at the end of 1999 was about
25,000, down from about 30,000 at the start of the year. Boeing has
been cutting its workforce the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, total company employment was around 239,000. It
is now down to about 197,000 and Boeing has forecast that by the
end of 2000 its work force will number between 185,000 and 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the company no longer comments on
production rates, and he would not speculate about possible changes
in the size of the Everett workforce should rates go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real focus is hitting our delivery target ... not on
production rates,'' spokesman Doug Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it expects to deliver 480 airplanes this year.
That is well down from the record 620 planes delivered in 1999, and
reflects a declining demand for new airplanes after the most recent
industry boom cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 480 planes to be delivered this year, 121 will be
twin-aisle jets built in Everett, Webb said. The company will
deliver 25 747s this year, added Gary Lesser, Boeing's 747
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is now building the 747 on a 10-day cycle, meaning one
plane leaves the factory every 10 working days. That translates to
a production rate of two planes a month. (Boeing does not build
planes on the weekend, which leaves an average of about 21
manufacturing days a month.)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with plane No. 1261, which is scheduled to be
delivered late in the fourth quarter, Boeing will go to an 8-day
cycle, according to people who have seen the company's latest 747
``firing order'' or production schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Since it takes about four months to build a 747, the 8-day cycle
would have to kick in no later than the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Webb and Lesser cautioned that the production schedule can
change. But a lot of planning is required for Boeing to increase
production rates. Parts suppliers, for example, must know months in
advance so they can be ready.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 747, Boeing also plans to increase the
production rate this year of its 777, a knowledgable source said.
The rate will increase from four planes a month to five, probably
in August, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said they are not surprised that Boeing plans
to increase production this year of the 747 and 777.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the renewed optimism that the Asia market will be
improving, it makes sense that we could see an upward bias in
production rates later this year,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs of
Seattle's Ragen MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Asia continues to rebound, that bodes very well for the
747,'' said Bill Fiala of Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Boeing has been ``very conservative'' in
forecasting production rates for the 747. ``They have kind of said
that if Asia is strong, it would not take too much to get the rates
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing would not comment about production rates for this
story, the issue is certain to come up later this month when the
company holds a conference call with analysts and the media to
report fourth quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Boeing doesn't like to talk about production
rates, it's easier to see trends when they do,'' said one industry
analyst. ``I like them talking about both deliveries and
production.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Boeing was building five 747s per month. As the rate
began to drop there were concerns it could eventually dip below two
per month if Asia did not rebound.
</P>
<P>
   When the company announced third quarter earnings last October,
Chairman Phil Condit said he was encouraged by what was happening
in Asia and Boeing would be able to maintain its 747 production at
two planes per month in 2000. Boeing had previously forecast that
it would be able to build only 14 of the jumbo jets in 2000 because
of sagging orders from Asian airlines. The additional 10 planes
this year will result in $1 billion more in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting production of the 747 to an 8-day cycle, while not a
big hike, is a ``nice move in the right direction,'' said Jacobs,
the industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too long ago we all thought there might be some risk
to those numbers (of two per month),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of new 747 orders last year were for freighters. Boeing's
web site lists 35 747-400 orders in 1999. Only two were passenger
models.
</P>
<P>
   This year should see more orders for 740-400 passengers jets,
``as Asian airlines continue on the path to recovery,'' Jacobs
said.

 McCAIN BACKS WHITE SOUTHERN VIEW OF CONFEDERATE FLAG AS `SYMBOL OF (sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having spent several months saying he sees both sides
of the Confederate Flag issue now raging within South Carolina,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona has embraced the philosophy of the
white Southerners trying to keep the old battle flag flying over
the capitol in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, he said in a statement distributed to reporters on
Monday, is ``a symbol of heritage.'' The statement was quickly
distributed by his South Carolina campaign to counter what aides
said was a misstatement by McCain on Sunday, when he told a
television interviewer that the flag was ``offensive'' and a
``symbol of racism and slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``symbol of heritage'' may sound innocuous outside
the South, but its meaning is unmistakable in a region where
conflicting memories of the Civil War are often as important as any
contemporary political issue. Saying the flag is a symbol of
heritage rather than a reminder of racism, is an argument made by
those who say the war was not fought over slavery, but over state's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, like the other Republican candidates, has
declined to take a position on the specific issue of whether the
flag should fly over the South Carolina statehouse, saying he
understands the concerns of both sides, his characterization of the
flag's symbolism puts him further to the right than any other major
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``When whites say heritage in the South, they are generally
referring to a heritage in which black people are excluded,'' said
Bernard Powers, a professor of history at the College of
Charleston. ``In the best possible light, the senator is just
trying to be political, but I fear that he is uninformed about a
critically important element of American history and its legacy for
contemporary times.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue is enormously volatile in South Carolina, which
is holding a Republican presidential primary on Feb. 19 that is
crucial to McCain's hopes for the nomination. The NAACP has
declared an economic boycott against the state as long as the flag
continues to fly over the capitol, but Republicans in the State
House of Representatives have blocked any attempt to move it.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the flag a symbol of heritage, McCain has taken a
far more conservative position than his chief rival for the
Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush. Whenever he is asked
about the flag issue in South Carolina, Bush has repeatedly said
that the matter is for South Carolinians to decide. On Monday
night, he told MSNBC in an interview that he would not fly the
Confederate Flag over the Texas statehouse ``because of the
symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has much closer ties to the leaders of the pro-flag
movement. One of the most prominent members of the so-called
Heritage Movement in the state, who has helped organize the
campaign to keep the flag flying, is Richard M. Quinn, McCain's
chief strategist in South Carolina. Quinn, the editor in chief of
the neo-confederate magazine Southern Partisan, is the father of
State Rep. Rick Quinn, the House majority leader, who has said the
flag will never be lowered as long as the NAACP boycott is in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Quinn said on Tuesday that he had not pushed McCain to
support the flag. But the emotions sweeping the state over the
issue have become more intense than any in years, and may explain
why McCain felt it necessary to issue a formal statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the business community is lobbying hard to remove the
flag, most of the Republicans in the legislature _ who represent
white districts that McCain desperately needs to win the primary _
are fervently in favor of the flag. One prominent state senator,
Arthur Ravenel, R-Charleston, referred to the NAACP as the
``National Association of Retarded Persons'' on Saturday, and later
issued an apology to retarded people. Ravenel said on Tuesday that
he misspoke, but he was denounced by some of his colleagues on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's written statement, which also appeared on his Website,
was his first on the subject, and was issued quickly after he
seemed to suggest on Sunday that he found the flag offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is offensive in many, many ways, as we
all know,'' he said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation'' on
Sunday morning. ``It's a symbol of racism and slavery. But I also
understand how others do not view it in that fashion. My forebears
from Mississippi fought under the Confederate flag. They were not
slave owners, and I'm sure they considered their service _ one I
believe died in Shiloh _ was honorable. So, I obviously understand
why many Americans find it offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, he issued a statement apparently intended to
correct the impression that he finds the flag offensive, and it was
that most recent statement that appears to align him with the flag
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how I view the flag, I understand both sides,'' he said
in the statement. ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery; others
view it as a symbol of heritage. Personally, I see the Battle Flag
as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said in an interview on Tuesday that McCain had misspoken
on Sunday by not saying the flag was offensive ``to some people.''
He added that McCain has often said in the past that he considers
the flag a symbol of heritage, but had never issued a formal,
written statement of his position before. Several political
reporters in South Carolina confirmed that they had heard McCain
describe the flag as a symbol of heritage over the past year.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Bush has several pro-flag supporters in his camp, as well,
including Charlie Condon, the state attorney general, who is
co-chairman of the South Carolina Bush campaign. But none are as
well known for their ideology as is Quinn, whose quarterly magazine
has become a leading journal of the notion that the Civil War was
not fought over slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of the magazine, the cover of which shows a man
reading an Uncle Remus book to his grandchildren, contains a list
of the 15 best Southern books of all time. Though the list includes
William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren and Margaret Mitchell, most
are apologias for the Southern cause, and none is by a black
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine takes the view that the flag should be regarded
as a symbol of heritage, rather than slavery,'' said Quinn. ``Many
Southerners believe that there are positive aspects to Southern
history, without having to link everything to slavery. Taking down
the flag or hiding it or treating it in a dishonorable way turns
the banner over to the racists on both sides. It helps define the
flag as something ugly and evil rather than something that
memorializes the heroism of these young men who fell for the South,
most of whom were not slaveowners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the word heritage means something very different to black
residents of South Carolina, most of whom do not vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word kind of like `choice' or `life' in abortion, a
code word to mean certain things that people don't want to come
right out and say,'' said Dr. Lonnie Randolph Jr., president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP, who oversees the group's economic
sanctions against the state. ``Of course the flag has to do with
heritage, but it's a heritage of white supremacy and racism. Too
many people are in denial about what the heritage really is.''

COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE NOT DRAWN TO POLITICS OR VOTING, POLL SHOWS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ College students say they give their time to help
the homeless, tutor children and clean up polluted streams, but
they tell poll takers that their interest in public service does
not extend to voting or talking about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of college students polled by the Mellman
Group last November said they had done volunteer work in such areas
as helping the homeless, teaching, religious service, social work,
the environment and health care. Forty-one percent said they had
volunteered more than 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent said they would consider spending some of
their lives working in education, and 63 percent said they could
work for a nonprofit group. Only 25 percent said they would
consider spending time in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Students interviewed Tuesday said they found more immediate
rewards from volunteering than in political activity. Michele
Chang, an 18-year-old math and applied science student at UCLA,
said politics was more remote to her than a program working with
children to encourage them to go to college. She said she was
giving back, after someone had done the same for her.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie D'Amboise, a 19-year-old student at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst who tutors fifth-grade girls in science
and math, said, ``I know a lot of people don't have a good
understanding of math and science and I do, so I like to help
out.'' As to voting, she said: ``It's like, well, more distant. I'm
one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for the Panetta Institute, which is
headed by Leon V. Panetta, former congressman and White House chief
of staff, and it found only a quarter of the students said they
discussed political issues as often as three or four times a week.
A third said government had no influence on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, whose institute in California promotes student
involvement in government, said the students' sense of government
was unfortunate and mistaken. But he said he was optimistic that if
they did involve themselves in careers in education or health, they
would become voters once they saw how important government was to
those activities.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said required volunteer work in high school and college
was an important element. ``Someone has to push them on stage
before they learn they enjoy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students interviewed offered caustic views of
politics. Matthew Flaherty, a 19-year-old at Boston University,
said, ``There is just such a negative connotation to politicians
and the whole field of politics that it doesn't interest me much to
get involved in such a hypocritical situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that negative view came from experience. Another
Boston University student, Kim Haberlin, said she had interned at
the Massachusetts State House, and ``Watching the state rep I work
with, all he does is talk and have lunch and golf and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mellman, head of the organization that polled 800
students by telephone, said the college students were in fact less
alienated from government than the population generally. Forty-nine
of the students, but 71 percent of the nation's population in 1996,
said they believed ``government is run by a few big interests
looking out for themselves,'' rather than ``for the benefit of all
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And 41 percent of the students, compared to 27 percent of the
public as whole, said they felt the government in Washington could
be trusted to do the right thing at least most of the time. The
poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mellman, citing the volunteerism and the interest in careers
like education, said American college students were
``public-spirited and civic-minded'' and ``less cynical, less
alienated than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Actual voting levels are very hard hard to determine, as almost
all polls find wildly inflated voting claims. Fifty-seven percent
of the students who were old enough to vote in 1996 said they had
voted then.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate and an expert on voting rates, said that among
18-to-24-year-olds with four years of college at the time, 49
percent had voted. Of those with one to three years then, 39
percent had voted, while among high school graduates in that age
bracket, 22 percent had.
</P>
<P>
   Some students saw both voting and volunteering as important.
Jeff Belizaire, president of the Black Student Union at the
University of Massachusetts, said, ``I'm here because other people
volunteered their time and services to mentor me,'' and works at a
prison ministry. As to politics, he said he was involved ``big
time.'' He added, ``What makes this country run is money and
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student there, Tekura Campbell, 20, said she was sure
she would vote ``because if you don't, then you can't complain
about anything that's going on in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But a response that was both more typical and consistent with
the survey came from Kristin Hightower, a 24-year-old music student
at UCLA, who said she participated in a church group that sings and
performs at hospitals and convalescent homes. She said she thought
she could have more impact as a volunteer than in politics.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I guess if I had the time for it, and I felt it was
a worthy cause, or a candidate I really supported, I guess I would.
It's mainly a time issue.'' She said volunteering ``is an influence
in a more immediate way, whereas in politics it's a little slower
in getting to the individual.''

CBS NEWS CREATING IMAGES THAT DO NOT REALLY EXIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were watching the CBS Evening News broadcast
live from Times Square on New Year's Eve, you might have seen a
billboard advertising CBS News out in the square behind Dan Rather.
You might have looked at the well-placed billboard and wondered
just exactly how it was that CBS was able to place its ad so
fortuitously.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it didn't. The billboard and the advertisement for
CBS did not exist. The image was digitally imported onto the live
CBS broadcast, obliterating an existing, real billboard _ the NBC
jumbotron underneath the New Year's ball and a Budweiser ad _ using
electronic insertion technology.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting digital images has become increasingly common in
sports and entertainment programming, usually to insert advertising
and corporate logos , but has generally been considered out of line
in the world of news shows, a type of programming in which the
assumption of reality is considered sacrosanct, and not informing
viewers is considered a breach of journalistic guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News, however, is using the technology as part of a broad
agreement signed last year with a technology company, Princeton
Video Image. The technology has been used regularly on ``The Early
Show'' and the news magazine ``48 Hours'' and has been used
intermittently on ``The Evening News,'' according to Eric Shapiro,
the director of the CBS Evening News and CBS News special events.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, news show logos that appear real are being inserted
on the sides of structures like the General Motors building, on the
back of a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park, in the fountain
outside the Plaza Hotel and, on Tuesday's ``Early Show'' broadcast,
in the center of Wollman Rink in Central Park. In some instances,
the logo clearly resembles a large billboard advertising CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the technology is part of a multi-year deal that CBS
has signed with Princeton Video Image to provide branding services
for a variety of CBS programs. ``The Early Show'' has been the most
ardent user of the technology and has been using it almost every
day since the show's debut on Nov. 1, at times making it appear
that a large promotional billboard several stories high is attached
to the General Motors building, where the show is aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for some way to brand the neighborhood with
the CBS logo,'' said Steve Friedman, the executive producer of
``The Early Show.'' ``It's a great way to do things without ruining
the neighborhood. Every day we have a different way of using it,
whether it's logos or outlines. And we haven't even scratched the
surface of its uses yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said that the practice did not press the boundaries of
ethical guidelines for the CBS news division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not distort the content of the news,'' he said, and
compared the use of the technology to earlier visual innovations.
``I remember the hue and cry when people started to use graphics on
news.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News' deal with the Princeton company was reported in the
Jan. 3 issue of the trade magazine Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said that the news division examines each case
individually before putting the virtual logos on air. ``The
technique, I find, works best if you put it someplace where there
is intended to be something,'' he said. ``If it feels that it is
not correct to use it, then we obviously won't use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, knew about the use of the virtual technology
during the broadcast and did not protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did not know in advance,'' Shapiro said. ``These are
not things he needs to worry about. He spends most of his time
worrying about the content of the broadcast. But as a production
technique he was most certainly aware that it was happening around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather did not return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday
night. Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson, anchors of ``The Early
Show,'' could not be reached for comment
</P>
<P>
   Harry Jessell, the editor of Broadcasting and Cable magazine,
said that the technology raised questions with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does raise some ethical questions for CBS,'' he
said. ``You would think that a TV news organization would not
tamper with video, especially live video. Viewers should be able to
rely on the fact that what they are seeing is actually there.''
</P>
<P>
   Network news has flirted with similar technological issues
before. In 1994, the use of a fake backdrop caused an outcry when
the ABC journalist Cokie Roberts appeared in front of a picture of
Capitol Hill. Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor, introduced a
report from Ms. Roberts and said that she was reporting from
Capitol Hill; Ms. Roberts, wearing a coat, appeared in front of
what looked like the Capitol. But without the knowledge of network
viewers or even Jennings, Ms. Roberts was actually inside the ABC
News Washington bureau with a photographic image of the Capitol
projected behind her. Ms. Roberts and Rick Kaplan, then the
executive producer of ``World News Tonight'' and now the president
of CNN, were both reprimanded and the network apologized on air.
</P>
<P>
   Other news organizations have said that they do not use similar
digital technology on news broadcasts,
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC News, said that ABC uses
similar virtual technology on Monday Night Football and on other
network entertainment programming, but that it has not used it in
news programming.

 &HT;    Jags' edge seems to be slipping as Dolphins surge
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin doesn't need a history
lesson as his team prepares for Saturday's NFL divisional playoff
game against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the fifth-seeded Jaguars were 15-point
underdogs when they beat the top-seeded Broncos 30-27 at Mile High
Stadium in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coughlin will experience it from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars are the AFC's top seed and had the league's best
record this season at 14-2. The Dolphins (9-7) are a sixth seed
after taking a back door into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll have to remind them,'' Coughlin said.
``They know how good Miami is. I don't know that we'll go into the
history. It's important to realize that every team left playing has
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who lost five of their past six games this season,
weren't given much of a chance in the playoffs. But Miami traveled
across the country and beat Seattle 20-17 in a wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who won their first road playoff game since 1972,
also became the first AFC sixth seed to win since the playoffs were
expanded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Against Jacksonville, Miami will try to become the first No. 6
seed to make it to a conference championship; five NFC No. 6 seeds
have won their playoff opener, but all lost in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the playoffs, and we know anything's possible,''
Miami safety Shawn Wooden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins might be catching the Jaguars at an opportune time.
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell is questionable for the game
with a sprained left knee, and Pro Bowl offensive tackle Tony
Boselli will miss the playoffs with torn knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some things that are an Achilles' heel,'' Jaguars
tackle Leon Searcy said. ``But who doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville might not be as formidable as its record indicates.
The Jaguars played the league's second-weakest schedule, behind
only St. Louis, and didn't beat a team with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami played the toughest slate of the 12 teams
qualifying for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won 14 games this year, and they have a lot of talent at
every position,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``The strength
of schedule is one thing, but in this league, if you win 14 games,
it doesn't make any difference who you win them against. The
difference is we won nine games and they won 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides injuries, the Jaguars also struggled in their pass rush
and in their red-zone scoring late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 of the Jaguars' 57 sacks came in the final eight games
of the season. The lack of a pass rush also resulted in fewer
interceptions. After intercepting 13 passes in the first eight
games, the Jags had only six in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They also had problems on offense. Of the 12 playoff teams, the
Jaguars had the third-lowest scoring percentage inside opponents'
20-yard line. Jacksonville scored 77.8 percent of the time, and
scored only 29 touchdowns in 63 trips inside the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got several areas that have to be better,'' Coughlin
said. ``And we've spent a lot of time working on those. Those
things that we've struggled with will have to be better in the
playoffs.''

 &HT;    NFL Notebook: Johnson fined by league
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Washington Redskins guard Tre Johnson was fined
$50,000 by the NFL Tuesday, but the Pro Bowl player won't be
suspended for any playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of 23 players _ 15 Redskins and eight Detroit
Lions _ who were fined $154,000 for a fight during Washington's
27-13 victory in an NFC wild-card game last Saturday. It is an NFL
record total for fines, surpassing the $145,500 levied against 35
Pittsburgh and Houston players for a fight in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was suspended for the first game of next season for
fighting and inadvertently hitting an official.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said Johnson's fine was determined in two parts: $30,000
for striking back judge Bill Leavy on the head, and $20,000 for
what the NFL called his ``extensive involvement in the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After deliberately engaging in conduct that directly violated
the playing rules by fighting,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
wrote in a letter to Johnson, ``you then attempted to resume
fighting after order had been restored. As a result, you struck a
game official in what can only be described as knowing and
deliberate conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight started when Lions linebacker Stephen Boyd intercepted
Brad Johnson's pass. During Boyd's return, defensive end Robert
Porcher knocked down the Redskins quarterback with a block. Brad
Johnson, who later called the block a ``cheap shot,'' threw Porcher
to the ground, and the two started to wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   After order was restored, Tre Johnson tried to hit a Detroit
player with his right arm. But he struck Leavy, who was trying to
restrain him.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson was fined $12,500 for fighting; Porcher, $10,000.
Five other players were fined $7,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Four Redskins were fined $5,000 for coming off the bench. Others
were fined $3,000 or $1,500 for ``unnecessarily entering a fight
area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone goes after your quarterback, you've got to
protect him,'' said Washington guard Keith Sims, who was fined
$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders fire top aide Shaw
</P>
<P>
   How does one of the league's hottest assistant coaches end up in
the unemployment line? Ask Raiders defensive coordinator Willie
Shaw, who was abruptly fired Tuesday by coach Jon Gruden.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who last week interviewed for the Patriots' vacant head
coaching position, led one of the league's best defenses the past
two seasons. Oakland's defense ranked No. 13 in 1999 and fifth in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders told Shaw his contract wouldn't be renewed on
Monday, just one day shy of his 56th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Cost-cutting Niners
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh said he's asked
quarterback Steve Young, receiver Jerry Rice and several other key
veterans to take substantial pay cuts next season. The 49ers are
trying to trim about $24 million from their salary cap by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot continue operating under the current format,'' Walsh
said. ``It's a very serious matter, so serious that every player on
our team must be evaluated and scrutinized. That's just where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ken Norton Jr., offensive guard Ray Brown, safety Tim
McDonald, and center Chris Dalman also have been asked to
renegotiate their contracts and reduce their salaries, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   While the 49ers hope to keep all six players, Walsh conceded
that might not be realistic. Under their current contracts, the six
veterans count $28.5 million against next season's projected $62.2
million cap.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said no more than 10 players would have their contracts
restructured. That practice is what put San Francisco in its
current crisis, he said, by pro-rating large signing bonuses to
subsequent years in the deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about some big-time salary cuts,'' Walsh said.
``We're going at it right now, but it's going to be tough. We could
be the Titanic right now, sitting on the bridge and just sailing
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell returns to practice
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell returned to practice Tuesday
and said his sprained left knee is about ``95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell saw only limited action in his first practice since
spraining the medial collateral ligament in a 41-14 loss at
Tennessee on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for me this week is to build up, do some
today, do more tomorrow, then hopefully get the majority of the
reps by Thursday,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said Brunell's practice regimen
over the rest of the week would depend on how his knee responds.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren seeking help
</P>
<P>
   After his team collapsed in the second half of the season and
lost to Miami in an AFC wild-card game, Seattle coach Mike Holmgren
said his top priority is hiring a defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is seeking a replacement for Fritz Shurmur, who arrived
in Seattle with Holmgren from Green Bay. But Shurmur left the team
after he was diagnosed with cancer that ultimately claimed his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle linebackers coach Jim Lind directed the Seahawks'
defensive this season, but was never named coordinator. Holmgren
said he'll probably interview former Patriots coach Pete Carroll,
who was fired earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to do in a week,'' Holmgren said. ``If
I'm going to do it, let's do it. Now can I do it in a week? I don't
know. I probably can't do it in a week, but I want to get it done
as soon as I can because if it's not Jim there could be a change in
defensive philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign or not to sign
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said he'd like to keep receiver Joey Galloway, who
missed the first half of the season in a bitter contract dispute.
When Galloway finally signed, he was ineffective and out of shape,
catching only 23 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who has played five seasons in Seattle, is expected to
become an unrestricted free agent. The Seahawks could keep
Galloway, a first-rounder from Ohio State in 1995, by declaring him
their ``franchise player.''
</P>
<P>
   If the team does that, Seattle would have to give him a one-year
contract for the average salary of the top five wideouts in the
league. If another team signed Galloway, they'd have to give
Seattle a pair of first-round picks. Or the Seahawks could sign
Galloway and then trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's here and he can be the player that he is,''
Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Two free agents who probably won't return to Seattle are
defensive tackle Sam Adams and defensive end Phillip Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who played at Georgia, could be a good fit for the
Falcons, who might be seeking a pair of ends to replace veterans
Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau. Mainly a pass rusher for the
Bulldogs, Daniels has added considerable weight and is effective
against the run. He had a career-high nine sacks this season.

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the Supreme Court wanted to underscore the
constitutional vulnerability of the Violence Against Women Act, it
could hardly have orchestrated a more convincing demonstration than
it put on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the justices open their session by declaring, in a
separate case argued three months ago, that Congress lacked
authority to make the federal law against age discrimination
binding on the states. But then, during arguments on the
constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, members of the
same five-justice majority in the age discrimination case made
abundantly clear their deep skepticism about whether Congress had
an adequate basis for opening federal courts to suits by victims of
violence ``motivated by gender'' against their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, just
before the Supreme Court set itself on its current course of
subjecting to searching scrutiny any congressional action that
could conceivably impinge on state sovereignty or traditional
prerogatives. In a sense, the statute and the court's growing list
of federalism rulings have been on an inevitable collision course
that ended in the courtroom on Tuesday morning, with little
evidence that the 5-4 states' rights majority would shift course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your approach would justify a federal remedy for alimony,
child support, even contract disputes,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said disapprovingly to Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman,
who was arguing the government's appeal from a ruling that the
law's civil damages provision was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Some students of the court have speculated that O'Connor's
record of solicitude for women's interests might, in this case,
trump her demonstrated commitment to keeping federal power within
distinct boundaries. But she gave little sign that she saw this
case as in any way different from the other federalism cases,
including the age discrimination case in which she announced the
court's majority opinion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act case is an appeal by a former
Virginia college student, and by the Clinton administration on her
behalf, from a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in
Richmond that barred her from using the law to sue two fellow
students, football players who she contended had raped her in her
dormitory room. The woman, Christy Brzonkala, sued after Virginia
Polytechnic Institute took no action against one of the men and
gave the other a deferred suspension that permitted him to keep
playing varsity football.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law has several other provisions, including a criminal
section that provides for federal prosecution of interstate crimes
of gender-motivated violence. The court last year refused to hear a
constitutional challenge to the criminal provision.
</P>
<P>
   The section at issue on Tuesday in U.S. vs. Morrison, No. 99-5,
providing for private civil suits for damages, does not depend on
whether a defendant has crossed state lines, because Congress
wanted to provide a remedy for violence in or near homes. The
absence of an interstate ``hook,'' as O'Connor described it, is a
decided liability before a court that has taken a limited view of
Congress' power to act under its authority to regulate interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Both Waxman and Julie Goldscheid, representing Ms. Brzonkala on
behalf of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, told the
justices that violence against women has a substantial impact on
interstate commerce by deterring women from taking certain jobs or
continuing their education. ``Gender-based violence reduces
national productivity'' and remained ``one of the most persistent
barriers to women's full participation in the economy,'' Ms.
Goldscheid said.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the civil damages provision, the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said the law did not come within Congress'
power to regulate interstate commerce because it did not address
commercial activity. The court on Tuesday appeared wary of adopting
quite such a hard and fast rule, particularly after Michael E.
Rosman, representing the defendants in Ms. Brzonkala's lawsuit,
Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, said that in his view,
Congress lacked constitutional authority to prohibit possession of
narcotics for personal use because the activity was not commercial.
</P>
<P>
   However, even under a more elastic definition of activity that
affects the economy, the justices appeared dubious about accepting
the congressional findings on the economic impact of violence
against women. There was considerable sparring during the argument
over whether and to what extent courts should defer to Congress'
factual predicates for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices find the Violence Against Women Act provision to
be invalid under Congress' commerce authority, they could
nonetheless uphold it under Congress' authority to enforce the
equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, a basis that the
4th Circuit also rejected. Rosman, the defendants' lawyer, argued
on Tuesday that the 14th amendment, which governs only official
action, could not be a basis for a law that applies to private
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The law's defenders argue that the statute is aimed at the
failure of states to provide adequate remedies for violence against
women, an aspect of official action, or inaction, that is
appropriately the subject of legislation under the 14th Amendment.
However, Ms. Goldscheid's and Waxman's time at the podium ran out
before they could address this aspect of their argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rosman, general counsel of the Center for Individual Rights, a
conservative public interest law firm here, warned the justices
that if they upheld this law, ``Congress could pass virtually any
law'' and ``relegate the states to a trivial and unimportant role
in our federal structure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged that depiction. ``What is
the clash here?'' she asked. She said Congress' goal was not to
displace state authority but ``just to provide an alternate remedy,
an alternate forum.'' She continued: ``We are just complementing
what the states do. Why can't Congress do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The power to regulate is the power to pre-empt,'' Rosman
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg persisted, noting that ``we have so many parallels in
discrimination legislation,'' with both the states and the federal
government barring discrimination in employment and in public
accommodations. Why can't the Violence Against Women Act coexist
with parallel state laws, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is not commerce,'' Rosman replied. ``This is
violence, interpersonal violence, the kind of thing states have had
as their exclusive province ever since the start of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act has generally been welcomed on
the state level, with 36 states joining a brief in this case in
support of the law. Only one, Alabama, filed a brief asking the
court to declare the provision unconstitutional.

<P>
   SHALI, Russia _ When Gen. Aleksandr Bespalov became the Russian
military commandant in this Chechen town, his job was to restore
electricity, gas and other basic services. So what happened on
Sunday was most unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of rebels rushed through Shali, encircled Bespalov's
office and brazenly presented him with a demand: The Russian troops
in Shali had to hand over their weapons, raise the Chechen flag and
leave.
</P>
<P>
   After unleashing a punishing barrage and engaging in furious
firefights, Russian troops regained control of the town, and the
rebels vanished _ some of them fading, Russian commanders suspect,
back into the town's population.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Russian officers provided the first on-the-scene
account of the fighting that has alarmed authorities in Moscow and
has prompted a review of military strategy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused on measures to be taken in Argun and Shali,'' Igor
Sergeyev, Russia's defense minister, said after a meeting with the
acting president, Vladimir V. Putin. ``We cannot allow such a
situation to happen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel offensive has also raised the question whether
Chechnya can ever be made secure for Russian forces. Tuesday,
Shali's streets were filled with young men _ the remnants, the
Russians suspect, of a rebel band that briefly controlled the town.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise offensive began on Sunday morning when hundreds of
militants made coordinated attacks on Shali and Argun, two towns
near Grozny, Chechnya's capital, that the Russians have long
claimed to control.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks appeared to be an effort to divert the Russians'
attention from the siege of Grozny and shake the confidence of the
Russian troops by demonstrating that no part of Chechnya is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials still do not know exactly how the rebel force
was assembled. The military claims to have isolated the rebels in
Grozny and in the Chechen highlands to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear where they came from,'' Maj. Gen. Sergei A.
Makarov, the commander of the Eastern Group of Russian Forces in
Chechnya, told reporters. ``They just popped up among the
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   One Russian official said that two groups of militants appear to
have joined forces. The members of one group passed themselves off
as civilians, made their way past Russian checkpoints and armed
themselves from secret caches in Shali. The other group was drawn
from residents of the town, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Yevgeny Sidorov, the deputy commander of a nearby brigade,
said Russian forces are increasingly plagued by Chechens who assume
the role of civilians during the day and fight by night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say exactly how many militants there are,'' Sidorov
said. ``It all depends on whether you count them in the day or at
night. It is not written on somebody's forehead that he is a
militant.''
</P>
<P>
   The raid on Shali, which is 15 miles southeast of Grozny, was
one of several coordinated assaults behind the Russian lines. The
rebels also attacked Argun, which is five miles east of Grozny, and
other targets near Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian commanders tried to rush reinforcements to the
battle the troops were attacked by rebels hiding along the rutted
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Shali bore the signs of the fight. A ring of Russian
armor sealed the town. A machine-gunner sat in a trench, his
weapons aimed toward Shali.
</P>
<P>
   A column of bedraggled refugees marched toward the town. They
were returning from a funeral outside of town and were anxious
about what awaited them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not good,'' said Lechi Khadzhiyev, a
67-year-old Chechen. ``It is not our fault. We have been walking
miles on foot and have nothing to do with any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who did, however, had a plan. The goal of the rebels was
to chase the Russians out of town by seizing Bespalov's
headquarters, storm the headquarters of the Russian militia and
take over a school.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the Russians by surprise, the rebels moved through the
city and presented the commandant with an ultimatum: surrender and
hoist the green Chechen flag within one hour or face a rebel
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Bespalov rejected the ultimatum, and the Russians used their
equalizer: massive firepower. They unleashed a furious barrage,
which they claim killed about 50 rebels. Russian defenders at the
commandant's office and the militia headquarters held firm until
reinforcements arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since yesterday the situation has been stabilizing,'' Bespalov
said, adding that he was meeting with village elders to encourage
them to prevent the rebels from entering the town.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians clearly did not have control of the region.
Bespalov described the fighting over a field telephone to reporters
just outside the town. With rebel snipers prowling Shali's streets,
it was still somewhat dangerous for the commandant to venture out
of his headquarters or for a large group of reporters to be bused
in.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces claim to have killed as many as 150 rebels while
suffering minimal losses. Seeking to play down the rebel attacks,
Russian military officials did not even mention the fighting at
Shali and Argun in Tuesday morning's briefing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kremlin, however, there was evidence of concern. Putin
convened a meeting of military and security officials to discuss
ways to prevent a repeat attack behind the Russian front lines and
regain the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``New proposals have been put forward, which Putin considered an
approved,'' Sergeyev, the defense minister, said. ``The first task
is stabilizing the settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev did not provide details. Later, Russian officers said
they would be detaining and checking all young Chechens males over
the age of 10. And they vowed to carry out more thorough
house-to-house searches in Shali and other towns under Russian
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in
the North Caucasus, said the rebel attacks in Shali and Argun are
``the result of mistakes made in mopping up the previously
liberated settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev added: ``The situation has radically changed.''

   She had succeeded her husband of 29 years, William Loeb, who
bought the papers in the 1940s and died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The papers' influence stems partly from the outspoken role they
play in their state's widely watched presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mourn her passing,'' said Steve Forbes, a Republican
presidential contender who has won the endorsement of the
newspapers. ``Let us be guided by her spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Loeb could be pungently partisan. On the day when President
Clinton visited New Hampshire soon after his acquittal on
impeachment charges, a front-page editorial, written by her, had
the headline, ``Don't Come Back, Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a native of Los Angeles and attended Scripps College in
Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Her survivors include two daughters, Nackey Scagliotti, of
Boothbay Harbor, Maine, and Edith Tomasko of Hopkinton, N.H.; three
brothers, Robert Scripps, of Fredericksburg, Texas, Charles E.
Scripps, of Cincinnati, and Samuel H. Scripps, of Rhinebeck, N.Y.;
and three grandchildren

CLINTON TO PROPOSE EXPANSION OF TAX CREDITS FOR WORKING POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to propose a substantial
expansion in the program of tax credits for the working poor on
Wednesday as he kicks off a broader effort to focus this year's
federal budget debate on issues related to low-income people, White
House officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will call for a $2-billion-a-year increase in the earned
income tax credit, which provides an annual payment, often
thousands of dollars, to 19 million families living below or just
above the poverty line, they said. The program is currently
budgeted at $26 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, the first big expansion of the program since 1993,
is intended not to cover more families, but to increase the benefit
to many recipients by hundreds of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal faces an uncertain reception in Congress. The tax
credit has a history of bipartisan support. Because it rewards
work, many moderate Republicans and most Democrats back it as a
complement to the 1996 overhaul of the welfare system that has
pushed many people into the labor force for the first time. Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican presidential
candidate, defended the program last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But many conservative Republicans, especially in the House, see
the credit as a welfare payment in disguise and as a magnet for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposed expansion of the tax credit is mainly
intended to help families with more than two children, a group that
has seen poverty rates remain stubbornly high as rates have fallen
among smaller families.
</P>
<P>
   While overall child poverty has fallen to 18.9 percent from 22.7
percent in 1993, the rate among families with three or more
children, 28.5 percent, is far higher than the 11.9 percent poverty
rate among families with one or two children.
</P>
<P>
   To address that problem, Clinton's proposal calls for increasing
the maximum credit for families with three or more children by
$500, to $4,491. The administration said 2.1 million families would
benefit from the change.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increase, to be announced by the president in a
speech to a group of centrist Democrats in Washington, is part of
an emerging debate over how the nation should put its current
prosperity to use.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the plan would be a major component
of a wide-ranging agenda that Clinton will lay out in his State of
the Union address this month and in his budget request next month.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative will address issues ranging from health care and
preschool education to the creation of jobs and the gap in computer
use between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the nation is enjoying the longest spell of
economic growth in its history, and with the Treasury overflowing
with surplus tax revenues, members of both parties have been
increasingly focusing their attention on what can be done for the
people the good times have left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican presidential contenders, Bush and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona have been sparring over whose tax plan does more
to help the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al
Gore for the Democratic nomination, has made reducing child poverty
and improving access to health care the central planks of his
platform. Gore has long advocated an expansion of the earned income
tax credit and other steps to fight poverty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal also reduces the so-called marriage penalty
faced by many couples whose benefits would be higher if they were
single. It would raise the income level at which married workers
begin to lose the tax credit, to $14,480 from the current $13,030.
More than 1.3 million families would get an average increase in
their credit of $250 a year, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would further increase the benefit for many families by
reducing the rate at which the credit is phased out as a worker's
income rises. Currently, families with two or more children face a
phaseout in which the credit is reduced by 21 cents for every
dollar they earn above a maximum level. Under the proposal, the
phaseout reduction would decline to 19 cents for every dollar
earned. The change would apply to 5.4 million families.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also try to encourage low-income workers to
save for retirement by exempting contributions to 401(k) programs
and Individual Retirement Accounts from the calculation determining
how fast the credit is reduced as income rises.
</P>
<P>
   The changes could have a substantial effect on the finances of
families living week to week on minimum wage paychecks or slightly
more, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple with three children, earning $15,000 a year,
would see its annual credit rise by $815, to $4,392 from $3,577,
according to an example provided by the White House. A married
couple with two children and $20,000 in earnings would see its
benefit increase by $416, to $2,940 from $2,524.

NEW OWNER FINALLY GIVES JETS A HINT OF STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (With FBN-JETS-SALE)  
 (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells will meet with the new owner of the Jets, Robert
Wood Johnson IV, as early as Wednesday to begin the process of
naming a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Johnson first will ask Parcells what it would take
for him to return as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting Johnson,'' Parcells said
Tuesday when he learned that Johnson had won the battle with
Charles F. Dolan with a $635 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose bid is expected to be approved by National
Football League owners next week in New York, said Tuesday in a
statement, ``I do intend to have preliminary conversations with
both Steve Gutman and Bill Parcells at the earliest possible
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Johnson temporarily brought stability to the
unsettled organization, which has been reeling since last week when
a stunning series of unexpected events _ within 24 hours Parcells
stepped down as coach, and then, shockingly, so did Bill Belichick,
his successor.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue's office to try to untangle the the Belichick dispute.
Belichick, along with his attorney, Neil Cornrich, will meet face
to face with Steve Gutman, the Jets' president, to discuss the
validity of Belichick's contract with the Jets. Belichick has three
years left on his six-year contract as an assistant coach, which
the Jets say was updated as recently as 10 months ago. Belichick
contends that the contract he signed to succeed Parcells is invalid
and that he is free to coach for any team.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership is just one part of the unsettled Jets' murky
situation. Players and assistant coaches are unsure what their
roles will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate for something like to have to happen now, particularly
the way it might be looking up for us,'' strong safety Victor Green
said Tuesday. He was a believer in the defensive system espoused by
Belichick, the defensive coordinator who also tutored the defensive
backs. The Jets had won their final four games and seven of their
last nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep things together,'' strong safety Victor
Green said Tuesday. ``It's hard to keep your free agents when you
can't even keep your coaches together.''
</P>
<P>
   The free agency period is scheduled to begin Feb. 12 but might
be pushed back to March 2 because of contract negotiations with the
Players Association. The Jets' key free agents are former Pro Bowl
linebacker Mo Lewis, and the emerging cornerback, Marcus Coleman.
Johnson will have to know how much money it will take to keep his
players, and how much others will cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting patiently,'' said Green, sounding impatient.
``I'll be watching on TV like everyone else. There's a lot of
anticipation. A new owner might bring in a coach he already has in
mind. And a new coach would implement his own coaches. I might be
gone. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   For linebacker Chad Cascadden, a big fan of Al Groh, his
position coach, the uncertainty even extends to his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting married in May,'' he said Tuesday. ``And the date
we picked was around the same time we had a minicamp last year. And
now, with a new coach coming in, I just don't know if he wants the
same dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cascadden, tackle Jason Fabini and running back Leon Johnson
were at the Jets' training camp complex Tuesday when they heard the
news about Johnson's successful bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only ones there today,'' Fabini said. ``The three
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   All suffered season-ending knee injuries and are working out
daily. They saw Parcells earlier in the day, as they usually did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask what his plans were,'' said Fabini. ``It's not
like we discuss the direction of the team.'' But Fabini said he
hoped that Johnson's arrival ``leads to the team finding a new
coach. I have a feeling it will come from inside, but you never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of an outsider coaching the club has some players
``concerned,'' Cascadden admitted, but added, ``I don't think
anybody's up in arms. I think people are concerned about where the
football team is headed. I don't think people are running through
the streets, but we're concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Fabini, ``more guys are worried about who's
going to coach the team than who's going to own the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's purchase brings stability to an organization that has
been reeling since for more than a week:
</P>
<P>
   _ Parcells stepped down as coach, surprising most of his players
and coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Belichick, his hand-picked successor, by contract became the
head coach while Parcells remained in charge of the team's football
operations, a duty Parcells claimed he would yield to Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   _ A day later Belichick quit, citing uncertainty about his role
with whoever would become the new owner, as well as how Parcells
figured in the operation. Parcells immediately said he was adamant
about not returning as coach but would wait until the naming of a
new owner before deciding on a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Belichick filed a grievance with the league claiming his
contract was invalid. It prohibits him from seeking employment with
another team as long as he is under a Jets' contract.

STOCKS SLIDE IN TURBULENT SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply in heavy, volatile trading
Tuesday as rising long-term interest rates helped to persuade
investors to sell equities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rising bond yields, traders and analysts said, a
more sober assessment of the prospects for a combined America
Online and Time Warner dragged down the share prices of both
companies and those of other big Internet companies. And there was
skittishness in advance of Yahoo's fourth-quarter profit numbers,
which were released after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the declines were mostly based on developments
in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks ignored the bond market until midday, and then after
bonds were down about a point, stocks seemed to care,'' said Greg
Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities. ``We
are going to have a lot of volatility because a lot of people in
the stock market are saying, `The Fed is out to get us.'''
</P>
<P>
   No economic reports were released Tuesday that influenced bond
prices. Smith said bond traders were selling securities to position
themselves for forthcoming sales of Treasury and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 61.12 points, or 0.5
percent, to 11,511.08. Strong performances by Intel and American
Express were more than offset by declines in issues like Microsoft,
J.P. Morgan and International Paper. The blue-chip index had set
records in its three previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index continued the pattern of triple-digit
point moves that have been its hallmark so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Big declines in favorites like CMGI, Cisco Systems and JDS
Uniphase pulled the Nasdaq down by 128.48 points, or 3.2 percent,
to 3,921.19. It was the fifth-biggest daily point drop in Nasdaq
history and came a day after the index rose 167 points, its biggest
one-day point gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also slumped, as both
America Online and Time Warner Inc. fell sharply. At the close, the
index was down 19.04 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,438.56. Small
stocks were also hit hard: the Russell 2000 index of smaller
company stocks fell 9.28 points, or 1.8 percent, to 492.61.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America Online, which were weak Monday after the
company's plan to acquire of Time Warner was announced, fell
sharply Tuesday, dropping 6}, to 64{. And Time Warner, which soared
Monday, fell 5, to 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality may be setting in,'' said Robert Froelich, chief
investment strategist at Scudder Kemper Investments. ``This deal
will be a successful deal and will provide a blueprint for what
will happen in the future. But it won't be easy, and some people
may be saying it will take a year or two to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo shares, up sharply Monday, retreated Tuesday before it
released its earnings for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The stock slumped 38 11/16, to 397], before the company posted
earnings that rose elevenfold, exceeding expectations. The company
also said it would split its stock two for one, effective Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, Yahoo jumped as high as 426\ but then
fell back, to 378, after Gary Valenzuela, the company's chief
financial officer, warned investors that Yahoo's revenue growth
rate was not sustainable. During the fourth quarter, Yahoo's
revenues increased to $201 million from $91 million in the period a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results
after the market closes Thursday, was a big winner Tuesday. The
chip maker's stock gained 3 15/16, to 89 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP; Gamble were other Dow gainers.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola rose 2, to 60 13/16. And P&AMP;G advanced 1 13/16, to
117}.
</P>
<P>
   Among Nasdaq stocks, CMGI fell 24|, to 281~. JDS Uniphase
slumped 9 11/16, to 190 11/16. And Amgen shed 5 11/16, to 66 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume remained heavy. One billion shares changed hands
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market
was 1.65 billion shares, making the session the fifth most active
in the market's history.

POSTAL SERVICE SEEKS 1-CENT RISE IN STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Postal Service's board of governors on Tuesday
proposed raising the price of a first-class stamp by 1 cent, to 34
cents, early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The board also proposed steeper rate increases for priority and
express mail and additional postal services like insurance,
domestic money orders and certified mail.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring a strong protest from the magazine industry, the board
also proposed raising the rate for periodicals by an average of
12.6 percent. Officials of the Magazine Publishers of America,
which represents most consumer magazines, said the average increase
for its members would be about 15 percent, an increase that would
most likely be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increases must undergo a review by the independent
Postal Rate Commission, and are not likely to take effect before
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The last 1-cent increase in the price of first-class stamps took
effect on Jan. 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The price of one- and two-pound priority mail packages would
increase to $3.45 and $3.85, respectively, from $3.20 under the
proposed rate increases, and the cost of certified mail will
increase to $2.10 from $1.40. Basic insurance costs for postal
services would rise to $1.35 from 85 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The rate commission plans to hold hearings in the next 10 months
for postal service users, suppliers and competitors.

 Alessandra Stanley is chief of the Rome bureau of The New York
Times.  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seated at a corner table at Il Matriciano, one of his
favorite haunts during his dolce vita of the '70s, Roman Polanski
was discussing his desire to make an important, lasting film.
Almost impatiently, he explained that his latest release, ``The
Ninth Gate,'' was not it.
</P>
<P>
   ```Ninth Gate' is fun, it's nice, I think it's a good movie, but
after all, what is it about?'' asked Polanski, 66, the Polish-born
director whose repertory includes ``Repulsion,'' ``Rosemary's
Baby'' and ``Chinatown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like every other movie that is made nowadays. It may be
different in style, but it doesn't make any important statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``The Ninth Gate,'' an occult thriller opening March
17 that features satanic rituals, exotic locales and gruesome
deaths, is not even very nice. Polanski jokingly described it as
``an advertisement for hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a novel by the Spanish writer Arturo Perez-Reverte,
the film stars Johnny Depp as a brooding, Scotch-swilling,
chain-smoking scavenger of rare books; Frank Langella as a rich,
literally demonic book collector; and Lena Olin as a
devil-worshiping society hostess, all of them seeking a key to
``the ninth gate,'' which, perhaps not surprisingly, leads to
Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuelle Seigner, the French actress who is Polanski's wife,
plays a mysterious guardian angel. She also starred in two previous
Polanski films, ``Frantic,'' a 1988 thriller starring Harrison
Ford, and ``Bitter Moon,'' a 1992 movie about sexual obsession gone
awry.
</P>
<P>
   Together since 1985, the couple live in Paris and have two small
children, and it is obvious that Polanski relishes late fatherhood,
describing with amused pride his 6-year-old daughter's fascination
with ``Dance With the Vampires,'' a 1997 musical performed in
Vienna, and based on his 1967 film, ``The Fearless Vampire
Killers.'' ``She has seen it already 10 times,'' he said. ``She
plays the tunes on the piano and sings the songs, doing shows at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife called him from Paris on his cell phone during dinner,
and he listened attentively as she described her own dinner with
fashion models from the Paris collections. ``Hmmm, models, eh?'' he
interjected with a laugh. ``I should be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski was more reluctant to discuss his film, which was
poorly received even in France, a nation that tends to be generous
to auteurs. He was in Rome last fall for rehearsals of an Italian
stage version of ``Amadeus,'' which he is directed, and was perhaps
stung by the negative reviews back home. Liberation, called his
movie ``painful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose ``The Ninth Gate,'' he said, because he liked the black
humor and the occult mystery within the plot, because he wanted to
work with Johnny Depp and, most of all, because he could make it
without delay. His last film was ``Death and the Maiden,'' in 1994.
``This was something that could be done quickly, I needed work, I
had to do something. It was too long a time since my last film, a
lot of projects were canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that Polanski _ whose film career spans 40
years and continued successfully even after the horrifying murder
of his wife Sharon Tate by the Manson gang in 1969, and after a
statutory rape charge drove him to become a fugitive from American
justice in 1977 _ feels the kind of restless anxiety that fuels
younger, less-accomplished filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski chose to flee Los Angeles, but he has not shaken off
the pressure of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before in Hollywood, even if you did not make a commercial
success but the film won awards or was well received or the
community had a conviction it was a good film, there would be
satisfaction in the studio,'' he said, describing with nostalgia an
era when he was a dashing celebrity and a respected artist in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Rushes were always seen by the whole studio, there
was pride taken in achievement even if it didn't strike a jackpot.
Now the only thing that counts is the dollar, and on a huge scale.
Nobody cares about a film that pays for itself and brings in a
marginal profit. They all want a bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends say Polanski is merely realistic about an industry
that is still overwhelmingly controlled by Hollywood. ``It is hard
enough to make a hit in the United States; to operate from Paris
makes it all the harder,'' explained Andrew Braunsberg, a
Vienna-based producer and close friend of Polanski's who has worked
with him since the swinging '60s in London. ``Nowadays, 99 percent
of the settings for major films are either in the United States or
outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski's bitterness may also have been prompted by a major
studio's decision to drop one of his more ambitious projects: a
film version of Mikhail Bulgakov's classic 1930s novel set in
Communist Moscow, ``The Master and Margarita,'' which Polanski
wrote himself. He described the script as ``the best thing I ever
managed to adapt _ and it seems like an unadaptable novel,'' but he
said that the project was scrapped soon after the Berlin Wall fell
by executives at Warner Brothers, who decided that Polanski's
budget was too costly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he began working on it more than 10 years ago. ``It is a
good script. It so good that people keep telling me even now to
come back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighed wearily. ``I think it is a bit late now. The book's
Moscow scene has vanished and finally it wasn't that important,''
he said, referring to Soviet communism. ``It did not leave the same
stain on history as the Shoah.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If I were to make something about those times I
would rather go for the Holocaust or my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are entwined. When he was a young boy in the ghetto of
Cracow, his mother was taken away to a concentration camp, where
she died. Shortly afterward, he watched as his father was deported
by the Nazis. His father survived and they were reunited after
Germany surrendered, but Polanski spent the war hiding among
peasants in the countryside.

 ROME: the countryside.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polanski said he had been thinking about making a film about the
Holocaust for many years, but could never find the right material.
He said he turned down an early offer by Steven Spielberg to direct
``Schindler's List'' as ``a very generous offer but not right for
me.'' Nor was he prepared to make a film of his own youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My childhood had no story in a Hollywood sense _ there has to
be a denouement or intrigue,'' he said matter-of-factly. ``Or it
would have to be fictionalized, and then I would have to be
untruthful to the real events.'' He added rather gloomily that he
doubted his childhood would entice major studios. ``You don't know
these people,'' he said with a laugh. ``They would ask, `Yes, but
who is the girl?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the dinner, Polanski called to announce a new
project he had not felt free to discuss in Rome. He had just
reached an agreement to adapt ``The Pianist,'' the autobiography of
Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish composer and pianist who, like
Polanski, narrowly escaped a roundup that sent his family to the
death camps. Szpilman, now 86, spent the war hiding in the
burned-out ruins of Warsaw, scavenging for food and shelter. Toward
the end, he was helped by a German officer who appreciated his
music and who ended up dying in a Soviet POW camp.
</P>
<P>
   Szpilman's extraordinary memoir, written in 1946, was suppressed
by the Communist authorities for 40 years and was finally published
in Germany two years ago and in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the story I've been looking for for years,'' Polanski
said. He said he did not see it as an echo of his personal tale,
despite the haunting similarities, pointing out that Szpilman was
27 and already a famous musician at the start of the war, and that
he lived in the Warsaw ghetto, which was far larger than Cracow's.
``It was very different _ what happened in Warsaw was on an epic
scale,'' he said, adding dryly, ``But I do know the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found the book harrowing, but distanced himself at
the same time. ``It's a very difficult subject to relive, whether
it is your history or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski maintains the same reserve about the crises of his
adult life. Even his autobiography, titled ``Roman,'' which he
published in 1984, is phlegmatic in describing his reaction to the
murder of Sharon Tate, and later the statutory rape charge, which
he vigorously denies in the book. ``I couldn't equate what happened
that day with rape in any form,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski served six months in prison under psychiatric
observation, but fled while awaiting sentencing, convinced he would
not get a fair deal from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have passed, and the girl, who is now 35, has said
in interviews that she feels Polanski should be allowed to return,
and his friends say the legal obstacles could probably be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   But the director is skeptical. ``If I even think about going
back, there are immediately articles. So if I went for real you can
imagine the number of articles there would be. And I don't want to
become the prey of the media again.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, who said he admired the way Bill Clinton endured the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, said he did not think that case helped his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed, but the main thing is that the media has
taken over the judicial system of the United States,'' he said.
``The outcome depends entirely on what they say and show about you
on television. I would have to go back and spend some time there.
And I think it would be hell, not from the system itself but from
the media. I don't ople hanging outside my door, and antenna
dishes in front of my window or on top of some mobile television
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wants, he said, is an opportunity to make major films.
Even, someday, another shot at Bulgakov's novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first have to make a hit,'' he said ruefully, ``then maybe
I'll be comfortable enough to deal with the executives and push the
thing through.''

COURT UPHOLDS EXPULSIONS OF 6 ILLINOIS STUDENTS INVOLVED IN BRAWL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A federal judge Tuesday upheld the expulsions of six
high school students suspended for a brawl at a football game in
Decatur, a case that had triggered a series of protests led by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael McCuskey ruled that the Decatur school district
had not violated the civil rights of the students, all of them
black, who took part in a brawl in the bleachers at a game on Sept.
17.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, McCuskey said the people of Decatur should be
able to watch a football game ``without worrying about a violent
confrontation erupting in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Rainbow/Operation Push, the civil rights
organization headed by Jackson, who Tuesday criticized the ruling
as being ``harsh, with radical disregard to the future of the
children.'' Lawyers for the students said they planned to appeal to
the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The school initially expelled the students for two years, but
after the intervention of Jackson and Gov. George Ryan, a
Republican, the punishment was reduced to a one-year expulsion,
with a chance to attend alternative schools immediately.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have also said they will allow the two seniors
in the group to graduate with their classmates in May. The others
will be eligible to return to school this summer. Three of the
students were also charged criminally.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Arndt, the superintendent of schools in Decatur, said he
was pleased by the ruling, but he expressed bitterness over
Jackson's role in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very costly and disruptive detour for us, and it
has created tremendous turmoil in our community,'' Arndt said. ``In
some of our elementary schools, we now have students warned about
minor infractions, telling us, `I'm going to call Jesse Jackson,'
just to be cute. That must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Arndt said the school district spent more than $100,000 in
defending the suit. Decatur police officials say they spent more
than $50,000 in overtime wages during a series of protests in the
industrial city of 83,000 in November.
</P>
<P>
   The case has heightened debate over the tough ``zero-tolerance''
behavior codes, in which any show of violence is met with harsh
penalties like expulsion, that have become common in American
schools. Critics of the codes contend that students on the edges
are being cast to the wind. But defenders of the stricter rules say
schools must be made safe for learning.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Tirozzi, the executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals, said the ruling showed
the importance of fairness in applying such policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that if you are fair, and you apply the
rules consistently,'' the courts will more likely back a school
district accused of violating student rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Myers, a lawyer for the expelled students, expressed
disappointment with the ruling. But he said his forces had ``won a
victory before we ever walked into court,'' noting that the
district had reduced the penalties for the students. He also said
the case has caused school districts to look closely at their
discipline policies, especially where they disproportionately
punish students who are members of racial minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the Decatur case late last month revealed that
black students accounted for more than 80 percent of the
expulsions, even though they make up only about 50 percent of the
student body.
</P>
<P>
   Arndt, the school superintendent, said the bitter debate over
the case had set back race relations in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's opened a deep wound here,'' Arndt said, blaming ``outside
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Jackson, who brought busloads of demonstrators from
Chicago, was ``not the only outsider'' whose presence stirred
resentment. He noted that members of the Ku Klux Klan and other
white supremacist groups had come to Decatur, and left many
citizens here disgusted.  &QL;

ASHCROFT TO ENDORSE BUSH FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri will finally
endorse a GOP presidential candidate Wednesday, and his choice is
no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He will go with Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who dropped his own bid for the White House last
January, will make his intentions known at a breakfast this morning
with Bush at his side in Columbia, S.C..
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary is considered crucial,
especially if Bush loses the first primary Feb. 1 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush trails Sen. John McCain of Arizona in some New Hampshire
polls, although Bush remains the favorite to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his support, Ashcroft joins legions of public
officials across the country, including Kit Bond, his fellow
senator from Missouri, who have endorsed Bush. Ashcroft will be the
30th U.S. senator to jump on Bush's bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft would not comment on the endorsement Tuesday. Asked
about Ashcroft's timing, spokesman Steve Hilton said he did not
know when Ashcroft made his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has for quite some time had a very positive relationship
with the Bush family, which has very significant family and
friendship connections in the state of Missouri,'' Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft traveled to South Carolina to make his announcement at
the Bush campaign's suggestion, Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was delighted to do that,'' the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   Before dropping out of the 2000 race, Ashcroft had some early
political success in South Carolina. Last May he won a poll of 788
delegates to the state's Republican Convention with 32 percent
support. Bush was second with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That Ashcroft settled on Bush was not considered a surprise.
Last May, Bush's father, the former president, came to the Country
Club Plaza to attend a fund-raiser for Ashcroft's Senate
re-election campaign. Ashcroft faces Democrat Mel Carnahan in one
of the premier races in the nation this year.

YAHOO CITES BIG EARNINGS GROWTH; VOWS TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo, the leading Web portal company, on Tuesday reaffirmed its
plans to remain independent even as it reported another quarter of
spectacular growth.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement of a planned merger between America Online
and Time Warner Inc. has raised the question of whether Yahoo,
which in five years has become a force on the Web and one of the
world's most valuable companies, will merge with a traditional
media company like Walt Disney Co. or even a cable or telephone
company. But on a conference call with investors to discuss their
quarterly results, Yahoo executives said the company could remain
successful without a merger.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo executives did not absolutely rule out a merger in
response to several questions from analysts, they reaffirmed the
benefits of remaining independent and open to partnerships with
many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet analysts said they shared that view. ``I do not
think in any way, shape or form that America Online buying Time
Warner places more measurement on Yahoo to acquire traditional
media content,'' said Henry Blodget, a Merrill Lynch analyst who
follows Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to deliver fast growth, Yahoo said its sales more
than doubled, its profit margins widened, and its user base doubled
last quarter from the comparable period of 1998. The company earned
$57.6 million, or 19 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared
with $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. That figure
represents cash earnings excluding good will charges and some
payroll taxes related to stock options.
</P>
<P>
   With Yahoo valued at nearly $120 billion, almost 800 times its
1999 profits, even that strong report may not be enough to satisfy
investors. The company's earnings were well ahead of published
estimates from Wall Street analysts. But they did not match the
``whisper number'' of 20 cents a share that some analysts had
privately estimated. Shares of Yahoo closed down $38.6875, to
$397.375, at the close of regular trading. In after-hours trading,
Yahoo shares were down almost 5 percent, to $378.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speculation that Yahoo will combine with Disney or another
traditional media company has driven up share prices of media
giants since Monday, when the America Online-Time Warner deal was
announced. But several Internet analysts and investors said Yahoo's
fast growth and huge market valuation will enable Yahoo to remain
independent if it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cook, portfolio manager of the $7 billion Munder NetNet
fund, said Yahoo is more likely to form partnerships with media
companies like Disney than to merge outright with one of them. ``I
think Yahoo has gone out of its way to retain its independence as a
media Switzerland,'' Cook said. ``In the wired world, cooperation
and partnership among competing entities is the norm. I don't think
they want to change that model.''
</P>
<P>
   While older-media companies rely on creating and charging for
their own products, Yahoo has found success with a different
strategy, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content is freely available on the Internet. It's how you
package it and how many users you have,'' said Safa Rashtchy, a
media analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``Yahoo didn't have
any proprietary content, and they have 100 million users who go to
their Web site every month. They've done it by making the content
really useful for people, giving it to them in a form that they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Walker White, Internet and new-media analyst for J.P.
Morgan, said the company's ``strategy has always been to be
device-agnostic, content-agnostic, that they are an unbiased
aggregator of information.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has been successful so far, Ms. White said. ``I
don't think it's necessary for them to have a partner. I think it's
possible, but I don't think it's necessary for them to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Yahoo's fourth quarter looks exceptionally
strong. The company's revenue rose from $91.3 million in the fourth
quarter of 1998 to $201.1 million in 1999, while its audience of
users doubled to 120 million worldwide. Traffic increased even more
quickly, with Yahoo's page views reaching 465 million a day in
December 1999, compared with 167 million in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also extended its lead over competing Internet portals,
including Lycos and go.com. The company reached nearly two-thirds
of all Internet users in the United States in December, compared
with fewer than half of all users in November 1998, according to
Media Metrix, which surveys Web usage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company's international growth continued at a
rapid pace. Yahoo said it now has 40 million users outside the
United States, and page views for Yahoo Japan tripled to 39 million
in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's incredible valuation doesn't give the company much
room for error. Of all the big Internet companies, Yahoo is the
most highly valued on a price-earnings and price-sales basis. With
a market valuation of $120 billion, Yahoo trades at almost 800
times its 1999 earnings, while the average big public traded
company in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index trades at about 30
times. Compared with traditional media companies, the gap is even
larger. In market valuation, Yahoo is worth about as much Walt
Disney and the News Corp. combined. Those two companies had nearly
$40 billion in revenue in 1999. Yahoo had $600 million.

EFFORT BY GRATUITOUSLY MEDDLESOME GOVERNMENT IS RISKY, COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's anything worse than Big Government, it's Gratuitously
Meddlesome Government.
</P>
<P>
   Gratuitously Meddlesome Government had the business world in a
tizzy recently with the revelation of its intention to extend
federal workplace safety rules to people who work at home. The
resultant protest prompted the grand pooh-bahs of Gratuitously
Meddlesome Government to withdraw the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hoopla over that example of Gratuitously Meddlesome
Government at its worst, there is yet another move afoot portending
even more disruptive, and perhaps even more harmful, federal
intrusion into American life.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is moving to require
airlines to provide safety-seat restraints for young children. If
you're an advocate of Gratuitously Meddlesome Government and a
certified member of the ``save the children'' crusade, you probably
think this is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you think wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those efforts by Gratuitously Meddlesome
Government that has the potential to create unintended consequences
that would put more children in harm's way rather than protect
them. The initiative has been slowed by technological and economic
barriers, but if it ever becomes a reality, it could increase the
potential for death and injury to children from other
transportation means.
</P>
<P>
   How so? Air travel is statistically safer than driving. The
proposed safety-seat regulation probably would cause airlines to
charge more for carrying young children now allowed to fly for free
or at steep discounts. The added cost would discourage some
parents, especially those of modest means, from flying and force
them to drive. Moreover, because safety seats for cars don't seem
adaptable to airlines, parents probably would have to invest in an
extra safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   Given statistical inevitabilities, this would result in more
children being killed, maimed and otherwise traumatized as a result
of auto accidents than otherwise would be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Given this probable outcome, why would regulators want to push
this proposal? This is a good question, especially given the dearth
of airline deaths of those the proposal is designed to protect.
Over the last 12 years, safety regulators have documented only a
half-dozen or so such fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the FAA previously rejecting advice
from the National Transportation Safety Board for airlines to
provide child safety seats. Syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum, who
often analyzes regulatory issues, recently cited economic research
estimating the regulation's cost at about $7 billion a year for
each life saved. The FAA, meantime, has traditionally used a value
of $2 million per life saved when assessing regulatory cost-benefit
trade-offs, Sullum noted.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the new position, the FAA administrator called it
a ``complex public policy issue'' requiring the ``perspective of
the secretary of transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   This implies the controversy is more about politics than saving
the children, and puts it in the same league as the cockamamie idea
to extend workplace safety regulations to the home.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptic might think this has more to do with election-year
politics than concern for citizen safety.

BRADLEY WENT TO BAT FOR CONTRIBUTORS IN 1994 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Although he says he had a ``basic policy'' as
a New Jersey senator of not intervening in the federal regulatory
process on behalf of any individual, Bill Bradley did just that in
1994 for a company where two officers had contributed to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to correspondence obtained by The Boston Globe,
Bradley wrote to Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown ``to ask your
personal assistance'' resolving a trade dispute involving the Sigma
Corp. of Cream Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the contributions is relatively modest _ $500
apiece. And Bradley's letter certainly doesn't stand out as
anything out of the ordinary in Washington political circles. But
its existence appears to contradict statements he has made to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go take a look,'' Bradley challenged the other day, when asked
if he had written letters on behalf of contributors _ letters of
the sort that have drawn discomfiting news coverage to another
presidential candidate, Republican Senator John McCain. McCain and
Bradley have made campaign finance reform a central issue in their
campaigns, even appearing together at a forum last month in
Claremont, N.H., to promise to fight the special interests and
unregulated money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity in Washington, said the letter puts Bradley on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question these presidential candidates have helped
their patrons over the years,'' Lewis said. ``The point is, this is
something Bradley needs to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said any suggestion of a
link between the contributions and the action ``is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter is about making sure Sigma got a fair hearing,''
she said. ``Asking for a fair hearing for a business in your state
is perfectly appropriate. I'm sure Al Gore did the same thing as a
senator from Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told reporters this weekend that while he would not
object if they culled through letters from his 18 years in the
Senate, he had given his Senate papers to Princeton University's
Selley Mudd Manuscript Library with the proviso that they not be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Harmon, a spokesman for the university, said the papers
could be made available if Bradley changes his mind. ``It's not a
decision for the university,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Ludecke, Bradley's deputy press secretary, said the
campaign would not unseal the correspondence out of concern for the
privacy of Bradley's constituents who had written to him.
</P>
<P>
   However, the campaign is planning to file a Freedom of
Information Act request to various regulatory agencies requesting
his correspondence. The FOIA process is often a lengthy one, and
the presidential nominations could be wrapped up before any letters
are produced.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's 1994 letter to the Commerce Department came well after
the New Jersey corporation began to have trouble with the
International Trade Commission. Sigma is a private manufacturing
company that makes industrial pipe fittings. It has about 50
employees and sales of $22 million last year, according to Standard
&AMP; Poor's business listings.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1991, according to The Dallas Morning News, the ITC
imposed a 127 percent anti-dumping duty on exports to the United
States by China National Metal Products. The Chinese company made
key components needed by Sigma for its own products, and Sigma
appealed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The president and vice president of Sigma, Victor Pais and Mark
Abrams, each contributed $500 to Bradley on March 16, 1993. Abrams
has since died. Pais did not return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Sigma appealed the ruling to the United States Court of
International Trade, the court ruled on June 3, 1994, that the case
should be returned to the Commerce Department. Seven days later,
Bradley wrote to Brown, asking the commerce secretary to speed up
the process in reaching a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am writing to ask your personal assistance in ensuring fair
treatment for the Sigma Corporation,'' Bradley's letter said. ``Now
that the case is back at Commerce, I urge you to ensure that it
receives expeditious treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asked Brown to speed up the process for Sigma by not
requiring the company to resubmit the same documents provided for
the original case. Bradley said this would take ``months off'' the
process. ``If for some reason this is not possible, I would
appreciate your informing me,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply dated June 17, the deputy assistant secretary for
investigations, Barbara R. Stafford, told Bradley that Sigma had
already agreed to the time frame involved and that the Commerce
Department had only asked for new information from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not requested from the parties to the investigation
any information that is already on the record of this case,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford no longer works at the Commerce Department and could
not be located.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about whether Bradley ever sent letters to federal
agencies on behalf of donors arose after The Globe reported that
McCain had written to the FCC urging the agency to vote or explain
why it had not yet voted in a case that involved a major
contributor to McCain. In the wake of the controversy, McCain
decided to release more than 500 letters written over the past few
years in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was asked if he had ever written similar letters,
he said, ``As a senator, I had a basic policy, and that was I did
not intervene in regulatory matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would write a letter to HUD saying `Give Newark the grant,'
but I did not intervene on behalf of people in a regulatory
process,'' said Bradley. ``I can't think of any time I did that in
the US Senate. Somebody pulls up and finds one somewhere, I'd be
extremely surprised, because I had that as a basic policy.''

 &HT;    Bonfire logs appeared to be leaning, report says
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ In a new indication of what might have
caused Texas A&AMP;M University's bonfire to collapse Nov. 18, killing
12 and injuring 27, a newly released report shows the log pile
appeared to be leaning slightly in the direction it eventually
fell.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Rogers Engineering Services of College Station,
compiled in early December at the request of university officials,
also found that the first stack of logs in the bonfire _ considered
a key to the structural stability of the 7,000-log pile _
``appeared not to have been constructed vertical to the center
pole,'' which itself was plumb or vertical.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, measurements showed the ground beneath the bonfire
was not level, sloping slightly to the southeast, the direction in
which the stack eventually collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   While the report draws no firm conclusions about the cause, it
suggests that a shifting of logs between the first and second tiers
could have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   But it notes: ``Several factors probably contributed to the
actual collapse of the bonfire stack.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M officials on Tuesday declined to discuss specifics of the
report, saying only that it has been turned over to a special
commission that is investigating the tragedy and hopes to
eventually determine a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident this will be something significant for
(the investigating commission's) research firms to look at,'' said
Leo Linbeck Jr., chairman of the five-member commission. ``But I
think it's too early to be drawing any conclusions from any of the
pieces we have so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Engineering was hired by A&AMP;M officials hours after the
four-tier stack of logs fell to help dismantle the log pile and
free survivors and victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rogers Engineering officials referred questions
about the report to A&AMP;M officials who referred them to Linbeck.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, engineer Alton G. Rogers said that photos taken
over several days suggest that the lean became more pronounced in
the final days.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first stack of logs appeared to have been
constructed perpendicular to the ground, the report notes that the
ground slopes slightly to the southeast _ enough to make the
northwest edge of the stack about 9 inches higher than the opposite
side.
</P>
<P>
   The stack fell to the east southeast, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the stack ``fell in a manner similar to a
stack of playing cards,'' snapping the center pole into four
pieces. The pole was broken off at the ground and did not rotate in
the ground before it snapped, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it did not rotate is unusual, the report said.
``However, if the bonfire initially failed between the first and
second stacks, a mass shifting of the first stack could shear the
center pole at the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttressing that theory, the report says, is that one break in
the center pole ``essentially corresponds with the first layer of
the bonfire stack.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting students at the scene, The Austin American-Statesman
newspaper reported last November that the construction swings
attached to the center pole dropped unexpectedly moments before a
loud cracking sound was heard and the stack toppled. Officials at
the time questioned what extreme stress could have caused the
center pole to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The soil on which the stack was being built appears not to
have been a factor as it was in 1994, when the stack toppled
because of rain-soaked grounds that caused the center pole to
shift. No one was injured that year and the bonfire was demolished
and rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the time of the collapse, the stack was about 60 feet tall
and weighed about 1.3 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ As the 2-foot-wide, 14-foot-deep hole for the center pole was
being dug, the driller hit a previous year's pole, causing the
augur to ``kick to the side 4 to 5 inches out of plumb.'' To
straighten it, the hole was made several inches wider, with the
understanding that the space around the pole would be filled in
once the pole was in place.
</P>
<P>
   The report also notes that four of the eight ropes that
stabilized the center pole of the Aggie bonfire were removed about
three hours before the collapse, although Bonfire adviser Rusty
Thompson insisted Tuesday that was routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stack historically has proven it is stable enough by
itself at that point . . . usually about three days prior to
completion,'' he said. At that point, Thompson added, ``it's unsafe
to have those lower ropes on there.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and four other top A&AMP;M officials _ three of them former
Bonfire advisers _ would not answer whether they were aware the
construction site was not level, whether any structural analysis
ever had been conducted on the method of construction and whether
there had been previous warnings about the way the stack was being
built.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire has been a tradition at A&AMP;M since 1909, officials
said. It is burned at a pep rally held several days before the
annual football game with rival University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no history of an accident at Bonfire,'' said Dr.
Malon Southerland, vice president for student affairs and Bonfire
adviser from 1968-72 and 1981-82. ``There have been two occasions
where the -- onfire stack began to slip _ 1957 and 1994 _ but
nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that in addition to refunding all fall
tuition and fees to the survivors of the dead students, $20,000 was
paid to each family _ half by insurance and half by the association
of former students. Those injured have received lesser payments
depending on the severity of their injuries, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I slipped into a corner booth, surrounded by
burnished wood and brass, gleaming white tile and silvery mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   No-nonsense waiters in white aprons threaded among the crowded
tables with platters held high. The mood was convivial, with the
clink of glasses and silverware against the buzz of conversation.
Plateaus of oysters glistened on the bar, charred steaks with
golden fries were being delivered to diners. I started on one of
the dishes I love most: frisee aux lardons, a salad of bitter curly
endive, poached egg and chunks of bacon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the quintessential Parisian experience. Except that I was
on lower Ninth Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so many brasseries have opened in New York that you can
think of almost any neighborhod as an arrondissement. Besides
Pastis in the meatpacking district, carefully detailed brasseries
have opened in the SoHo neighborhood, on the Upper East Side, in
Midtown Manhattan and in the theater district. And many more New
York restaurants are copying the brasserie in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's brasseries _ both in Paris and New York _ are
more about wine than beer, the word itself is actually French for
brewery. The first brasseries were beer halls at intersections in
Paris, opened by Alsatians, many of whom fled their province as the
Germans invaded in 1870. By the late 1800s, they had become
elaborate and fashionable late-night spots. Paris has hundreds of
brasseries, some with famous names like Lipp, La Coupole, Bofinger
and Julien.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a bit of a brasserie tradition in New York, with
places like L'Absinthe on the Upper East Side and Les Halles on
Park Avenue South, which have been around for about 10 years. Many
New York residents also remember the original Brasserie, in the
Seagram Building, which just reopened.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith McNally led the resurgence here. He set the standard
when he opened Balthazar, which captured the brasserie look and
spirit to perfection, down to the hours _ from breakfast through
late night _ and now he has expanded with Pastis. Since then, he
has been joined by others, including Restaurant Associates, which
in addition to the Brasserie, plans to open Brasserie 8{ next month
on West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Feret, who opened Brasserie Julien and Acacia Brasserie
last year on the Upper East Side, said: ``I was tired of formal
dining rooms, and I wanted to do something that was more fun, with
good food and reasonable prices. That's the way I think people like
to eat now, so it's becoming a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of brasseries shows how dining in New York has
relaxed, and not just downtown, where ties have always been
loosened, if not discarded. Meal times are no longer rigidly set,
with places like Gramercy Tavern offering a midafternoon menu.
Brasseries, with their anything, anytime attitude, fit right in.
They also reflect a growing appreciation of simple, everyday French
food.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bistros, which tend to be cozy and intimate neighborhood
spots, brasseries are large, noisy and throbbing with energy. The
menu is usually a compartmentalized broadsheet that invites
customers to pick and choose everything from steamed mussels to
rib-sticking cassoulet. Both bistros and brasseries emphasize basic
cooking _ escargots, duck confit, lamb shank and sole meuniere _
which may be one reason they are often confused. But brasseries
have a stronger Alsatian influence, with dishes like choucroute and
onion tart.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Bucher, the president of the Groupe Flo, which owns 16
brasseries in Paris, describes them as ``popular and democratic,
with big menus that always had something for everyone from laborers
to intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend the day in a brasserie from morning to night,''
he said. ``They're institutions that have evolved less than other
kinds of restaurants _ they're more or less unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Groupe Flo, whose historic properties in Paris include Balzar,
La Coupole, Vaudeville and Le Boeuf sur le Toit, plans to open its
first modern brasserie, Les Grandes Marches, at the Place de la
Bastille in September.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the original Brasserie, on East 53rd Street, was
developed by Restaurant Associates in 1959 and operated around the
clock. It may have been the first restaurant in America to serve
quiche, but the Philip Johnson design looked nothing like a
brasserie, with its table-height bar, Picasso plates on the walls
and modern woodwork. It closed after a fire in 1995 but has since
reopened with a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, other brasseries struggled for recognition. In
the 1980s, a New York version of Coupole in Paris opened on East
32nd Street and was a failure. (Reviewers skewered it for its
mediocre food and arrogant service.)
</P>
<P>
   Alan Stillman originally opened Cite, near Rockefeller Center,
as a brasserie in 1989, but it did not succeed until he changed the
concept to a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran up against the recession,'' Stillman said. ``But I'm
convinced New York was not ready. A brasserie is young, and not for
Midtown businessmen or tourists from the Midwest. I'm not sure even
Balthazar would have made it in Midtown in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Stillman's problems may have been that in trying to
create the ultimate brasserie he didn't achieve a classic look, and
wound up with a brasserie fit for Versailles, with prices to match.
</P>
<P>
   Even the original Brasserie had trouble communicating in that
earlier era, said Nick Valenti, the chairman of Restaurant
Associates. The Brasserie's $5 million makeover, by Liz Diller and
Ricardo Scofidio, now has a look that is both retro and sleekly
futuristic. It has Granny Smith-green resin tables, banquettes with
backs that soar to the ceiling at a rakish angle, a back-lit bar,
and video monitors that capture diners as they enter and start to
descend the floating glass staircase.

NEW YORK: glass staircase.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It borrows none of the Parisian references of the city's other
ones. Julien, Acacia and even L'Absinthe were do-it-yourself
projects by owners who used materials and accessories imported from
France.
</P>
<P>
   McNally designed Balthazar and Pastis himself, scouring flea
markets here and in France and having some details reproduced, like
the railings. Eric Demarchelier described the Houston Street branch
of Demarchelier, his bistro on the Upper East Side, as ``more
brasserie than bistro.'' And his design looks it.
</P>
<P>
   Although classic brasserie style is easy for restaurateurs to
replicate, some hire architects like David Colins, for Brasserie
Bit in the theater district, which looks air-lifted in from Paris,
and Morris Nathanson, for Rue 57, on West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The food is sometimes a little more difficult to keep on the
traditional track.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brasserie, now only open from 6:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., light
dishes like steamed mussels, croque monsieur sandwiches, fish soup
and burgers are e served through most of the day. But the chef, Luc
Dimnet, who is from Strasbourg in Alsace, has added more global
fare like lobster salad with sambal dressing, penne puttanesca, and
pho, the Vietnamese oxtail noodle soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic French stuff is pretty heavy, so I reworked the
brasserie concept with some French-colonial touches and Asian
spices,'' Dimnet said.
</P>
<P>
   At more traditional brasseries in New York, the classics
prevail, like quiche lorraine and cassoulet. Some places like Les
Halles and L'Absinthe and Acacia are trying to tempt New Yorkers
with time-honored but exotic items like tete de veau (calf's head
terrine), pig's feet and blood sausage. They also are venturing
into new territory. Julien serves ostrich burgers, Les Halles
offers hangersteak marinated in ginger and L'Absinthe teams tuna
steak with miso vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   True to their brewery roots, today's brasseries, here and in
Paris, offer an array of beers, mostly Belgian and many on tap. But
wine is the more popular beverage. ``We sell much more wine than
beer at Balthazar and Pastis,'' McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   But brasseries are still as much about drinking as eating. ``The
brasserie is emerging in New York now because of the rebirth of bar
life in a convivial atmosphere,'' said Michael Batterberry, a
co-founder of Food Arts magazine, who wrote ``On The Town in New
York,'' (Routledge, 1999) with his wife, Ariane. ``The tone of a
brasserie is set at the bar, not the table.''
</P>
<P>
   As for other reasons for the brasserie revival, Batterberry
said: ``They're great for young people who move in packs. The sushi
generation can understand the raw bar. Another factor has been the
evaporation of strict meal times.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the historic emphasis on beer, Belgian places like
Waterloo and Markt have the longest lists. Brasseriebit, a
partnership with a German brewery, Bitburger, features its beers on
tap and in a number of French dishes like roast chicken with a
black beer sauce. (Gerard Renny, one of the owners, also owns
Brasserie Americaine near Lincoln Center.)
</P>
<P>
   Feret, at Julien and Acacia, has four Belgian beers on tap. But
he has four inexpensive French varietal country wines also on tap,
sold by the glass and carafe.
</P>
<P>
   Even as traditional brasseries have taken hold in New York,
American translations have evolved as well. The Odeon in TriBeCa
opened nearly 20 years ago. ``We didn't think of it as a brasserie
when we opened it,'' said Lynn Wagenknecht, an owner. ``But it has
become one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Zagat survey, the sprawling Redeye Grill near
Carnegie Hall is identified as an American brasserie. It has the
space, the raw bar, the extended hours and the crowds. Metrazur,
opening next week in Grand Central Terminal, is billing itself as
an American brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   Even Guastavino, the 300-seat restaurant that Sir Terence Conran
is opening next month on the far East Side, is in brasserie mode,
as are many of the Conran megarestaurants in London, said Joel
Kissin, a partner. ``Before doing Quaglino, I sat in all the big
brasseries in Paris,'' he said. ``I wanted to take the energy and
the history of Parisian brasseries and reinterpret them in modern
terms.'' With a raw bar, a varied menu (from fish and chips to
Cuban stew) and an informal atmosphere, it could work.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lajaunie, an owner of Les Halles, said a brasserie does
not have to be French. He defined the Globe, a big restaurant
nearby with a diner-style menu, as a type of brasserie. ``It's the
spirit and the easygoing ambiance that counts,'' he said. ``If you
think about it, where a French town had a brasserie, in America,
you have diners.''

CLINTON PROPOSES $1.3-BILLION AID PACKAGE TO FIGHT DRUGS IN
COLOMBIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Tuesday announced a $1.3
billion, two-year emergency aid package to fight narcotics in
Colombia that further deepens American involvement in that
country's long and violent war against narcotics traders and
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the emergency aid was ``urgently needed''
not only to help Colombia and its struggling democracy but to keep
``illegal drugs off our shores.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan received immediate praise from Congressional
Republicans, who said it mirrored their own legislation, introduced
last autumn, with the big exception that Clinton wants to spend
even more money than the Republicans had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money would be spent on military training and
equipment for the Colombian armed forces and police in their
anti-drug war, but significant funds would also be spent on
improving the judicial system and institutions protecting human
rights as well as bolstering the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government, which already is the third largest
recipient of American aid, could begin receiving the new funds as
early as this March.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana of Colombia welcomed the program,
saying that helping fight the narcotics trade is a ``shared
responsibility'' between countries that produce drugs, such as
Colombia, and those that consume drugs, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the Colombian military would receive 30
Blackhawk helicopters and 33 Huey helicopters to ferry soldiers
into two southern provinces that have become the center of coca
production. There, the army will protect the national police and
help in their counter-drug mission. In addition, the $600 million
set aside for military assistance will include funds to train and
equip two more counter-narcotics battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian farmers who grew coca or poppy and villagers displaced
by the war will receive $145 million in economic aid to help them
find new livelihoods and new homes. Another $93 million will be
spent to strengthen Colombia's judicial system in its ability to
protect human rights, enforce anti-drug laws, and crack down on
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a comprehensive approach that could be the basis for
the peace process,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Tuesday at a press conference. ``It is based on the program
President Pastrana has developed.''
</P>
<P>
   To underline the administration's emphasis on the crisis in
Colombia, the secretary of state will visit Bogota this weekend to
go over the details of the program with Pastrana and to figure out
how to convince other countries to contribute money to the drug
war, according to James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Tuesday's proposal showed that the president
had come to accept, or appropriate, many of their ideas for
combating drugs before they reach the United States. Rep. Bill
McCollum, a Florida Republican, applauded Clinton for creating a
proposal that he said took many ideas from his legislation that
became the 1998 Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, a Ohio Republican, said he ``finally''
welcomes a White House plan that will give badly needed assistance
to fight narcotics in Colombia. His legislation, which is
cosponsored by Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, also a Republican,
was by comparison more modest and would have cost $1.6 billion over
three years and involved, for instance, the purchase of only 15
Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to the Republicans, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that the
administration has ``benefited from the debate over the past
months.'' He said he expected that Congress and the White House
could come to an agreement for immediate aid to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats cautioned that this strategy would require many
more years and billions of dollars more than this plan envisages _
with no assurances that the United States could avoid being tainted
by _ or even drawn into _ the dirty side of a civil war that has
killed tens of thousands of people over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the
United States, but we have spent billions trying to do that and the
flow has gotten worse, not better,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the
Vermont Democrat. ``What we are seeing is a dramatic ratcheting up
of a counter-insurgency policy in the name of counter-drug
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade underwrites the insurgency. The rebels earn as
much as $100 million a year from taxing the narcotics trade, making
them self-sufficient and, perhaps, the wealthiest insurgency in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The administration insists that American military equipment will
be used only against drugs and not in the civil war, but officials
admit that it is often difficult to distinguish one from the other.
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 150 American military personnel in Colombia at
any moment, many of them training and advising, there is a concern
that they will get caught in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the slippery slope argument that American
soldiers will eventually get involved in the war but we have
established a redline that we will not cross _ no U.S. personnel
will ever take part in the conduct of a counter-drug operation,''
said a senior Defense Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem voiced by human rights groups is the right-wing
paramilitary groups that protect and profit from drug traffickers
and also have ties to officers in the Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   Well over half of the human rights abuses in Colombia are
committed by these paramilitary groups, according to Human Rights
Watch officials who argue that the United States should demand that
the Colombian army go after the paramilitary with ties to the drug
traffickers as well as the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about giving money to an army that is deeply
wedded to paramilitary groups that are the main human rights
abusers,'' said Robin Kirk of Human Rights Watch. ``This is a very
dirty war and you have to ask where will U.S. tax dollars
ultimately end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia already receives $300 million in this year's budget;
with the money already allotted to Colombia, the entire two-year
aid package would total $1.6 billion.

INS EXTENDS BOY'S STAY   AS JUDGE'S LINKS TO CASE QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>
   (mg) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Tuesday
that it would extend a Friday deadline that it had set for
returning Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came a day after a family court judge in Miami
awarded temporary custody of 6-year-old Elian to his great-uncle.
The boy was found clinging to an inner tube after his mother and
several others drowned trying to flee Cuba in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Although contending that it _ and not the state court that
issued the custody ruling on Monday _ had jurisdiction in the case,
the immigration service said it would not enforce its Friday
deadline and would probably allow the boy to remain in this country
until the court hearing on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since everything is under review,'' said Maria Cardona, an
immigration service spokeswoman, ``we'll most likely extend that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new controversy erupted over documents
showing that the family court judge, Rosa I. Rodriguez, had failed
to disclose a business relationship with a man who serves as
spokesman for the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spending reports filed by Rodriguez with the Miami-Dade
Elections Department show that she had paid the spokesman, Armando
Gutierrez, his wife, Maritza, and their consulting firms $60,946
during her campaign in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In failing to disclose the relationship during the hearing,
Rodriguez, of Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, violated the Florida
Code of Judicial Conduct, said Anthony V. Alfieri, director of the
Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Celena Rios, director of family court operations for the
11th Judicial Circuit of Florida, said that while the judge's
conduct was ``troubling'' under the code ``there is no obligation
that a judge disclose the participation of any individual in a past
campaign who is not an attorney and is not a party in a pending
legal matter before her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez called the campaign services and her husband's
services on behalf of Elian's Miami relatives ``apples and
oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   While Elian has remained in his relatives' Little Havana
neighborhood where he has started school, he has become the focal
point of the vast Cuban-American population's loathing for the
41-year-old government regime of President Fidel Castro, its
failure to dislodge him and its usually emphatic support of family
ties, including a father's claim on his motherless child.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service has come under growing criticism for
delays in its decision to return the boy to his father and
continuing delays in enforcing the return.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the agency says it has been proceeding in the
child's best interest. Russ Bergeron, an agency spokesman said,
``We felt it was necessary to allow a reasonable period of time so
the family would have time to reach some agreement and so the
logistical issues of reuniting him with his father could be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the agency also wanted to allow all sides to seek
relief through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delays, ``every day it gets more painful,'' said
Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches,
which dispatched three emissaries to Cuba to interview the father
and found him eager for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Now the disclosures about Rodriguez's campaign ties to a
supporter of allowing Elian permanent residency in the United
States, have stirred the pot further.
</P>
<P>
   For helping Rodriguez's election, her first, Gutierrez's
consulting firm, Gutierrez &AMP; Associates, received two payments
totaling $7,500, according to the elections commission. His wife's
firm, Creative Ideas and Advertising Inc., received four payments
totaling $53,446 for advertising and other media services. Both
rejected any implications of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped her with her campaign,'' Gutierrez said. ``But I help
over 100 judges with their campaigns. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   His assistance, he said, had been ``no secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez said she and her husband had seen the judge only
once, nine months ago, since working on her election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with her to get elected,'' she said, ``but that is
totally irrelevant. It's apples and oranges. It has nothing to do
with this child.''

FBI SEARCHES FOR TEXAS TEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING THREATS IN COLUMBINE
CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo.) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The letters were crude, barely literate. But lack of
literary polish was the least worry Tuesday for the Texas teen-ager
who allegedly wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   For the writings were menacing, including one letter filled with
hateful threats against a key investigator in last spring's high
school massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Leon Thomas, 18, of Houston was the object of an FBI
search on charges that could send him to prison for 15 years and
cost him $750,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a former Milby High School student, is accused of
mailing letters to Jefferson County, Colo., Sheriff John Stone and
to Columbine High School. A third message was sent via computer to
a Broomfield, Colo., woman.
</P>
<P>
   The three indictments were handed down Monday by a federal grand
jury in Denver. An FBI spokeswoman said agents are looking for
Thomas to give him a summons to appear in court Jan. 26 in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this stuff is really bizarre,'' U.S. Attorney
spokesman Jeff Dorschner said of the threatening letters related to
the Columbine High shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen students, including gunmen Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, and a teacher were killed April 20 at the suburban
Denver school. More than 20 other people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the messages allegedly authored by Thomas, the writer claimed
to be the ``ghost of Eric Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two messages were sent via U.S. mail in late
September, and the computer message was posted in early November,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to the high school began, ``Death for Columbine,
rip.'' The letter mailed to Stone began every line with ``420'' _
an allusion to April 20 _ and promised to ``get my shotgun. I will
have bloody fun. I will waste it all away. U will see. U will all
bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer also pledged death for a Broomfield woman, whose
connection with the Littleton school shooting is undetermined. Some
authorities suggested she may have dated Thomas, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Stone,'' one message read, ``your a fool you let me Skip
Right out of your hands you had me. Im the only one from The
columbine massacre you didnt Talk to. But you should cos I knew a
secret I have that hidden puzzel, but yor not going to find me in
Houston!!!! im Real close.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would not comment on whether Thomas had been in
Colorado or had any connection with the school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Residents near the fenced complex of small southeast Houston
houses where the Thomas family lives said they had little contact
with the teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched him grow up like we did the other neighborhood
kids,'' said Wilbert Williams, who lives across the street from the
Thomas family. ``But we were just good across-the-street neighbors.
We didn't know them personally. They went to one church, we went to
another. We didn't socialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleazar Resendez, who lives next door to the Thomas family, said
he routinely saw the teen coming home from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be carrying his backpack,'' Resendez said, ``but we never
really talked to them. Like most people here, they kept pretty much
to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver grand jury also indicted a Cape Coral, Fla., teen for
allegedly threatening violence at the Littleton high school.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ian Campbell, 18, is accused of sending a computer
message pledging to ``finish what begun.''

FOR FORMER CHANCELLOR KOHL, A REPUTATION UNRAVELING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A streak of obstinacy helped Helmut Kohl unify Germany
and persuade his countrymen to abandon their beloved mark for the
euro. But now the same stubbornness that elevated him to
statesmanship appears to be unhinging his Christian Democratic
Party and unraveling Kohl's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   By admitting that as chancellor he accepted more than $1 million
in secret payments to the party during the 1990s, but refusing to
reveal the names of the donors or quit politics, Kohl has opened
devastating divisions among Christian Democrats no longer sure
whether to revere or revile their once sacrosanct leader.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, any donation to a party that exceeds 20,000
marks (about $10,500) must be declared. It was Kohl's failure to do
this while operating secret bank accounts that led to the opening
last month of a criminal investigation into his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Christian Democrats worsened further Tuesday
when Wolfgang Schaeuble, 57, a protege of Kohl and his successor as
leader of the party, described at a hastily convened press
conference how, in 1994, he accepted a bag containing 100,000 marks
(about $52,000) in cash from an arms broker named Karlheinz
Schreiber, who is now in Canada fighting extradition to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Thus weakened, Schaeuble will be hard pressed to reverse the
party's sharp political slide _ one that has abruptly revived the
fortunes of Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   A well-oiled political machine powered by a strong
identification with the basic conservatism of most Germans, the
Christian Democratic Party is still a long way from collapsing, and
the aura surrounding Kohl has not been entirely stripped away. But
the events Tuesday suggested strongly that the worst is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The bag of money, Schaeuble said, was given to him the morning
after a fund-raising meeting organized on Sept. 21, 1994, by
Brigitte Baumeister, then the treasurer of the Christian Democratic
Party. ``I passed the donation on to Ms. Baumeister for further use
and financial accounting,'' Schaeuble added.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as he himself conceded Tuesday, was that this
formal accounting never took place and the money disappeared from
view until it was transferred more than a year later to a private
Frankfurt bank, George Haucks &AMP; Sohne. A bank official declined
Tuesday to give any information on the account.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baumeister has suggested that the account was used for what
she has called ``special earnings'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be other potentially devastating problems with
Schaeuble's story, among them why he would consider it natural to
accept a bag full of cash and how he can now hope to clear up a
scandal in which he has become deeply implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Schaeuble had sought to distance himself from Kohl in
the affair, declaring recently that the ``Kohl era is over.'' But
by declining to take full responsibility and withdraw from
politics, the former chancellor has plainly undermined his
successor and ensured that the shadow of his era remains long.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistencies in Schaeuble's account suggest the extent of his
predicament. In November, when asked about Schreiber, who now lives
in Canada, the Christian Democrat leader said he thought he had
``run into him'' once.
</P>
<P>
   The clear intent of Schaeuble was to show that he had nothing to
do with a man already linked to shady payments under Kohl,
including a 1 million mark donation to the Christian Democratic
Party made in Switzerland in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, acknowledging that he had not only met him twice
but had also been involved in the presumably memorable hand-over of
100,000 marks, Schaeuble said: ``We should be very careful when we
talk about the issue of lying. Once or twice is not particularly
important, nor does it constitute a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   This remark, suggesting a very pliable notion of what
truth-telling is, appeared to reflect a political culture long
cultivated by Kohl. Under the chancellor who ruled for 16 years
until 1998, accountability and transparency were far less important
than loyalty and the preservation of power.
</P>
<P>
   It is already clear that much of the unaccounted money
controlled by Kohl was used to provide funds to party branches and
individuals in order to cement party unity and a fierce loyalty.
``He used this money to sustain his authority,'' said Hans-Peter
Muller, a sociologist. ``He corrupted his party, forging a regime
of personal power.''
</P>
<P>
   The culture that permitted such practices has clearly shifted in
Germany, as elsewhere in Europe. Already there are murmurings that
the fate of Christian Democracy in Germany may bear some similarity
to that of the Christian Democrats in Italy, a once dominant party
whose post-Cold War undoing began with a corruption scandal that
ultimately revealed a widespread network of slush funds and secret
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in Italy, where the public mood was long misjudged, you see
Kohl today underestimating public opinion and the changes since
1989,'' said Claus Leggewie, a political scientist. ``The
worst-case scenario is now the Italian-style implosion of a party
founded in 1949 to fight the Cold War and unify Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kohl nor Schaeuble appears to have entirely grasped the
gravity of the scandal. Certainly, Kohl has given the impression
that he believes he has made a minor mistake, scarcely relevant in
the light of his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Schaeuble rejected suggestions that he should resign,
saying there was ``no reason'' to do this. He argued that while he
should have checked more carefully what happened to the money, his
actions were the right ones in that he handed the funds to the
party treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble's implication Tuesday was that he had expected the
treasurer to declare the cash. In other words, he argued that his
actions were distinct from Kohl's in that he had not tried to keep
the money secret or himself direct its use.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly attacking Kohl, the party leader said: ``If everyone had
acted in the manner I did, we would soon have all the
explanations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even the best explanations may not prevent the departure of
some officials. Growing irritation was evident within the party
Tuesday and there were isolated calls for Schaeuble's immediate
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   If he survives, it is also unclear how he will able to settle
the central issue of dealing with Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Largely unrepentant, adamant in his refusal to reveal the names
of his secret donors, Kohl has shown no sign of leaving the
Bundestag or distancing himself from a party of which he is still
honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the party is deeply split. There are those still
loyal to Kohl _ among them Jurgen Ruttgers, another protege and
possible future leader; but others like former defense minister
Volker Ruhe, now see the former chancellor as a menace. ``Kohl is
playing a very dangerous game,'' said Moller.
</P>
<P>
   But the former chancellor still seems to be bathing in the
spotlight he enjoyed just two months ago, on the 10th anniversary
of the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the likes of George Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev stood beside him. Unlike these two men, however,
he often gives the impression of being unaware that time has moved
on.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cartoon here showed a statue of Kohl being dismantled.
``He was a great statesman,'' said Alfred Hartenbach, a Social
Democratic member of the Bundestag. ``His great mistake has been to
continue in politics for another season.''

JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON HEIR WINS RIGHTS TO BUY JETS FOR $635 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Texas, D.C., Ill., Md., Ohio)  (With FBN-JETS-TEAM) 
(jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson IV, whose great-grandfather founded Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, won the right Tuesday to buy the Jets for $635 million,
the third highest price for a professional sports team and the most
for one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose connection to big-time New York sports had been
confined to courtside seats at Knick games, outbid the $612 million
offered by Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which
owns Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to emphasize that we are totally dedicated to bringing
a winning and a championship team to this area,'' Johnson said in a
statement. ``We understand and appreciate the difficulties inherent
in that goal, but we look forward to working with Steve Gutman and
Bill Parcells in developing a first-class organization, which is a
cornerstone to developing a winning franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The price seems remarkable for a team with a downtrodden
history, which finished with a 1-15 record as recently as 1996. The
Jets staged a revival under Coach Bill Parcells _ playing for the
American Football Conference championship last year _ but spun into
public disarray last week when Parcells stepped down and his
designated successor, Bill Belichick, cited the uncertainty over
the team's ownership when he quit the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The team sold for far more than what some sports finance
analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   But the tantalizing prospect of owning a team in the New York
area, the nation's largest market, stoked the value of buying the
Jets, as did the possibility that the team might have a new stadium
in its future that would generate much greater revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is on-field performance always a reliable predictor of
franchise prices in the financially stable National Football
League, which shares the bulk of its revenues equally among its 31
teams and benefits from network television contracts that paid each
team $58 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   And NFL teams are selling for a premium. Last year, the
Washington Redskins, coming off a 6-10 season, sold for $805
million, a purchase that included the Redskins privately financed
stadium, which is now called FedEx Field. That acquisition was
followed by the purchase of a new and as yet unnamed Houston
franchise for $700 million in October.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 52, has homes in Manhattan and Bedminister, N.J. He
runs a private investment firm on Fifth Avenue. Until now, he has
not been a public figure, although he has made a name for himself
by raising money for juvenile diabetes research and Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 suitors contacted the estate of Leon Hess, who
first bought a piece of the Jets in 1963 and had owned 100 percent
of the team since 1984. Hess died in May. Dolan was the presumptive
early favorite because of his prominence in sports. But when the
process reached the so-called final stage in early December,
Johnson was the only opponent standing up to the cable TV magnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped out at $510 million because my brains overruled the
seat of my pants,'' said Sam Grossman, a real estate developer in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 8, there had been shifts in the bids. Early on,
Johnson was leading, but in the last stages, he had to play
catch-up to Dolan, said people involved in the sale. On Jan. 3,
Johnson raised his offer from a shade below $600 million to $625
million. That placed him above Dolan, but each offer had individual
complexities leading to different ways to determine their value.
</P>
<P>
   To the five executors of the Hess estate, including John Hess,
the son of the late Jets' owner, and Thomas Kean, the former
governor of New Jersey, the bids were excruciatingly competitive.
The executors met Monday, knowing that the NFL's finance committee
wanted their recommendation by Tuesday morning. But they could not
choose, people involved in the sale said. They needed the
committee's help.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday, John Hess arrived at the NFL's
Park Avenue headquarters, with Eric Grubman, the estate's
investment banker at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hess needed to know how strongly the committee felt about
Dolan's media interests. NFL rules prohibit corporate ownership of
teams. League officials and some owners were concerned enough about
Dolan's businesses that they wanted him to separate a possible
purchase of the Jets from his corporate interests, which include
the Garden and cable TV systems serving 3.4 million subscribers.
Dolan agreed that Madison Square Garden would not play a role in
the Jets and he would not vote on television-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolan signed everything we asked him to sign, but we felt the
membership still wouldn't go along,'' said Robert Tisch, co-owner
of the Giants and a member of the NFL's finance committee. ``They
felt there may be problems down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess made two presentations in the league's large boardroom, but
spent most of his time in another room with Grubman. Much of the
feedback to Hess about the committee's feelings about Dolan came
from Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner. There were no concerns
about Johnson's private family business interests, participants
said. Dolan and Johnson, who were not at the meeting, knew they
still had time to raise their bids if they wanted to. Johnson
conferred on the telephone with one of his lawyers, Ira Akselrad,
in late morning about whether to increase his bid. ``There was a
lot of deliberation about what was appropriate,'' Akselrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Johnson called the NFL to make one final $10 million
leap.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan never called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hotly contested until the end and the estate considered
a number of criteria,'' Grubman said. ``But ultimately, the estate
decided to focus on the highest bid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hess eventually told the committee that the estate wanted to
accept Johnson's bid, and then the committee members voted 8-0 to
recommend the offer to the full ownership when it meets next
Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am personally disappointed, I have enjoyed working
with the Hess family throughout the process and hold them in the
highest regard,'' Dolan, 73, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan has now bid unsuccessfully for three NFL teams. In 1998,
he bid with his brother, Lawrence, for the Browns, his hometown
team. Last year, he and John McMullen, the owner of the Devils,
tried unsuccessfully to buy the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Art Modell, the Baltimore Ravens owner, who supported Dolan but
was also a longtime friend of Leon Hess, said, ``This is what the
Hess family wanted and it's good enough for me. Chuck still has the
Knicks and the Rangers. He's got a zillion things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who also tried unsuccessfully to buy a majority stake in
the Yankees, is now pursuing the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who will pay for the Jets with his personal wealth, is
now faced with the task of creating the revenue needed to support
his purchase price. The paramount concern is building a new
stadium, in New York or New Jersey, where the Jets would get
virtually all of the revenues, rather than sharing them, as they do
now with the Giants and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not discuss Tuesday where the team might play when
its Giants Stadium lease runs out in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he develops a new stadium properly, the Jets could become
the most valuable franchise in American sports,'' said Marc Ganis,
the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm. A new
stadium, with a corporate name, 250 luxury suites selling for
$200,000 each and 15,000 club seats costing $4,000 each, could
generate more than $100 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year he's in Giants Stadium, the Jets lose $100 million
a year,'' Ganis said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 season, the Jets had forecast revenues of $104.5
million and an operating profit of $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But long before decisions on a new stadium are made, Johnson
will huddle with Parcells about the next coach. His first
initiative may be offering Parcells a huge sum to return for a
final season as the coach.  &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16)  
 (af)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Toback brought two props to lunch at the Fine &AMP;
Schapiro deli on the Upper West Side last month. One was Raymond
Durgnat's recent biography of King Vidor, which contained a picture
of Toback and Vidor on the set of Toback's 1982 movie ``Love and
Money.'' The other was ``Immobilarity,'' a CD by the rapper
Raekwon, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan, with a dedication in the
liner notes to ``James `The Music Man' Toback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From King Vidor to Wu Tang,'' Toback exulted over matzoh ball
soup, hot dogs and a diet cream soda. ``The range of American
film!''
</P>
<P>
   Few directors can boast a career like Toback's. Fewer still
might want to. Half a dozen movies that have not always rubbed
critics the right way, or translated into huge box office profits
(or losses, for that matter). And yet, at 55, this idiosyncratic
writer-director still makes the movies he wants to, lures marquee
stars, finds the money men and, lately, makes the cut at the big
film festivals. He's got outsider credentials, insider connections
and one Oscar nomination (his screenplay for ``Bugsy'').
</P>
<P>
   What's more, as John Calley, the chairman of Sony Pictures,
said, ``His life is more interesting than his films, which is
rarely true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Calley bought ``Black and White'' for Sony's Screen Gems
division. The movie is scheduled for release in April, the same
month as a retrospective of Toback's work at the Screening Room in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The series will run the gamut of Toback's eclectic oeuvre.
``Fingers'' (1978), his dark directorial debut, with Harvey Keitel
as an aspiring concert pianist who can't stop busting heads for his
loan-shark father. ``The Big Bang'' (1989), a documentary riff on
Toback's theory of the universe as a great cosmic orgasm. And his
last one, on a related theme: ``Two Girls and a Guy'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Sex is to Toback what violence is to Quentin Tarantino, who once
said he used to play ``Fingers'' at the video store where he worked
until the owner told him it was scaring the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' begins with two white female teen-agers and
a black man groping one another against a tree in Central Park _ a
scene that was recut three times to get the film from an NC-17 to
an R.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teen-agers is portrayed by Bijou Phillips as a
privileged private-school girl and hip-hop groupie. The man is
played by Power, executive producer of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose
character, Rich Bower, is the leader of a rap group who moonlights
as a gang and drug lord.
</P>
<P>
   Besides black-white relations, other Toback obsessions woven
into the loose, interlocking story lines are gambling, murder and
sexual triangulations.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic cast includes Brooke Shields, Ben Stiller, Claudia
Schiffer, Allan Houston (of the New York Knicks), Robert Downey Jr.
and Mike Tyson, as himself. In keeping with the film's rough,
documentary feel, much of the dialogue was improvised. Power said
he ad-libbed about 40 percent of his lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim, obviously, he's not a dude that's like from the ghetto or
anything like that, so he wouldn't be able to fill in certain
words,'' he said. ``The situations and scenes were set. We just had
to do the deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   David Thomson, a film critic and longtime friend of Toback's,
said of the film's experimental style, ``He's getting back to what
he's best at: these very low-budget and very interesting
exploratory films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' started with a budget of $1.6 million, then
grew to $5 million as more stars signed on. The idea, Toback said,
came from his belief that ``the race-sex mix is the single most
significant social phenomenon of the whole post-civil rights era,''
and that not until now has the final interracial taboo been broken
by Generations X and Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are certainly big blocks of racism and skinheads
and all that, who I think have been overwritten about and
overemphasized, a far more pervasive phenomenon is a complete
erasure of racial barriers in sexual behavior,'' he said. Talking
to some Manhattan high-schoolers about their sexual histories in
the course of researching the film, Toback said that he found they
``often can't immediately remember what the racial balance is, it's
so insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   The pervasive influence of hip-hop music and culture ``is, more
than anything, responsible for that,'' Toback continued.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an important question: How does a guy who talks
this much ever get a movie made?
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Toback is a compulsive raconteur. A
discursive, digressive lecturer. It's easy to imagine him in front
of a classroom at the City College of New York, where he taught
English after obtaining degrees from Harvard and Columbia. City
College's eclectic faculty then included Joseph Heller, William
Burroughs and Israel Horovitz _ the father of Adam Horovitz, whose
white-boy rap group, the Beastie Boys, Toback put on the soundtrack
of his 1987 movie, ``The Pick-Up Artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Toback's screenplay for ``The Gambler'' (1974) is a thinly
fictionalized account of his City College years. Directed by Karel
Reisz, the film stars James Caan as a college professor with a bad
gambling habit and an impressive wardrobe of tight,
chest-hair-revealing shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore those shirts!'' said Toback, who nowadays clothes
himself more sensibly, in dark jackets, long overcoats and a
scalp-concealing baseball cap. A beard is the only vestige of his
swinging '70s self.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a white, middle-aged director who grew up on Central
Park West make an authentic movie about black culture? Even one who
spent a year living at Jim Brown's house in the Hollywood Hills
researching his 1971 book, ``Jim''?
</P>
<P>
   He knows what it's like to be ``the only white guy in a totally
black orgiastic world,'' he said. ``But that was 20 years ago. I'm
not living with Jim Brown. This is hip-hop. I could live with these
Wu-Tang guys for 10 years and not be better at writing their
dialogue than they are at inventing it. Why would I want to tell
them what to say? Their entire identity is linguistically based.''
</P>
<P>
   Toback said he told the actors they had to get ``from point A to
point R in a scene'' and left the specifics to them. The movie's
unforgettable moment is Tyson's reaction when Downey, playing Ms.
Shields' gay husband, makes a pass at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike didn't know Downey was going to hit on him,'' Toback
said. ``I just said, `Downey is going to come up and talk to you.'
To Downey, all I said was, `Approach Mike, hit on him.' And to
Brooke I said, `Shoot them with your camcorder, watch what happens
and if you want to join in, join in.' I was startled when she hit
on Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable scenes like the Tyson-Downey-Shields encounter are
what make a Toback film, rather than, say, plot.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson observed that ``in terms of narrative, he doesn't always
have the strongest grasp of his material. Sometimes they get a
little silly.'' In ``Exposed'' (1983), Nastassja Kinski plays a
fashion model who gets mixed up with terrorists. ``Not a very good
film,'' Thomson concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the screenwriter Robert Towne said: ``There's always
something in all of them. Something very unexpected, very
insightful.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is often said of Toback himself. Warren Beatty, who has
known him since the critic Pauline Kael suggested they meet in
1978, said of his friend, ``Let me put it this way: Jimmy is not
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the secret of Toback's success, or at least his
access.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who meets him is ever bored,'' Thomson said. ``They
say, `Come to this party,' or whatever, and because of this he's
had access to a lot of places ordinary people wouldn't get into.
He's got a proclivity for staying up late enough to see the really
terrible things that go on. And he's got an appetite and a memory
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson likens being with Toback to being in a movie. ``I have
been with Jim when he has said, `Oh my God, I left a money belt in
the restaurant and it's got a lot of cash in it that I need to pay
off a debt,''' he said. ``And we went back and there was this black
leather thing packed with high-denomination bills. Clearly, some
pretty large transaction was in the offing.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, the two men found themselves gridlocked on Santa Monica
Boulevard. ``He sees an attractive woman three or four cars back,
so he goes back to talk to her and leaves me sitting in traffic,''
Thomson said, adding, ``He was a little more inclined to do this a
few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So inclined was he that Spy magazine once chronicled Toback's
own exploits as a pickup artist. He has been known to stop women in
the street and offer them parts in his films, flashing his
Directors Guild of America card to prove he is in a position to do
so.

<P>
   Toback, who is married to Stephanie Kempf, called the article
slander and ``an occupational hazard of personal filmmaking.'' He
complained that the coverage of him in the media has subjected him
``to personality stuff no other directors are subjected to''
because he has never hired a publicist.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he is his own best _ and worst _ publicist. He can
talk nearly nonstop about himself, his work, his life. He seems to
know, or have known, everyone. His first marriage was to Consuelo
Sarah Churchill Vanderbilt Russell, daughter of Lady Sarah Spencer
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty and Jeff Berg, the chairman of International Creative
Management, are among his close friends. He is a memoir waiting to
happen, though someone else will have to extract it from him, since
he doesn't type.
</P>
<P>
   Capable of dropping names that leave a dent in the floor, Toback
prefers to see his biography as a necessary adjunct to his films.
``My life has been lived by thousands of people far more radical
and interesting than me in whatever area _ sex, gambling, drugs,
any of those things,'' he said. ``What is different about me is
that I'm making movies and using aspects of what I picked up over
the years, and letting people expose and reveal themselves through
characters that they create either with me or that I've created for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's calmed down. No more cigarettes or alcohol. Gambling
is, he said, ``an enemy in abeyance.'' He gave up recreational
drugs after a bad acid trip in college. LSD was still legal then,
and he says he ate a shoeboxful of of the stuff, then flipped out
for eight days, not counting the two days he lay unconscious after
being injected with an antidote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the seminal psychological experience of my life,'' he
said. It is also the centerpiece of the film he wants to do next,
``Harvard Man.'' Don Simpson, another close friend, had agreed to
produce the movie if Toback would do a rewrite of the 1995
Simpson-Bruckheimer action movie ``Bad Boys,'' which he did.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Toback was on the phone with Simpson, who said he was
going to talk to Joe Roth, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, in
the morning about making the ``Harvard Man'' deal. The next
morning, Toback got a call from Berg, his agent _ not about a deal,
but to tell him Simpson had died the night before. ``Simpson hung
up the phone and went into the bathroom and died,'' Toback said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another movie.

BRADLEY FAULTS GORE FOR RECORD ON TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Resorting to a campaign tactic that he has
complained about his opponent using, former Sen. Bill Bradley on
Tuesday lashed into Vice President Al Gore, his lone rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, for a vote Gore cast 15 years
ago in Congress that helped the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, who has come under withering attack from Gore on
several fronts but has generally struck back only when he was put
on the defensive, Tuesday's attack marked one of the few times he
had taken the offensive first.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Bradley asserted that Gore, as a member of
Congress from Tennessee, had been a friend to ``big tobacco,''
while Bradley, as a senator from New Jersey, had consistently
fought against it. Their records, he argued, demonstrated that as
president, he would be a stronger advocate of restricting smoking
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To make his case, Bradley said that Gore had opposed
restrictions on tobacco advertising in 1988. And Bradley cited a
1985 amendment he proposed that would have increased tobacco taxes
and used the revenue to reduce premiums on Medicare, the government
health program for the elderly. Gore voted against the measure,
which failed by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   That vote ``lays out a very clear point of time where there was
a disagreement over who supported big tobacco and who supported
Medicare,'' Bradley said. ``I've been consistent over time with
regard to tobacco and I think this illustrates that he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not take issue with the Clinton administration's
record of trying to regulate tobacco products and restrict tobacco
industry advertising. But he asserted that the issue was about
trust, a central theme of his campaign, suggesting that Gore, whose
father grew tobacco on the family's Tennessee farm and whose sister
died of lung cancer, had not fully disclosed his record on tobacco
and had not explained why he once supported the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with how you conduct the campaign, and whether
you are leveling with people,'' Bradley said. ``I mean, when I've
changed positions on something, as everybody in politics does over
time, I explain why, I explain why I change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign seemed almost pleased by Bradley's new
criticism because the vice president's aides say they think that
every time Bradley attacks Gore, it undermines the insurgent's
efforts to cast himself as a ``different kind of politician'' who
stays above the fray and rejects negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that the Clinton administration's record of
fighting the tobacco industry made Bradley's criticism seem
pointless. And they said they viewed Bradley's remarks on Tuesday
as evidence that his campaign is sinking in Iowa, which kicks off
the primary season on Jan. 24 and where Gore is heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the year, Bill Bradley has repeatedly promised not
to be negative, pledging he would run a `different kind of
campaign,''' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``Today, we find
out that with his campaign fortunes flagging, he is resorting to
the typical negative attacks of a desperate politician.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore has blasted Bradley for repeatedly voting
against measures that would have helped Iowa farmers, including a
1993 bill intended to help farms hurt by flooding. When Gore
brought up that vote again during a debate last Saturday in Des
Moines, Bradley responded by saying, ``This is not about the past.
This is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his attacks Tuesday on Gore's record was any
different, Bradley replied that he considered it absurd to argue
that ``anything anybody ever did, any position anyone ever took is
somehow or another off limits. I think that the issue is not only
tobacco, the issue is consistency over time, intensity of feeling
and willingness to challenge the tobacco industry.''

3 TOP BANKERS RESIGN, BUT ECUADOR'S CENTRAL BANK APPROVES SWITCH TO
U.S. DOLLAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ President Jamil Mahuad's plan to replace the
domestic currency with the American dollar won approval early
Tuesday from the rump board of directors at Ecuador's central bank
after its top three officials quit to protest what they called an
irrational change of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of the president of the central bank and his
top two deputies helped intensify the confusion and doubts about
the plan, which Mahuad had described as a necessary step to help
rescue Ecuador from its worst economic crisis in 70 years. But
Mahuad had threatened to fire any central bank official who opposed
the plan, and it remained unclear Tuesday exactly how the plan
would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is occurring continues to suggest to me a lot of
confusion,'' Marc Helie, a director of the Ecuador Creditors'
Advisory Group, which represents holders of bonds on which the
country defaulted last year, said in a telephone interview from New
York Tuesday. ``We don't even know if they have a consensus to
implement the dollarization plan as they have presented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Better, president of the bank, resigned after having
consistently opposed Mahuad's plan, arguing that the country was
better off sticking with the system of allowing the national
currency, the sucre, to rise and fall freely against the dollar.
Just last week, Better, a former minister of finance, had said
dollarization was not an option for Ecuador, even though the sucre
had lost 67 percent of its value against the dollar in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also stepping down was Virginia Fierro, general manager of the
Central Bank, who last week had warned against ``introducing
rushed, crazy measures.'' She reiterated her opposition after
Mahuad's Sunday night speech announcing the plan, warning that
``conditions to dollarize the economy do not yet exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank's assistant manager, Patricio Proano, also quit. In
addition, dissident staff members posted an official study on the
Central Bank's website that concludes the exchange rate at which
Mahuad has fixed the currency, 25,000 to the dollar, is not
realistic. Their study suggested that a more realistic rate would
be 30,000 to the dollar, which some Ecuadorean and foreign private
sector analysts here say is still short of an exchange rate that
will discourage speculators from testing Mahuad's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the government's program, announced Sunday night,
is to replace the sucre, named for Ecuador's national hero, Marshal
Antonio Jose de Sucre, with the dollar. After Mahuad threatened to
call a special session of Congress Tuesday to remove any Central
Bank official who opposed him, the remainder of the Bank's board
approved the measure at a tense eight-hour meeting that ended only
early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress was meeting here Tuesday to begin studying new laws
needed to implement the plan, protests against Mahuad and
dollarization were continuing in Guayaquil, the country's main
business center. ``The medicine is worse than the disease,'' said
Augusto Aguirre, leader of the transport workers union, in
endorsing the call for a nationwide general strike beginning Jan.
15 and condemning the government's new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's decision to dollarize implies that Ecuador's Central
Bank, which currently determines monetary policy, will immediately
lose many of its functions and eventually wither away. ``The
Central Bank will participate in foreign exchange markets
exclusively to exchange dollars for sucres in circulation,'' said
Miguel Davila, who replaced Ms. Fierro on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the government plans to buy up sucres
now in circulation and replace them with American dollars.
Thereafter, the sucre will continue to exist, but only in the form
of coins, to be used for small transactions _ similar to the system
that Panama uses.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean officials estimate the total value of sucres in
circulation, calculated at the new official exchange rate, as about
$450 million. The country's foreign reserves amount to more than
$1.2 billion, about $900 million of which is in cash, meaning there
should be no shortage problems in exchanging sucre bills for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures, however, do not include savings accounts, most of
which have been frozen since last March, or checking accounts. The
government plans to circumvent that potentially troublesome problem
by issuing dollar-denominated bonds as compensation for accounts in
excess of $4,000 or, in some cases, delaying cash compensation for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency plan is a major setback for Ecuador's efforts
to secure a $250 million loan with the International Monetary Fund.
An agreement to that effect had been scheduled to be signed as
early as this Friday, after nearly a year of negotiations, but
Mahuad's sudden shift of direction has now effectively delayed that
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the country wants to turn around and start a different
economic policy, we have to start negotiations all over again,''
Jeffrey Franks, the fund's Ecuador representative, warned reporters
here last week. In a terse statement issued Monday, the fund's
managing director, Michel Camdessus, said it was willing to resume
discussions with Mahuad ``once suitable measures are identified.''

HONG KONG PROMISES A CRACKDOWN ON STOWAWAYS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Alarmed by a surge of smuggling in which Chinese
migrants are carried to the United States and Canada in the
containers of cargo ships, Hong Kong pledged Tuesday to crack down
on that new method of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The government's pledge came a day after three Chinese stowaways
were found dead in a cargo container shipped to Seattle from Hong
Kong. Fifteen others survived the trip in the container, and nearly
100 illegal immigrants from China have been arrested since December
in containers seized in ports on the west coast of the United
States and Canada. The ships were all loaded in Hong Kong, raising
questions about security in this normally well-policed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our law-enforcement efforts are effective, taking into account
the fact that the crackdown on the recent cases in Long Beach,
Seattle, Los Angeles and Vancouver was the outcome of tip-offs from
Hong Kong,'' said So Kam-shing, a security official in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But So conceded that Hong Kong needed to tighten its inspection
of cargo containers _ particularly canvas-topped containers, which
have become the vehicle of choice for smugglers because they allow
in just enough air to be livable for a two-week journey across the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Customs Department said it would inspect every
canvas-topped container that passed through its port. Canvas-topped
containers account for only 1,000 of the 15 million containers
processed here each year, but even that small number may be hard to
monitor in Hong Kong's teeming harbor, which vies with Singapore as
the world's busiest container port.
</P>
<P>
   ``The containers sometimes arrive just before the ship is due to
sail,'' said Arthur Bowring, the director of the Hong Kong
Shipowners Association.
</P>
<P>
   The trafficking in Chinese immigrants is controlled by shadowy
criminals known as snakeheads. The smugglers charge up to $50,000 a
person, and immigrants often pay off the fare by working in
sweatshops in the United States after they land.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident of human smuggling from China, a Chinese ship,
the Golden Venture, ran aground on a sandbar in Far Rockaway,
Queens, in 1993. Ten people died after jumping overboard.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to stamp out smuggling has taken on an unmistakable
political overtone here. Two recent incidents of stowaways involved
ships owned by the Orient Overseas Container Line, a shipping
company controlled by the family of Hong Kong's chief executive,
Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to show their vigilance, customs officials Tuesday
took journalists along on an inspection of a freighter owned by the
Chinese government. Although the officers rummaged through the
rusting engine room and hold, they did not open any of the
containers being loaded or unloaded. Once the containers are off
the dock, an officer explained, they can no longer be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust the shipping line,'' said the officer,
Ronald Au.

INS WON'T FORCIBLY REMOVE CUBAN BOY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note dateline change; optional ending included) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigration officials said Tuesday they have no
plans to forcibly remove Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez from the home
of his U.S. relatives, and conceded that a Florida judge's
emergency ruling would likely delay the 6-year-old's return to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner decided last week that Elian, who survived a boat sinking
that killed his mother, stepfather and nine others en route to the
U.S. coast, should be returned to his father in the communist
country by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have backed
that decision, but immigration officials said they would have to be
flexible on the deadline in the wake of Monday's Florida court
ruling giving emergency temporary guardianship to the boy's
great-uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date is not written in stone,'' said INS spokesman Russ
Bergeron. ``We have said all along that we would work with Elian's
family to arrange for his return. The attorneys for his Miami
family have said that when all is said and done, they will accept
the rule of law, and we take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said that while INS clearly has the authority to
enforce its order and send Elian back to Cuba, there is no truth to
rumors circulating in Miami that Border Patrol agents are poised to
storm the home where the child has been staying since his rescue
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying we won't eventually take custody of him,'' he
said, ``but there's been a great deal of speculation and rumor
alleging that INS would swoop in and forcibly take that child. We
have been saying for weeks we have no plans to use force. We are
still hopeful that the family will work this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron declined to comment on what the INS would do to enforce
its order if Elian's U.S. relatives refuse to cooperate even after
they get their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez, has said his ex-wife did not have
his consent to take Elian with her when she fled Cuba. He and the
boy's two sets of grandparents have demanded his return, and Cuban
President Fidel Castro has made Elian a national hero, plastering
his image on T-shirts and posters, and bringing hundreds of
thousands of Cubans into the streets of Havana to protest the
child's ``kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other
Cuban-American relatives in Miami, suspect that Gonzalez is being
coerced by the Castro government, and his wishes can't be known
unless he comes to the United States for a March 6 court hearing on
Elian's custody. Even if the father genuinely wants the child to
return home with him, they say, the court should also consider
where Elian would have a better life and whether he would suffer
mental and emotional damage if he were returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American community has staged several demonstrations
in the streets of Miami and has held vigils outside the family's
home in Little Havana. Demonstrators in New York supported the
INS's decision Tuesday, chanting, ``Let Elian go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the federal government's decision on the immigration
matter, Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez ruled Monday
that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until the March
custody hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered Elian's father, who has remarried and has
a family in Cuba, to come to the United States for the hearing,
saying his ``failure to appear may result in a decision adverse to
his interests.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday that lawyers with the
INS and Justice Department are still reviewing the Florida court's
ruling and have not yet made a decision on their next move.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Associated Press reported that Rodriguez
dismissed suggestions Tuesday that she should have removed herself
from Elian's case in state court because she had once paid a
spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives $10,000 to serve as her
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Armando Gutierrez, who runs a public relations
firm, said he worked for Rodriguez during her 1998 election
campaign, but hasn't spoken with the judge in 18 months. He said
his past work for her did not influence her ruling.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It falls to Agustin Palacios Roji, the president
of Mexico City's largest map company, to stay current with the
shifting geography of North America's largest city. And it is no
easy job.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, developers carve some 1,500 new thoroughfares out of
the city's suburban fringe, and neighborhood leaders across the
metropolitan area, falling sway to passing fancies, rename another
300 streets. As a result, although Palacios Roji's company
publishes a new city map every year, each new edition is instantly
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``People phone us up and say: `No, our street isn't called that
anymore. The name's been changed,''' Palacios said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mexico City residents fail to take their street names
seriously. Quite the contrary. They have never tolerated numbered
streets, and few have names as prosaic as Elm or Main. Street signs
ring with history along roads like Pioneers of the Cooperative
Movement, or Division of the North, which honors Pancho Villa's
fierce revolutionary cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The names of our streets and avenues are like a cultural code,
our collective memory preserved,'' Jorge Legorreta, president of
the city's central Cuauhtemoc borough, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   So city leaders were stunned when a survey in 1998 showed that
80,000 city blocks had no street signs and that thousands of other
public avenues lacked any official name. Other streets were named
for political leaders now held in ill repute, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who has since stepped down
to run for president, responded by appointing a Nomenclature
Commission to erect thousands of new signs, assign official names
to roads now languishing in anonymity and consider renaming streets
that had become an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is sweeping, since Mexico City has 25,000 public
avenues and its metropolitan area 72,000. New York City, by
comparison, has about 13,000 streets.
</P>
<P>
   Few changes are contemplated, because most street names here are
cherished. In the historic center, names like Mixcalco and
Tlaxcoaque date to Mexico's City's Aztec builders.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians on Tacuba, a cobblestone avenue still bearing the
title given it by Nahuatl-speaking urban designers, tread the path
followed by Hernan Cortes during his disastrous retreat in 1520,
when hundreds of his conquistadores, weighted down with plundered
gold, perished under an Aztec onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Other streets recall the centuries of colonial rule. Sister
Juana Ines de la Cruz, the 17th-century nun who is among the
world's greatest poets, has lent her name to 82 city roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of streets commemorate Mexico's independence struggle,
including 760 named for the Rev. Miguel Hidalgo, the priest who
roused his parish peasants into anti-Spanish fervor at the onset of
the anti-colonial war in 1810.
</P>
<P>
   Such repetition can be bewildering. Martha Nava Zaragoza, a
psychologist, lives with her family on Benito Juarez Street _ one
of nearly 800 thoroughfares named for the 19th-century president
who was a contemporary of Abraham Lincoln and is often compared to
him here. Mrs. Nava said she was often asked which Benito Juarez
Street she lived on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live on the Benito Juarez Street in the Benito Juarez
borough,'' she says. ``So it can be confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Diaz, the 19th-century strongman, tried to avoid all
this. During the 26-year presidency that followed his first
election in 1884, Diaz sought to impose order by abolishing names
and numbering the streets. Residents stubbornly ignored the
dictator's numbers but compensated for the impertinence by naming
more than 100 city thoroughfares Porfirio Diaz Street.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution that broke out when Diaz re-elected himself to a
sixth term in 1910 swept new names onto thousands of signposts.
Venustiano Carranza, the general who assumed the presidency in
1916, renamed 20 streets surrounding the National Palace, each
after a Latin American country that had recognized his government.
Two hundred eight streets bear Carranza's name.
</P>
<P>
   That is four times as many streets as are named for Plutarco
Elias Calles, the general who consolidated the revolution in 1929
by founding the party that has monopolized power in Mexico ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Calles might have gotten more recognition, but his last name
means streets in Spanish, and the ring of Calles Calle, or Streets
Street, limited the sycophantic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The name of every modern president adorns at least a few
streets; not even the surviving ex-presidents who are now widely
reviled have been left out. Jose Lopez Portillo, whom Mexicans
routinely insulted in public for years because of his catastrophic
economic stewardship from 1976 to 1982, is nonetheless honored
along 75 public avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen streets are named for Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who
is widely hated because Mexicans associate his presidency, from
1988 to 1994, with the plundering of the public treasury. The
Nomenclature Commission's current review appears to have been
provoked mainly by public irritation over streets named for
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deliverymen laugh at me,'' said Juana Aguilar, 52, a
grocer, shrugging as she stacked shelves with bread in her cramped
store on Carlos Salinas Street in a neighborhood called
Presidentes. ``They say this must be a street of thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   A few addresses away, Anastasio Juarez Romero, 34, a butcher,
was hanging smoked pork chops from hooks on his shop ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tell people where we live, they say, `Oh, you must be
filthy rich!''' Juarez said. ``We're really hoping they change the
name. Anything but Salinas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown offices of the Nomenclature Commission, its
technical secretary, Angel Perez Palacios, said his staff had
received dozens of requests from citizens to rename streets bearing
Salinas' name.
</P>
<P>
   Since its formation in 1998 the commission has focused much of
its energy on organizing production of 45,000 new signs for streets
that had none. But now citizens' committees in each of the city's
16 boroughs are reviewing suggestions for street name changes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will act with caution and prudence, but it is
good bet that the Carlos Salinas Streets will get new names, Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commission had decreed that ``the names of
personalities can become part of the city's nomenclature only five
years after their death, and only if their career contributions are
recognized locally and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The name changes will force Palacios Roji to revise his city
map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work every day to keep our maps up to date,'' he said.
``It's a grueling task.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pickup trucks can be great vehicles. So can sports cars. But
their virtues are very different, and fans of one may not love the
other.
</P>
<P>
   That may help explain why Day 2 of the America Online-Time
Warner deal sent stock prices of both companies tumbling, with each
down $5 or more a share. The value of the stock that America Online
is offering for Time Warner, at $165 billion when the deal was
announced, leaped to $180 billion in early trading Monday but was
down to $145.1 billion by the end of trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That difference _ $34.9 billion _ is itself a huge number. A
quarter-century ago, no company in the United States was worth that
much. The most valuable company in 1975, IBM, sported a valuation
of $33.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed merger is completed, shareholders of both
companies are going to get something very different from what they
bought. In a real sense, Time Warner and America Online have
inhabited parallel stock market worlds when it comes to valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question for shareholders is whether the market will
accord the new entity a traditional valuation or an `Internet
valuation,''' Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
said in a report to clients. ``Our answer to this is not
surprising: probably somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the short term at least is that not a lot of
stocks now fall ``somewhere in between.'' Nor has there been much
demand for such stocks. A share in AOL Time Warner, as the company
is to be called, will have no hope for the growth rate that was
expected for the old America Online. Nor will it sport the current
cash flow that was represented by an old Time Warner share.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many shareholders of each type of company have been
contemptuous of the other. America Online and other Internet stocks
were derided as bubbles waiting to burst; Time Warner was viewed as
an old-economy company that was stumbling in its efforts to get
with the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices are set by markets, of course, based on what
investors are willing to pay. And in recent months investors have
been willing to pay far more for America Online's growth prospects
than for Time Warner's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   That is reflected in a few ratios. Time Warner shareholders will
provide operations that produced 82 percent of the revenue, and 70
percent of the operating cash flow, for the 12 months ended last
September. But they will get only 45 percent of the stock in the
new company.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the numbers that way, and it appears that Time Warner
shareholders are getting a bum deal. But a different set of numbers
produces the opposite conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on stock prices Friday, before the deal was announced,
Time Warner shareholders are getting a 71 percent premium for their
shares. Had this been a ``merger of equals,'' with the exchange
ratio set by current market prices, Time Warner shareholders would
have wound up with only 32 percent of the merged company, not 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget concluded that the combined company's stock price ``will
be entirely a function of management's ability to instill
confidence'' in investors. He said that shares of America Online,
which closed at $64.50 Tuesday, down $6.75, could trade in a range
of $55 to $90, depending on how successful that effort is. One
tactic being tried by Stephen Case, the chairman and chief
executive of America Online, and Gerald Levin, his counterpart at
Time Warner, is to argue that the two businesses are not really
that different. ``The two companies are very similar, even though
at first blush it's not evident,'' Case said on Monday. Levin said
that linking up with America Online felt like ``coming home''
because both companies were ``subscription-based, distribution and
consumer brand-building'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   One risk to this deal is that shareholders will abandon the
companies, some seeking purer plays in explosive Internet growth
and some looking for better current valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that, in the year this deal may take to close, the
stock market itself could radically alter the valuations on these
two types of stocks. A year ago, the market thought Time Warner
shares were worth 1.7 America Online shares; two years ago that
number was 5.6. There is no guarantee that similar changes in the
next 12 months will not make the 1.5 ratio in the announced deal
seem unfair to one group of shareholders or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term winners in this deal are clearly Time Warner
shareholders. Even after shares fell $5, to $85, Tuesday, they are
trading higher than they ever had before this week.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer term it is probably a better deal for America
Online. Its stock price has fluctuated greatly, tied to two
factors: its success in the rapidly changing Internet market, and
investor infatuation with such stocks. Case managed to choose a
moment when things looked great on both fronts to use highly valued
stock to buy a company that _ by any measure save market valuation
_ is clearly a much larger and more successful company.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Internet mania fades, America Online will have
substantial businesses, ranging from Warner Brothers movies to
Cable News Network, to support its stock price, assuming this deal
is completed. But getting to that point will require the company to
convince its shareholders _ who presumably were quite happy without
the Time Warner safety net _ that the new, slower-growing America
Online is something they want to own.
</P>
<P>
   And that, judging by Tuesday's market reaction, will be a
challenge. The companies need to convince shareholders that they
are creating a vehicle as fast as a sports car and with the hauling
capacity of a truck. The risk is that it will end up with something
that sports car afficianadoes view as slow and that truck fans
think has a small cargo capacity.

REVIVAL OF THE WILD WEST IN THE HEART OF THE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Beyond the gleaming towers of downtown and new centers
of high-tech companies that cannot seem to move here fast enough is
the annual reminder that, in its heart, Denver is essentially a cow
town.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 85th year, the National Western Stock Show is packing
crowds daily into the old Denver Coliseum, where Western-style
goods are sold by day and rodeo stars perform each night. And iffn
you're not wearin' blue jeans, a big ol' silver belt and cowboy
boots, well, you're apt to look a mite funny.
</P>
<P>
   But more than calf roping and bronco busting, the 16-day event
has evolved into one of the world's largest and most important
showcases for prized breeding cattle, the backbone of the American
beef industry. And for farmers tending their bulls and heifers for
auction in the days ahead, prospects for record sales have seldom
been better.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enduring problems for America's grain farmers, the
cattle industry is experiencing its first real economic boom in 20
years. A rare confluence of rising beef prices and a new consumer
demand for beef _ not to mention depressed feed prices _ has pushed
up revenue for cattle farmers by 10 percent and more over the last
year. Cattle farmers like Glen and Judy Swanson from Durant, Iowa,
who have brought several prized animals here this week, say they
have not seen anything like it in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A farmer is always optimistic that next year will be better,''
Swanson said Tuesday, standing beside a 2-year-old Iowa state
champion bull known as S6807 that weighs a massive 2,275 pounds.
``We've been married 40 years. I tell her every year, things'll be
better, and she gets tired of hearing me say it. But this year, I
really believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the beef industry operates in five-year cycles. When
prices fall, farmers sell parts of their herd to cut expenses and
reduce supply. Eventually, demand catches up and prices rise again.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent uptick has been accelerated by a growing
number of Americans eating red meat again. Some are returning to
high-protein diets in which meats are a major component. Some
believe that eating chicken and fish instead of red meat to reduce
cholesterol has not made that much of a difference. Others, feeling
flush from the strong national economy, are dining out more often
at steak restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   And meat processors have expanded their marketing efforts to
accommodate busy families in which both parents work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more convenience,'' said Mike Miller, director of cost
and performance analysis for Cattle Fax, an industry newsletter.
``Companies are precooking the meat so they're microwavable, and
more products in the meat case have labels, telling the consumer
how to prepare them.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of red meat is also spurring new interest
in bison. At a booth here, two men from the National Bison
Association handed out brochures that say bison meat has fewer fat
grams, calories and cholesterol than beef, pork or chicken. ``Even
if you freeze it, it stays nice and moist when you cook it,'' said
one of the men, Don Kroupa, a bison rancher in Parker, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   For all these trends, the stock show is ground zero. An exhibit
hall adjacent to the rodeo ring has become a virtual beauty salon
for rows upon rows of bulls and cows that have proved themselves to
be among the best bovine procreators in the country. In preparation
for auction, their owners spend hours hosing them down, trimming
their fur and blow-drying them smooth so that not a hair is out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the animals get an ample supply of hay and the
promise of a cushy life in the pastures, so long as they keep
procreating.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said S6807, the son of a 1996 state champion, is such a
fine example of a black Angus bull that he could fetch as much as
$4,000 at auction this week. And what a prize for his next owner:
Swanson said S6807 could continue producing offspring for another
10 years ``unless he loses his libido.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' Swanson said, ``he'll go to slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the 10,000 head of cattle living inside the coliseum
this month are for sale. Many are here just for show, and other
exhibit halls feature pigs, rabbits, sheep, goats, roosters, ducks
and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can buy almost anything here associated with the West,
like chaps, Stetson hats and hand-tooled boots _ all of which look
perfectly natural here in Denver, even downtown.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Delaware bankruptcy court approved a $91
million bid Tuesday by Warner Bros. and Paramount Studios for the
defunct Mann Theatres chain.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's parent company, WestStar Cinemas Inc., declared
bankruptcy last year. It later negotiated a sale agreement with WF
Cinema Holdings a limited partnership between Warner Bros. and
Paramount but the bankruptcy court ordered the sale opened up to
competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
   No other companies bid on the 351-screen chain, and Warner Bros.
spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti said the court process Tuesday was
``fairly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for WF Cinema to pay WestStar $46 million up
front and an additional $45 million by Oct. 15, according to court
documents. WF Cinema also would take on several financial
obligations of the f Brogliatti declined to say when the first half
of the purchase price would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of Irvine-based Laguna
Research Partners said the absence of competing bids reflects the
industry's wariness of aging theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any expansion strategy that involves the purchase of existing
theaters is a risky strategy,'' Skislock said. ``Consumers drive
right past old theaters to get to new theaters. They drive right
past remodeled theaters to get to new theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Encino-based WestStar operates 53 Mann Theatres in Colorado and
California, including the landmark Mann's Chinese Theatre in
Hollywood, the Plant 16 in Van Nuys, the six-screen Agoura Mann,
the Village 8 in Westlake Village, the seven-screen Mann in
Valencia and the 10-screen Exchange in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   WestStar acquired the chain in 1997 from Cinamerica, a
partnership between Warner Bros. and Paramount that had owned the
chain since 1986. WestStar paid about $165 million for the chain,
which in 1997 had a far larger inventory.
</P>
<P>
   WestStar struggled with Mann's aging theaters, however, and it
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September after
failing to find a buyer for the ailing chain.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock said that while another company might be willing to buy
some of Mann's assets, the partnership probably did not buy the
theaters to sell them at a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to go through the business model for
each one of those theaters with a fine tooth comb,'' Skislock
continued. ``They're going to do their best to make those theaters
perform.''

<P>
   GRAND CANYON, Ariz. _ With the natural splendor of
billion-year-old rock formations behind him, President Clinton on
Tuesday doubled the size of the federally protected land with a
presidential decree that he said would outlast the memory of the
chief executive who signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 20,000 years from now, if the good Lord lets us all
survive as a human race, no one will remember who set aside this
land on this day,'' Clinton said, describing his action as ``an act
of humility.''
</P>
<P>
   With his signature, Clinton turned more than 1,500 square miles
of soaring cliffs and rugged desert along the canyon's northern rim
into the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. He sat at a desk
in a field in the Tuweep Valley, dotted with desert sage and ringed
by a rainbow of towering rock.
</P>
<P>
   The designation has been opposed by many Republican lawmakers
from Western states, including Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona and
the state's seven Republican congressmen. They urged Clinton to
stay out of the issue and allow the state to protect the land.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's stance was buoyed by a poll Tuesday in The Arizona
Republic showing that nearly 80 percent of the state's residents
back his action.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers said the designation was aimed at preventing the
land, most of which is already owned by the federal government,
from being spoiled by mining or encroaching development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more important 20 years from now than it is now,''
said Alan O'Neil, superintendent of the Lake Mead National
Recreation Area. ``Although we don't see any problems today, we're
trying to prevent them and preserve the solitude and remoteness of
this land.''
</P>
<P>
   The President also granted monument status to 71,000 acres north
of Phoenix containing prehistoric ruins, Agua Fria, and to
thousands of desolate islands, rocks and exposed reefs off the
California coast. He expanded the protected spire-like rock
formations at the Pinnacles National Monument east of Salinas,
Calif., by more than 8,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the Antiquities Act of 1906, which was first used
by President Theodore Roosevelt _ 92 years ago _ to create the
Grand Canyon National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The president's action, his aides said, means he has set aside
more land as national monuments in the lower 48 states than any
other president. Only President Carter's designation of a vast
expanse of Alaska trumps him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chafed at the notion that he was taking the action in
the final year of his presidency as a legacy-enhancing act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do in your last year looks like a legacy thing
but we've been at this a while,'' he said aboard the presidential
helicopter, as he and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt flew along
the southern rim of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Clinton was at times nonchalant, flipping
through paperwork as majestic vistas swept by. From time to time he
would gaze over his reading glasses and remark on the rock
formations below.

canyon as a young man of 24 on a trip from Arkansas to California.

   ``This morning I got up and for about an hour I watched the sun
rise over the canyon for the first time,'' he said in his speech.
``In both cases, watching the interplay of the changing light
against the different layers and colors of the canyon left me with
a lifetime memory I will always cherish. Millions and millions of
Americans share those memories, and a love of our natural
treasure.''

L.A. COUNTY REGION'S TOP BOSS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When it comes to employing people in Southern
California, Los Angeles County remains king while discount retailer
Wal-Mart is becoming a major player on the regional employment
scene, according to a survey to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   The county has 88,779 workers, more than twice as many as the
biggest private-sector employer, the Boeing Co. with 38,000
workers, says the tabulation by the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is done every two or three years and while the top
employer hasn't changed, the fact that the county bureaucracy is
the largest always surprises some people, said Jack Kyser, chief
economist f group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a county that has a population approaching
10million people, so you are the social and public service
provider. That (ranking) makes a lot of sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the county has a larger population than 42 of the 50
states, so the size of its work force should not be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   What might be a surprise, though, is the emergence of Wal-Mart
as a major employer and the continued strength of the aerospace and
defense sector.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart ranked 22nd on the list with 15,285 workers across Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Ventura and San Bernardino counties.
That puts it ahead of such entrenched retailers as Robinsons-May
department workers, and Costco, with 8,909 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The first appearance on the list by a San Fernando Valley-based
company is Walt Disney Co. at No. 12 with 24,538 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Public agencies hold the top six spots, with the U.S. government
No.T2.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said it is important to compile this type of list every
several of years because it is the kind of information sought by
companies thinking about expanding into the area.

 &HT;    Ft. Hood site a likely place for re-creation, attorney reveals
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The court-ordered re-creation of the events at
Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993, to determine whether FBI agents
shot at the Branch Davidians will probably be in March at Fort
Hood, Texas, the plaintiffs' lead attorney in the wrongful death
lawsuit against the federal government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell said Fort Hood is the ideal
location to fly an airplane equipped with an infrared camera
overhead while weapons identical to those at Mount Carmel are
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood, the world's largest military base, is 50 miles
southwest of Waco near Killeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrain is similar to that at Mount Carmel,'' Caddell
said. ``The ATF used Fort Hood to train for the initial raid.
There's even a building there that mimics some of the conditions at
Mount Carmel. The weather is similar. The soil conditions are
similar. There would be no security problems. And they fire off
weapons all the time. You wouldn't have to worry about getting
special permits.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell declined to disclose the source of his information on
the re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not return a phone call from The Waco
Tribune-Herald newspaper requesting an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco
ordered a re-creation of the final day of the siege at Mount Carmel
after being asked to do so by Special Counsel John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth wants to determine if the bursts of light seen on the
FBI's infrared surveillance tapes from Mount Carmel are gunfire _
as the plaintiffs argue as well as the producers of the Academy
Award-nominated documentary, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have maintained their agents didn't fire a single
shot on the last day of the government's 51-day siege of David
Koresh and the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the simulation would be staged by a British firm
recommended by Danforth's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FLIR camera is a British-made camera,'' Caddell said. ``So
these guys have experience with the FBI's type of camera. We're
happy having them rather than the ringers recommended by the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys recommended to Judge Smith that three
employees of ERIM International of Ann Arbor, Mich., run the
simulation. The plaintiffs protested, noting that all three were
former colleagues of William Ginsberg, who filed an affidavit on
the government's behalf arguing there are too many unknown
variables to accurately re-create the conditions at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Testing could take a couple of weeks, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give yourself enough time to match the conditions
at Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993,'' he said. ``You can't guarantee
on any one given day you'll have the same temperature and wind
conditions as at Mount Carmel. The airplane could have mechanical
problems. The FLIR camera could have some problems. Who knows?
There needs to be time allowed to ensure the test is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from the re-creation should be known almost instantly,
however, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first day is a good day, everything works well and the
weather is similar, we could know by the first day,'' Caddell said.
``We should know immediately what the results are. We're going to
have a tape, and we'll look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he's still certain the simulation will show the
flashes reflected on the original FLIR tape are gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's possible we may not go to trial after the
re-creation,'' Caddell said. ``I think it's possible that the
government's case could just collapse like a house of cards.''

 &HT;    Judge wants government fined in Branch Davidian case
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Houston attorney Mike Caddell filed a motion
Tuesday urging U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco to
fine the government $50,000, claiming it is preparing to dump
thousands of pages of documents on plaintiffs as the deadline nears
for document production in the Branch Davidian wrongful death
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also asked that any request by the United States for
more time to produce documents be denied.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest clash between the two sides over evidence in
the case, set for trial on May 15, which stems from the death of
David Koresh and 75 followers at Mount Carmel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they've been doing,'' Caddell said.
``They've produced 20 boxes of documents. In the real world, that's
basically one clerk sitting in a room for a week. I don't know what
it is in government world. I guess if they've got $900 hammers,
they may have paralegals who can only produce one document a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith set a Jan. 15th deadline for document production after
meeting with both sides last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Caddell said the government had ``only'' produced
12,000 pages of documents in the last four months. Of that, more
than 25 percent _ or 3,400 pages _ was turned over last week.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell accused the government of stockpiling documents in order
to dump them on the plaintiffs at the last possible moment, four
months before trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear at the status conference that discovery was
to be done on an ongoing basis,'' Caddell said. ``The 15th was more
of cleanup date, for us to get the few documents not already
produced. But it now looks like the vast majority of documents will
not even be produced until after the deadline. At some point, the
word 'inexcusable' doesn't seem sufficient. These people basically
have thumbed their nose at the court's orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Smith threatened to hold government attorneys in
contempt if they did not promptly turn over evidence related to the
Branch Davidian siege. Smith bluntly stated that the government
``waits not only until the last day, but until the last minute to
respond to every order this court has issued.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the evidence so far given plaintiffs by the government
isn't new, according to Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've gotten, by and large, was already publicly
available,'' he said. ``We may have gotten copies that had fewer
redactions. But the new material would probably fit into two boxes.
I know through sources that there is material out there that we
should have but haven't gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Caddell cited files and notebooks taken from the
FBI's Hostage Rescue Team's headquarters at Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they exist because they were turned over to
Congress,'' he said. ``But we haven't gotten them.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked for attorney fees in the amount of $50,000, which
his motion said will allow plaintiffs to hire additional personnel
to sort through any last-minute documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think the government is counting on May 15th being
a hard deadline,'' Caddell said. ``They're trying to squeeze us
between their stonewalling and the trial date. In private
litigation, they would be penalized in some way. They might be
precluded from putting on evidence not properly disclosed, for
example. I'm hopeful that Judge Smith will treat the government the
same way he would a private party who flouts the court's orders.''

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having helped transform the U.S. economy over the
past two decades, a loosely knit group of corporate titans is now
taking its ideas about business, investment and management and
applying them to a different topic: education.
</P>
<P>
   The group's aim is nothing less than overhauling the nation's
system of public schools, eliminating what it calls the
government's monopoly in education and allowing parents to choose
which school their children will attend at government expense.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that business offers a model for education is not new.
But these participants _ wealthy businessmen like Ted Forstmann,
the billionaire leveraged buyout specialist; John Walton, an heir
to the Wal-Mart fortune, and John Doerr, the technology venture
capitalist _ are pushing the discussion to a different level,
hoping to use their fortunes and stature to steer the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The men, whose preliminary efforts have so far been limited to
lobbying, philanthropy and investment but who plan more direct
involvement in education reform, envision the government serving as
a sort of ATM, dispensing to parents the $7,000 or so that public
schools spend per pupil. Parents could then use that money to send
their children to whatever school they want.
</P>
<P>
   The businessmen hope to draw new providers to education,
including, perhaps, companies like Microsoft and National
Geographic. If the public schools can compete in that environment,
they say, fine. If not, they should be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never led a revolution before,'' Forstmann said. ``But I
didn't get here without understanding supply and demand. Parents
believe the public school government monopoly produces a bad
product at a high price. So why are no suppliers rushing forward to
cater to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, whose family grew wealthy building Wal-Mart stores in
suburbs and rural areas starved for competitively priced goods,
argues that when stores do not go into the inner city, it is
because the residents lack the buying power to allow the stores to
be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But if inner-city parents were given the option of sending their
children to a private school with the money that would otherwise go
to the local public school, they would have buying power equal to
that of suburban parents, Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the three men will gather with politicians, educators
and investors at a conference in Manhattan to try to stimulate
investment in education. The conference is sponsored by Merrill
Lynch and the Children's Scholarship Fund, the organization
co-founded by Forstmann and Walton, which this year began
distributing $200 million in partial private-school scholarships to
40,000 children around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly some of the interests of these new participants in
education lie in profits and politics. Doerr, for example, invests
heavily in for-profit educational ventures through the New Schools
Venture Fund. Walton is active in conservative politics, and Doerr
is a campaign adviser to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The men said the profit motive was not a bad sign but a good
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that some people in this effort are actually
going to make money,'' Forstmann said. ``They are, like everybody
else who does a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But these men face what might be called the CEO's dilemma, said
Dr. Douglas Archbald, a professor of education at the University of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about how slow the process of learning to read or write
is for an individual kid,'' Archbald said. ``It takes years to see
the result of changes in education. A new CEO can come in and
downsize a company or start a new product line, and those changes
can quickly appear on the bottom line. But you can't just go into
the schools and make people more accountable, tweak the budget here
and there and see substantially better results in a year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have not dimmed the ardor of Forstmann and his
counterparts, who say they know they are battling something far
more powerful than teachers unions, entrenched bureaucracy or
special political interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom just has a choke hold on most good people
in America in this area,'' said Forstmann, who bought and turned
around Gulfstream, the maker of business jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are always telling you how impossible it is,'' he
said about educational change. ``It's not impossible at all. What
do you think's harder, making jet engines or teaching kids reading,
writing and arithmetic? I hope you don't have to think too hard
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Forstmann and his colleagues fail to understand
education and how it is run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't who provides the schools, whether they're
public or private or for-profit,'' said Arthur Levine, president of
Teachers College at Columbia University. ``It's who can beat the
achievement gap between blacks and whites and between urban schools
and those in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues will have to be dealt with as well. In a free
market system, companies typically spend a large amount of money on
marketing and advertising. That would mean that public school
dollars would be used to attract more public school dollars _
arguably a questionable use of taxpayer funds.
</P>
<P>
   But even some ``educrats,'' as Forstmann calls them, agree that
competition could be good for the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the competitive shot that they're giving to the
system,'' Richard Mills, the New York state education commissioner,
said of ventures in for-profit education. ``It gives weight to the
argument that we've been making, saying to schools that you've got
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional educators have rarely voiced such arguments, but
Forstmann appears to be winning over some of the biggest opponents
of school choice. Teachers have objected that school choice
programs will drain resources from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But last month at a speech at Columbia University, Forstmann
unveiled an advisory board of 19 teachers and other educators who
support his ideas. In addition, he said, civil rights leaders from
around the country are helping him recruit other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   To Forstmann, Walton and the others, the effort is nothing less
than a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real moral issue,'' Forstmann said. ``I hate talking
about the economics of it.''

COMMENTARY: MEDIA MANIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a former columnist for Fortune, I am probably one
of the few people who regularly visited the unsuccessful Pathfinder
portal. And I can heartily endorse the claim that Time Warner
needed someone else's expertise to develop its Internet profile.
The Fortune site, part of Pathfinder, was deeply flawed in at least
two ways: Much of it was in unreadable yellow type (when I inquired
about that, I was told it looked better on a Macintosh, suggesting
a slight lack of consumer orientation), and it failed to include
the kind of content that might have attracted readers _ that is, it
didn't post my columns.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably AOL Time Warner content will no longer be pale
yellow. But that does not explain why Time Warner was willing to be
bought by a company that, by every measure except market valuation,
is a mere fraction of its own size. So let me try to answer the big
questions raised by this deal.
</P>
<P>
   First, is this a good idea on Time Warner's part? The answer,
which we can state very definitely, is that nobody knows. For one
thing, remember that even Time Warner is basically selling
entertainment, and what Nathanael West declared to be the
fundamental principle of Hollywood still goes for multimedia:
``Nobody knows anything.'' Never forget that among the key
properties of the supposedly solid half of this marriage is _ you
guessed it _ Looney Tunes.
</P>
<P>
   To the time-honored uncertainty of the entertainment business we
must add the brand new (or is that new brand?) uncertainty involved
in the valuations of Internet companies. As such companies go, AOL
is unusually solid: more service provider than dot-com, it has
genuine consumer loyalty, a universally recognized brand name, and
even makes profits. But does this justify a market value of well
over $10 million per employee? Or will AOL 2000 end up being like
Polaroid 1972 _ a company so famous, so loved that its name ended
up becoming a common noun, but a disaster for the investors who
thought that made it a sure market winner? I don't know, but
neither does Gerald Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a good idea for AOL? On a strict market-value basis AOL
actually overpaid for Time Warner _ that is, its share of the
merged company is less than its share of the pre-deal stock
valuations. The theory of the (Steve) Case is that the acquisition
of Time Warner will create valuable synergies. Again, maybe _
unless five years from now we are all relying on wireless access,
and cable sounds hopelessly old-fashioned. I also have to admit
that I am (just) old enough to remember the conglomerate-building
era of the 1960s, an era that ended so badly that many thought the
word ``synergy'' would be permanently banned from the business
lexicon. (But then I thought ``empowerment'' would soon be laughed
out of circulation too.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, I know: I sound like a professor, not a businessman.
Companies have to make bets on the future, whether they like it or
not; Hamlet would not cut it as CEO. But the realistic uncertainty
surrounding this deal does have a direct bearing on the next
question: Does this merger, in which the new-era, e-business
company is clearly the senior partner, dispel once and for all any
doubts we may have about the validity of the extraordinary
valuations the market currently places on such companies?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, of course not: This deal was based on those
market valuations, and provides no real evidence about whether or
not they make sense. Only time, with a small ``t,'' will tell us
whether companies like AOL will ever be able to deliver the kind of
profits that will justify their current price.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the final question: Does this merger imply an end to the
dream of the Internet as an open, democratic place, where anyone's
voice caard?
</P>
<P>
   No _ because the expectations that drove this merger could be
wrong. But the deal is based on the belief that a big piece of the
electronic prairie can indeed be fenced off, that a big company can
create a zone of influence within which people watch or listen to
its content, coming over its wires, and pay for the privilege. If
the cyber-libertarian dream of the Net as a world without
boundaries is right, some big businessmen have just made a very big
mistake.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief
executive, urged the assembled press corps earlier this week to
look at the body language among the executives on stage as proof of
how harmoniously his company would blend with America Online, the
row of men in the spotlight fidgeted in uncomfortable silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then Robert Pittman, president of America Online, leaned back
and put his arms around his Time Warner neighbors. If the gesture
did not necessarily provide assurance of a happy cultural mesh, it
did draw laughter and managed to defuse an awkward moment.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, 46, once a high-profile figure in New York's elite
media scene who began his corporate career running the Movie
Channel at a predecessor company to Time Warner, now carries around
a Libretto notebook computer and conducts business through America
Online's instant message feature. With a foot in both worlds _ and
an affinity for the limelight _ he is expected to be a key figure
in stitching together the old media with the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of me as a forward scout,'' Pittman said Tuesday from
Palm Springs, Calif., where he and Richard Parsons, who are to
share the job of chief operating officer at the merged company, to
be known as AOL Time Warner, were speaking to a group of investment
bankers from Salomon Smith Barney. ``The truth is these two
companies are a lot alike. What we both think about is the
consumer, what are people doing, and how do we serve them and
create new value.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by most accounts, the two companies are more similar
than they appear.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has long fancied itself a mass media company, and
many of its top executives have been drawn from the ranks of
traditional media companies. The people who run Time Warner's
entertainment properties, particularly in Los Angeles, pride
themselves on being quick to make deals. And the dress code has
relaxed even at the company's more buttoned-down editorial offices
in New York, where 10 years ago men were virtually required to wear
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Time Warner has casual dress five days a week, one
America Online senior executive said Tuesday with some relief.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at AOL this week, the buzz held that the merger with
Time Warner would be easier than had been that with Netscape
Communications, the Silicon Valley software company America Online
acquired in 1998. Many of Netscape's star programmers have since
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives in turn said they expected the merger
with America Online to run far more smoothly than Time Inc.'s
notoriously prolonged integration with Warner Communications after
they merged in 1989 to form Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Dockers guys,'' said a senior executive at Time
Warner from the Time Inc. side of the business. ``Latte-drinking
nice guys. These are not Hollywood killer types.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the melding of an Internet company at which jobs change
weekly and employees are compensated largely in stock options and a
corporate hierarchy known for its devotion to tradition may
encounter some difficulties. At America Online, where instant
messages hyperlinked to the company's stock price flit across
computer screens all day, there was off-the-record dismay Tuesday
at the performance of the company's stock, which closed down $6.75,
at $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   At Time Warner, there was a David-and-Goliath issue, the sense
that an august old-media institution had been felled by a smaller,
more agile competitor. ``There is a recognition that new media is
big, that this is a sea change, that this is momentous,'' said one
executive, who insisted on anonymity. ``And somehow this company
with a fifth of our revenues and far less cash flow came along and
took us over. We've seen it before. How did WorldCom buy MCI? But
it's a little different when it happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. was once a company that embodied a certain Ivy League
gentility. In the 1950s and 1960s, after the editors closed an
issue of the magazine, a waiter brought a cart with wine and hard
liquor for a celebratory toast. Now, some Time Warner executives
believe that the merger with Warner Communications 10 years ago and
the ascension of Levin has brought about a certain anodyne quality,
almost a neutral environment.
</P>
<P>
   There is no drinking in the office. The headquarters building at
Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan is a big, rather bland
monolith. A nest of wires runs along the ceiling of the Time
magazine offices, and in the right frame of mind can resemble the
corporate environment portrayed in the 1985 movie ``Brazil,'' which
satirized a post-apocalypse corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   One Time Warner executive said that Levin purposefully affects a
mien of utter calm. ``He has had a charisma bypass,'' the executive
said. Parsons, he added, is a consummate politician, even-handed
and almost benign in his ability to assuage demands and dented egos
from all sides of the Time Warner corporate edifice.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, at AOL's headquarters next to Dulles Airport in the
Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia, the company's chairman and
chief executive, Stephen Case, not long ago held regular beer
parties on Fridays, and Pittman has weekly staff meetings that are
often raucous. Built on a sprawling site that was once a British
Aerospace hangar, America Online's headquarters consist of two
glass creative centers referred to as CC1 and CC2. Whether an art
director at InStyle, Time Warner's successful new celebrity
lifestyle magazine, would consider the work done in them to be
creative is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   And while Pittman has been careful to emphasize the similarities
of the two companies this week, he may well try to import America
Online's faster pace and more experimental method to the newly
merged company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once said something about how hard it is to get your mind
around the pace,'' said Don Davis, the relatively new chief
operating officer of AOL's interactive properties group. ``Pittman
goes, `Aw, what's the matter? You'll get no sympathy in this room.'
It's kind of like you're on the moon. It's a perspective that's
hard to describe.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentless rate of change may be why some other efforts to
combine new and old media have flopped. Most recently, the attempt
by Barry Diller, who controls USA Networks, to merge his cable
holdings with Lycos, an Internet search engine and information
portal, failed when a major Lycos shareholder opposed the
combination because it did not offer a premium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional media companies have gotten into more trouble
trying to delve into the Internet on their own. Time Warner is
often held up as a textbook example of such failures. The company's
experiment in interactive television in Orlando, Fla., for
instance, cost thousands of dollars per household and never quite
worked. And though Time Warner was ahead of its old media
colleagues in creating Pathfinder, an umbrella site on the World
Wide Web for all of its properties, the venture lost millions of
dollars and was scrapped last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Time Warner has been an internal clash of
cultures, that's what's kept them from being able to put together a
Web property that works,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``Internal politics destroyed it; they
shredded themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With access to AOL's 20 million subscribers, the unwillingness
of Time Warner's many divisions to devote their resources to the
Internet may change. Selling the idea to them, and uniting them
behind it, is most likely to be largely left to Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Levin made a point of welcoming Pittman back, saying
that some of the best work Pittman had done at America Online was
rooted in what he had learned as a builder of brands and consumer
marketer at Warner. Pittman, several executives with long tenure at
the Time Warner said, is perceived as a known quantity. Friendly
with many Time Warner managers, he and his wife, Veronique, dine
regularly with Levin and his wife. Don Logan, the chief executive
of Time Inc., said the two men see themselves as kindred spirits,
bonded by their passion for marketing, and both are from the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it's like coming home,'' Pittman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the company's headquarters to be split between New York
and Dulles, he has not decided yet just where he will live, Pittman
said. He owns homes in Great Falls, Va.; Manhattan; Jamaica and
Telluride, Colo. Pictured on the cover of New York magazine in 1990
as the ``Couple of the Minute'' with his first wife, Sandy, Pittman
has since remarried and has two sons, one from his first marriage
and one from his second. A few months back, he made Forbes
magazine's list of the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a United Methodist minister from southern
Mississippi, Pittman has carved out a ron as archmarketer.
From his first job as a teen-age radio disc jockey, he has had a
knack for sensing what the consuming public wants, or at least how
to package it and sell it.
</P>
<P>
   At a Thanksgiving gathering on an uncle's farm in Holly Springs,
Miss., when Pittman was in the second grade, the horse he was
riding threw him off and kicked him in the face until it was so
bloodied that nobody could tell what was still left underneath. A
trip to the hospital determined that his right eye had been lost.
Tom Pittman, who witnessed the accident, believes that the glass
replacement sharpened his brother's determination to understand
other people's motivations, the better to fit in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never could play ball because he could never see where the
ball was coming from,'' said Tom Pittman, who is the publisher of a
newspaper in DeSoto, Miss. ``But he became a pretty keen observer
of human nature and what other people were interested in, how to
determine that, how to fit in with that. He learned to do that very
well. Even the sports guys liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   After building WNBC in New York into the leading television
station in the country, Pittman landed at Warner Amex Satellite,
where he helped to found MTV. When Viacom bought MTV _ along with
the other channels Pittman helped to create, VH1 and Nickelodeon _
he briefly headed his own company, Quantum Media, at which he
introduced Morton Downey Jr. to television. Returning to Time
Warner in 1990 at the behest of Steve Ross, who was chairman,
Pittman acquired the Six Flags theme parks and bolstered the parks'
attendance and brand awareness. When a controlling share of Six
Flags was bought by a new investor, Pittman was unable to reach an
agreement on what his equity stake should be, and he departed to
run Century 21 Real Estate Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He joined America Online just as the service was imploding.
Having decided that it needed to switch to flat-rate pricing to
keep its customers, AOL proceeded to sacrifice its lucrative
per-hour connect fees and simultaneously enraged its customers by
being totally unprepared to handle the ensuing spike in usage of
its network.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman is credited with stabilizing the company, expanding its
customer service, and, significantly, selling it as a credible
stock to Wall Street investors. Since he arrived at the company in
October 1996, AOL stock has risen 3,100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   `People say AOL exists because of Steve, but it works because of
Bob,'' said Mark Stavish, America Online's chief of human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, chairman of Cendant Corp., Pittman's former
boss at Century 21 and the godfather of his 8-month-old son, said
Pittman's role at the world's largest media company would have less
to do with the touchy-feely blending of corporate cultures and more
to do with his traditional strength: selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's a marketing guy,'' Silverman said. ``What Bob did best
at AOL is he got the stock up and he gave the company a currency
that enabled it to acquire Time Warner. I would assume that would
be what he's expected to continue to do. He'll be asking what he's
always asked: `What can we sell, whom can we sell it to and at what
price can we sell it.''

REFORM PARTY STRUGGLES TO HOLD TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Minn., Texas, Calif., Colo., Fla., Mich., Conn.)  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ On election night 14 months ago, the Reform Party
celebrated a rare and stunning victory, the triumph of Jesse
Ventura as Minnesota's governor, the highest office ever won by a
member of Ross Perot's upstart political organization.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of unifying a party that delivered 19 percent of the
presidential vote to Perot in 1992 and 8 percent to him four years
later, Ventura's victory has touched off a succession of internal
battles, leaving the party fractured and weakened and heading into
the 2000 campaign without a clear-cut presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions are so deep that aides to Perot, who has largely
disappeared from public view since 1996, say he is considering
another presidential run this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is just holding on, and it's not holding on very
well,'' said Jack Gargan, the new party chairman. ``We're
drifting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party has split over a power struggle between two
rival factions, those who still regard Perot, the Texas
billionaire, as the titular head and those led by Gargan, who say
that Ventura, a former professional wrestler, has earned the role
by virtue of his election.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two groups agree on almost nothing. Each group
has accused the other of trying to wrest control of the party, and
each, for now, is backing a different candidate to win the
presidential nomination in August. Perot loyalists have coalesced
around Pat Buchanan, the conservative who left the Republican Party
last year after several failed efforts to become its presidential
nominee. Ventura and his supporters favor Donald Trump, the New
York developer, if he decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   The groups cannot even agree on where to hold the summer
convention _ the Ventura group is fighting for Minnesota; Perot's
supporters, for Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how this cat fight is going to come out,'' said
Ray Lashley, co-chairman of the Colorado Reform Party, expressing a
view held by many Reform Party leaders around the country. ``But I
am extremely concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   And although the squabbles are largely taking place among senior
party leaders, state officials say the impact is threatening the
organization's growth by undermining the already difficult efforts
to recruit credible candidates to run at the state, county and city
levels. Besides Ventura, only a handful of Reform candidates won in
1996, mostly for municipal posts, but expectations have been for
greater numbers this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, members are looking for help,'' said Judy Duffy,
former chairwoman of the California Reform Party. ``But national is
not providing money or direction or telling us how to build our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only things uniting the rival groups are the party's
need to win at least 5 percent of the presidential vote to qualify
for $12.6 million in federal campaign money in the 2004 election
and its collective anger over criteria announced by the Commission
of President Debates that could prevent the Reform nominee from
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, one of Perot's closest associates and the
party's only chairman until Gargan succeeded him, said Perot would
prefer to remain on the sidelines ``in a passive role'' while
another candidate wins the party nomination this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he hasn't ruled out the possibility of running himself,
should he make that decision,'' Verney said from Dallas. ``If this
circuslike atmosphere gets out of hand, I could see him stepping
out, thinking the party needs some adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot was not available for comment. Verney said he was
concentrating on business and not conducting any political
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Within the party, unity began unraveling either in 1996 or
sometime after Ventura's election, depending on who is interpreting
events.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, a retired financial consultant from Cedar Key, Fla., who
became national chairman this month, said it all started during the
last presidential campaign, when Perot re-entered the race as the
Reform candidate after bowing out, a reversal that pushed aside
Dick Lamm, a Democrat and former Colorado governor, who had built
considerable support among party activists.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, Perot won fewer than half the votes he
got in 1992, but some Reform Party leaders said they believed he
inserted himself only to keep intact an organization, should he try
again in 2000 _ a perception that was fueled, Gargan said, by
Perot's unwillingness to help Ventura in his campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse came, seeking help, but they only went through the
motions,'' Gargan said, referring to Perot and his allies. ``That
was the real cause of the rift.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Verney, who insisted that Perot looked favorably
upon the new governor as a rising party leader, saying that Perot
felt Ventura ``had all the potential to take us to greater heights.
But it hasn't worked out.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Verney's view, trouble started at last year's Reform Party
convention in Dearborn, Mich., when the newly elected governor
threatened to abandon the party if Gargan was not elected to
succeed Verney as chairman. Perot loyalists at the time were
supporting another candidate, Patricia Benjamin of New Jersey.
Gargan won with 61 percent of the vote, a victory, he said, that
reflected a growing sentiment that too much power still rested in
Dallas with Perot and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, bad feelings toward Ventura grew worse, Verney said,
after Ventura expressed several controversial opinions in an
interview that appeared in last November's issue of Playboy
magazine. In it, he called for the legalization of prostitution and
the decriminalization of drug use and characterized organized
religion as ``a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people.'' Ventura
also said accusations of sexual abuse by women against Navy
officers in the Tailhook scandal constituted ``much ado about
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said those kinds of remarks shocked many party loyalists
and eroded Ventura's stature within the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost an enormous amount of credibility and the moral
authority to be our leader,'' Verney said. ``All things being
equal, he is less persuasive now. He would have been a very big
influence, but he sacrificed that to the Playboy interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side has the more accurate view of party disarray,
animosities have evolved into a tortuous battle over control of the
party. Just last month, about 20 party members, mostly Perot
loyalists, formed a new group within the party called the Reform
Leadership Council, an organization Verney said would refocus the
party on its founding issues, like campaign finance reform and good
government. ``It is not in competition with the party leadership;
it's complementary,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But Gargan called the new group ``a shadow government'' and a
direct slap at Ventura, whose personality and policies, like free
trade and abortion rights, do not sit well with many Perot
loyalists, including Buchanan. With obvious sarcasm, Ventura said
on Friday: ``There is no split. Jack Gargan is our leader and all
the others are former leaders, like former Super Bowl champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side prevails will be evident in how the party
resolves major issues like the presidential nominating process and
the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   For now, any registered voter, regardless of party affiliation,
can cast a ballot to pick the Reform nominee, a system that
potentially holds different advantages for different Reform
candidates. Buchanan, for example, could generate strong support
from conservative Republicans who might think Trump is too moderate
on social issues like abortion. Or it could help Trump build
advantages in states where he is better known, like New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan has vowed to call for a vote of the 150 national
committee members to change the primary process by restricting
participation to the 1 million or so registered Reform party
members. Others oppose change, saying the open process helps build
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over the convention site have raged since early last
year, when the party's 11-member executive committee voted
unanimously to hold the convention in Minnesota, an advantage for
any candidate backed by Ventura. Verney called for another vote in
September, even before the Playboy controversy, and this time, the
vote was 8-3 for Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura forces took the matter into federal court in St. Paul,
Minn., but lost when a judge last month rejected their plea to have
the vote discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Gargan said he was planning to hold a national
committee meeting soon to decide the convention site once and for
all despite the fact that the party has signed a contract with Long
Beach and made a deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said all the bickering amounted to little more than
``temper tantrums'' by the Gargan forces that would fade once the
party picks its presidential candidate. Gargan vowed he would fight
on until the powers of ``the Dallas faction'' were diminished.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves many party members disillusioned and fearful
that whatever noble ideals that led to the party's founding will be
submerged in chaos and the party will be rendered virtually
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us turn our backs on these petty quarrels and
try to do what we did in the first place,'' said Lashley, the
Colorado chairman. ``If not, there's a grave possibility we will
not achieve anything we want to achieve this year. That dismays me
quite a bit.''

 &HT;    PointOne raises $55 million for expansion
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ PointOne Telecommunications Inc., a 2-year-old
communications startup, raised $55 million from investors to help
develop its international long-distance voice and data network.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one of the largest private investments in an Austin,
Texas, company.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses Internet technology to deliver high-quality
voice and data communications for a range of customers, including
local telephone companies, small long-distance companies, Internet
service providers and small- to mid-size corporations.
</P>
<P>
   PointOne's network, which serves 25 cities in the United States
as well as Shanghai, China, will be expanded to 90 cities by
mid-year, company officials said. The 65-employee company expects
to grow to 120 workers during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   PointOne officials also said their company has secured $100
million in lease financing from a major maker of communications
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   PointOne declined to disclose the name of that hardware maker.
But the company has said that it has a special relationship with
what used to be Ascend Communications, which had been PointOne's
major supplier of routers since its formation. Ascend last year was
bought by Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The equity investment group was led by affiliates of Soros
Private Equity Partners and J&AMP;W Seligman &AMP; Co. Inc. Other investors
are Aurora Investments, an affiliate tied to principals of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts and Co., and the Texas Growth Fund. Hoak Breedlove
Wesneski &AMP; Co., a Dallas-based investment bank, served as
PointOne's investment adviser in the deal.

BRITISH CALL PINOCHET UNFIT FOR TRIAL AND MAY SEND HIM HOME TO
CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for refinements, additional details, updating and quotes
throughout)  
 (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain declared Tuesday night that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet was medically unfit to stand trial in Spain and that it
was now inclined to abandon the extradition case against him. The
statement opens the way for the former Chilean dictator to avoid
charges of crimes against humanity and to return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw released the results of a Jan. 5
examination of the 84-year-old general by four British specialists
and said he was ``minded'' to ``take the view that no purpose would
be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical report and Straw's reaction to it appeared to mark
the closing stages of a case that has shaken international law,
galvanized human rights and exile groups and stirred bitter and
passionate old antagonisms in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for nearly 15
months awaiting the outcome of complicated legal and judicial moves
surrounding a Spanish judge's request to send him to Madrid to face
35 charges of torture and conspiracy to torture stemming from the
days of his strongman rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Straw did not make clear how soon he might exercise his power to
put an end to the extradition proceedings, on compassionate grounds
of age and health. But he said he was writing to various rights
groups that have been party to the case and to Spain, Chile and
countries like France, Belgium and Switzerland that have made
extradition requests of their own and was asking for answers back
within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Robertson, a spokesman for Pinochet, said he was
delighted at the announcement. The general's principal lawyer,
Michael Caplan, said only that it was `` a very important
development in the case at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In obtaining a decision from England's highest court, the Law
Lords of the House of Lords, formally throwing out the general's
claim that he could not be tried for acts during the time that he
was a head of state, the case has fundamentally altered the law of
sovereign immunity and established new international powers for
people seeking redress of human rights abuses, even in courts
outside the country where crimes were alleged to have been
committed.
</P>
<P>
   The point was reflected in the response of Kenneth Roth,
executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said, ``Heads of
state no longer enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical tests last week were scheduled after the Chilean
Embassy submitted evidence in October from Pinochet's doctors that
his health had declined markedly. He was said to have suffered a
series of small strokes in September.
</P>
<P>
   Straw then asked Pinochet to consent to an independent
examination, and his office selected the four doctors, specialists
respectively in gerontology, geriatric medicine, neurology and
neuropsychology. The seven-hour examination was conducted in
Spanish _ Pinochet does not speak English _ and two of the
physicians, Straw said, were fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was the ``unequivocal and unanimous'' conclusion
``that following recent deterioration in the state of Senator
Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during
September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial,
and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The general was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, as he lay
in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. The British
police made their surprise move in response to an application from
a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, seeking his extradition to Madrid
to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and
murder in connection with the disappearance of more than 3,000
people in the 17 years after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish
judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into
the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s. The Spanish
government, though forced by circumstance to pursue the case, has
shown little enthusiasm for it from the outset, and Tuesday night
Spain's Foreign Ministry said it would ``respect the decisions of
the British government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges in a
ruling by the High Court that upheld his claim to sovereign
immunity. But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the
Law Lords overturned that decision, saying that being a head of
state did not excuse crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the
original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty
International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision
was even more emphatic on the principle than the first one, though
it drastically reduced the number of charges and narrowed the scope
to torture and conspiracy to torture. The case then moved on to the
validity of the extradition order itself, which was upheld by a
London magistrate last October and then appealed, leading to a plan
for another hearing on March 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the one appearance in court that Pinochet has been obliged to
make, he maintained the defiant attitude he adopted from the
beginning, saying he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any
court outside of one in Chile to try him and saying he was innocent
of ``all the lies of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Every hearing and court date over the 14 months has seen crowds
of supporters and opponents behind barricades angrily facing down
one another, hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and
placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 13 months, the general has been living under house
arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's
exclusive southern suburbs. He had periodic visits from Chilean
supporters and backers of his in this country, the most visible of
whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her office
said Tuesday night that she was delighted with the doctors' report
and that she expected Straw to be a ``very fair man'' and order the
general's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reyes, a former journalist imprisoned by the Pinochet
government who speaks for a group representing Chileans abroad,
said, ``It's unbelievable that a criminal should escape justice
because perhaps he is ill.''
</P>
<P>
   But other opponents of Pinochet were more resigned to the
apparent inconclusive end of the case. ``I am not surprised to hear
this, and much as I regard Pinochet as a blood-soaked tyrant, if
the doctors say he is unfit to stand trial then he is unfit to
stand trial,'' said George Galloway, a Labor member of Parliament.

 Worms and Germs Bait Biotech's Hooks  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Private biotech firms tried to get Wall Street's attention with
talk of promising worms and germs on the second day of the Chase
H&AMP;Q Life Sciences conference.
<P>
   The event, which offers several thousand money managers and
venture capitalists a chance to meet with executives from 250
firms, typically gives a few private firms a chance to strut their
stuff in front of analysts and investors before plunging into a
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby of the Westin St. Francis yesterday filled with soggy
biotech executives with cell phones glued to one ear, who glanced
at name tags as they waited for appointments with the dealmakers
beneath the hotel's antique grandfather clock.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, privately held Exelixis Inc. of South San Francisco
made its splash, announcing a $100 million deal to help the German
chemical and pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG develop agricultural
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Exelixis has made its niche by studying the genes
of tiny worms, obscure fungi and fruitflies. In an interview
yesterday, CEO George Scangos said the Bayer deal would go a long
way toward supporting the company's 145-person payroll and
lessening the annual deficits that makes investors leery of small
biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Scangos was coy about whether Exelixis is planning an IPO, but
with interest in biotech stocks high after a long dry spell,
industry observers expect that many private players will go public
in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Sangamo BioSciences of Point Richmond was another private firm
at the conference that seems to be angling for an IPO. The
40-person startup has developed a technology to turn any gene on or
off. In an interview Monday, Sangamo CEO Ed Lanphier said that
ability could lead to drugs that might switch off a disease caused
by a genetic excess, or the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Sangamo used the conference to announce that Chiron Corp.
co-founder Bill Rutter is joining its board of directors _ a board
that already includes Genentech co-founder Herb Boyer. ``We think
it's the first time they've ever served on a board together,''
Lanphier said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Sangamo announced a deal, worth up to $40 million, to
help Baxter Healthcare Corp. find ways to turn on the genes that
would build new blood vessels in people with weak hearts. Between
that and similar deals, ``we expect to be cash flow positive in
2000,'' Lanphier said.
</P>
<P>
   While the private firms jostled for attention, Chase H&AMP;Q analyst
Robert Olan led a panel debate about whether genomics _ the study
of how genes affect human health _ was the beginning of a
fundamental change in the drug discovery process, or a stock bubble
about to burst.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Randy Scott, president of Incyte
Pharmaceuticals, one of the firms racing to discover and patent
human genes, argued that drug and biotech companies are still in
the early stages of incorporating genomics techniques into their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Levy, senior vice president for American Home Products,
agreed, to a point. He said spending on genomics already accounted
for 10 percent of his direct and indirect research budget but was
unlikely to gain a larger share.
</P>
<P>
   Moderator Olan sent a chuckle through the crowded conference
hall when he raised the issue of gene patents. Incyte, Celera,
Hyseq and other genomics firms have filed so many patents, &LR;  on so
many gene fragments, &LR;  that ``812 percent of the genome is
covered,'' Olan joked, as he asked panelists whether patent issues
made them apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patent landscape is a minefield,'' Levy said. ``We have
established job security for a generation of patent lawyers.''

COMMENTARY: NO MORE GUILT ABOUT GILT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I woke up feeling intensely guilty.
</P>
<P>
   When I was young, I used to go into a dark box at church and
confess all kinds of guilt: about talking back to my parents, about
unkindnesses, about impure thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   But now I feel guilty about just one thing: not being a
millionaire. On the glowing boxes of my adulthood, the TV and
computer, people are constantly getting rich quick.
</P>
<P>
   When Time Warner merged with AOL, some predicted the end of
print, and my life passed before my eyes. But I was far more
disturbed that I had lost yet another opportunity to cash in, or to
cash out.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at Time in the early '80s. The magazine was not on the
cutting edge of technology then. When Time made the computer ``Man
of the Year'' in 1982, we were still pounding out our stories on
typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hold onto my Time stock. And on Monday many of my old
colleagues became multimillionaires. If there's a way to lose
money, I'll find it.
</P>
<P>
   I called a Washington psychoanalyst named Justin Frank. I told
him I didn't want to feel deeply inadequate just because I didn't
know how to day-trade.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed his own feelings of inadequacy. ``As a
psychoanalyst, I subjectively feel like a dinosaur because I am
exploring things in depth, and in the meantime everyone around me
has gotten rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I was driving somewhere and my children said, `Dad,
you're smart and funny and hip. Why didn't you invest in Internet
stocks? What's wrong with you?' I told them, `I'll take this under
advisement.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into an era of decisiveness as opposed to an era
of thoughtfulness. People feel guilty if they have a subconscious
identification with Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   To trade or not to trade. I never cared about money before. It
was not what Country Joe and the Fish taught me to value.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, money was an occasion for guilt. The robber
barons who had exploited the poor would cleanse their lucre by
buying great art or pouring it into charity; the Guilted Age. But
now the only remorse that people feel about money is, why haven't
they made more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, new money tried to disguise itself as old money,'' says
Michael Lewis, who wrote ``The New New Thing,'' about a Silicon
Valley billionaire. ``It gave some of itself away. It dressed
itself up in airs and pretensions. Now old money cringes in the
face of new money. Now even new money gets stale fast, and has a
sell-by date.''
</P>
<P>
   We are obsessed about making money with our money. Making an
honest living does not seem like a particularly sensible thing to
do anymore when you can simply hold onto a stock that rises to the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen so many disgruntled people at the peak of a
bull market,'' says James Stewart, the author of ``Den of
Thieves,'' about the Wall Street scandals of the '80s, who is now
an editor at Smart Money. ``People look at their portfolios going
up 40 percent last year and they are whining and complaining to me
that they didn't own Qualcomm. They don't even know what Qualcomm
makes. If they had Qualcomm, they whine they wish they had more of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody brags about their gains. Nobody talks about their
losses. As a subject for boasting, portfolios have supplanted
sports and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cramer, the money manager who founded TheStreet.com, agrees:
``People used to be mortified to talk about how much money they
made. Now they get in my face and say, `I caught 79 points on
Oracle, what did you catch?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, you had to be intrepid or an MBA to get in on a
gold rush. Now your personal trainer knows as much about one-day
price movements as Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a land grab, where you had to go out west, brave
native Americans and horrible rains and run into the Donner
party,'' Cramer says. ``You don't have to brave anything at all.
You just have to have a predilection not to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   So the generation that prided itself on its idealism has finally
found its true signature. And the question that the children will
ask is: ``What did you do in the bull market, Daddy?''

 Feds OK Deal By E-Trade for Online Bank  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Federal thrift regulators said yesterday that they gave a go-ahead
to E-Trade Group's $1 billion purchase of online bank Telebanc
Financial Corp, a deal that will create one of the Internet's most
potent financial services competitors.
<P>
   The transaction, which could become official as early as today,
unites the nation's No. 2 online broker with the largest bank based
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park's E-Trade is expanding beyond securities into a full
array of financial products. Snapping up Telebanc provides a menu
of new offerings, including federally insured deposits and checking
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them a leading position in the online banking
arena,'' said Russell Keene, an analyst with the brokerage Putnam,
Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Telebanc calls itself a bank, it actually operates a
federally chartered savings and loan. Although Office of Thrift
Supervision approval of the takeover was expected, it didn't come
easily.
</P>
<P>
   To protect federal bank and thrift insurance funds, regulators
give extra scrutiny when a nonbank buys an insured institution.
Signaling its concern, the agency imposed several conditions on
E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   These include a requirement that the company clearly distinguish
between uninsured products sold through its brokerage operations
and insured deposits distributed through the thrift. The company
must also get agency approval for any significant changes in its
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that some analysts thought was a sore point was
resolved easily. The agency ruled that Softbank, the Japanese
software company that holds a 25 percent stake in E-Trade, won't be
subject to special regulation as a thrift holding company since it
doesn't exercise control over the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators took six months to review E-Trade's purchase
application, quick by agency standards but glacially slow in
Internet time. The pace produced a bit of drama, since either party
was free to kill the deal after December 31, and neither company
would say what it would do if the deadline passed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they will move quickly to combine the two
companies. Telebanc will keep its Arlington, Va., headquarters, but
its operating unit will begin using the name E-Trade Bank. The
companies are also likely to combine their Web sites soon.
</P>

 _ SF CHRON   New Workplace Laws Don't Apply to All 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I was interested in your December 22 column covering California
legislative changes that went into effect  &LR; law  &LR; January 1 affecting
businesses and employees,  &LR; that went into law January 1,
 &LR; particularly the one requiring employers who provide paid sick
leave to now allow employees to use up to half of it for care of a
sick parent, child or spouse.
<P>
   I work for a commercial airline with more than 100,000 employees
worldwide that spends millions on sick leave and uses intimidation
to keep the costs down. As a flight attendant, if I call in sick
three times in a 12-month period, I will have to meet with the
Wellness team. Considering that I work in a tube that can be filled
with germs, that seems a little unrealistic, but so it goes. I hope
the new law applies to me, but someone in my union office said
there is a loophole in the law &LR; , &LR;  excluding employees engaged in
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: I hate to dash your hopes, but it's true. California AB60
specifically excludes employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. The AFL-CIO Association of Flight Attendants is governed
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
</P>
<P>
   State law cannot override federal law, according to Susan Kemp,
the California Chamber of Commerce's labor law adviser. However,
she notes that when your current contract expires, your union is
free to negotiate similar wage and hour benefits for its members
with your employer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
More on Sick Leave
</P>
<P>
   Q: For exempt employees, can employers deduct paid sick leave
for partial-day absences due to doctor/dental visits or illness?
</P>
<P>
   My employer maintains separate employee accounts for sick time,
vacation time, floating holidays, etc. and its policy for exempt
employees is to deduct partial absences.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The Federal Fair Labor Standards Act governs exempt employees
who are paid a salary rather than an hourly rate, and deductions
from their salary and/or benefits must generally be in increments
of a full day. That means employers cannot deduct partial days
worked from exempt employees' salaries. However, there are two
schools of thought on deducting from their benefits for partial
workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers deduct for partial absences; others don't. Since
the law is unclear in this area, Kemp suggests that companies take
a more benevolent stance and allow exempt workers to take partial
days off without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; sh  &LR; Overtime Rules
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: My wife works for a district hospital in the Central
Valley and has been told that the new state overtime laws,
requiring overtime to be paid after eight hours worked in a day
rather than after 40 hours worked in a week, do not apply to her. I
thought district hospitals were a California invention to provide
health care facilities to outlying areas. She would love to go to
eight-hour 8-hour  &LR; shifts from the grueling 12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Kemp notes that district hospital employees are considered
public employees. Like collective bargaining employees, that makes
them subject to federal rules and immune from California's AB60.

JUDGES QUESTION NYC STANCE ON BROOKLYN MUSEUM FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Firing off questions laced with sarcasm and
incredulity, three federal appeals court judges Tuesday
relentlessly challenged City Hall's rationale for cutting financing
to the Brooklyn Museum of Art over an exhibition of contemporary
art that many found sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   The low moment for the city's lawyers came when Leonard Koerner,
chief assistant corporation counsel, asserted to the panel, ``This
is not a First Amendment case,'' a remark that drew widespread
laughter from the packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it isn't?'' asked Judge John Walker of the 2nd Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals, his eyebrows arched with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Jon Newman, jumped in to say that he had
considered the city's attempt to evict the museum and its 1.5
million pieces of art the most ``extraordinary'' feature of the
city's legal position _ until Koerner's suggestion that freedom of
expression did not apply to this case.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the appellate judges Tuesday in Manhattan was
narrow: whether to uphold a preliminary injunction that has
prevented the city from withholding monthly payments, proceeding
with eviction or taking any other steps to punish the museum for
staging ``Sensation,'' the controversial exhibition that angered
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the exhibition featured a painting of the
Virgin Mary with a breast fashioned from elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did not reach a decision Tuesday on the preliminary
injunction, but the arguments quickly swerved into broader
questions about the city's methods of subsidizing cultural
institutions, and the limits of its discretion to withhold money
when it deems a display to be offensive, particularly to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the exhibition is appropriate for
schoolchildren,'' Koerner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is every book in the New York Public Library appropriate for
children?'' Newman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Koerner replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they next?'' the judge shot back sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Koerner said, struggling to draw a distinction between
libraries and museum exhibitions that the judges seemed not to
appreciate. Koerner offered the hypothetical example of a
city-financed museum that decided to hold an exhibition celebrating
the Ku Klux Klan, or even pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the court would say we'd be required to fund
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too sure,'' came the caustic reply from Newman, who
in another First Amendment case was sharply critical of the city's
refusal last summer to grant a permit for a rally promoted as the
Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, meanwhile, was on a panel last year that ruled that the
city had violated the First Amendment when it refused to allow an
association of Hispanic police officers to march in uniform in
parades. And while he, too, appeared deeply troubled by the city's
actions against the museum, he also suggested that museum directors
who accept city money may have to accept some limits over their
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he noted, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law requiring
the National Endowment for the Arts to take decency standards into
account when making grants to artists. But without any clear
decency standards in the city's rules, he asked, will museums not
be left to guess what might offend City Hall's artistic tastes?
``It becomes the totally subjective view of the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The third judge, Sonia Sotomayor, also seemed bothered that the
city acted in the absence of any written rules or regulations. She
stressed that she had scrutinized the museum's lease for any
language that explicitly allowed the city to withhold money because
it disapproved of an exhibition's content. ``Can you point me to
anything?'' she asked Koerner, who acknowledged that there was no
such language.
</P>
<P>
   But Koerner drew a more receptive response on the question of
whether the museum would suffer ``irreparable harm'' without the
protection of a preliminary injunction. Proving such harm is a
critical element of preliminary injunctions, and the judges
repeatedly returned to it during their questioning of Floyd Abrams,
the museum's First Amendment lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The display ended Sunday after drawing roughly 180,000 people, a
strong attendance for contemporary art. With the show over, the
judges asked, what is the irreparable harm?
</P>
<P>
   ``But for this injunction,'' Abrams said, ``we would be punished
for showing this exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   As the judges consider the legality of the preliminary
injunction, the museum is continuing to lay the groundwork to
secure a permanent injunction from Nina Gershon, the federal judge
in Brooklyn who first heard the case. On Friday, Abrams took a
sworn statement from Schuyler Chapin, the city's cultural affairs
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to take Giuliani's statement.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Accommodations for the 15-day trip from Hong Kong were
a metal cargo container, covered by canvas and stacked atop several
other such tractor-trailer-size boxes in the hold of a giant
freighter called the Cape May. The only light was from flashlights.
Human waste was deposited in buckets. Food, primarily boxes of
vegetables, ran out at some point. The seas were particularly
rough.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cape May pulled into Seattle and the containers were
taken off late Monday afternoon, 15 men from China stumbled out of
the metal box, dazed, dehydrated and gravely hungry. The stowaways,
illegal immigrants who had agreed to pay tens of thousands of
dollars in future wages to smugglers, pointed to the garbage-strewn
container, indicating even grimmer news. Inside were the bodies of
three men who had died during the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These containers were designed to carry machinery and cargo _
not people,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. ``The people aboard the Cape May were
effectively entombed.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 times in recent weeks, officials at ports on the
west coast of the United States and Canada have found human beings
in cargo containers, a reflection of an alarming new trend in
smuggling that has now turned deadly and of the extraordinary steps
that Chinese laborers are willing to take to reach North America
and the jobs they are promised here.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost certainly more instances in which such
travelers have managed to make it across without detection, as some
freighters carry 1,000 containers or more. There is no question
that more such human-laden boxes are on the way, officials say. At
5 a.m. Tuesday, another 19 Chinese men, all relatively young and in
apparent good health, were discovered in a cargo container aboard
the Hanjin Yokohma, which had also sailed from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   With American and Canadian officials expressing shock at the
recent discoveries, Hong Kong authorities pledged a crackdown
Tuesday on the illegal trafficking, which has been detected so far
in freighters arriving here and in Long Beach, Calif., and
Vancouver, B.C. Conditions in the containers vary widely: some,
with ventilation punched through the canvas tops and with furniture
and electric heaters and lights, seem to be somewhat endurable. But
in other cases, particularly aboard the Cape May, they are
nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Coleman, the acting director of the immigration service
in Seattle, of the Cape May stowaways: ``I've simply never seen
people so disoriented, so distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet whether the three dead people aboard the
freighter perished from exposure to the cold in their unheated
containers, lack of water, or perhaps a combination of the two,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 who survived the journey in the 40-foot-long, 8-foot
wide metal box, seven remain in Harborview Medical Center in
satisfactory condition, all being treated for dehydration or
malnutrition, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for the hospital. Eight
others, able to eat solid food, were released Tuesday into the
custody of the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   Under American immigration laws, unless they can establish a
well-grounded fear of persecution in their native country, the
stowaways will likely be deported to China in weeks. In recent
days, U. S. authorities have repatriated at least 246 recent
stowaways to China, some who arrived in containers and others
elsewhere on ships.
</P>
<P>
   American officials hope that word of the repatriations may deter
others from making the hazardous journeys, but such actions have
hardly stemmed the tide in the past. As unemployment increases in
China and the demand for cheap labor continues in this country,
some experts think it will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants found in the last couple of weeks are not the
first on record to make the crossing in dark, cramped metal
containers, but there has never before been such a rash of
crossings discovered. Why it is occurring now is not certain,
although Irene Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the immigration
service, said it might be a response to crackdowns on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly couldn't speak for the smugglers, but it seems
it's simply a new avenue that they've tried to open recently,'' she
said. ``When one method doesn't work so well, they try something
new. That goes for drug smuggling or human smuggling. And if this
doesn't work so well, they'll try some other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, she said, officials do not believe that the
shipping companies are knowing accomplices. The crew may make the
entire crossing without having any reason to know that people are
in the containers stacked in the hold. In the case of the Cape May,
no action has been taken against the officers or crew.
</P>
<P>
   As awful as the containers' conditions can be, it is not clear
that the journey inside them is any more dangerous than those in
which hundreds of people are crammed aboard older ships that travel
at much slower speeds, sometimes taking two months or more to cross
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine anything worse than the crossing of
those in the Cape May container. In Washington, Ken Elwood, deputy
executive associate commissioner of field operations with the
immigration service, said there was something particularly
appalling about the case: the discovery of irregular rips in the
canvas top and other evidence that at least some of the occupants
had frantically tried to escape the container, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically this had to be terrible,'' Elwood said.
``Evidently they had tried desperately to tear the top off the
container and get out. It's horrific to think what happened to
those people.''

`GOD, PLEASE HELP ME': QUADS' MOTHER GETS LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Elizabeth Shannon Whittle, 25, convicted in Novem
ber of severely shaking her in fant quadruplets, will die in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The children's father, Anthony Perez, 23, will be free after
five years, giving him the chance at life that his family and
friends had begged the judge for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God! Dear God, please help me!'' Whittle wailed as Judge
Roger Kaufman of Mari copa County Superior Court sen tenced her to
172{ years in prison, Arizona's longest term for child abuse in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence for Whittle, which came two days after An thony
Jr., Megan, Robert and Damian turned 2, is lengthy be cause she was
convicted of ``dan gerous crimes against children,'' which carry
mandatory sen tences and no chance of early release.
</P>
<P>
   The terms for each count ranged from 2{ years to 24 years for
the worst offenses, mostly those involving Anthony Jr., who has
been left blind, deaf and incapacitated by the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman did not give Whittle the minimum sentence on any count,
citing a pattern of abuse that left the four babies with more than
70 fractures. As the children's mother, the judge said, Whittle
violated a special trust when she hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle's attorneys say they will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   When she addressed the court, Whittle again denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve life in prison because I didn't hurt my
babies,'' she wailed, sobbing. ``I know I didn't hurt my babies.
They con victed me on lies! Lies!''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kaufman asked Whittle to be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, separated from his wife by their lawyers, cried silently.
He, too, proclaimed himself and Whittle innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good and decent person,'' said his attorney, Em met
Ronan, asking Kaufman to put the young father on proba tion.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Perez will never see his kids again is pun
ishment enough, Ronan argued.
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave Perez five years in prison for failing to get
medical care for Anthony Jr. and suspended sentencing on the three
counts for the other babies. Upon release, Perez must serve five
years on probation, submit himself to drug and alcohol test ing and
take parenting classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the jury did not find that Perez injured the ba
bies, nor that he knew they were injured. However, the judge said
the babies would have been in consolable and obviously in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing was delayed half an hour when the judge, known
for his promptness, was trapped between floors in a courthouse
elevator. Maintenance crews had to pry open the door.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, it was stand ing room only. Social workers,
nurses and others who testified during the trial sat together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied that justice was served in this case,'' prose
cutor Patricia Nigro said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindaruth Carnett Estes, director of Victims of Child Abuse
Legislation and Laws, an advocacy group for people who say they are
wrongly accused, called the sentence ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You murder someone, you get 25 years, and you're out in
eight,'' she said, citing other cases where mothers have killed
their chil dren and gotten less time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the mother of Ashley Guerard, who was 7 months old
when she died of a skull fracture in May 1997, got six months in
jail. And Sally Ann Rabens pleaded no contest to negligent homicide
in the suffo cation death of her month-old son in March 1993 and
was put on probation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before 1997, when Arizona's lawmakers stiffened the
state's ``dangerous crimes against children'' statutes, setting
mandatory prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Perez babies were 4 months old when they were vio lently
shaken in the spring of 1998. They suffered fractured skulls,
retinal hemorrhages, bro ken bones and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled in Juve nile Court for Friday to decide
what will happen to the infants, now in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona law allows for their parents' rights to be severed
because the children have been in the state's care for more than 15
of the past 22 months and because the parents have been convicted
of child abuse, said Karin Kline of state Child Protec tive
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The children's foster parents want to adopt them. Anthony lives
in one home, Megan in another, and Robert and Damian in a third.
They visit regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is blind and deaf. He cannot walk or even crawl. His
head is grossly misshapen.
</P>
<P>
   Megan has cerebral palsy and is stiff and in pain from her
fractures. She and Anthony Jr. have shunts in their brains be cause
of bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Damian are slow in speech and likely will have other
developmental delays.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deciding Whittle's fate had no idea what sentence she
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``As jurors, one of our biggest fears was that after rendering
our verdict, we would discover that there was evidence we were not
allowed to hear that would have changed our verdict,'' juror Dan
Hadley said. ``I have not heard any evidence that would make me
regret my decision.'' &QL;

 Computer Consultants Busy Handling Y2K Glitches and New Business  
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Mark Griffin of San Francisco's Automatic Garage Door Corp. used
the Y2K scare not just to patch his company's computer systems but
to entirely replace them.
<P>
   Like many other small-business owners, Griffin unfortunately
waited a tad too long. When he finally got around to overhauling
his 5-year-old computer system just two days before New Year's with
$20,000 worth of new Dell PCs, a Microsoft NT server and other
gear, there wasn't enough time to completely check out all systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Automatic Garage had to call Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer
Computer Consulting Services for help after it opened for business
for the first time this year. Its check-writing and accounts
payable functions didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few other small businesses suffered similar
high-tech hangovers. After doing absolutely nothing to prepare for
Y2K, Osaka Sushi in Davis reopened for business on January 2 to
find its aging Sable Technology computer system acting like a dead
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The server was stuck on March 27, 1972, and refused to take food
orders or accept credit cards. Owner Alan Vu whipped out his trusty
calculator to compute bills and changed the restaurant's policy to
accept checks instead of cards. He also quickly ordered a new
$3,089 Sable server.
</P>
<P>
   During this past year, U.S. businesses and government agencies
spent an estimated $100 billion to $150 billion on hardware,
software and labor to assess, repair and test their computer
systems for Y2K glitches. That was a small but significant part of
the total $862 billion that Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn.,
figures was spent in North America last year on telecommunications,
hardware, software and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a buy-and-scrap mentality, and Y2K was a great excuse
for companies to upgrade their computers,'' said Gartner research
director Dale Vecchio. ``The byproduct of Y2K remediation was a lot
of down payments on information technology infrastructure
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some consultants who specialized in rewriting computer
code to cope with Y2K have lost business, most computer consultants
see no shortage of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting some calls about Y2K,'' said Jeffrey
Pascone, director of Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer's computer services. ``A
lot of people pulled the trigger late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His firm recently replaced 15 full computer systems that were so
far out of compliance that it was easier and more cost-effective to
junk them than to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't foresee any slowdown because so many businesses
delayed other computer-related expenditures in the past year to
deal with Y2K. Now, they want to build and expand their Web sites,
gain faster Internet access to customers and suppliers, integrate
systems, and enhance software and security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some still need to make sure their systems are Leap
Year-compliant. (True, February 29 comes every four years, but
special computations are be required for the end of centuries.)
</P>
<P>
   To handle the uptick in the business, Pascone expects to
increase his consulting staff by 50 percent, to 12, by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone. Proactive Networking Consulting in San Francisco
is booked up through March and plans to add staff. Last year, the
nine-person consulting firm replaced computer systems for half of
its 50 business customers, including the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than just make Y2K fixes, we added value,'' said
Proactive Networking President Lawrence Flores. ``Maybe customers
replaced equipment six or nine months earlier than they would have.
But our philosophy is, if you spruce up a (Ford) Pinto, it's still
a Pinto. Why not get something that will take you three years down
the road?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm busier than ever,'' added San Francisco computer
consultant Peter Jones. ``It's full-tilt boogie. Businesses are
upgrading their software but many machines that ran Microsoft's
Office 97 at reasonable speed will run Office 2000 like molasses.
Everyone wants more speed and bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones contends there were a lot of ``Y2K charlatans'' that used
scare tactics and sometimes charged clients more than they should
have to make simple fixes to off-the-shelf computer systems. But he
and others say that doesn't alter the fact that business computer
systems are often obsolete after just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's computer world, our 5-year-old system was a
relic,'' said Griffin of Automatic Garage Door Corp. ``A garage
door opener will last 15 years, but everyone said our computers
were out of date and could have crashed. Plus we didn't have enough
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's company has been around for 38 years and installs
about five doors a day. But until now, its garages have been more
automated than its office.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been writing its invoices and tracking inventory
by hand. Griffin also has been using a pen to take notes at job
sites and send out estimates. But all that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are to do all my invoicing and inventory on the
computer, save time and money using the Internet to find suppliers,
and do all my estimates by laptop computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although small businesses like Griffin's are beefing up their
computer capability, they accounted for less than 1 percent of the
total Y2K spending, according to Bruce Webster, author of ``The Y2K
Survival Guide'' and co-chairman of the Washington, D.C., Year 2000
Group. Now a consultant with the &LR; PricewaterhouseCooperscq &LR; , Webster
adds, ``About half of all small businesses were planning to do
nothing at all. Basically, they were going to `fix on failure.'''
</P>
<P>
   One local company that sailed through Y2K without any planning
was Sherlock's Haven. ``We ignored the hype and didn't do a
thing,'' said Marty Pulvers, owner of the San Francisco pipe and
tobacco shop. ``We're always more concerned about how our cigars
perform than our computers.'' Pulvers only uses his 3-year-old,
previously owned Apple Performa for e-mail and writing checks and
it came through without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been plenty of glitches. Some nuclear power
plant security systems went haywire. Some dialysis machines and
defibrillators seized up. Some folks were overbilled for bringing
back their rental videos 100 years late. But no catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was profoundly underwhelmed,'' said Webster. ``Most Y2K
failures are dull. A date reads 19100 instead of 2000 or a program
stops running or does something wrong. It's like the torment of
1,000 fleas.''
</P>
<P>
   Although problems could keep bubbling up for weeks or months and
companies will spend a few hundred dollars on software upgrades or
a few thousand for computers, Webster figures the impact will be
``largely invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that small businesses did not take Y2K as seriously as
most large companies, the U.S. Small Business Administration got
only 91 takers for its Y2K equipment loans nationwide and loaned
only $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the beneficiaries was Krogh Pump Co. of Benicia, which
borrowed about $20,000 for seven years at 2.25 percent over the
prime lending rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our old computer system was 6 or 7 years old and it couldn't
handle the new accounting software,'' said company President
Charles O'Brien. ``Since new hardware is so cheap, we decided to
bite the bullet and put in an entirely new system that is better,
faster, cleaner.''

 Publishers Vow to Fight Proposed Postage Hike for
Magazines,  Catalogs 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Magazines, mail-order catalogs and charitable fund-raising mailings
will bear the brunt of rate increases the U.S. Postal Service will
propose today, and their publishers are fighting mad _ and
considering other ways to deliver their publications.
<P>
   Under the new rates, which will take effect next January if the
Postal Service has its way, postage for conventional first-class
letters will rise only a penny, from 33 to 34 cents. But rates are
slated to jump about 7.7 percent for catalogs, 12 to 15 percent for
major magazines and 15 percent for presorted local mailings by
community-based nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely upset and disappointed,'' said Jim Cregan, the
Washington, D.C., executive vice president of the Magazine
Publishers of America.
</P>
<P>
   He said the trade organization's members, who range from Time,
Newsweek and other giants to tiny specialty publications, will
fight the new rate plan in hearings before the Postal Rate
Commission, a five-member panel appointed by the president and
charged with reviewing the proposal before the Postal Service
Governors make a final determination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Cregan said, ``Our short-term plan is to take this
to the Hill and if necessary to the Court of Appeals. For the long
term, our members are starting to look seriously at alternatives to
the Postal Service for delivery, and this proposal is bound to
accelerate that process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, magazine publishers have explored the
possibility of having their products distributed by private
package-delivery companies or local newspaper carriers.
</P>
<P>
   None of those ideas have worked out _ 85 percent of MPA members'
circulation goes through the mail, and nearly all the rest
represents newsstand sales _ but such ideas could be re-examined if
the proposed postal increases go through, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, he said, publishers are taking the idea of
online, electronic delivery seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Postal Service tried to focus attention on
the relatively modest increases it proposes for individual
first-class letters. ``Overall, it amounts to less than 25 cents
per month per household,'' said Hector Ruiz, Northern California
spokesman for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.3 percent raise on such letters will amount to less than
the rate of inflation since the last rate increase, a year ago this
month. According to a Postal Service fact sheet, the proposed
34-cent rate, adjusted for inflation, will be lower than the rate
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service receives no tax dollars for its operations _
by law it's required to rely on sales of its products and services
to cover its operating costs. Over the past five years, it has
recorded a steady stream of profits, but it has plowed them into
new investments in automation as well as efforts to reduce its
accumulated deficit, which now totals $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires the service to base rates for different
types of service on their actual cost. ``There's rhyme and reason
to it,'' Ruiz said. Bar codes and other forms of automation have
dramatically reduced the cost of sorting and routing commercial
first-class mail, he said, while periodicals still often require
some manual processing.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for industries socked with big increases under the
Postal Service plan questioned how accurately the service measures
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shell game in a sense, and community-based charities
have drawn the pea,'' said Neal Denton, executive director of the
Association of Nonprofit Mailers, based in Washington, D.C., which
represents companies that prepare mailings for nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Local mailings from community-based nonprofits cost the Postal
Service service less to process than any other kind of mail, he
said, because these senders generally bring them directly to the
local post office in pre-sorted trays that can be handed directly
to carriers. But under the Postal Service plan this type of service
faces the largest increases of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes no blasted sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cregan of the magazine trade group shared Denton's frustration.
``We're not just angry, we're mystified,'' he said. ``Under the
plan they're proposing, the biggest increases fall on the
publishers who've done the most to implement bar coding and the
other kinds of technologies the Postal Service says it wants us to
adopt.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, he said, is that the Postal Service
proposal is based on 1998 cost data. ``By waiting just two more
months'' before filing its proposal, Denton said in a statement,
the service could have used 1999 data.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service said it had to file the plan because the law
gives the Postal Rate Commission 10 months to examine proposed
increases, and by the beginning of 2001, the service will need the
additional revenue it's asking for.
</P>
<P>
   Before the review process has run its course, there's likely to
be plenty of data presented: When the Postal Service presented its
last request for an increase, it submitted 100,000 pages of
documentation, filling a 2.5-ton truck, and the review commission
then took testimony from 11 witnesses over 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increases come at a time of uncertainty about the
long-term effects of the Internet on the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   In a forecast it released last year, the agency predicted that
first-class mail volume will decline 0.8 percent per year between
1999 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Thomas, executive director of the National Association
of Presort Mailers, an organization of companies that prepare
first-class mailings for banks, brokerages, utilities and other
high-volume customers, said he sees no sign of a significant
decrease _ overall, first-class volumes have held more or less
steady for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on the effects the Internet will have,''
he said. ``There's an awful lot of talk about it, but for now
e-commerce is still far too small a portion of the total mail
volume to say yet what the net effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Postal Service spokesman Ruiz said the service believes the
Internet has already had some effect in reducing the volume of
business-to-business mail, but that's been matched by an increased
volume of package resulting from e-commerce purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is definitely going to take volume away from the
Postal Service,'' said Robert McClean, executive director of the
Mailers Council, an umbrella trade group based in Arlington, Va.,
that represents major mailers in all categories.
</P>
<P>
   When online bill-paying takes off, he said, ``it will happen
very quickly, and that could cost the Postal Service a couple of
billion dollars a year. That'll be very difficult to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   The big questions, he said, are ``whether the service can
improve its productivity and whether it's really prepared to cope
with the changes e-commerce will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' he said, ``they'll face the worst crisis in their
history.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Beth Ciabattari, the human resources manager at Wanger Asset
Management in Chicago, had to take a deep breath before listing the
contents of the office kitchen. ``They have one wall filled with
about 25 bins and they have everything from Ruffles potato chips to
Fritos to Snickers to Twix bars to sunflower seeds,'' she said, her
voice growing heavier with each calorie mentioned. ``They just do
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' she said, adding, as if to lighten the load,
``they do have granola bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the imported spring water, the sodas, the
tuna-fish-and-cracker lunch packs, or that it is all free to
employees whenever they have the urge to munch.
</P>
<P>
   At many fast companies, and even some slower ones, the office
kitchen has evolved from a nook with a Microfridge and a handful of
plastic forks to a temple of snacking where every indulgence is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that a loaded kitchen on each floor entices
employees to work longer days, said Richard Federico, a work-life
consultant with the Segal Co., an employee benefits consulting firm
based in New York. He tells of one large company where employees
who worked late were treated to free popcorn in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then somebody new in Human Resources did a cost-benefit
analysis and found out it cost $100 a month for the free popcorn,''
he said. That was a pittance in the grand scheme of things, but
someone thought it costly enough to do away with the treat. Sure
enough, as soon as the popcorn was cut, people stopped working
late. The moral, Federico said, is that ``the return on investment
for a bag of popcorn is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn is but an appetizer. The Commercial Property Services
Co. in Santa Clara, Calif., furnishes its kitchen with a gas stove,
toasters and blenders, as well as the raw ingredients for meals. It
is part of one employee's job to replenish the stocks of cold cuts,
frozen meats, vegetables, even herbs. On nice days, employees roll
the barbecue out onto the patio. ``If you came in in the morning
and wanted to have scrambled eggs and ham and bacon, sure,'' said
Ray Baker, the chief operating officer for the 50-employee company.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen doubles as a meeting room, with one wall covered in
whiteboard. ``It's all wired so we can plug projectors and
computers in, and do projections onto the wall,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, centralized kitchens that can double as conference
rooms have become standard, largely as a result of the rising cost
of office space, said Steven Basque, a principal with ADD Inc., a
design firm in Boston. His company recently moved into a new
building with a central kitchen area that employees must walk
though to get to other offices, making it a hub of activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become in the office almost what the family room is
residentially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Bertholdt, 59, a shareholder services representative at
Wanger, can confirm that. ``We gravitate toward the kitchen,'' she
said. When she has a question for a fellow employee, particularly
one too consumed with work to be disturbed at his desk, she might
wait to catch him during snack time. ``You'll go in there and
you'll see an analyst or a portfolio manager, and you can pick
their brain a little bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bertholdt sees the bounty as an expression of corporate
affection, but even so blames the free potato chips for the five
pounds she gained when she joined the company three years ago. ``I
eat all day,'' she said. ``I'm so full by the time I leave here, I
don't want to think about food any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Free food is an important symbolic benefit, even for employees
who can demand hefty salaries. Michael Weissenburger, 31, said he
was pleasantly surprised when he joined GTE Internetworking, a
division of the GTE Corp., as manager for international finance two
years ago and saw the kitchen setups at the Burlington, Mass.,
campus. You know your office cares when the division president
periodically makes rounds with an ice cream cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first job, we had a very small, dank, dark kitchenette
with an old microwave and no refrigerator,'' he said. ``Here, there
is always food around. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Abundant pantries are no passing fad, either. Bob Gaudreau, a
founder of the Regus Business Centre Corp., which leases fully
furnished offices around the world, says he has redesigned the
kitchen areas into ``beautiful piazzas'' where employees can rub
elbows while taking a snack break. (No fountains or pigeons, but
there is cappuccino.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the refrigerators and microwaves, he added
televisions and iMac computers. ``So many people are working from
home or just sitting in a cubicle, and the social aspect of work,
that's the part that people seem to be looking for,'' Gaudreau
said. ``People who literally sit across from each other might
literally never speak to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even accounting firms and law firms, which tend to be more
conservative in their decor, are jazzing up their kitchens,
dazzling employees and clients with stainless steel appliances,
glass-front refrigerators and granite countertops. ``Those kinds of
things are the amenities that people like to show potential hires _
that they've got this funky space, with Starbucks coffee and
designer teas,'' Basque said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, things are a bit more low-brow. After all, doggie
bags are one reason for the popularity of office kitchens; Harry
Balzer, a vice president at NPD Group Inc., a market research firm,
estimates that 2.5 billion helpings of leftovers were carted out of
restaurants last year, and that a good number ended up in office
refrigerators. So, undoubtedly, did many pastries, sandwiches and
catered goodies that companies lay out at office meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People find that they don't even need to go out and get
anything,'' Basque said. ``It just seems like there's always food
in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Ciabattari says, employees have logged only joking
complaints about the sinful variety of treats that Wanger doles
out. The company recently expanded its culinary repertory to
include carrots and celery. But more fattening comestibles prevail.
``Sometimes I wish we had to slip a quarter in a slot,'' she said.
``It would make you think before you grab something.''

MRS. CLINTON CALLS GIULIANI TEMPERAMENTALLY UNSUITED FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Repeating a theme that her campaign is likely
to use more frequently, Hillary Rodham Clinton used a trip to
upstate New York on Tuesday to criticize New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely Senate opponent, as temperamentally
unsuited to represent New York in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after greeting shoppers at a supermarket
here, Mrs. Clinton sought to portray Giuliani as an official who is
perpetually battling those with whom he has disagreements, and who
would not fit well into the demeanor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have an ally one day who is not for you the next
day,'' Mrs. Clinton said of the Senate. ``But you have to be
willing to keep working with everybody. You can't walk into the
Senate and have a disagreement with somebody and say that you're
going to fire them or sue them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments were similar in tone to remarks she made about a
month ago in which she chided Giuliani for what she called his
tendency to be consumed by anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is clear that there have been so many
controversies and difficulties,'' Mrs. Clinton said, referring to
Giuliani's tenure in City Hall. ``The most recent is what has been
going on in the schools once again. Two schools chancellors
couldn't get along with him and are now gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know, at the end of the day, that's a lot of wasted
energy. People ought to be working together to solve problems,
particularly when it comes to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had a full day of campaigning, beginning at the
supermarket in the center of the city, flanked by Mayor William
Johnson Jr. and Sandra Frankel, the town supervisor of the suburb
of Brighton. Mrs. Clinton was the house guest Monday night of Ms.
Frankel, who ran last year for the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, she spoke with shoppers about their families and
economic issues in the area. She also bought some low-fat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Mrs. Clinton traveled to Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, in Geneva, a picturesque town in the Finger Lakes
region. There she spoke at a gathering of more than 2,000 students
and residents on service and volunteerism. In tone, it was less of
a campaign event then a discussion on service, similar to the
so-called listening tours that were a mainstay of the first lady's
early foray into New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has not made her candidacy official, the first lady
said that she expected to make an announcement in early February,
adding that she had to find a date on which it would be convenient
for President Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, to attend the
event.

 BOB McFADDEN, VOICE OF TV ADS, DIES AT 76   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert McFadden, who gave raspy voice to the parrot cackling
``Ring around the collar!'' and ``Pretty shirt!'' in Wisk
commercials in the 1970s as well as speaking for thousands of other
advertising and cartoon characters, died last Friday at his home in
Delray Beach, Fla. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, TV Guide called McFadden ``one of the elite of TV
commercial voice-overs.'' Known professionally as Bob, he made
hundreds of thousands of dollars selling his voice to advertisers
like Ford, Geritol, Frankenberry cereal, Pepto-Bismol, Campbell's
Soup, Mountain Dew and Ban deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette, his wife of 48 years, said he never minded being
invisible. ``He just loved being in it,'' she said of show
business. ``It never meant anything to be a star or a name.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden was born in East Liverpool, Ohio, and got his first
break as a singer while stationed in Puerto Rico with the Navy
during World War II. He did impersonations in a weekly talent show.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Navy, he worked briefly in a Pittsburgh steel
mill, then got into show business as an opening act at hotels and
nightclubs for the McGuire Sisters, Harry Belafonte and others. He
did singing impressions of Frankie Laine, Billy Eckstine and the
Inkspots.
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife in Boston in 1950, when the two were working
together. While he sang onstage, she and her twin sister performed
synchronized swimming exercises in a pool below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a wet act and he was a dry act,'' recalled Mrs.
McFadden.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the McFaddens moved to Queens, and McFadden
switched to doing voices and advertising work as well as cartoons.
They later moved to Leonia, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For two and a half decades, he squawked like a parrot for Wisk
and barked like a dog for Crest toothpaste. He once received
$12,000 for making a swishing sound to imitate a jet airplane.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden appeared on several comedy albums and played ethnic
comedy characters in albums like ``The Yiddish Are Coming!'' His
cartoon characters included Cool McCool and Milton the Monster.
</P>
<P>
   Even after retiring to Delray Beach, he did not stop performing.
He would appear in supper clubs, introducing Jack Benny in his own
voice and then Ed Sullivan in Jack Benny's. ``I don't do Sullivan
to try to make him funny,'' McFadden told The St. Petersburg Times
in 1997. ``He was hysterical enough just being himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, McFadden is survived by two sons,
Jeffrey, of Delray Beach and Brian, of Palisades Park, N.J.; a
daughter, Tracy Huber of Ringwood, N.J.; a brother, James, of
Ashland, Ore., and a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   His gift for voices was perhaps best demonstrated in 1959 in
Cuba, just days before Castro took over. ``They wanted me to do a
show in Spanish, and I didn't know a word,'' he said. His
brother-in-law wrote the show in impeccable Spanish. McFadden
pronounced everything phonetically. The high point was Gabby Hayes,
Roy Rogers' sidekick, singing underwater in Spanish.

 AIKMAN BEARS PART OF BLAME FOR SORRY EVENT
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIM REEVES c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jerry Jones came up with a horribly ludicrous
reason for firing head coach Chan Gailey yesterday _ the devil made
him do it.
</P>
<P>
   A devil, if you read Jones' rather broad hints, named Troy
Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   At a hurriedly called news conference to confirm what everyone
knew 48 hours ago, the Cowboys' owner did everything but unfurl an
Aikman poster and use a pointer to blame Gailey's demise on his
quarterback and other players who either couldn't or wouldn't
adjust to the head coach's offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   Misdirection play or not, it was another shameful chapter for an
organization that has had far too many such moments over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a football decision, Jones stressed, but if the boys from
the forensic lab had been present, I suspect they would have found
that the knife in Gailey's back bore many fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Were Aikman's there? Not intentionally, I'm sure _ that's just
not Aikman's style _ but it was clear that Jones had talked to his
quarterback and other key players and assistant coaches before
making this decision.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Jones has said since the Cowboys' tepid season ended
with that 27-10 thrashing by the Vikings Sunday in Minnesota has
absolved the players from all blame. What a ridiculous farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that the energy and the compromise that it would
take for Chan to go the direction that would best fit our
personnel,'' Jones said in his typical oratory excess and
double-speak, ``and the decision and the compromise and the
willingness of a lot of our personnel to go in the direction Chan
wanted to go, we'd burn up more energy and we'd spend more of our
resources than we had to spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The players weren't going to change or accept
Gailey's offensive philosophy, so the head coach had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was not done because of our personnel's wish
that we make a change at head coach,'' Jones said, realizing that
he'd already made it abundantly clear that that's exactly what
happened. ``It was not done because of Chan's total unwillingness
to step up and continue to work at this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a decision ... that the energy that we spend
building this team for next year wouldn't be spent trying to come
to an agreement as to what we were going to do philosophically
offensively. That we would go in a direction that everybody from
the get-go was on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   It never seemed to occur to Jones that if he, as owner and
general manager, would make a commitment to Gailey then perhaps the
players would, too. Or that if they didn't, then perhaps they
should be the ones to go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the coach was fired, which will apparently please a
majority of the fans who have been clamoring for his scalp,
forgetting perhaps, that another couple of field goals by Richie
Cunningham, or another pass or two caught by inept receivers might
have turned this into a decent, if unremarkable, 10-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   Players who could never be counted on to make a third-and-1 play
will wake up today, yawn, and head to the golf course with the
knowledge that their owner and GM doesn't hold them one iota
responsible for their incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey pays the price for all of them, including gross
misjudgements and mistakes made by Jones as owner and GM (anyone
remember Patrick Jeffers?).
</P>
<P>
   As for wasting energy getting on the same page, won't that be
exactly what this team will be doing as it adjusts to its fourth
head coach in the past seven years?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who only a year ago was being praised for his strong
disciplinary presence and an offense that finished eighth in the
league and carried the Cowboys to the NFC East championship,
remained loyal to the end, refusing to point fingers at his players
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say they undermined me,'' Gailey said. ``I think they
said what they believed,'' when Jones asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were open for change here. The environment was right for
that,'' Gailey added. ``When you come and take over a veteran team
that's had a great deal of success, they believe very strongly in
what they're doing. Unless you do a supreme job of winning them
over immediately, it's always in the back of their minds the idea
that there might be another way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably was the case and why everybody wasn't on
the same page at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   The first hint that the owner-GM wasn't on the same page with
the head coach came yesterday, when Gailey learned that he was
being fired. There was no scenario offered in which he might remain
as head coach, Gailey said. Jones never asked if he would make
changes in his philosophy or even add an offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there enough upside and positives if you took away some of
what he believes in?'' Jones asked rhetorically. ``How much of that
can you whittle away without whittling away Chan Gailey from the
standpoint of what he is as a football coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you want to take away from maximizing the unique
skills of certain players that we have on this team? How much do
you want to compromise that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jones decided he would do what he has always done:
protect his overpaid, underachieving star players and give them
what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the devil did make him do it, after all. Or a lot of
devils.  &LR; tagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7972

 &HT;    GBI seizes welfare agency's files in probe of 13 children's
deaths
 &HT;    By Jane O. Hansen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Signaling a criminal investigation is under way, the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday seized the files of 13
children who died after someone had reported they or their siblings
were being abused or neglected. In a coordinated sweep across
Georgia, agents made surprise appearances at six county child
welfare offices.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said Tuesday he had ordered Buddy Nix,
director of the GBI, to oversee an investigation into children's
deaths that is expected to grow in scope beyond the 13 so far
identified as supicious. He said he became concerned after articles
in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspapers last year chronicled
the deaths of children already known to local departments of Family
and Children Services. The articles, which were based on hundreds
of child abuse records opened to the newspaper by court order, ran
in October and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``After those series of articles, we began to review files _
including myself and others in the governor's office,'' Barnes said
Tuesday. ``This action is a culmination of that review because we
think there's a possibility there may be criminal activity
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also announced in his state of the budget address
Tuesday that he was seeking $4.1 million to fund a child advocacy
office that would oversee and investigate the operations of DFACS.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes refused to comment further on the criminal investigation.
But officials say some DFACS staff may have broken the law by
making false statements on records, which is a felony. Agents will
also investigate whether some deaths should have been prosecuted as
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI sweep came the same day an Atlanta attorney called for
the federal takeover of the state's child welfare system, which has
come under escalating criticism over the handling of abuse and
neglect complaints.
</P>
<P>
   GBI agents descended Tuesday afternoon unannounced at DFACS
offices in Glynn, Fulton, Cherokee, Bibb, Sumter and Clarke
counties. They also visited the office of Peg Peters, former head
of the state Division of Family and Children Services, who was
reassigned late in October to another job. Among the 13 children's
deaths, seven were homicides.
</P>
<P>
   One child whose records were seized was Terrell Peterson, a
5-year-old Atlanta boy who died in January 1998 after eight reports
had been made to the Fulton DFACS alleging that he or his siblings
were being neglected or abused. Terrell's grandmother, aunt and
aunt's boyfriend have been charged with the little boy's murder,
and the two women are facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Following the child's death, two state reviews of the case found
numerous violations of policy that may have contributed to his
death. Despite those reports, Ralph Mitchell, the Fulton
administrator, issued a press release saying all policies and
procedures had been followed. He later wrote to Peters, the state
agency head, saying he'd made a mistake, but ``fortunately there
have been no further calls from the media to follow-up or contest
the information contained in the statement.'' Neither officials
corrected the public record. Since then, Peters has been reassigned
and Mitchell has been on an extended medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   In November, attorney Don Keenan filed a lawsuit in state court,
charging the state with contributing to Terrell's death through its
negligence and seeking systemwide reform. Tuesday, he filed a
second lawsuit in federal court, this time calling for a federal
judge to take control of the state DFACS.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said it was no accident that the GBI's involvement was
made public the same day he asked a court to take over another
state agency. ``The timing is certainly not coincidental,'' said
Keenan, who said he told the governor's office and attorney
general's office last week that he would press for criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, both Keenan and Barnes were featured in another
story about Terrell on the CBS news program ``60 Minutes II.''
Following the national broadcast, Keenan said he received more than
700 e-mail messages, letters and phone calls from people demanding
that public officials be held accountable for the death. He said he
forwarded them all to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes denied that the GBI's investigation had anything to do
with the federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true that our action was taken in response to Don
Keenan's announcement that he was filing a federal lawsuit,''
Barnes said, ``because this has been an ongoing response for
several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that continuing publicity on Terrell's case, as
well as articles about other children whose records were released
by court order, sparked a public outrage and moved both Barnes and
Nix in November to begin quietly discussing what the state should
do in response.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference in late November, Barnes announced the
appointment of a new head of DFACS, Juanita Blount-Clark, and his
support for an ombudsman's office to oversee the agency. Behind the
scenes, he asked Commissioner Audrey Horne of the Department of
Human Resources, also a recent appointment, to begin reviewing
internally the records of deceased children.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last month, Horne sent questionable or egregious
cases to the governor's office, where Barnes himself said he read
through some of the records. As a lawyer, the governor believed the
records raised questions of criminal actions, and he called in the
GBI to begin an investigation of the first 13 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nix convened a task force of 10 to 15 agents who will
examine the records in search of possible violations of state law,
which makes it a felony to make false statements on official
papers. The maximum punishment is five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   GBI spokesman John Bankhead said agents began examining some
records shortly after the Journal-Constitution articles appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI task force is made up largely of agents specially
trained in child-abuse investigations. These agents take annual
training in that area, and one is assigned to each of the agency's
15 regional offices. Agents on the task force, Bankhead said, were
drawn from regions near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the task force is Dr. Kris Sperry, the state's chief
medical examiner, and the agency's criminal profiling specialists.
Among the records being collected in addition to DFACS records are
autopsy reports, hospital records and police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead said DFACS workers in some of the offices were so
cooperative that they called agents to report they had found more
documents pertaining to the cases. At a press conference Tuesday,
attorney Keenan said he was asking the federal court to appoint a
single overseer or a small panel to run DFACS until it was reformed
to the satisfaction of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan repeatedly emphasized that the lack of state action,
including the failure to fire officials involved in Terrell's case,
was typical for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no other reason, to protect the integrity of the agency,
these people have got to go _ today,'' Keenan said.

 SOME COACHING JOBS KNOWN FOR SHORT SHELF
LIFE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By PETE ALFANO
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The distinction was once claimed by the
manager of the New York Yankees. It has belonged to the head
football coach of Notre Dame, the man behind the bench of the
Montreal Canadiens, the head basketball coaches at Kentucky and
UCLA, and anyone who has tried to coach the Oakland Raiders with Al
Davis looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the toughest job in sports may belong to the head coach
of the] Cowboys. Are you listening Mike Martz? Norv Turner? Gary
Kubiak? Mack Brown? Butch Davis? And the rest of the potential
Cowboys coaching wannabes?
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Chan Gailey compiled an 18-14 regular-season
record, won a division title and earned two playoff berths with an
aging team, salary cap restrictions and a general manager who
passed on Randy Moss. Maybe not Super Bowl worthy, but does anyone
have to be reminded what Tom Landry and Jimmy Johnson did in their
first couple of years?
</P>
<P>
   In his late-afternoon news conference yesterday, Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said that Gailey was diligent and honest, that he
worked hard, did everything that Jones had imagined and would be a
head coach in the NFL for many years to come. Only not with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which parity appeared to have maxed out this
season _ when the phrase, ``On Any Given Sunday,'' was not just a
clever movie title or NFL marketing slogan _ expectations at Valley
Ranch remain high. Think about this: Johnson lasted five years,
Barry Switzer four, and Gailey two. The countdown keeps getting
shorter for head coaches of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appears to have inherited George Steinbrenner's trigger
finger, although Joe Torre has a lot to do with mellowing The Boss.
Jones is as intrusive as Al Davis, who actually was the Raiders'
head coach at one time (don't even think about it Jerry). Davis had
no patience for one of his bright young head coaches _ Mike
Shanahan _ who, of course, led the Denver Broncos to the past two
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens still change coaches more often than some people
change socks, but the Flying Frenchmen usually wait until they have
a losing record. Bob Davie may have only one year left before Notre
Dame decides he's no Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian or Holtz, but the
Irish haven't gone to a bowl game the past two years, much less
contend for the national title they believe is a birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demand to win and win often remains high at UCLA
and Kentucky, even many fans, alumni and boosters appear to
understand that the good old days of Wooden and Rupp are gone and
sights have to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe but until 1989, the Cowboys had only one
head coach in their history. Tom Landry survived some early storms
in his 29-year reign that probably would have shipwrecked him
today. But that was then, this is now. Jones will be hiring his
fourth coach in little more than a decade. He may also have a new
rival for quick trigger finger in Daniel Snyder, the Washington
Redskins' involved owner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the Redskins' coach, may want to think about that if
Jones offers him the Cowboys' coaching job. He may become the
popular example of going from the frying pan into the fire.

   In his late-afternoon news conference yesterday, Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said that Gailey was diligent and honest, that he
worked hard, did everything that Jones had imagined and would be a
head coach in the NFL for many years to come. Only not with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which parity appeared to have maxed out this
season _ when the phrase, ``On Any Given Sunday,'' was not just a
clever movie title or NFL marketing slogan _ expectations at Valley
Ranch remain high. Think about this: Johnson lasted five years,
Barry Switzer four, and Gailey two. The countdown keeps getting
shorter for head coaches of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appears to have inherited George Steinbrenner's trigger
finger, although Joe Torre has a lot to do with mellowing The Boss.
Jones is as intrusive as Al Davis, who actually was the Raiders'
head coach at one time (don't even think about it Jerry). Davis had
no patience for one of his bright young head coaches _ Mike
Shanahan _ who, of course, led the Denver Broncos to the past two
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens still change coaches more often than some people
change socks, but the Flying Frenchmen usually wait until they have
a losing record. Bob Davie may have only one year left before Notre
Dame decides he's no Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian or Holtz, but the
Irish haven't gone to a bowl game the past two years, much less
contend for the national title they believe is a birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demand to win and win often remains high at UCLA
and Kentucky, even many fans, alumni and boosters appear to
understand that the good old days of Wooden and Rupp are gone and
sights have to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe but until 1989, the Cowboys had only one
head coach in their history. Tom Landry survived some early storms
in his 29-year reign that probably would have shipwrecked him
today. But that was then, this is now. Jones will be hiring his
fourth coach in little more than a decade. He may also have a new
rival for quick trigger finger in Daniel Snyder, the Washington
Redskins' involved owner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the Redskins' coach, may want to think about that if
Jones offers him the Cowboys' coaching job. He may become the
popular example of going from the frying pan into the fire.

 VALLEY RANCH ISN'T EDEN AS LONG AS JERRY
IS AROUND (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By RANDY
GALLOWAY c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ An indictment of failure was delivered at
Valley Ranch yesterday. Jerry Jones, serving as judge and jury,
waived the defendant's right to a trial, and finally got on with
the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, having been found guilty, was fired as Cowboys head
coach, but not until the blood-sucking leeches were finished
feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in a totally classless act, delayed the inevitable for 48
hours, allowing Chan to be roughed up some more by the radio
talking dogs, while also taking additional knives to the back from
the Valley Ranch brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, however, said he was ``thinking,'' always a dangerous
proposition when it comes to football. But in this case, Jones
promised he was thinking about how to break the news to Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. By refusing to go public with a stay-or-go decision
immediately after the Minnesota misery, Jones had already cut the
legs from under his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was 48 hours of added agony for Gailey. His
owner-president-general manager humiliated him in front of the same
players who Jones claimed are not being held responsible for what
went on this season. Jerry destroyed his head coach's football
credibility, both inside and outside the locker room, by opening
his mouth minutes after the Minnesota debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey as head coach was yesterday's news two days
``before'' yesterday's announcement. He was gone, and based on
results, you can't say that's wrong. Chan is a big boy. He knew the
Valley Ranch ground rules when he took the job two years ago. He
was, of course, Jerry's hand-picked man.
</P>
<P>
   This means Chan's failures to get the offense moving lead right
back to Jerry, the owner who doesn't want his head coach to have a
powerful Valley Ranch presence.
</P>
<P>
   Being more direct, Chan's failures in this job also means Jerry
hasn't done a damn thing right, football-wise, in six years and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, six years. Five years ago, the Cowboys won a Super Bowl.
Six years ago, they were in the NFC Championship Game. At the time,
the talent was so good, neither Jerry or Coach Gunsmoke could screw
it up, unless you think this franchise came up one world
championship short. Which, by the way, it did. But the decline
started six years ago. It's true, of course, what they say about a
dead chicken always rotting from the head down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, baybee, you don't want to hear this. The mere mention
of it kills you inside.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry, it's true. You ain't spit without Jimmy, although
this concession will be granted: So far, Jimmy ain't been spit in
the NFL without you.
</P>
<P>
   God help us, but you two guys made a lovely Valley Ranch couple.
You were simply meant for each other, in a football sense, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   But lets face it, Mr. Jones. All your success in this league
ended, and all your troubles started, in that time frame known as
ATJ. After The Jimster.
</P>
<P>
   On coaching hires alone, Jones is now 0-for-2 ATJ. Both hires
shocked us. Gunsmoke was the big-name houseboy at Valley Ranch who
became a goofy cartoon character. Gailey was the unknown X-factor.
Upon review, Gailey paid for the football sins of the previous four
years, a time when bluff and bluster replaced substance and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But now Chan is leaving, and next comes the really scary part.
Jones goes back to work as general manager. He's got his
``thinking'' cap on. He's going to try and make it right. Las Vegas
odds say John Rocker has a better chance of being elected mayor of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Cowboys once had going for them was a strong
collection of talent. Now, that's gone. Combine this loss with the
thought of working for Jones _ rule No. 1 is don't ever get caught
between Jerry and a mini-cam _ and no reasonable thinking coach
would dare touch this job.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think Gailey's treatment these past 48 hours has gone
unnoticed in the coaching ranks. Being fired is part of the job,
but deliberate humiliation says everything about the working
conditions at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one coaching name out there who might
become all things to all people named Jerry, Troy and Emmitt. There
is no such creature as a perfect coaching fit at Valley Ranch,
unless Jerry hired himself, but Norv Turner came the closest.
</P>
<P>
   Except Norv already has a job in Washington and will be back
there in 2000, despite continuing reports he will bolt after the
playoffs. Turner is simply not a candidate here.
</P>
<P>
   And if he were, Gailey would have to wonder how a coach he's 4-0
against in two seasons was hired to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Where Jones does go for a coach to replace Gailey is a
continuing mystery. And how Jerry juggles the salary-cap problems
in making this job more attractive is yet another unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Based on available evidence, things figure to only get worse at
Valley Ranch, no matter the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   This we know: The only time the Cowboys have functioned in a
world championship-type manner is when someone other than Jerry was
calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jimmy, those days are gone forever. Give it a couple of
years, and it's Chan Gailey who will be considered the lucky one.

 PLAYERS, COACHES NOT SURPRISED BY FIRING
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By CHAREAN WILLIAMS
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey admitted that the Cowboys' decision
to fire him as their head coach was based on the bottom line.
Cowboys players and others in the NFL looked at it the same way.
</P>
<P>
   So Jerry Jones' announcement yesterday that he was making a
coaching change was met with resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't really say I was surprised because you had heard
all this speculation for weeks on end about it,'' said Cowboys
defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban, the team's first-round choice in
1999. ``It wasn't as if today Jerry just said that we don't have a
head coach. You've heard it for the past four or five weeks in the
media and everything else. I guess that took away the surprise,
because you always knew there was a possibility of it happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the blame doesn't go toward him, but since he's the head
coach, everyone looks at it that way. You have to put some of the
blame on the players as in sometimes we did not execute and we made
his job a lot harder than what it needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (8-9) ended their season Sunday with a 27-10 loss to
the Minnesota Vikings in an NFC wild-card playoff game. In his news
conference yesterday, Jones mentioned Gailey's ``offensive
philosophy'' as a reason for Gailey's termination. The Cowboys
ranked 16th in the league in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the injuries, who am I to determine what's fair
and what's not?'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders said. ``We had
some injuries. But don't bring up Mike Irvin. Mike is the same
person you didn't want anyway. Now, we want to blame it on Mike's
absence for the offense's struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost 13 players to injuries, including Irvin. The
Cowboys were 3-0 when Irvin injured his spine early in a 13-10 loss
to the Philadelphia Eagles, but the team had Irvin on the trading
block before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin now is contemplating retirement, and Sanders could end up
with another team. Sanders will have his contract voided because it
would count more than $12.7 million against the salary cap next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't instant coffee,'' Sanders said. ``What offense is
going to work now, next year? I don't want to be part of a
rebuilding situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, for sure, won't be back. And hardly anyone is surprised
by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the business is such that you have to
be ready to make changes, and you have to be ready for changes,''
Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``That's just
something that happens during the course of your time. Every coach
has been through it. This is not something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Gailey was a good man. I think unfortunately it didn't
work out, but it's something that you know happens in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is searching for his fourth head coach in eight years.
Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer were big-name college coaches when
Jones hired them, while Gailey was a relatively unknown NFL
assistant when the Cowboys tabbed him Feb. 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big surprise to me just as a fan that Jerry hired
Chan in the first place,'' said Vikings owner Red McCombs, a San
Antonio resident. ``In the first two coaching decisions Jerry had,
he had hired people he had known for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey was cleaning out his office, the other members of
the coaching staff were hoping Jones did not decide to clean house.
Two years ago, Gailey inherited a staff with eight assistant
coaches under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Jim Bates and receivers coach Dwain Painter
are the only assistants not under contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to decisions regarding our staff, look at the record that I
have when we've made coaching changes before,'' Jones said. ``All
the staff members remained on staff when we replaced Jimmy. We had
some staff changes when Chan Gailey replaced Barry. ...I do believe
that our staff is one of the biggest assets we have in the Dallas
Cowboys organization. We have some great coaches on our staff, and
I know how hard it is when you make a coaching change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys assistants were not resting easy last night.
Offensive line coach Hudson Houck, who has been with the team for
seven years, was trying unsuccessfully to go about his business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the uneasy part of the job,'' Houck said, ``but that's
the business.'' Staff writers Tim Price and Clarence E. Hill Jr.
contributed to this report.

 SOME COACHING JOBS KNOWN FOR SHORT SHELF

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The distinction was once claimed by the
manager of the New York Yankees. It has belonged to the head
football coach of Notre Dame, the man behind the bench of the
Montreal Canadiens, the head basketball coaches at Kentucky and
UCLA, and anyone who has tried to coach the Oakland Raiders with Al
Davis looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the toughest job in sports may belong to the head coach
of the] Cowboys. Are you listening Mike Martz? Norv Turner? Gary
Kubiak? Mack Brown? Butch Davis? And the rest of the potential
Cowboys coaching wannabes?
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Chan Gailey compiled an 18-14 regular-season
record, won a division title and earned two playoff berths with an
aging team, salary cap restrictions and a general manager who
passed on Randy Moss. Maybe not Super Bowl worthy, but does anyone
have to be reminded what Tom Landry and Jimmy Johnson did in their
first couple of years?
</P>
<P>
   In his late-afternoon news conference yesterday, Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said that Gailey was diligent and honest, that he
worked hard, did everything that Jones had imagined and would be a

national monuments in Arizona, President Clinton rejected criticism
from Gov. Jane Hull and other state Republicans that he is using
Arizona to burnish his presidential legacy and ignoring the wishes

   ``We will always be sensitive to the concerns and the legitimate
interests of local people,'' Clinton said after he created the
national monuments.

up from the pressures of development and the threat of sprawl for

   Under a cold blue sky lightly feath ered with white clouds,
Clinton signed the proclamations as he sat at a hardwood table in
the vast empti ness that surrounds a dot on the map called Tuweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tuweep lies below the Uinkaret Mountains at the eastern edge of
what is now the new, million-acre Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument. The nearest paved road is about 50 miles away, close to
the Arizona-Utah line.

<P>
   Clinton also signed proclamations to create the Agua Fria
National Mon ument just east of Interstate 17, 40 miles north of
Phoenix, and the California Coast Monument to pro tect thousands of

National Monument near San Jose.

``forgo unilateral federal action . . . and instead work with us as
we involve the people of Arizona in a preservation effort that
allows the public a voice in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Jackson, a spokeswoman for Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., who had
sponsored a bill with an alternative proposal for protecting the
areas north of the Grand Canyon, said Tuesday, ``The president's
action usurps any opportunity to move forward with a bill that
reflects the interests and hopes of people who live there.'
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. John Shadegg, who represents District 4, wanted
more chance for public discussion about the new monuments,
particularly the Agua Fria, said his spokesman, Sean Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we rushing it now?'' Noble wondered.
</P>
<P>
   To Hull's legacy-building charge, Clinton responded, ``When you
come to the end of an eight-year term, everything you do,
obviously, can be characterized that way. But if it's a legacy for
the children of America for hundreds of years into the future, then
that's not a bad gift to give the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters, including an array of environmental
organiza tions, counter that every 20th-cen tury president except
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush has created national
monuments, using powers granted by the Na tional Antiquities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The act allows presidents to establish monuments at ``historic
landmarks, and prehistoric structures, and other objects of
historic or scientific inter est'' on federally owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The president arrived at Tuweep after a helicopter tour of the
area with Interior Secretary and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt,
who proposed the national monument after two years of study and
public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically doubling the size of the (Grand Canyon)
National Park,'' Babbitt told the president during a 45-minute
flight that began a few miles from the El Tovar Hotel, where
Clinton had spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Babbitt's office, the new, 71,100-acre Agua Fria
monu ment is an archaeological treasure, containing ``one of the
most signifi cant systems of late prehistoric sites in the American
Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, the Grand Canyon-Parashant is in some ways more
a part of Utah than of Arizona. It lies on the Arizona Strip, a
vast domain that stretches north from the Colo rado River to the
Utah line. Most of the ranchers, miners and hunters who have used
the area are from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the earliest settlers were Mormon pioneers sent by the
church to construct a timber mill on 8,000-foot Mount Trumbull. The
lumber they harvested built the Mormon Temple in St. George, Utah.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR OFFERS $76.8 BILLION BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday proposed a $76.8
billion budget that depends heavily on the state's prosperity to
finance spending increases for schools, environmental projects and
prison construction, as well as an array of new tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The budget veers from the austere fiscal policies that Pataki, a
Republican, had championed during much of his first five years when
he sought to reduce the size of state government with significant
spending cuts in several programs, no matter how popular they were.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, one of the least painful budgets that he has
ever proposed, calling for no major reductions in services, even as
it provides spending increases for programs that have faced deep
cuts in the past, including health care for poor New Yorkers and
financing for public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The budget seeks to spread New York's economic wealth,
potentially enabling Pataki to insulate his Republican allies in
the Legislature from a bruising budget battle in a year when they
face re-election. It might also help the political prospects of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, also a Republican, in his expected race
against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate,
because it contains no major cuts in funds for the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal will almost surely provoke a fight in at least
one major area: education. While Pataki's proposed budget contains
a modest 2.8 percent overall rise in state aid to public schools,
it calls for some cuts in educational programs favored by
Democrats, like expanding prekindergarten classes and enhancing
teachers' salaries in urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the governor's proposed budget is $3.5 billion, or 5.5
percent larger than the one that he and the Legislature enacted
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The budget carries the themes that Pataki outlined in his annual
address to lawmakers last week, primarily his plan to spend $25
million a year to cover tuition costs for college students who
agree to teach in New York's most troubled schools for at least
four years. It also continues his policy of refusing to spend any
of the budget surplus. Instead, it salts away the surplus,
estimated at $625 million, to finance tax cuts that were enacted in
previous years but have yet to take full effect, as well as to pay
off the state's huge debt.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said on Tuesday that his policies had helped revive New
York's once troubled economy, enabling him not only to provide
generous financing for vital programs like education, but also
allowing him to pay for more tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the right path _ the path of limited government,
controlled spending, lower taxes and more jobs,'' Pataki said in
his annual budget address.
</P>
<P>
   The budget represents the opening bid in the governor's annual
negotiations with the Legislature. The Legislature almost always
adds spending to budgets proposed by governors, and this year will
almost certainly be no different, particularly because all of its
211 members are up for re-election and eager to finance generously
programs popular with constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Pataki's proposal fell largely along partisan
lines in the Capitol. Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and speaker of the
State Assembly, attacked the proposed cuts to education, saying the
plan failed to meet the overall need of school districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State
Senate and Pataki's chief ally in the Legislature, praised the plan
as a good starting point for negotiations. ``The governor is
recognizing that times are good,'' he said. ``It ought to be the
least contentious budget that we have ever done.'' But even Bruno
said he saw a need to increase spending in areas like education.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction mong groups around New York was varied as well,
depending on how the budget affected them. The United Federation of
Teachers, the New York City teachers' union, gave a tempered
response, noting that Pataki's plan gave with one hand while taking
with the other, and termed it ``a good start to this year's budget
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan also drew fierce criticism from conservatives, who have
been among Pataki's most ardent supporters, because it departs from
the fiscal discipline that Pataki has displayed during most of his
years as governor.

CLINTON SIGNS PROCLAMA
 TIONS FOR 2 NEW NATIONAL
 MONUMENTS IN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - As he signed proclamations creating two
national monuments in Arizona, President Clinton rejected criticism
from Gov. Jane Hull and other state Republicans that he is using
Arizona to burnish his presidential legacy and ignoring the wishes
of the locals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We will always be sensitive to the concerns and the legitimate
interests of local people,'' Clinton said after he created the
national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about locking lands up. It is about freeing them
up from the pressures of development and the threat of sprawl for
all Americans, for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a cold blue sky lightly feath ered with white clouds,
Clinton signed the proclamations as he sat at a hardwood table in
the vast empti ness that surrounds a dot on the map called Tuweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tuweep lies below the Uinkaret Mountains at the eastern edge of
what is now the new, million-acre Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument. The nearest paved road is about 50 miles away, close to
the Arizona-Utah line.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also signed proclamations to create the Agua Fria
National Mon ument just east of Interstate 17, 40 miles north of
Phoenix, and the California Coast Monument to pro tect thousands of
acres of reefs and small islands. He also expanded Pinnacles
National Monument near San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the signing, Clinton pledged
cooperation with the ranchers who have permits to graze both of the
new monuments but who fear they will now face new federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proclamations, the ranch ers will retain their grazing
rights. Existing mining claims will also be honored, but new claims
will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he regretted that Hull did not attend the signing,
Clinton said, ``She would have been wel come.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hull spokeswoman Francie Noyes had charged that the

`GOD, PLEASE HELP ME': QUADS' MOTHER GETS LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Elizabeth Shannon Whittle, 25, convicted in Novem
ber of severely shaking her in fant quadruplets, will die in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The children's father, Anthony Perez, 23, will be free after
five years, giving him the chance at life that his family and
friends had begged the judge for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God! Dear God, please help me!'' Whittle wailed as Judge
Roger Kaufman of Mari copa County Superior Court sen tenced her to
172{ years in prison, Arizona's longest term for child abuse in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence for Whittle, which came two days after An thony
Jr., Megan, Robert and Damian turned 2, is lengthy be cause she was
convicted of ``dan gerous crimes against children,'' which carry
mandatory sen tences and no chance of early release.
</P>
<P>
   The terms for each count ranged from 2{ years to 24 years for
the worst offenses, mostly those involving Anthony Jr., who has
been left blind, deaf and incapacitated by the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman did not give Whittle the minimum sentence on any count,
citing a pattern of abuse that left the four babies with more than
70 fractures. As the children's mother, the judge said, Whittle
violated a special trust when she hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle's attorneys say they will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   When she addressed the court, Whittle again denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve life in prison because I didn't hurt my
babies,'' she wailed, sobbing. ``I know I didn't hurt my babies.
They con victed me on lies! Lies!''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kaufman asked Whittle to be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, separated from his wife by their lawyers, cried silently.
He, too, proclaimed himself and Whittle innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good and decent person,'' said his attorney, Em met
Ronan, asking Kaufman to put the young father on proba tion.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Perez will never see his kids again is pun
ishment enough, Ronan argued.
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave Perez five years in prison for failing to get
medical care for Anthony Jr. and suspended sentencing on the three
counts for the other babies. Upon release, Perez must serve five
years on probation, submit himself to drug and alcohol test ing and
take parenting classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the jury did not find that Perez injured the ba
bies, nor that he knew they were injured. However, the judge said
the babies would have been in consolable and obviously in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing was delayed half an hour when the judge, known
for his promptness, was trapped between floors in a courthouse
elevator. Maintenance crews had to pry open the door.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, it was stand ing room only. Social workers,
nurses and others who testified during the trial sat together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied that justice was served in this case,'' prose
cutor Patricia Nigro said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindaruth Carnett Estes, director of Victims of Child Abuse
Legislation and Laws, an advocacy group for people who say they are
wrongly accused, called the sentence ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You murder someone, you get 25 years, and you're out in
eight,'' she said, citing other cases where mothers have killed
their chil dren and gotten less time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the mother of Ashley Guerard, who was 7 months old
when she died of a skull fracture in May 1997, got six months in
jail. And Sally Ann Rabens pleaded no contest to negligent homicide
in the suffo cation death of her month-old son in March 1993 and
was put on probation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before 1997, when Arizona's lawmakers stiffened the
state's ``dangerous crimes against children'' statutes, setting
mandatory prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Perez babies were 4 months old when they were vio lently
shaken in the spring of 1998. They suffered fractured skulls,
retinal hemorrhages, bro ken bones and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled in Juve nile Court for Friday to decide
what will happen to the infants, now in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona law allows for their parents' rights to be severed
because the children have been in the state's care for more than 15
of the past 22 months and because the parents have been convicted
of child abuse, said Karin Kline of state Child Protec tive
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The children's foster parents want to adopt them. Anthony lives
in one home, Megan in another, and Robert and Damian in a third.
They visit regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is blind and deaf. He cannot walk or even crawl. His
head is grossly misshapen.
</P>
<P>
   Megan has cerebral palsy and is stiff and in pain from her
fractures. She and Anthony Jr. have shunts in their brains be cause
of bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Damian are slow in speech and likely will have other
developmental delays.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deciding Whittle's fate had no idea what sentence she
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``As jurors, one of our biggest fears was that after rendering
our verdict, we would discover that there was evidence we were not
allowed to hear that would have changed our verdict,'' juror Dan
Hadley said. ``I have not heard any evidence that would make me
regret my decision.'' &QL;

IT'S BIG DESPITE THE COACHSPEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps the coaches are right. Perhaps it's not
the most important game in Henry Bibby's tenure at USC, and maybe
it's not a critical game for UCLA, which has a brutal upcoming
schedule. But it sure seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off a sweep in Washington and winners of six of their last
seven, the Trojans (9-5, 2-0) have reached a rare perch: They're
tied with Arizona for first place.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way to gain momentum and credibility than by
beating their cross-town rivals for the first time since 1994, a
span of 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why everyone thinks one game is so important,''
Bibby said. ``The two we played last weekend were just as
important.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Sports Arena is a great place to watch a game.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, the issues tonight are staying within range of first
place and avoiding a January downturn. The Bruins play at No. 13
North Carolina on Saturday and host No. 2 Arizona next week, so
defeat tonight could usher in their first three-game losing streak
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, they refuse that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team we have 18 high-level games remaining, however
you divide them up,'' coach Steve Lavin said. ``If you look at
anybody as not being a challenge, that's when you get knocked
off.''
</P>
<P>
   __ To the wire? Despite UCLA's city-series dominance, four of
the last five games at the Sports Arena have been decided in the
final minutes. The Bruins needed a last-second basket by Charles
O'Bannon in 1996 and Toby Bailey's overtime heroics in '98 to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Based on comparative scores, tonight's game shouldn't be any
different. Both teams beat Washington State by 22 points. UCLA lost
at Washington by one, and USC beat Washington by two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better watch every second and every possession, because
both teams are so explosive,'' Washington coach Bob Bender said.
``Every matchup will be critical. Both teams have guys who can
score at each position. It should be a tremendous game.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the homecourt advantage and their victory in Seattle, the
Trojans rate a slight favorites. This might be their best chance to
beat UCLA since coach George Raveling roamed the Sports Arena
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in first place and we're not, so you'd have to say
(UCLA is the underdog),'' Bruins senior Sean Farnham said. ``It's a
different feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rush update: UCLA expects to forward the results of its JaRon
Rush investigation to the NCAA late this week. Given the NCAA's
standard response time and UCLA's likely appeal, the situation
probably won't be resolved until late January.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are bracing for a harsh penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush, a Missouri freshman, was suspended for 13 games by
the NCAA for accepting approximately $1,800 from former AAU coach
Myron Piggie. Upon appeal, the penalty was reduced to nine games
(one-third of the season).
</P>
<P>
   However, JaRon Rush's NCAA violations are more severe. In
addition to financial ties to Piggie (amount unknown), he accepted
$200 from L.A. sports agent Jerome Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was wrong, but I was a stupid kid doing stupid
things,'' said Rush, who returned to practice Monday. ``There's a
pretty good chance I'll come back, if not this season then next.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the situation believe Rush, who's missed
nine games already, could be suspended for the entire season and
get eight or 10 games back on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If he's playing by early February, UCLA would be thrilled.

BUSH VOLUNTEER SHIFTS TO MCCAIN IN AD CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ One day after the leading Republican presidential
candidates shook hands on national television and promised not to
run negative advertisements, a woman's complaint has helped raise
the question, what is negative?
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. John McCain of Arizona on Tuesday presented
reporters with a volunteer who said she was quitting the campaign
of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas because she was asked to criticize
McCain's tax proposals in a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides embraced her as a sign that Bush might not honor
his pledge to stay positive with his ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the script for the commercial was a relatively mild
assessment of the two candidates' tax plans, not a sleazy personal
attack or distortion of voting records _ classic examples of
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   And the woman, Heidi Quigley, a 23-year-old college student,
said she had been reconsidering her support for Bush because she
liked McCain better.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quigley, who has spent the last several weeks making
telephone calls and stuffing envelopes for the Bush campaign in
Manchester, N.H., said she was one of about a dozen volunteers who
had been filmed on Saturday morning for the commercial.
</P>

that ``the Bush camp would choose to go the low road.''

   But Ari Fleischer, an aide to Bush, said the advertisement was a
substantive comparison of a crucial issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called a contest of ideas, that's not negative''
Fleischer said, noting that Bush had made similar comments during
the debates. ``If Senator McCain thinks that's negative, he has yet
to say so.''

<P>
   Fleischer said the campaign would not include Ms. Quigley in its
ad.

   BC-NUKE-SECRETS-LEE-NYT (moved on Saturday, Jan. 8)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, Jan. 8,
about the separate court actions involving Wen Ho Lee, the former
Los Alamos scientist charged with having compromised nuclear
secrets, misidentified the lawyer who filed a civil suit against
the government on his behalf. The suit _ asserting that the
government used ``selectively disclosed information'' to depict Dr.
Lee and his wife as spies for China _ was filed by Brian Sun. (Mark
Holscher represents Dr. Lee in the government's criminal case
against him.)
</P>
<P>
   Also because of an editing error, the article referred
incorrectly to a comment from Holscher _ that the decision to
prosecute Dr. Lee had been influenced by ``other branches of
government.'' The comment did not specifically refer to Christopher
Cox or other members of Congress. Some supporters of Dr. Lee have
contended that Congressional critics of the Clinton adation
_ including a committee led by Representative Cox, Republican of
California _ put pressure on prosecutors for an indictment.

MCCAIN CALLS CONFEDERATE FLAG A `SYMBOL OF HERITAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., S.C.)   (Eds.: Subs for earlier killed version)  
(jw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having spent several months saying he sees both sides
of the Confederate flag issue raging in South Carolina, Sen. John
McCain has issued a statement echoing the language of white
Southerners trying to keep the old battle flag flying over the
Capitol in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, he said in a statement distributed to South Carolina
reporters on Monday and to the national press overnight, is ``a
symbol of heritage.'' The statement was quickly distributed by his
South Carolina campaign to counter what aides said was a
misstatement by McCain on Sunday, when he told a television
interviewer that the flag was ``offensive'' and a ``symbol of
racism and slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked Tuesday night why he had said he saw the flag as a
symbol of heritage, McCain said, ``If I said it, I misspoke,'' and
added, ``My forefathers fought under that flag. I know that they
thought their service was honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the phrase ``symbol of heritage'' may sound innocuous
outside the South, its meaning is unmistakable in a region where
conflicting interpretations of the Civil War are often as important
as any contemporary political issue. Saying the flag is a symbol of
heritage rather than a reminder of racism is an argument made by
those who say the war was not fought over slavery, but over state's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, like the other major Republican candidates, has
declined to take a position on the specific issue of whether the
flag should fly over the South Carolina statehouse, his
characterization of the flag's symbolism makes him the only major
presidential contender to empathize with the flag's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When whites say heritage in the South, they are generally
referring to a heritage in which black people are excluded,'' said
Bernard Powers, a professor of history at the College of
Charleston, S.C. ``In the best possible light, the senator is just
trying to be political, but I fear that he is uninformed about a
critically important element of American history and its legacy for
contemporary times.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue is enormously volatile in South Carolina, which
is holding a Republican presidential primary on Feb. 19 that is
crucial to McCain's hopes for the nomination. The NAACP has
declared an economic boycott against the state as long as the flag
flies over the Capitol, but Republicans in the state House of
Representatives have blocked any attempt to move it.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the flag a symbol of heritage, McCain, of Arizona,
has taken a more conservative position than his chief rival for the
Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or any other
major candidate. When he is asked about the flag issue in South
Carolina, Bush has repeatedly said that the matter was for South
Carolinians to decide. On Monday night, he told MSNBC in an
interview that he would not fly the Confederate flag over the Texas
statehouse ``because of the symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has much closer ties to the leaders of the pro-flag
movement. One of the most prominent members of the so-called
Heritage Movement in the state, who has helped organize the
campaign to keep the flag flying, is Richard M. Quinn, McCain's
chief strategist in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the editor in chief of the neo-Confederate magazine
Southern Partisan, is the father of state Rep. Rick Quinn, the
majority leader, who has said the flag will not be lowered as long
as the NAACP boycott is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Quinn said Tuesday that he had not pushed McCain to
support the flag. But the emotions sweeping the state are intense
and may explain why McCain felt it necessary to issue a formal
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the business community is lobbying hard to remove the
flag, most of the Republicans in the legislature _ who represent
white districts that McCain desperately needs to win the primary _
are fervently in favor of the flag. One prominent state senator,
Arthur Ravenel, a Charleston Republican, referred to the NAACP as
the ``National Association of Retarded Persons'' on Saturday, and
later issued an apology to retarded people. Ravenel said Tuesday
that he misspoke, but he was denounced by some of his colleagues on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's written statement, which also appeared on his Web site,
was his first on the subject, and was issued quickly after he
seemed to suggest on Sunday that he found the flag offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is offensive in many, many ways, as we
all know,'' he said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation'' on
Sunday morning. ``It's a symbol of racism and slavery. But I also
understand how others do not view it in that fashion. My forebears
from Mississippi fought under the Confederate flag. They were not
slave owners, and I'm sure they considered their service _ one I
believe died in Shiloh _ was honorable. So, I obviously understand
why many Americans find it offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, he issued a statement apparently intended to
correct the impression that he finds the flag offensive, and it was
that most recent statement that appears to align him with the flag
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how I view the flag, I understand both sides,'' he said
in the statement. ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery; others
view it as a symbol of heritage. Personally, I see the battle flag
as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said in an interview Tuesday that McCain had misspoke on
Sunday by not saying the flag was offensive ``to some people.'' He
added that McCain has often said that he considered the flag a
symbol of heritage, but had never issued a formal, written
statement of his position before. Several political reporters in
South Carolina confirmed that they had heard McCain describe the
flag as a symbol of heritage over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director said Tuesday night that
McCain had used the phrase many times but was referring to family
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking about the fact that he had relatives that fought
for what they believed was an honorable cause,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bush has several pro-flag supporters in his camp, as well,
including Charlie Condon, the state attorney general, who is
co-chairman of Bush's South Carolina campaign. But none are as well
known for their ideology as is Quinn, whose quarterly magazine has
become a leading journal of the notion that the Civil War was not
fought over slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of the magazine, the cover of which shows a man
reading an Uncle Remus book to his grandchildren, contains a list
of the 15 best Southern books of all time. Though the list includes
Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren and Margaret Mitchell, most are
sympathetic to the Southern cause, and none is by a black writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine takes the view that the flag should be regarded
as a symbol of heritage, rather than slavery,'' said Quinn, who was
the Rev. Pat Robertson's media adviser in 1988. ``Many Southerners
believe that there are positive aspects to Southern history,
without having to link everything to slavery. Taking down the flag
or hiding it or treating it in a dishonorable way turns the banner
over to the racists on both sides. It helps define the flag as
something ugly and evil rather than something that memorializes the
heroism of these young men who fell for the South, most of whom
were not slaveowners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the word heritage means something very different to black
residents of South Carolina, most of whom do not vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word kind of like `choice' or `life' in abortion, a
code word to mean certain things that people don't want to come
right out and say,'' said Lonnie Randolph Jr., president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP, who oversees the group's economic
sanctions against the state. ``Of course the flag has to do with
heritage, but it's a heritage of white supremacy and racism. Too
many people are in denial about what the heritage really is.''

FIXES NOTRE DAME WENT TO BOWL GAME LAST YEAR, STED NOT IN PAST TWO
YEARS 
SOME COACHING JOBS KNOWN FOR SHORT SHELF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The distinction was once claimed by the manager of the New York
Yankees. It has belonged to the head football coach of Notre Dame,
the man behind the bench of the Montreal Canadiens, the head
basketball coaches at Kentucky and UCLA, and anyone who has tried
to coach the Oakland Raiders with Al Davis looking over his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the toughest job in sports may belong to the head coach
of the] Cowboys. Are you listening Mike Martz? Norv Turner? Gary
Kubiak? Mack Brown? Butch Davis? And the rest of the potential
Cowboys coaching wannabes?
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Chan Gailey compiled an 18-14 regular-season
record, won a division title and earned two playoff berths with an
aging team, salary cap restrictions and a general manager who
passed on Randy Moss. Maybe not Super Bowl worthy, but does anyone
have to be reminded what Tom Landry and Jimmy Johnson did in their
first couple of years?
</P>
<P>
   In his late-afternoon news conference yesterday, Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said that Gailey was diligent and honest, that he
worked hard, did everything that Jones had imagined and would be a
head coach in the NFL for many years to come. Only not with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which parity appeared to have maxed out this
season _ when the phrase, ``On Any Given Sunday,'' was not just a
clever movie title or NFL marketing slogan _ expectations at Valley
Ranch remain high. Think about this: Johnson lasted five years,
Barry Switzer four, and Gailey two. The countdown keeps getting
shorter for head coaches of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appears to have inherited George Steinbrenner's trigger
finger, although Joe Torre has a lot to do with mellowing The Boss.
Jones is as intrusive as Al Davis, who actually was the Raiders'
head coach at one time (don't even think about it Jerry). Davis had
no patience for one of his bright young head coaches _ Mike
Shanahan _ who, of course, led the Denver Broncos to the past two
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens still change coaches more often than some people
change socks, but the Flying Frenchmen usually wait until they have
a losing record. Bob Davie may have only one year left before Notre
Dame decides he's no Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian or Holtz, but the
Irish didn't go to a bowl game this year, and in the past two
seasons haven't contended for the national title they believe is a
birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demand to win and win often remains high at UCLA
and Kentucky, even many fans, alumni and boosters appear to
understand that the good old days of Wooden and Rupp are gone and
sights have to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe but until 1989, the Cowboys had only one
head coach in their history. Tom Landry survived some early storms
in his 29-year reign that probably would have shipwrecked him
today. But that was then, this is now. Jones will be hiring his
fourth coach in little more than a decade. He may also have a new
rival for quick trigger finger in Daniel Snyder, the Washington
Redskins' involved owner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the Redskins' coach, may want to think about that if
Jones offers him the Cowboys' coaching job. He may become the
popular example of going from the frying pan into the fire.

HONG KONG PROMISES A CRACKDOWN ON STOWAWAYS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Canada, Calif., Wash.)  (Eds.: removes last 7 words of lead.)  
(With STOWAWAYS-U.S.) 
(jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Alarmed by a surge of smuggling in which Chinese
migrants are carried to the United States and Canada in the
containers of cargo ships, Hong Kong pledged Tuesday to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   The government's pledge came a day after three Chinese stowaways
were found dead in a cargo container shipped to Seattle from Hong
Kong. Fifteen others survived the trip in the container, and nearly
100 illegal immigrants from China have been arrested since December
in containers seized in ports on the west coast of the United
States and Canada. The ships were all loaded in Hong Kong, raising
questions about security in this normally well-policed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our law-enforcement efforts are effective, taking into account
the fact that the crackdown on the recent cases in Long Beach,
Seattle, Los Angeles and Vancouver was the outcome of tip-offs from
Hong Kong,'' said So Kam-shing, a security official in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But So conceded that Hong Kong needed to tighten its inspection
of cargo containers _ particularly canvas-topped containers, which
have become the vehicle of choice for smugglers because they allow
in just enough air to be livable for a two-week journey across the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Customs Department said it would inspect every
canvas-topped container that passed through its port. Canvas-topped
containers account for only 1,000 of the 15 million containers
processed here each year, but even that small number may be hard to
monitor in Hong Kong's teeming harbor, which vies with Singapore as
the world's busiest container port.
</P>
<P>
   ``The containers sometimes arrive just before the ship is due to
sail,'' said Arthur Bowring, the director of the Hong Kong
Shipowners Association.
</P>
<P>
   The trafficking in Chinese immigrants is controlled by shadowy
criminals known as snakeheads. The smugglers charge up to $50,000 a
person, and immigrants often pay off the fare by working in
sweatshops in the United States after they land.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident of human smuggling from China, a Chinese ship,
the Golden Venture, ran aground on a sandbar in Far Rockaway,
Queens, in 1993. Ten people died after jumping overboard.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to stamp out smuggling has taken on an unmistakable
political overtone here. Two recent incidents of stowaways involved
ships owned by the Orient Overseas Container Line, a shipping
company controlled by the family of Hong Kong's chief executive,
Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to show their vigilance, customs officials Tuesday
took journalists along on an inspection of a freighter owned by the
Chinese government. Although the officers rummaged through the
rusting engine room and hold, they did not open any of the
containers being loaded or unloaded. Once the containers are off
the dock, an officer explained, they can no longer be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust the shipping line,'' said the officer,
Ronald Au.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Calling it ``the essence of true conservatism to
be fiscally responsible,'' Sen. John McCain on Tuesday proposed a
tax cut half the size of the one sought by Gov. George W. Bush and
pledged that as president he would seek a congressional vote on a
plan to overhaul Social Security by the end of his first year in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting a plan whose outlines have emerged over the last few
days, McCain not only sharpened his differences with Bush, he also
challenged the longtime tax-cutting orthodoxy of the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal borrowed from Democrats and Republicans alike, with
its $237.5 billion in tax cuts over five years, a size that could
be embraced by Democrats, and itscall for a portion of Social
Security to go to individual retirement accounts, a favorite idea
of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ideological mix, McCain pitched the plan for his
party's true believers, using the words ``conservative'' and
``conservatism'' 11 times in a speech before the local Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is a conservative economic plan,'' he said. ``It
encourages savings, so working families can plan for their future.
It saves Social Security and pays down the national debt so that we
can honor our commitment to our children and future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for his tax cut and still set aside much of the federal
surplus to extend Social Security's long-term solvency, McCain said
he would eliminate $151.7 billion in corporate tax breaks over five
years, a task that would at best be politically difficult on
Capitol Hill and at worst could result in open warfare between
regions and corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let the warning go out, let the warning go out to the army
of lobbyists who so stoutly resist our campaign,'' said McCain,
echoing one of his persistent themes. ``Every tax dollar now wasted
on special breaks for oil companies, ethanol giants, insurance
companies and the multitude of other powerful special interests
with their armies of lobbyists are now at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A list of tax breaks that he said could be eliminated included
tax-exempt bonds for sports stadiums, special provisions for
publishing, special tax breaks for multinational corporations and
tax-free treatment of certain building industry costs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal represented a bet by McCain that even among
Republican primary voters economic prosperity has made Social
Security a greater concern than tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, we can afford a tax cut and American
taxpayers deserve one, but it must be a tax cut promise that a
leader can keep,'' McCain said, in a jab at Bush, who has proposed
a $483 billion tax cut over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Michigan and South Carolina, cast the
debate as a battle over the size of government. ``Do we want bigger
government, or do we want reasonable government?'' asked Bush whose
own tax plan would cut rates in all income brackets. ``Bigger
government or not? My concern is if we leave money on the table in
Washington, it will be spent on more government.''
</P>
<P>
   With their competition intensifying daily, the McCain and Bush
campaigns each released blizzards of paper to put their own tax cut
plan in the most favorable light, sometimes using different
assumptions and picking and choosing the best cases to make their
political points.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, noted that a ``lucky millionaire''
currently paying about $325,000 in taxes would get a tax cut of
$3,500 under his plan and a tax cut of $50,000 under Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that his plan, which has as its centerpiece a
substantial expansion of the 15 percent tax bracket so that it
would apply to couples earning up to $70,000 annually, would make
25 million more taxpayers subject to the lowest tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp argued back that this would not benefit the 70
million taxpayers already in the 15 percent bracket. And Bush
advisers said many middle-income families would not use another
feature of McCain's plan, an IRA-like ``family savings account in
which families could defer taxes on up to $6,000 in savings
annually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you simply expand the 15 percent bracket, there are a lot
of people who are not going to get tax relief under this plan,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a
research organization that is often critical of Republican tax
plans, said McCain's proposal would provide little or no benefit to
the three-fifths of taxpayers with income less than $39,000 a year.
McIntyre said 72.5 percent of the tax cuts would go to taxpayers
making between $65,000 and $319,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But McIntyre said McCain's plan was most different from Bush's
proposal in how it treated the very wealthiest taxpayers, the 1
percent with incomes of $319,000 and above. The Bush plan would
give 36.9 percent of its tax reductions to that group while the
McCain plan would give 1.8 percent of its benefits to that most
affluent group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he began a new trip through New Hampshire, a state with many
retirees, McCain put much of his emphasis on shoring up the Social
Security system for the coming retirement of the baby boomers,
saying, ``Social Security has been so grossly politicized that
success will require all our best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   He chastised both parties for making the retirement system into
a political hot potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats will have to stop using the issue to scare seniors
into voting against Republicans,'' he said. ``Republicans will have
to resist using Social Security revenues to finance tax cuts. And
both parties must stop raiding retirement dollars from the trust
fund to waste on new spending.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain called for 20 percent of the Social Security payroll tax
to be placed in individual retirement accounts in which workers
would be able to choose from an approved list of investment
options. He said they would also be guaranteed that they would
never get less in benefits than if they had stayed in the current
Social Security system. To pay for the transition to such accounts,
McCain would devote $729 billion of the non-Social Security surplus
over 10 years to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged that if elected president he would forward his
principles of reform to Congress his first week in office and ask
for a formal endorsement of them. Then he would summon the Social
Security trustees and the bipartisan leadership of Congress to
``submit a plan that I will insist be voted upon by the end of my
first year in office.''

WORK IN PROGRESS: KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BOUNCING BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York has proposed a state budget of
$76.8 billion, a 5.5 percent increase over last year. The budget
includes money from all sources, including the federal government;
state spending would increase 5.1 percent to $52.4 billion. The
budget requires the approval of state lawmakers, who will almost
certainly insist on more financing for some programs.
</P>
<P>
   TAX CUTS
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposes $700 million in new tax cuts, which would
supplement $2.3 billion in previously approved cuts in property
taxes and other areas. The largest amount of the new cuts, $500
million, comes from repealing a state energy tax for residential
and business consumers. That is one of several moves, such as tax
credits and low-cost power, intended to encourage businesses,
particularly in high technology, to move to and expand in upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL AID
</P>
<P>
   The governor is requesting a $355.2 million increase, to $12.9
billion, in operating money to elementary and secondary schools.
That is in addition to a $210 million increase in aid for school
construction. For the second year in a row, Pataki is also seeking
to backtrack on a 1997 agreement with the Legislature that
committed the state to new efforts to offer prekindergarten and
full-day kindergarten classes, to reduce class sizes in elementary
schools, and to give schools more money for minor maintenance. In
all, Democrats contend that he would cut $282 million from those
programs, a figure the governor's office says is exaggerated. The
governor also proposed, as he had in the past, eliminating a $67
million program to subsidize urban teachers' salaries, mostly in
New York City. That is another reduction expected to be fiercely
contested by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHER EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan calls for modest increases in aid to
universities: $74.6 million to the State University of New York,
for a total of $1.7 billion, and $19.2 million more for the City
University of New York, bringing the total above $1 billion. The
aid would allow tuition fees to remain the same for the fifth
consecutive year. At the same time, Pataki called for reducing
tuition assistance for poor students by $40 million, to $575
million, because of declining participation.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not propose new cuts for the Medicaid program, a
first for Pataki. As a result, Medicaid spending would increase by
$1.3 billion to $30.9 billion. The budget also includes a new
program to extend health insurance to as many as a million working
poor people by raising the cigarette tax by 55 cents, to $1.11 a
pack, the highest of any state. The program, which would cost the
state $750 million during the next three and a half years, would
also be financed by revenue from the settlement with tobacco
companies and by federal health care money.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   The governor has proposed an additional $157 million to create
two mental health programs, bringing total spending for such
services to $1.9 billion. A $125 million community-based program
would extend a range of treatment to adults and children. In
addition, for the first time, $32 million would be used to put into
practice a new state law that allows courts to compel the mentally
ill to seek treatment. The money would pay for more case managers
and other workers, as well as psychiatric services.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD CARE
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's plan, child care programs would receive an
additional $85 million in state aid, for a total of $711 million.
The money would pay for 159,000 child care subsidies for needy
families and would go to hire up to 170 state employees to monitor
child care and conduct background checks of providers.
</P>
<P>
   DEBT PAYMENT
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed tripling the size of a two-year-old fund
used to repay the state's debt, to $750 million from $250 million.
Two-thirds of the money, $500 million, would be used immediately to
reduce the current $37 billion debt, and the remaining $250 million
would be used the next year. In addition, Pataki has introduced a
series of fiscal measures that restricts borrowing and places a cap
on future debt.

HONG KONG VOWS TO CRACK DOWN ON SMUGGLING: 19 MORE STOWAWAYS
FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alarmed by a sudden and sometimes tragic string of
human smuggling cases from its shores, Hong Kong authorities
pledged Tuesday to crack down on stowaways on container ships.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials said customs agents will inspect every
soft-top cargo container and that carbon-dioxide and heat detectors
will be used to search for stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping companies have agreed to report suspicious cargo and to
check on new clients.
</P>
<P>
   Even as officials made those pledges, immigration agents here
found yet another container loaded with Chinese illegal immigrants.
Nineteen men were in a container taken off the Hanjin Yokohama at 5
a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be the last one coming out of Hong Kong _
knock on wood,'' said Todd Bancroft, detective senior inspector in
the organized crime bureau of the Hong Kong police. He and another
Hong Kong officer have been in Seattle the past few days sharing
intelligence on immigrant smuggling with law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is taking this very, very seriously. Once the
containers started arriving (in the United States), everybody got
involved: Customs, immigration, Hong Kong police,'' said Bancroft,
a Canadian who works on contract with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agents took the 19 found Tuesday into custody. As
with three previous human smuggling incidents during the past two
weeks in Seattle, immigration agents had been tipped off and were
waiting for the Hanjin Yokohama, which left Hong Kong on Dec. 27,
to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   So Kam-shing, Hong Kong's principal secretary for security, said
in a news release Tuesday that his government alerted officials
here. In some cases, U.S. immigration agents have been tipped off
to the serial number of the container that has stowaways inside.
</P>
<P>
   All 19 of the stowaways discovered Tuesday were in reasonably
good health. Monday, agents discovered three dead stowaways and 15
others in weak condition on a container taken from the NYK Cape
May. The three dead stowaways are all men. Immigration officials
erroneously reported Monday that one was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which has jurisdiction over deaths on the high seas, is
investigating. There are no signs of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokeswoman said the ships' crew, shipping agents and
others could be held criminally liable only if investigators can
prove they took some action to further the smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies at the King County Medical Examiner's Office on
Tuesday showed that the three men did not die of injury or disease.
Investigator David Delgado said further tests will be conducted to
determine cause of death, with results expected in four to five
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told immigration agents Monday that the men had died
three to seven days ago, said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The container had been sealed and left at the port of Hong Kong
several days before being loaded on the Cape May, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   During the voyage, the 18 men suffered from sea sickness and
eventually ran out of most of their food and water. Their
soft-topped container was in the hold of the ship. Four containers
were stacked above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were virtually entombed,'' said Virginia Kice, another
INS spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the survivors remained at Harborview Medical Center
here Tuesday. The hospital listed all seven, who suffered from
malnourishment and dehydration, in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials hope news of the tragedy deters other Chinese
nationals from following suit. In the past year, West Coast ports
have seen a rash of container smuggling. There have been 14
instances involving more than 200 stowaways since February at
Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, Tacoma and Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, stowaways have emerged well-fed and in good
health, appearing in creased khakis and carrying cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions, however, often are ghastly _ a dozen or more men
crowd inside a 40-foot container and live there for two weeks.
Stowaways have food and water and often a crude source of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything we can to publicize in this country
the tragedy that happened and also spread the word
internationally,'' Kice said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Seattle have said at least two Hong
Kong shipping companies _ Yuk Yat Trading and Lap Kei Trading _
were responsible for sending containers bearing stowaways to
Washington state. Bancroft said those companies are bogus.
</P>
<P>
   He also said inspecting soft-topped containers _ used because
they can be easily opened for ventilation and escape _ should be
easy. There are only a few soft-topped containers on cargo ships
that typically carry thousands of the 20- and 40-foot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, companies have been able to lease the containers in
Hong Kong, take them away from the port and fill them, Bancroft
said. Then they are returned to the port in Hong Kong and not
opened before loading on a ship.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers' plan in the United States, immigration officials
say, is to have the containers unloaded but not picked up. After
the docks are quiet, the stowaways cut a hole in the cloth-top
container and flee.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shuing, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
D.C., said the Chinese government has strengthened its garrison in
the coastal province of Fujian in an effort to crack down on
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the illegal departure of the stowaways may be one of
the prices China must pay for creating a more open country over the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now free to move anywhere to find work, and China
is very open now,'' Yu said. ``That's why people have many more
openings for getting out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bancroft said Hong Kong has been chosen as a starting point
because it one of the few ports in China where vessels leave
directly for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, smugglers have used fishing boats and other vessels
to bring over hundreds of immigrants at a time. But smugglers have
changed their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling by container is better for stowaways in the winter,
and it's lucrative, Bancroft said.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $8,000 to ship a container from Hong Kong to Seattle,
and those smuggled are charged $40,000 to $60,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants being detained in Seattle are from the
Fujian Province, in coastal China not far from Taiwan. Fujian has a
long history of sending out immigrants around the world and of
smuggling. Successful immigrants send back money, persuading even
more people to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that you can sit in a tea house or cafe there and
listen as customers discuss human smuggling plans, Bancroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those immigrants is a network of smugglers. Bancroft said
one or two crime syndicates seem to be at work sending stowaways on
containers to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The network is complicated. Immigrants have to be smuggled into
Hong Kong. Even though Hong Kong is part of China, it takes special
permission from the government for Chinese from other parts of the
country to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian residents arrested on the U.S. West Coast may be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the embassy spokesman, said once the Chinese citizenship of
the stowaways is documented, China hopes to work closely with the
United States to see that they are repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   They face a fine and re-education course, in which they would
face criticism from local leaders in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local leadership will trying to show them their mistake; they
will perhaps be fined and then they will be freed,'' Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   He blames the false promises of Chinese smugglers called
``snakeheads,'' who are telling people that in America ``they can
make a fortune _ maybe a million dollars _ in two, three or five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The stowaways have been led to believe it will be relatively
easy to get political asylum in the United States by claiming they
are fleeing China's one-child-per-family rule, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who have represented people who have been smuggled
from China to the United States say that some are legitimately
fleeing family-planning rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political asylum is the claim that most of them make,'' said
Jules Coven, a New York attorney. ``The major thrust right now is
that they are afraid of the Chinese one-child family planning
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Women or married men can file a refugee claim based on the
one-child policy, which Coven says has resulted in forced abortions
and sterilizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are believed by the judge, then they will have a
successful refugee claim,'' Coven said. ``It's not automatic that
all of them will be deported.''

A GERMAN-CANADIAN, A KEY FIGURE IN THE KOHL CASE, FIGHTS
EXTRADITION
</HEADLINE>
  (With GERMANY-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karlheinz Schreiber, a millionaire German arms broker, is the
kind of international figure more normally found under the palm
trees of Rio de Janeiro than on the snowplowed sidewalks of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, a persuasive man who made his fortune in private
deals, is fighting extradition from Canada to Germany to testify in
a corruption investigation of Helmut Kohl, the former German
chancellor who led the conservative Christian Democratic Union for
a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber openly acknowledges handing an envelope stuffed with 1
million German marks to two Christian Democrat emissaries in a
Swiss restaurant in July 1991, when Kohl was in power. The money,
he said in a telephone interview last Friday, was campaign money,
not bribe money. But the cash, about $670,000 at the time, never
appeared in the party's official accounts, German government
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do not understand is why he did not allow the money to
go to the official account first, then to a special account?''
Schreiber asked of Kohl. On Jan. 3, German prosecutors began an
investigation of Kohl to see if he should face criminal charges for
campaign finance violations, notably the use of secret party
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   With the reputation of the father of German reunification
possibly at stake, German investigators have increased the pressure
on Canada to send Schreiber, a dual Canadian-German citizen, back
to Germany. On Monday, Schreiber's name surfaced again, this time
in connection with a second payment to the party, a bag of $100,000
German marks, or about $52,000, that was handed over in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But in the interview, Schreiber, 65, a silver-haired
millionaire, sounded unruffled by the week he spent in a detention
center in Toronto, where the extradition fight began, in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to his skill at making friends in high places, two
major contributors to his $815,000 bail were former Canadian
cabinet members. They seemed unperturbed by hopscotching ahead of a
German warrant seeking him for questioning. Since May 1997, when
the warrant was issued, he has moved from his mansion near Munich
to his apartment near St. Moritz, Switzerland; then, skipping his
mother's funeral in Germany last summer, he moved into a luxury
hotel in Toronto, registering under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karlheinz is basically an honest and decent person,'' Elmer
MacKay, a former solicitor general who helped raise the bail. ``I
am concerned that this firestorm in Germany could burn Karlheinz,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Schreiber started real estate businesses in Alberta
in the 1970s, then, in the 1980s, became known as Bavaria's man in
Ottawa. A friend of the late Franz Josef Strauss, then governor of
Bavaria and chairman of Airbus Industrie, Schreiber helped broker
the largest aircraft purchase in Canadian history and Airbus' first
beachhead in North America: the $1.5 billion sale of 34 Airbus jets
to Air Canada in 1988, then a state airline.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying for other German companies, he brokered the sale of 12
Messerschmitt helicopters for the Canadian Coast Guard, and
unsuccessfully pushed a plan by Thyssen Industrie AG to build
armored vehicles in Nova Scotia. He also tried to persuade BMW to
set up a car plant in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber has not been formally accused of any crime, but he is
wanted in Germany for a tax evasion inquiry based commissions he
earned on those deals and one in the Mideast: the 1991 sale of 36
Thyssen-made Fuchs tanks to Saudi Arabia. After raiding his house
in Bavaria in 1995, German investigators began studying his
schedule and bank records, trying to decipher a system of coded
Swiss bank accounts to see if Schreiber paid kickbacks to Canadian
or German officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure he paid something,'' said Giorgio Pelossi, a former
business partner who had a falling-out with Schreiber in 1991 and
is now a prosecution witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me everything: who he had to pay and so on,'' Pelossi
said in a telephone interview from his home in Lugano, Switzerland.
``They found the evidence later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pelossi's statements, Schreiber called them ``a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political game,'' he said, noting that center-left
governments in Germany and Canada are now investigating business
deals made a decade ago under center-right governments in Germany
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Greenspan, his Toronto lawyer, has derided attempts by
investigators to decode the Swiss bank accounts as ``a game of
Scrabble.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, a self-made man who got his start as a buyer of
carpets in Iran, has bounced back from his jail stay to take on the
German and Canadian governments with a battery of legal and press
pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with German newspapers and television, he has
demanded that the Christian Democrats return to him the 1 million
marks, claiming that while he does not know what happened to the
money, it appears not to have been used for legitimate campaign
work.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal front, he has hired Greenspan, one of Toronto's
most formidable criminal lawyers. Last year, American Lawyer
magazine called Greenspan and his brother, Brian, ``Canada's Answer
to the Dream Team,'' in reference to their success in beating back
American extradition requests for celebrity clients.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber has sued Canada and Germany for $690,000 each for
``personal injury and mental distress'' caused by his detention
last September. He also has sued Canada's Justice Ministry for $28
million, saying it illegally requested his confidential bank
records from the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   With a host of other legal challenges up his sleeve, Greenspan
predicted that there is little chance that German prosecutors will
see his client on German soil any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that the extradition request was made under an
``investigative warrant'' that demands Schreiber's return to
Germany to answer questions about allegations that he failed to pay
more than $14 million in German taxes from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Canadian police arrested someone and detained them in
jail for the purpose of investigation, for even 20 minutes, it
would be unconstitutional,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, Canada's extradition treaty with Germany
does not list tax evasion as an extraditable crime.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to challenge the constitutionality of Canada's brand new
Extradition Act, which streamlines expulsion procedures, he said:
``This case has all the earmarks of ending up in the Supreme Court
of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to a supporting document for Schreiber's arrest,
public prosecutors in Augsburg, Germany, wrote in late August that
prosecutors expect to issue an expanded warrant that ``will also
include bribery, and aiding and abetting criminal breach of trust.
''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Schreiber has German citizenship, and so he has
to come to Germany and be charged in Germany,'' Hans-Juergen Kolb,
a deputy state prosecutor, said by telephone from Augsburg. ``We
think Schreiber's accusations are not right.''

DEMOCRATS RESHUFFLE DECK IN IOWA

<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSCATINE, Iowa _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley traded barbs Tuesday
about farm, health and tobacco policy, suggesting those issues
provided a guide to the Democratic presidential contenders' broader
vision and competence.
</P>
<P>
   The testy, long-distance exchanges came as the candidates
campaigned in the state where the nominating season opens with
precinct caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, is fighting back from
a weak performance in an Iowa debate Saturday in which Gore, the
vice president, put his challenger on the defensive by blasting his
voting record on agriculture. Gore hoped to keep up the offensive
by making Bradley respond anew to a pointed critique of Bradley's
health plan, especially as it relates to older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is not only one of the nation's most agri-centric states
but also has one of the oldest populations. The average age of
caucus-goers is 51, far above that of the adult population as a
whole. Polls show Gore holds about a 20 percentage point lead with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley,seeking an opening that might curb any momentum Gore is
enjoying in Iowa, played the tobacco card. He clearly hoped that
voters would recall _ or that the news media would remind them of _
Gore's former association with the tobacco industry and his
reliance on a top adviser who was once a chief strategist for
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself avoided direct criticism, but had his staff hand
out documents hammering Gore for tobacco-related votes and
statements Gore made as a senator from Tennessee a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad (Gore) has evolved on this issue,'' Bradley told
reporters. ``He's in the right place now ... but this is a matter
of measuring intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be positive, I'm still going to try to give
people something to vote for,'' he said. ``But I think it's absurd
to get into the position of saying anything anybody ever did, any
position anyone ever took, is off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday's debate and again Tuesday, however, Bradley
also complained that the race was ``not about the past, but about
the future'' when Gore challenged his Senate record on farm issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, as a House member and senator, accepted political
contributions from tobacco interests and in his ill-fated 1988
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination touted his
experience in farming tobacco. Gore accepted the donations for a
while even after the death of his sister from lung cancer. In a
shake-up of his campaign staff last year, Gore moved Carter Eskew,
who helped to manage the tobacco industry's most recent campaign
against new federal strictures, to a top job.
</P>
<P>
   The documents Bradley's staff distributed cited, among other
charges, Gore's vote against a Bradley amendment to a 1985 Senate
bill to keep the tobacco tax at a higher rate to avoid raising
Medicare premiums and a letter Gore wrote to the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette in 1988 saying, ``I do not believe the answer to
curbing our nation's tobacco use lies in banning tobacco
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arguing that he has ``led the fight'' against smoking and
tobacco company attempts to ``lure children'' into smoking, said
Bradley's statement ``sort of smacks of a sort of desperate,
negative campaigning.'' He said Bradley ``went back 15 years to
pick out some amendment'' to point out.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used a campaign appearance before children at Wallace
Elementary School in Des Moines to spell out how he intends to aim
his health-care proposal to tackle the problem of tobacco use among
children. He briefly noted that his program would spend money on
research on the causes of childhood smoking and the role of
community health programs in establishing health habits for
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept up the same theme on farm issues that he began in
Saturday's debate _ that Bradley's record has not benefited
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He voted time and time and time against disaster assistance
for farmers, not only after the 1993 flood but during the drought
of the 1980s. So this is not anything out of the ordinary for
him,'' Gore said in an interview with Iowa farm reporters. ``He has
a very anti-farm record.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has used nearly every speaking opportunity since the
debate to apologize for his previous ignorance on farm issues, and
tout how much he's learned in the past year from Iowa farmers. ``I
didn't know a lot about agriculture,'' Bradley said in Mason City
on Tuesday morning. ``I'm from New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his advisers almost certainly would have taken any
comments from Bradley in the closing days of the Iowa campaign and
attempted to portray them as negative. Bickering _ or the
appearance of bickering _ among candidates is a turn off to many
voters and can lower turnout. Depressing participation in the
caucuses would almost certainly benefit Gore, who has almost solid
support of the state's Democratic establishment and labor unions _
two groups who are very likely to get their supporters to caucuses
no matter how the campaign has gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane took pains to picture the Bradley
comments, as well as a humorous Bradley reference Monday night to
``Gore-istas'' as evidence Bradley had abandoned a pledge to remain
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all in the context of spending 12 months saying he
wasn't going to do negative politics,'' Lehane said. ``The
philosopher king has fallen off the pedestal and is now engaging in
negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point this was going to become comparative,'' Bradley
said Tuesday. ``When somebody does make a change, they ought to
explain it.''

<P>
   One day after the Dallas Cowboys were eliminated in the first
round of the NFL playoffs, owner Jerry Jones called coach Chan
Gailey in to discuss offseason moves.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jones made his first offseason move _ firing Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Gailey has displayed a passion and eagerness to exceed,''
Jones said. ``He's had a work ethic unparalleled with anyone I've
worked with inside or outside of sports. If you'd want to get in a
foxhole with somebody, you'd want to do it with Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision I had to make today was about football, not
about egos, not about friendship gone awry, not about
contentiousness. This decision is about football.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had the shortest tenure among the four men to coach the
Cowboys and was the only one not to win a Super Bowl. In his first
head coaching job, the former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator lasted only two years. His firing came on the heels of
an 8-8 season and a 27-10 wild-card loss to Minnesota on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my abilities,'' Gailey said. ``I feel like I have
the ability to do it. I learned that we're very bottom-line
oriented. That's the way decisions are made most often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys went 18-14 under Gailey, who went 10-6 and won the
NFC East in his first year after inheriting a 6-10 team. The 1998
team lost its wild-card game at home to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Cowboys won only one game on the road and lost
to non-playoff teams like the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Giants,
Arizona Cardinals, New York Jets and New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Gailey's offensive philosophy that eventually made
him the odd man out, Jones said. Gailey, who doubled as the
offensive coordinator, was known for his conservative approach,
which didn't fully utilize the talents of quarterback Troy Aikman
or running back Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come and take over a veteran team that's had a great
deal of success, they believe very strongly in what they're
doing,'' Gailey said. ``Unless you do a supreme job of winning them
over immediately, it's always in the back of their minds, an idea
that there may be another way of doing it. That may have been the
case, which is why everybody wasn't on the same page at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones initially talked about having Gailey rework his offense
during the offseason to tailor it more to Aikman's liking. Tuesday,
during his news conference to announce Gailey's firing, Jones said
such a change would be too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who had three years remaining on his contract, seemed
unwilling to rework his offense, though he said he wasn't given the
option to stay and change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This philosophy has been to the Super Bowl three times at
Pittsburgh,'' Gailey said. ``This philosophy won the division last
year and was eighth in the league in offense in its first year
being involved here. So why should it be changed?''
</P>
<P>
   The season began with promise when the Cowboys rallied to defeat
the Redskins in overtime in Washington. They added two more wins
but then lost nine of their next 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense performed so poorly that they lost four
games in which opponents were limited to 13 points. They went 1-7
in games decided by a touchdown or less, 0-3 in games decided by a
field goal or less.
</P>
<P>
   They also had the dubious distinction of leading the league in
penalties and penalty yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it discipline problems? Was it injuries? Was it player
problems? Was it coaching problems? Probably some of all of that,''
Gailey said. ``Bottom line is we didn't get it done, and
unfortunately we work with the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' veteran core is aging, creating a sense of urgency.
Yet that core isn't so old that the Cowboys think they should be a
.500 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (about) a fresh approach, a change, doing something
different for the Erik Williamses, the Emmitt Smiths, the Troy
Aikmans, the Michael Irvins, to name a few,'' Jones said. ``I
thought doing something fresh and a challenging thing just might be
the ticket, because I knew the skills that those players have. They
tried their hearts out. They worked at it to try to make it
productive. We just aren't as productive offensively as we need to
be, and we haven't been for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go in a direction that philosophically offensively
was quite a bit different than it's been the last two years. The
bottom line was, I certainly felt two years ago and feel now, with
the personnel we have, we have to have very impressive offensive
production.''

MCCAIN ISSUES CONFLICTING STATEMENTS ON CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., S.C.)   (Eds.: Top five graphs new, clarifying. Picks up ``But the
statement...'')  
(jw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last three days, Sen. John McCain has made three
conflicting statements on the Confederate flag issue raging in the
key primary state of South Carolina, and with each statement, his
position has become less clear.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, speaking on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,''
McCain said he considered the battle flag ``offensive'' and a
``symbol of racism and slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a statement distributed to South Carolina
reporters, McCain reversed himself and called the flag ``a symbol
of heritage,'' using the precise language that white Republicans
have used in the state to justify keeping the flag flying over the
statehouse. Aides said he had misspoken in the television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Tuesday night, in an interview with The New York Times
in New Hampshire, McCain reversed himself again, saying that if he
called the flag a symbol of heritage, he misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement calling the flag a symbol of heritage has been
on his campaign Web site for two days, and was distributed as a
news release by his staff. His top South Carolina strategist,
Richard M. Quinn, said earlier in the day that McCain had called
the flag a symbol of heritage at least 150 times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But while the phrase ``symbol of heritage'' may sound innocuous
outside the South, its meaning is unmistakable in a region where
conflicting interpretations of the Civil War are often as important
as any contemporary political issue. Saying the flag is a symbol of
heritage rather than a reminder of racism is an argument made by
those who say the war was not fought over slavery, but over state's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, like the other major Republican candidates, has
declined to take a position on the specific issue of whether the
flag should fly over the South Carolina statehouse, his
characterization of the flag's symbolism makes him the only major
presidential contender to empathize with the flag's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When whites say heritage in the South, they are generally
referring to a heritage in which black people are excluded,'' said
Bernard Powers, a professor of history at the College of
Charleston, S.C. ``In the best possible light, the senator is just
trying to be political, but I fear that he is uninformed about a
critically important element of American history and its legacy for
contemporary times.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue is enormously volatile in South Carolina, which
is holding a Republican presidential primary on Feb. 19 that is
crucial to McCain's hopes for the nomination. The NAACP has
declared an economic boycott against the state as long as the flag
flies over the Capitol, but Republicans in the state House of
Representatives have blocked any attempt to move it.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the flag a symbol of heritage, McCain, of Arizona,
has taken a more conservative position than his chief rival for the
Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or any other
major candidate. When he is asked about the flag issue in South
Carolina, Bush has repeatedly said that the matter was for South
Carolinians to decide. On Monday night, he told MSNBC in an
interview that he would not fly the Confederate flag over the Texas
statehouse ``because of the symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has much closer ties to the leaders of the pro-flag
movement. One of the most prominent members of the so-called
Heritage Movement in the state, who has helped organize the
campaign to keep the flag flying, is Quinn, McCain's chief
strategist in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the editor in chief of the neo-Confederate magazine
Southern Partisan, is the father of state Rep. Rick Quinn, the
majority leader, who has said the flag will not be lowered as long
as the NAACP boycott is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Quinn said Tuesday that he had not pushed McCain to
support the flag. But the emotions sweeping the state are intense
and may explain why McCain felt it necessary to issue a formal
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the business community is lobbying hard to remove the
flag, most of the Republicans in the legislature _ who represent
white districts that McCain desperately needs to win the primary _
are fervently in favor of the flag. One prominent state senator,
Arthur Ravenel, a Charleston Republican, referred to the NAACP as
the ``National Association of Retarded Persons'' on Saturday, and
later issued an apology to retarded people. Ravenel said Tuesday
that he misspoke, but he was denounced by some of his colleagues on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's written statement, which also appeared on his Web site,
was his first on the subject, and was issued quickly after he
seemed to suggest on Sunday that he found the flag offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is offensive in many, many ways, as we
all know,'' he said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation'' on
Sunday morning. ``It's a symbol of racism and slavery. But I also
understand how others do not view it in that fashion. My forebears
from Mississippi fought under the Confederate flag. They were not
slave owners, and I'm sure they considered their service _ one I
believe died in Shiloh _ was honorable. So, I obviously understand
why many Americans find it offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, he issued a statement apparently intended to
correct the impression that he finds the flag offensive, and it was
that most recent statement that appears to align him with the flag
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how I view the flag, I understand both sides,'' he said
in the statement. ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery; others
view it as a symbol of heritage. Personally, I see the battle flag
as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said in an interview Tuesday that McCain had misspoke on
Sunday by not saying the flag was offensive ``to some people.'' He
added that McCain has often said that he considered the flag a
symbol of heritage, but had never issued a formal, written
statement of his position before. Several political reporters in
South Carolina confirmed that they had heard McCain describe the
flag as a symbol of heritage over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director said Tuesday night that
McCain had used the phrase many times but was referring to family
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking about the fact that he had relatives that fought
for what they believed was an honorable cause,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bush has several pro-flag supporters in his camp, as well,
including Charlie Condon, the state attorney general, who is
co-chairman of Bush's South Carolina campaign. But none are as well
known for their ideology as is Quinn, whose quarterly magazine has
become a leading journal of the notion that the Civil War was not
fought over slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of the magazine, the cover of which shows a man
reading an Uncle Remus book to his grandchildren, contains a list
of the 15 best Southern books of all time. Though the list includes
Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren and Margaret Mitchell, most are
sympathetic to the Southern cause, and none is by a black writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine takes the view that the flag should be regarded
as a symbol of heritage, rather than slavery,'' said Quinn, who was
the Rev. Pat Robertson's media adviser in 1988. ``Many Southerners
believe that there are positive aspects to Southern history,
without having to link everything to slavery. Taking down the flag
or hiding it or treating it in a dishonorable way turns the banner
over to the racists on both sides. It helps define the flag as
something ugly and evil rather than something that memorializes the
heroism of these young men who fell for the South, most of whom
were not slaveowners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the word heritage means something very different to black
residents of South Carolina, most of whom do not vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word kind of like `choice' or `life' in abortion, a
code word to mean certain things that people don't want to come
right out and say,'' said Lonnie Randolph Jr., president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP, who oversees the group's economic
sanctions against the state. ``Of course the flag has to do with
heritage, but it's a heritage of white supremacy and racism. Too
many people are in denial about what the heritage really is.''

FISK AND PEREZ, RIVALS IN '75, BOTH GAIN HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each played more than two decades and, incredibly, the signature
moments in the careers of Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez occurred on
back-to-back nights, on the same field, both pursuing the same
championship for rival teams. Their lives will intersect again in
July, in Cooperstown, N.Y., but this time they will share a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and Perez were elected Tuesday into baseball's Hall of Fame
by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association of America.
Fisk, a catcher for the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox who
played more games at his position than anyone in history, was named
on 397 on 499 ballots, 79.6 percent; a player must be named on 75
percent of the ballots. Perez, a first baseman who had an uncanny
knack for delivering clutch hits in his 23 years, was named on 385
ballots, 10 more than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   No other eligible player came close to being elected: slugger
Jim Rice, a former teammate of Fisk's with the Red Sox, was named
on 257 ballots (51.5 percent), followed by Gary Carter (248 votes),
Bruce Sutter (192) and Goose Gossage (166). This year's results do
not bode well for those who weren't elected, because this was
considered to be a relatively weak year for first-time candidates _
certainly compared with last year, when Nolan Ryan, George Brett
and Robin Yount were inducted together, and even next year, when
Dave Winfield, Kirby Puckett and a few other notable players will
be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez's election should provide some hope for those still
waiting. This was his ninth year of eligibility, and when he
received a phone call at his home in Puerto Rico on Tuesday
informing him of the results, he responded, ``Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is the first Cuban-born player to be voted into the Hall
of Fame, and he immediately called Teodora Perez, his 88-year-old
mother who lives in Cuba, with the news. ``This is very special for
me,'' Perez said on a conference call with reporters, the tone of
his voice revealing his joy. ``It's sweet now, when I'm in. It
doesn't matter how long I had to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 57, played 23 seasons for the Reds, Red Sox, Montreal
Expos and Philadelphia Phillies, and he becomes the third member of
the great Cincinnati Reds teams from the 1970s to be elected into
the Hall; he will join Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan. Pete Rose also
played on those teams, and Perez essentially dodged the question of
whether he thought Rose should be inducted. ``I hope everything
comes up all right for him,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, 52, was born in Vermont and grew up in New Hampshire and
was embraced by New Englanders when he joined the Red Sox, and even
after he left Boston for Chicago at the end of a bitter contract
fray before the 1981 season, he usually has been associated with
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk finished his career with Chicago, catching most of his
2,226 games at the position for the White Sox and finishing with
376 home runs. But Fisk ended his career on bad terms with the
White Sox management _ scars that still exist, he said Tuesday _
and after he took a special assistant spot with the Red Sox last
year, there has been speculation he would choose to have a Red Sox
cap on his Hall of Fame plaque. Fisk will wait before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad I couldn't wear both of them,'' said Fisk, who waited
nervously at his Illinois home before learning tearfully that he
had been elected into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk was Boston's catcher in 1975, and that fall, the Red Sox
played the Reds in what is generally considered to be the most
dramatic World Series ever. After five tense games, the Red Sox
trailed the Reds three games to two, and the Red Sox fell behind,
6-3, late in Game 6. But Boston rallied to tie the scores and the
two teams fought into extra innings, stars from both sides making
great plays. At one point, Pete Rose stepped into the batter's box
for the Reds, turned to Fisk and remarked about what a great game
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk led off the bottom of the 12th inning against the Reds' Pat
Darcy and pulled a high drive down the left-field line. NBC,
broadcasting the World Series at that time, had inserted a camera
into the base of Fenway Park's left-field wall, and that lens
captured the timeless image of Fisk watching his long drive,
gesturing with his hands for the ball to stay fair, begging with
body English _ before throwing his arms into the air when he saw
the ball hit the foul pole, ending Game 6 after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   As Fisk barreled around the bases, dodging fans and charging
through others, he passed Perez coming off the field, with his Reds
teammates. Cincinnati had lost the World Series in 1970, and in
1974, and the team that was known as the Big Red Machine was in
jeopardy of going down as another postseason underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 7 the following night, the Red Sox took a 3-0 lead, and
Perez remembered Tuesday that before the Reds hit in the sixth
inning, Cincinnati manager Sparky Anderson paced in the small and
cold hallway that runs from the visitors' dugout to the clubhouse.
Anderson fretted about how the Reds would be perceived if they
lost. ``Sparky, don't worry about it,'' said Perez, a popular
player in part because of his joyful disposition. ``Just give me
two men on or three men on.''
</P>
<P>
   With a runner on base in the sixth, Perez waited on a slow curve
from the Boston left-hander Bill Lee _ Tuesday, Perez said he could
still see the pitch coming toward him, still feel the contact _ and
hammered a two-run home run. He hit 379 home runs in his career,
drove in 1,652 runs, and those two were the most important. The
Reds went on to win Game 7 and the World Series. After being voted
into the Hall of Fame, Perez mentioned that what made him most
proud in his career was winning so many games.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and Perez will go into the Hall of Fame now, side by side.
``I am thrilled to go with him,'' Perez said, ``to go in with
somebody you know.'' &QL;

PEGASUS TO ACQUIRE GOLDEN SKY FOR $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Golden Sky Holdings Inc., which got its start
in 1996 in Kansas City and went on to become the second-largest
reseller of DirecTV, was bought Tuesday for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasus Communications Inc., a Pennsylvania company that itself
may become a takeover target soon, said it would pay Golden Sky
shareholders $632 million in Pegasus stock and assume $373 million
in Golden Sky debt.
</P>
<P>
   In return, it will receive Golden Sky's 345,000 subscribers,
giving Pegasus more than 1.1 million rural customers in 41 states.
Pegasus said the deal, to be completed in the second quarter of
2000, would give it the added size that it considered crucial for
its future.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Sky has 900 employees and had sales of $135 million in
1999. About 250 employees are in its Kansas City headquarters. It
was unclear Tuesday what would become of the Kansas City office.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Sky's top executive said in a news release that the
combined company should grow because of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our past accomplishments provide a firm foundation
for the continued growth of our combined businesses,'' said Rodney
Weary, the company's chief executive, who did not respond to a
message asking for additional comment.

<P>
   Golden Sky has yet to turn a profit, according to company
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thanks
to the costs of acquiring customers, mainly through buying other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended Sept. 30, it had revenue of $37
million and a net loss of $41 million. It had 1999 sales of $135
million.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Sky and Pegasus have increasingly tense relations with
DirecTV. Indeed, the two companies Tuesday sued DirecTV, accusing
it of breaking contractual obligations by selling premium channel
service directly to Pegasus and Golden Sky customers.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV has its own litigation over the arrangement that allows
resellers such as Golden Sky. In its early days, DirecTV signed a
deal with the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative that
gave exclusive rights to sell DirecTV to rural areas. The
cooperative then allowed Pegasus, Golden Sky and other companies to
market the satellite TV service in the protected territories.
</P>
<P>
   But DirecTV has indicated that it wants an end to the
arrangement. Some analysts expect Hughes Electronics Corp., the
owner of DirecTV, to go as far as to make a bid this year for
Pegasus, which is based in Bala Cnywyd, Pa.

   Share Prices Drop Sharply
</P>
<P>
   For AOL and Time Warner The stock prices of both America Online
and Time Warner tumbled a day after their merger was announced.
Shares of AOL fell $6.75, to $64.50, while Time Warner declined $5,
to $85. The problem in the short term is that the stock of the new
company, AOL Time Warner, falls somewhere between the traditional
valuation of Time Warner and the much higher ``Internet valuation''
of America Online. And there has not been much demand for such
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite investor reaction, AOL Time Warner promises to be a
formidable power, perhaps more powerful in some ways than
Microsoft. The deal changes none of the facts in the government
case against Microsoft, but antitrust experts say it could figure
into potential sanctions or settlement talks.

   Bond Yields Pull Down Stock Prices
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell sharply as rising long-term interest rates
helped to persuade investors to sell equities. The Dow Jones
industrial average slumped 61.12 points, to 11,511.08. The Nasdaq
composite index dropped 128.48 points, or 3.2 percent, to 3,921.19,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 19.04 points, or 1.3
percent, to 1,438.56.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell as investors worried about how hard the Federal
Reserve will have to step on the brakes to slow the economy down.
The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.67 percent from 6.59
percent Monday.

FEARING RADIOACTIVITY, U.S. KILLS PLAN TO SEE SURPLUS NICKEL
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Tenn., Mich., Pa. Mass.)   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department is backing away from a plan
to sell its huge stock of surplus nickel, a metal used in stainless
steel and other alloys, because the material, left over from
nuclear weapons manufacture, may be too radioactive to sell on the
open market, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department had announced a plan in August 1997 to sell 6,000
tons of nickel later this year, for $41 million, in a program to
sell materials left over from manufacturing weapons. Another 10,000
tons would be sold later. The material was radioactive, but there
is no standard measure of how much radioactivity in such material
is unsafe, so the plan does not violate any rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea horrified scrap dealers and steel industry leaders,
who feared having to explain to their customers that their product
was even mildly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hurt our workers and our facilities, if it isn't in
fact safe, and the people won't ever believe it's safe,'' said
Thomas Sneeringer, senior vice president of the American Iron and
Steel Institute, a trade group here.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has been seeking a ruling from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that has jurisdiction
over most uses of radioactive materials. But the commission
recently had a setback, concluding three weeks ago that a
contractor it had hired to research the issue had a conflict of
interest, because the contractor was also in the radioactive waste
recycling business.
</P>
<P>
   And congressional critics said the radioactive metal could end
up in everything from stainless steel tableware to braces for
children's teeth. Three Democrats on the House Commerce Committee,
Reps. John D. Dingell of Michigan, Ron Klink of Pennsylvania and
Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, have been hammering the
commission for failing to develop a standard of radioactivity for
materials like the nickel in which the radioactivity permeates the
material, as opposed to sitting on its surface. The question is
becoming more pressing as the energy agency and electric companies
take apart old nuclear plants. The 6,000 tons are at the former
K-25 plant near Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Materials that are surface-contaminated can be cleaned, but it
is unclear whether those in which the radioactivity permeates can
be.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory commission regulates consumer products to which
radiation has been intentionally added. But the commission has
maintained, until recently, if the metal includes radioactive
material that was not added for ``beneficial effect,'' the decision
is up to the state, in this case Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And in Nashville, the director of the state's Division of
Radiological Health approved the release of the nickel.

 COWBOYS FIRE CHAN GAILEY (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By RAY BUCK c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey was fired as head coach of the
Cowboys yesterday, less than two years after he was hired by owner
Jerry Jones to bring in an innovative offense that would elevate
the franchise back to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey leaves with roughly $2.3 million left on a five-year
contract that he signed Feb. 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had a two-year record of 18-16, including 0-2 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have had more of a chance,'' Gailey said. ``I
understand it's part of the process. I don't like it. I don't agree
with it ... \Rbut\S if you're not tough enough to handle it, you
shouldn't be in the business in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who turned 48 last week, remained stoic in answering
reporters' questions for nearly 30 minutes, less than four hours
after he was fired for the first time in 26 years of coaching
football at the college and pro levels. This was his first head
coaching job in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey seemed to have lost the confidence of a core of veteran
offensive players, including quarterback Troy Aikman, in a system
that was run-oriented with multiple-receiver sets, designed to
confused opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jones called it a ``difficult'' decision to terminate a man whom
he holds in such high regard. He said his reasons included:
Gailey's offensive philosophy and the team's veteran personnel were
a poor match; and the dismissal of the Cowboys' third head coach in
11 seasons under Jones' ownership seemed to be a better option than
to ``burn up energy'' on trying to rectify those differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was not done because of our personnel's wish
that we make a change at head coach,'' Jones said. ``It was not
done because of Chan's total unwillingness to step up and continue
to work at this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that we don't have more time to get the job done? I had
to make a decision that impacts our fans and our organization, that
the energy that we spend building this team for next year wouldn't
be spent trying to come to an agreement as to what we were going to
do philosophically, offensively. That we would go in a direction
that everybody from the get-go was on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added: ``I have no criticism of Chan at all. Anybody who
places the responsibility of our failures on Chan Gailey is not
giving it an honest go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he now turns his attention to ``trying to acquire and
have the brightest people available'' in succeeding Gailey. All but
two of his assistants _ Jim Bates (defensive line) and Dwain
Painter (wide receivers) _ are under contract for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that he didn't feel that his players ``undermined''
him, but rather, ``I think they said what they believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he talked to several people inside the organization
before he arrived at his decision yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he understood the situation when he took the job,
that the offense was being asked to undergo a major change in
adapting to his run-oriented offense that used multiple-receiver
formations to keep opposing defenses off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you do a supreme job of winning \Rveteran players\S
over immediately, then always, in the back of their minds, there's
the idea that there might be another way to do things,'' Gailey
said. ``I think that probably was the case, that's why everybody
wasn't on the same page at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys reached the playoffs with an 8-8 record in 1999.
They lost eight of 13 regular-season games after getting off to a
3-0 start. Down the stretch, they lost three of their last four
games, including a 27-10 National Football Conference wild-card
loss at Minnesota on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After an awkward two days in which Jones declined several
opportunities to endorse his embattled head coach, Gailey was
unceremoniously let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in quitting. I believe you fight to the end,''
said Gailey, who showed up for work yesterday morning as usual,
parked his silver Cadillac in his normal parking space and began
preparing for what he believed could be a Super Bowl run for the
Cowboys in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jones dropped by Gailey's office sometime before 3 p.m. and told
Gailey that he was being terminated.
</P>
<P>
   There was no conversation to save his job, from either man.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey then met with his coaches one last time and _ with little
emotion in his voice, according to one assistant _ commended them
for their work over the past two seasons after he informed them of
what had just happened in the past 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been fired before,'' Gailey said. ``They pulled a
league out from under me in the World League (1991-92, Birmingham
Fire) one time, but I'd never been fired.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A FRANCHISE IS PURCHASED; AN ERA ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FBN-JETS-SALE, FBN-JETS-TEAM) 
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-one years ago Wednesday, an upstart team from
an upstart league in a relatively new event called the Super Bowl
shook the sports world with one of the great upsets in pro football
history. The New York Jets of the American Football League upset
the heavily favored Baltimore Colts, 16-7, in Super Bowl III at the
Orange Bowl in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ramos was the Jets' 30-year-old public relations director.
He was in shock like everyone else over the dramatic events of Jan.
12, 1969. Ramos was hired as the PR director in 1963, the same year
Leon Hess became one of the owners of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the Orange Bowl is a relic, the Colts are
in Indianapolis, Baltimore has the Ravens, the Super Bowl is an
orgy. And the Hess family no longer owns the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ramos was at National Football League headquarters,
effectively presiding over the final hours of the Hess legacy as
the National Football League announced the Jets' new owner: Robert
Wood Johnson IV. Ramos described the day as bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a departure from the Hess family, who I've been
with for 36 years, but you always have to go forward,'' he said.
``Leon would have wanted the Jets to go forward, and that's how
Jets fans should think about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess was a benevolent owner, a man who often made the wrong
choice for head coach and kept bad coaches too long. He saw the
Jets as family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him on a regular basis,'' Ramos said. ``His presence
was always felt and his direction was always felt.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the business community was still buzzing about the
America Online's acquisition of Time Warner, the NFL owners voted
overwhelmingly to stay true to the league's founding roots. They
selected philanthropist Johnson over media mogul Charles Dolan,
whose several media holdings and teams made conglomerate-wary
owners wary.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complexities of the sale, long-suffering Jets fans
simply want to know who will coach their team. Will the Jets'
journey toward the Promised Land continue? Is this chaos _ no
defensive coordinator, a franchise held hostage by its former head
coach _ a temporary interlude?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the new owner is like a man who buys a dream
house; what sold him on it, though, was the Tiffany chandelier in
the dining room. As he is moving in, he discovers that the
chandelier is not included in the price _ that it costs an extra
million. Bill Parcells is the chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, he is the only coach who can keep the Jets
headed in a championship direction. He knows it; Johnson should
know it. The Jets went from a 1-15 nightmare in 1996 under Rich
Kotite to the American Conference championship game in 1998 under
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Progress comes at a price, and it is not a pretty sight. Pro
football is a barracuda's life.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Hess' benevolence, only when he turned the reins over
to the bullying, aggressive Parcells did the program kick into
gear. The price paid, of course, has been the cloak-and-dagger
escapades of Parcells and Bill Belichick, the wheeling and dealing,
betrayals and counter-betrayals. Bluster and team hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Now you hear Al Groh's name being floated out as the only
logical successor to Parcells in the event that Parcells really
does retire. Groh is the Jets' linebacker coach and was with
Parcells when the Giants won the Super Bowl in 1990. The new owner
has to know that Groh is not the name that Jets fans, intoxicated
by a taste of honey, want to hear. Groh is fine, I'm sure. But Jets
fans have seen this before: with Rich Kotite and Pete Carroll and
Joe Walton.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells is really tired and this is not merely the bow
before an encore, the Jets' new owner had better start fresh; none
of this puppet-puppeteer business with Groh and Parcells. The era
of experiments is over.
</P>
<P>
   If Minnesota reaches the Super Bowl, pursue Denny Green and
complete the Jets' transition into an offensive juggernaut; if
Tampa Bay wins, hire Tony Dungy and make the Jets into a defensive
rock of Gibraltar; if Tennessee wins, hire Jeff Fisher; consider
Tom Coughlin at Jacksonville. Or should Johnson talk Parcells out
of retiring and beg him to coach?
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who has seen it all with the Jets, has faith. ``I've
heard about how much turmoil we're in,'' he said. ``All I know is
that we have Bill Parcells at one end of the hall, we still have
the players who won seven of the last nine games. I've always been
an optimistic person, I feel optimistic about things.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder. Does Robert Wood Johnson know what he's gotten
himself into?  &QL;

KANSAS SENATE VOTES TO ABOLISH THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The Kansas Senate on Tuesday voted unanimously to
scuttle the state's April 4 presidential primary, and the House is
expected to follow suit when it considers the legislation next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Senators removed the $1.5 million that Gov. Bill Graves had
recommended to pay for a primary to select Republican and
Democratic national convention delegates. The delegates would help
select the presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Without an election, the two parties would have to set up their
own machinery for selecting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Janice Hardenburger, a Haddam Republican who is chairwoman
of the Senate Elections and Local Government Committee, led the
effort to abolish this year's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the timing of the primary,'' she said in outlining her
opposition. ``The election comes late in the season when a majority
of the delegates have been selected. Historically the campaigns are
over for many of these candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The money for the election had been nestled deep in a bill to
trim the current state budget by nearly $65.8 million. The version
approved by the Senate after a six-hour debate would spend about
$1.6 million more than the governor proposed.
</P>
<P>
   In a major change from Graves' recommendation, the Senate
followed its Ways and Means Committee position and refused to
reduce per-student public school aid.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Legislature approved a $50 per student increase in
school aid, but Graves proposed reducing that to $37 per student
after tax collections fell short of projections made last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Had Graves' recommendation been followed, public schools in
Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties would have lost $1.65
million through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats offered a number of amendments to restore cuts
for special education, community corrections and mental health for
children, but they were rejected on party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   They also tried, unsuccessfully, to return the bill to a
committee for more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The bill eventually passed on another party-line vote, 27-12.
Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, praised
the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cleared a major hurdle,'' he said. ``The Senate will now
be able to focus on the job we came to do: the 2001 budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders had expected their colleagues to preserve the
school aid, but the full-scale rejection of the presidential
primary was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee on Friday removed the $1.5
million for the election, and the full House is expected to support
that position when it considers proposed changes in the budget for
the year that ends June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh, who has been an ardent
supporter of the primary, said he was ``very disappointed with the
Legislature's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still committed to a primary and encouraging Kansans to
be involved in this presidential nomination,'' said Thornburgh, the
state's chief election officer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier he had joined the state chairmen of the Republican and
Democratic parties to support continuation of the primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Hardenburger's amendment removing funding for this year's vote
also directed the secretary of state to work toward creating a
regional presidential primary involving at least six states that
would vote on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   He would report progress to the next session of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Thornburgh said he did not need any such encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 he has led an effort by the National Association of
Secretaries of State to establish a rotating regional primary.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system was designed to begin with the 2004 election.
</P>
<P>
   A series of regional presidential primaries would be scheduled
on the first Tuesday in March, April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   The order of the primaries would rotate so each region would
have an opportunity to be first.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the debate on the bill, Sen. Sherman Jones, a
Kansas City, Kan., Democrat, added a provision strengthening
efforts to complete work on a new Kansas Bureau of Investigation
laboratory at Kansas City Kansas Community College.
</P>
<P>
   It said the KBI could spend money this year to remodel the
facilities, and equip and operate the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This served notice to the director (KBI Director Larry Welch)
he's to get about the business of completing the lab and putting it
into operation at the community college,'' Jones said.

   Like RealNetwork's and MusicMatch's Jukebox software, the
MP3.com service will enable consumers to record CDs as MP3 files or
to listen to such files on their computers. But unlike existing
Jukebox players, the new service will be Internet-based, meaning
that the music will be accessible from any Internet-connected
computer. Eventually, the company says the service will be made
available for wireless Inernet devices as well.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the company plans to establish 10 million accounts
for its existing customer base. Initially, the service will be
free-of-charge but eventually it will require a paid subscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move is fundamentally sound for these guys,'' said Mark
Mooradian, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``Being the
default repository where consumers keep all their stored music will
be a linchpin of success in the music business.'' But he added that
the service seems duplicable. ``Unless it's for legal reasons, I
don't see why RealNetworks wouldn't dive into this very quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who open an account on the MP3.com site will be able
to place CDs into their CD-ROM drive and, if that title is in
MP3.com's database (currently at 40,000), a digital copy will be
automatically transferred to their MP3.com account. In addition,
consumers purchasing a CD from MP3.com's online retail partners
will simultaneously obtain a digital copy of the CD in their
account. Currently, MP3.com is partnering with Duffelbag.com,
Jungle Jeff.com, Cheap-CDs.com and CDGlobe.com, but more agreements
are in the works, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   User's accounts will be password protected. Since the security
of the service is in the hands of MP3.com, rather than the record
labels or artists, the recording industry is likely to react
unfavorably to the service. The industry launched the Secure
Digital Music Initiative to develop technological standards to
combat rampant music piracy on the Internet. By allowing prime
content to be stored on the Internet with security of its own
devising, the MP3.com service may be perceived as a circumvention
of that effort. Company officials said they had not yet briefed the
recording industry on their plan but that they intended to do so
sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lemley, a professor specializing in Internet law at the
University of California at Berkeley, said it was probable that
MP3.com would be sued, but that MP3.com had a good chance to win
such a case.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that as long as MP3.com can demonstrate that the
service is being used legally by a substantial number of people, it
is probably on solid legal ground. ``As long as there are a
substantial number of people making legal use of the service it
doesn't matter if there are a whole lot of people making illegal
use,'' he said. ``The recording industry would have to sue the
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, said the company
had ``thought a lot'' about the recording industry's response to
the service and had made a number of concessions to copyright
concerns. If a user is logged on to an account and a second user
simultaneously tries to access it, that second user will be
automatically bumped off, he said. He said that this feature would
discourage the sharing of passwords. More important, he said the
service will allow the music to be streamed but not downloaded.
Computers play streamed audio files as they receive them but don't
store the file on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies and individuals have developed software tools for
saving streamed files to user's hard drives. For instance,
Streambox, a company fighting a lawsuit from RealNetworks for
copyright infringement, was in the process of building such
functionality into its software before getting slapped with a
temporary restraining order, a Streambox spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   While Robertson said he was aware that such tools exist, he said
he believed that MP3.com was striking the right balance between the
concerns of content providers and those of consumers. ``This
encourages people to buy CDs while discouraging proliferation of
content,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: BRAWLING LEGISLATURE OPTIMISTIC OVER BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It would be hard to overestimate the capacity of
New York's lawmakers for fighting, especially over money. This is
the gang, after all, that in the last six years has produced the
five latest budgets in state history, including the two latest by
any state since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, as Gov. George Pataki proposed his $76.8 billion
budget for the fiscal year that starts April 1, even some of the
Capitol's battle-scarred cynics said this year should be different.
There will, as always, be a fight over education spending, but
other traditional areas of conflict have been resolved in advance,
and the governor, continuing to move away from the austerity that
marked his first years in office, is offering a healthy enough
spending increase _ more than 5 percent over all _ to make most of
the Legislature happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's optimistic that this could be the easiest
budget process we've had under this governor,'' said Assemblyman
Eric Vitaliano, D-Staten Island. ``There's no reason we can't get
it done by April 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who did not know better might guess that this was an
election year, when even conservative governors embrace social
programs and loosen the purse strings to smooth their path to
another term. Pataki, a Republican, does not face re-election until
2002.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an election year, and while the governor may not be
worried about his immediate prospects, his allies in the state
Senate are concerned about theirs. The Republicans hold a 36-25
margin, and some of them have had close calls in recent years. They
know that 2000, a presidential year with a hot U.S. Senate race,
will produce a large turnout, which traditionally favors Democrats.
And this year's elections will decide who gets to control the next
redistricting, which will give a crucial edge for the next decade
to the party controlling each house.
</P>
<P>
   So no one is happier about this budget than the Senate
Republicans. They see it as insurance against charges that their
party represents a reflexive hostility to popular spending
programs, and as insurance against being stuck in Albany late into
a year when they are eager to get home early to begin campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   If that holds true, an easy budget could also help Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican, in his expected run for the U.S. Senate,
because he is counting on the Senate Republicans to form a powerful
organizing network for him in corners of the state where he is not
well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a very smooth year, because there isn't much to
fight about,'' Sen. Thomas Libous, R-Binghamton, , said of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were not so sanguine, particularly Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, who complained that Pataki talked about
supporting education, while proposing cutting some schools programs
that are dear to the Democrats. ``The dollars don't match the
rhetoric,'' said Silver, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But even Democrats conceded that the groundwork had been laid
for the least incendiary budget negotiations in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, the largest part of the budget at $30 billion, has
also been the most contentious area in recent years. Pataki's
attempts to make cuts in Medicaid, the health insurance program for
the poor, were the primary sources of conflict in drawing up last
year's budget, which was finally approved on Aug. 4, 126 days late,
tying the record that the state set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, health care has effectively been taken out of the
budget fight. Last month, Pataki and the Legislature agreed to a
major new program to give health coverage to the uninsured, and a
55-cents-a-pack increase in the state cigarette tax. As part of
that deal, the governor agreed that, for the first time since he
took office in 1995, he would not try to cut Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``With health care done, that's half the budget,'' said Sen.
Martin Connor, the leader of the Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, the state budget became tangled in unrelated
struggles _ over workers' compensation rules and rent controls _
that made the process even slower and more bitter than it would
have been on its own. This year, there are no such overarching
issues.
</P>
<P>
   One subject looms as a likely battleground: For the second year
in a row, Pataki, while proposing a modest overall increase in
education spending, is trying to backtrack from a 1997 agreement
that committed the state to big increases in spending on
prekindergarten classes and class size reduction. Silver and his
troops see that deal as one of their great victories, and they will
do whatever they can to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   But even that may not prove to be a great obstacle. In years
past, the Senate Republicans have sided with the Assembly Democrats
in seeking big increases in school spending, and it is one area of
the budget where the governor has tended to give in.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the governor's entire package, the Republican majority
leader of the Senate, Joseph Bruno, was almost giddy about its
prospects. ``It ought to be the least contentious budget that we
have ever done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his counterpart, Connor, took a slightly darker view, noting
the Legislature's talent for turning everything into a struggle.
``If we can't show people that the process can work under these
circumstances,'' he said, ``then I don't know when we can.''

N.J. GOVERNOR FOCUSES ON HIGH-TECH INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NJ-WHITMAN-ASSESS) 
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Saying New Jersey must make high technology
``the undisputed engine'' of its economic growth, Gov. Christie
Whitman proposed $100 million in new spending Tuesday to help
researchers convert their scientific advances into thriving
businesses, and to help train what she called ``the high-tech work
force of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In her sixth annual address to the Legislature, Whitman, who in
past years has used the occasion to tackle difficult problems like
high auto insurance rates and rising property taxes, instead
outlined a modest agenda for her remaining two years in office,
with the state's economy, education, the environment, and the
elderly all sharing her attention.
</P>
<P>
   The governor seemed to suggest that the greatest battles of her
two terms were behind her, although she urged lawmakers to come to
terms on a court-ordered program of school construction that could
cost more than $11 billion and result in new classrooms and
gymnasiums in every district in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made great strides together in so many areas, from
health care to transportation, welfare reform to historic
preservation,'' she said. ``Now it's time to lock in our
accomplishments and build on our record.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Whitman is seeking to build on New Jersey's strengths
in high-technology areas like telecommunications, electronics and
pharmaceuticals. High-technology companies employ 10 percent of the
state's private-sector workers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor proposed initiatives that could total $165 million
over several years, including $55 million from private sources and
$10 million from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $100 million in new state spending would help bring
new technologies to market, like $5 million to add seven business
incubators to the seven already open in the state, $10 million for
two small-scale industrial parks to help high-technology start-up
companies take root, and $10 million in seed money for a
public-private venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's economic plan, called New Jersey Jobs for a New
Economy, was conceived by the Edison Partnership, a group of
high-technology business and institutional leaders including the
president of Princeton University, Dr. Harold Shapiro, and the
president of the New Ventures Group at Lucent Technologies, Thomas
Uhlman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled that Governor Whitman has chosen to adopt the
high-tech theme,'' Uhlman said Tuesday. ``If we stand still, we are
going to fall behind. Other states understand the importance of
nurturing high-tech, retaining and attracting new high-tech
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Caren Franzini, director of the State Economic Development
Authority, said California operates 50 high-technology business
incubators. Gov. George Pataki of New York has proposed investing
$440 million to create high-technology jobs in the state, said
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the budget division in Albany, N.Y. Of
that, $250 million is earmarked from the state pension fund for
investment in small and start-up companies, and $95 million goes to
grants for research laboratories and centers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To help train workers for entry-level jobs at high-technology
companies, Whitman also proposed spending $15 million for new
courses at community colleges, and another $3 million for a pilot
program to teach computer skills to 1,000 women leaving the welfare
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her economic initiatives, however, Whitman's latest
proposals pale next to some of her past accomplishments. In
education, for example, Whitman has established core curriculum
standards for the public schools, set up 47 charter schools, and
begun a pilot program in which parents can choose to send their
children to schools in other districts at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by contrast, the governor's most ambitious plan is to spend
$69 million for preschool programs in the state's 30 poorest
districts, including $36 million to provide year-round,
10-hour-a-day classes for 10,000 3- and 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also announced a new partnership with the New
Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers union,
for a two-year intensive mentoring program that would be required
for new teachers. The state would spend $8.7 million to pay the
extra stipends for veteran teachers who advise them.
</P>
<P>
   One measure that would not require new spending is a proposal to
give state workers two hours a month of paid leave to volunteer in
the schools. Mrs. Whitman, who teaches a fourth-grade class twice a
month, said she wanted to encourage others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Her environmental proposals also seemed modest when compared
with her continuing effort to preserve 1 million acres of open
space. For example, she called for $15 million to clean up
contaminated sites in urban areas, and another $580,000 to set up
three new air-quality monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest of Whitman's four areas of emphasis was in programs
for the elderly. She proposed just $5 million in new spending: $1
million to eliminate the 2,000-person waiting list for Meals on
Wheels; $1 million more to investigate and prevent abuse and
neglect; $500,000 for new supervisors at county offices on aging;
$1 million to provide housekeeping and nutrition services to frail
residents in subsidized housing; and $1.5 million for background
checks on home health aides.

BRITAIN TO FIGHT TYSON'S ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Immigration officials in Britain announced Tuesday that
boxer Mike Tyson could be refused entry to the country for a bout
later this month because of his criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is scheduled to fight Julius Francis, the heavyweight
champion of Britain, on Jan. 29 in Manchester. But immigration
officials said that Tyson's coming here would violate rules
prohibiting entry into Britain of anyone convicted of an offense
carrying a sentence of 12 months or more.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was jailed for six years in 1992 for raping Desiree
Washington in Indianapolis. He served half the sentence. This past
spring, he also served three and a half months of a one-year
sentence after his no-contest plea to misdemeanor assault charges
stemming from a minor traffic accident in Gaithersburg, Md., in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office, the British cabinet agency that controls
immigration, said Tyson had no right of appeal of the restriction
but that his backers would be given the chance to argue the case to
let the boxer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to prove ``strong compassionate reasons'' about
why the rules governing normal foreign citizens with criminal
records should be waived, a Home Office spokesman said. Britain is
a country with a tradition of strict immigration policies, and
several politicians here were outspoken in their support of the
restrictions facing Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ``As I
understand it, the room for discretion is very, very limited. These
are the rules. They will have to be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Jackson, the Academy Award-winning actress who is a
member of Parliament and a mayoral candidate in London, said she
would take action if the rules were relaxed for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offenses for which he served were very serious,'' she
said. ``I see absolutely no reason an exception should be made in
his case.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Phillips, a broadcaster and candidate for deputy mayor
here, said members of his family know Washington, and that it would
``stick in my craw'' if the boxer were allowed into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to stop him boxing in America, but the bottom
line is that he molests women,'' Phillips, a prominent member of
Britain's black community, said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The fight's promoter, Frank Warren, pledged to get Tyson in
England for the bout. He also criticized the timing of the
immigration officials' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disgusted that no one had the courtesy to pick up the
phone and tell me about this problem,'' Warren said. ``It's not as
if we put this fight on last week; we did this back in the first
week in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was scheduled to fly to England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said that almost all the 22,000 tickets for the fight at
the MEN arena were sold and that hotels in Manchester were already
heavily booked in conjunction with the fight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Usually, American boxers would not need either a visa or a work
permit to come into Britain for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had a problem like this before,'' Warren said.
``We have done everything as we have done for any boxer. We have
gone through the normal formalities of bringing a boxer into the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman for the Home Office said that no one involved
in the boxing match had taken any steps before Tuesday to get in
touch with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Maloney, the manager for Francis (21-7), complained that
officials barring Tyson's entry into Britain ``would be denying a
young British fighter the opportunity of a lifetime, which he's
worked very hard for.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis is reportedly getting $528,000 for the fight while Tyson
is expected to get $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said Tyson had served his time and ``he should be
allowed to get on with his life now.'' Warren said Tyson should be
allowed to come here, train for the match, fight and depart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not here to do anything else,'' Warren said, ``and he's
not going to be a danger to anyone apart from the man he's going to
fight in the ring.''  &QL;

PERJURY CASE AGAINST FORMER HILTON OFFICIAL IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM and MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Jackson County judge has dismissed all
perjury charges against a former Hilton Hotels Corp. gambling
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Justine Del Muro ruled Monday that county
prosecutors erred in December 1998 when they charged former Hilton
Senior Vice President Markland Rousseau under a state law that
governs horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Del Muro ruled that the horse-racing law could not be applied in
riverboat gambling cases.
</P>
<P>
   County Prosecutor Robert Beaird said Tuesday that he would
appeal the dismissal, hoping to reinstate charges that Rousseau
lied to the Missouri Gaming Commission at a 1996 prelicensing
hearing for Flamingo Hilton Casino.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the dismissal would affect the fate of the
Flamingo, which Hilton has tried to sell for a year. It could
prompt the Gaming Commission to reconsider disciplinary action
against the casino. Such action had prompted Hilton to put the
riverboat on the market.
</P>
<P>
   A Gaming Commission spokesman said Tuesday the agency had no
comment on the Rousseau developments.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1996 hearing, the commission questioned a $250,000 grant
that Hilton paid in 1993 to a Kansas City firm with close ties to
Elbert Anderson, then the chairman of the Kansas City Port
Authority. The city agency later that year selected Hilton over two
other applicants to build a casino on city-owned land along the
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bath, an attorney for Rousseau, said he and his client were
pleased with the judge's decision. Bath said he hoped to dissuade
Beaird from filing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton officials did not return calls Tuesday. Hilton has long
maintained that neither it nor any of its employees did anything
illegal or improper.
</P>
<P>
   Former County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill, now Missouri auditor,
said she brought the charges based on the horse-racing statute
because it was the only law that could apply in the Rousseau case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants people to be able to lie to the Gaming
Commission,'' she said. ``It was the only statute we could proceed
under.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird, who succeeded McCaskill, noted that under a strict
reading of existing state law it was not a crime to lie to the
Gaming Commission when it was considering an uncontested riverboat
gambling license. He said he hoped to persuade the appeals court
that applying the horse-racing statute, under which perjury is
clearly prohibited, was a reasonable interpretation of the law's
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the indictment) was filed, everybody understood that the
legal position was novel,'' Beaird said. ``We're going to appeal
it, so we'll have a definitive position. If (the appeals court
comes) back and agrees with Judge Del Muro, then (Missouri
legislators) have got to modify that law.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the appeals court rules against him, Beaird said he would
drop any further plans to prosecute Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal could take 10 or 11 months, Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the outcome of the appeal, Del Muro's ruling could
close the book on an 8-year-old scandal that at one time threatened
to topple Hilton's multistate gaming empire.
</P>
<P>
   Under Anderson's leadership in 1993, the Port Authority selected
Hilton over two other applicants for rights to lease city land for
its casino.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau was Hilton's advance man on the project.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Kansas City in late 1992 and in a matter of weeks
established relationships with prominent Kansas Citians. Rousseau
sought to line up support for the project, in part, by making
grants to community groups recommended by Anderson allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to find a competitive advantage,'' Rousseau said
in a 1996 statement to the Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 a Jackson County grand jury accused Rousseau of lying to
the Gaming Commission about a $250,000 donation to KC Perspectives,
a company operated by Michelle Lathan, in 1993. Lathan, who
according to sworn testimony was Anderson's lover, also worked for
a company owned by Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But in pretrial motions, MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...a company owned by Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But in pretrial motions, Bath argued that the perjury charges
themselves were flawed because Rousseau's statements under oath in
1996 were in response to ``ambiguous and imprecise'' questions that
never dug to the heart of the matter _ whether there was bribery
between Hilton and Anderson or his friends, and if so, who
solicited it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Hilton agreed to pay the federal government $655,000 in
fines and penalties to avoid criminal charges that it provided
financial rewards to an associate of Anderson in exchange for his
political support for the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is serving a prison sentence for an unrelated bribery
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, executive director of the Gaming Commission, told
The Kansas City Star last year after the Rousseau indictment that
he was prepared to recommend harsh disciplinary action against the
company. Hilton then announced it was planning to sell the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the commission agreed to let Hilton off the hook
because, ``as a practical matter, Hilton has a right to appeal any
action we might take, and we could conceivably be tied up in court
for months or years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our time and our resources can be better spent to
keep 800 jobs open for employees and the facility open for an
orderly transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The years-long investigation of the Anderson matter raised fears
among investors and throughout the gaming industry that Hilton was
at the brink of being fined, suspended or stripped of its Missouri
license. If so, other jurisdictions with Hilton casinos could have
taken their own disciplinary actions against the company,
jeopardizing the viability of the gambling and hospitality giant.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton wrote the struggling Flamingo casino off its books as a
financial loss in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of last year's deal with the Gaming Commission, the
Beverly Hills, Calif., company agreed to surrender its state gaming
license when the riverboat was sold to Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino
Resorts Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The sale collapsed in August when the Gaming Commission did not
license the Trump organization before the $15 million contract's
purchase window expired.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators were concerned about the Trump companies'
long-term debt _ $1.8 billion and one of the largest corporate debt
obligations in the gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent Hilton deal to sell the Flamingo to Station Casinos
Inc. for $22.5 million fell apart last month when that purchase
window closed before the Gaming Commission acted.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Gaming Commission balked over a $500,000 payment
Las Vegas-based Station made to its St. Louis lawyer around the
time Station Casino Kansas City casino was licensed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That matter is still under investigation by state gaming
officials and law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A Hilton subsidiary still owns the Kansas City casino, despite
spinning off virtually all of the rest of its far-flung casino
empire into Park Place Entertainment Inc. last year. Las
Vegas-based Park Place is handling the Flamingo sale for Hilton.

TEDDY BALLGAME LOOKS BACK, AND FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has a wonderful past, but Ted Williams does not dwell in it
obsessively. He is 81 years old and fully convinced we are living
in glory days.
</P>
<P>
   He goes back to Joe DiMaggio and Hank Greenberg, the sluggers of
the '30s, but sings the praises of the new sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in New York on Tuesday and consented to a private
interview, seated in a wheelchair in a fashionable East Side hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Slowed down by a stroke and poor eyesight in recent years, he
has attended some gatherings guided by his admirers, but he shows
more grace than sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, imagine having guys like Willie Mays and Henry Aaron
help you,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in town for a new documentary, ``The Life and Times
of Hank Greenberg,'' which begins a two-week run at the Film Forum
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rule was that Williams might give half an hour, but
it was immediately clear that Theodore Samuel Williams, the
erstwhile Splendid Splinter, The Kid, Teddy Ballgame, just might
leap from the wheelchair to lash a home run into the Fenway Park
gales, or land another flaming Marine jet on a tiny runway, or yank
a trout from a glittering stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Sammy Sosa,'' Williams said, every sentence fairly
demanding an exclamation point. ``What a great player; what a great
guy. You tell him the next time you see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That switch-hitter who plays center for the Yankees,'' he
said, referring to Bernie Williams, a relation only in the sense of
baseball being a fraternity. ``What a great player. And Garciaparra
with the Red Sox is not bad, either. If he lays off the first ball,
he could put together a streak of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembers the generation when he and Greenberg (``my
favorite player'') were the brutes of the business, well over 6
feet tall. Nowadays they would be normal size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remuneration is there,'' Williams roared. ``That makes the
competition better.''
</P>
<P>
   He never claimed the old days were better, but he made them
compelling as he recalled 1939, when Greenberg was the powerful
first baseman who had hit 58 homers the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a tall rookie,'' Williams said. ``We had a pitcher
named Jim Bagby, great athlete but not a great fastball, and he had
a harelip, and he talked with a lisp. The first time we played in
Detroit, Bagby was in our dugout, on the first-base side, and he
was trying to get Hank to move back behind first.
</P>
<P>
   ```Hey, Hank,' he kept yelling. `This kid can hit. Hank, you're
too close. Hank, I'm trying to talk to you. Hank, I always liked
you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, when Hank wouldn't back up, Bagby yelled at him with
that lisp, `All right, Hank, if you want to sound like me and look
like me, just stand right where you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Williams recalled it, Hank Greenberg never budged. They
usually observed each other from 90 feet, in those days of precious
little fraternizing. But Williams did recall meeting Greenberg in
the hotel lobby before Williams' first All-Star Game in 1940, and
how the veteran tried to pump the kid for insights into certain
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father was smart,'' Williams told Steve Greenberg, the
slugger's son, once a fine AAA player and later a deputy baseball
commissioner, who was sitting in on the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might look lousy on one pitch, but look out on the next
pitch,'' Williams added. ``I'd pitch him low and away, high and in,
lots of breaking stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feller would eat him up,'' Williams chortled, but then again,
Bob Feller ate everybody up.
</P>
<P>
   They were not socially friendly, said Williams, who noted that
Greenberg played tennis and Williams fished. But Williams knew how
Greenberg, as the first great Jewish baseball player, had
encountered prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me how your father played in Yankee Stadium
early in his career, and heard all this ugly stuff,'' Williams
said. ``After the game, Hank went down the runway and followed the
Yankees to their clubhouse and told them: `I heard what was said
out there today. Whoever said it, if you have a gut in your body,
you'll stand up.' Nobody stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Greenberg said his father ``froze'' on a fastball he had
anticipated from Paul Dean of the Cardinals in the sixth game of
the 1934 World Series, and for the last 52 years of his life he
wondered if he could have clinched the Series with the swing that
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Williams totally understood. He recalled an All-Star Game
against ``a hard-throwing pitcher from Philly'' _ presumably Turk
Farrell in 1958 _ when Williams recalled how ``I could smell the
wood'' from the friction between bat and ball of his vicious foul
tip, a quarter-inch off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wonder how far that ball would have gone had I hit
it,'' Williams said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man who merely batted .344 in his career, the last man to
bat over .400 for a season, said, ``I still can't sleep at night,
thinking about the failures.''
</P>
<P>
   He then switched a few decades earlier, to Shoeless Joe Jackson
and his .356 batting average, a player who is still banned from the
Hall of Fame for his debatable role in the gambling scandal in the
1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Williams thinks Jackson knew something about the fix, ``but so
did everybody on the South Side of Chicago, including the owner of
the team.'' He thinks Jackson, who died in 1951, should be placed
in the Hall of Fame because ``he already served his life
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Williams does not believe Pete Rose should be
in the Hall, saying: ``I feel sorry for Pete Rose, but he committed
the cardinal sin of baseball. He gambled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Williams were both included in the top 30 on an
arbitrary all-century team that was announced during the recent
World Series. Rose's swaggering appearance, his first in a decade
at any baseball event, induced a huge ovation. Williams remembers
telling Rose, ``Hey, they still love you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said there will always be room for other great players
like Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk, both of whom were elected to the
Hall of Fame Tuesday. He could not resist a barb at the now-faded
wisdom of swinging down on the ball that, he said, cut down on
Fisk's natural power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball games are won in the air!'' Williams pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   It was now 75 minutes later, time to let the old slugger have
some lunch. It was quite clear that Ted Williams still has some
exclamation points left for the Hank Greenbergs of this young
baseball century, these glory days to come.

ANALYSIS: WHITMAN BUILDS ON HER SUCCESS, BUT WITH NO BOLD
PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NJ-WHITMAN-REPORT) 
 (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ As she begins her final two years in office,
Gov. Christie Whitman appears to be quite comfortable that her
legacy is secure.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering her State of the State address Tuesday _ the last
before she enters the lame-duck year of her final term in office _
the governor laid out a modest array of economic and
quality-of-life proposals: $165 million in spending to spur
high-technology business growth, plus a variety of smaller plans to
help the elderly, bolster the education system and make limited
improvements in New Jersey's antipollution efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But to many in New Jersey politics, the speech was most notable
for the absence of any bold proposals. In her six years in office,
Whitman has used her annual January address to preach the twin
pillars of fiscal restraint _ tax cuts and reduced government
spending _ or propose sweeping programs like her $1 billion plan to
preserve 1 million acres of open space.
</P>
<P>
   Having accomplished many of those goals, and established her
credentials as a moderate Republican, the governor apparently
decided this year to ride the national economic boom and build on
the state's business success rather than take on any other major
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   She also did little to antagonize conservative leaders of the
national Republican Party. During this year's Republican
presidential debates, Whitman has been repeatedly criticized by
name, because she supports abortion rights, and her status as the
favorite object of conservative scorn could ultimately hinder any
national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she still holds any hope of being the vice presidential
nominee, or even a cabinet member, it makes sense to play it
safe,'' said Gerald Pomper, a political science professor at
Rutgers University. ``She's already done the things conservatives
like, which is to cut taxes. She's best off not proposing anything
too liberal. And to the anti-abortion people, there's nothing she
can do to get in their good graces anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, reaction to the governor's speech was divided,
predictably, along party lines. Democrats complained that Whitman
had squandered an opportunity to channel more of the state's record
surplus to residents of New Jersey's struggling cities or shore up
some of the financially troubled hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the governor chose to throw us bones,'' said state Sen.
Richard Codey, leader of the Democratic minority. ``We received
mostly recycled material on high-tech investment initiatives, elder
care and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were far more complimentary, and Assembly Speaker
Jack Collins praised the governor for highlighting important, but
often overlooked, issues like elder care.
</P>
<P>
   But many members of both parties acknowledged that the
scaled-down ambitions reflected the shifting balance of power in
state government as Whitman's tenure moves toward its end. The two
legislative leaders, Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, also a
Republican, and Collins, are likely candidates to succeed Whitman
as governor in 2001, and have become increasingly aggressive about
pushing their own agendas in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the three leaders must decide on a school
construction plan, which could cost $10 billion. They must also
work out a way to refinance the Transportation Trust Fund, a task
that may ultimately involve the politically volatile move of
increasing the gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the governor, who last year became the first state
official to acknowledge that New Jersey State Police discriminated
against minorities, must follow through on her pledge to overhaul
the department.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said that those issues would make for a busy
schedule in coming months, and that the governor could still unveil
major initiatives when she released her budget proposals this
month. ``I think people are wrong to say she is a lame duck in
2000,'' he said. ``The year 2001, that might be true, but she's
still got the power and she's still calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, for example, the governor proposed spending
$100 million a year to provide health insurance for 125,000
low-income residents, using money New Jersey will receive as part
of the national settlement with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the governor repeated her promise to work as hard
during the final two years in office as she did during the first
two, and her staff members say Whitman often reminds them that
nearly 25 percent of her time in office lies ahead. To those who
were disappointed that the governor's address was short on grand
gestures, her aides say it is simply good policy for the state to
continue her focus on improving New Jersey's business climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an indication of her success,'' said Michael Torpey,
her chief of staff. ``It's a chance to solidify her gains and look
forward.''

GOP FRONT-RUNNER SAVORS HIS TIME IN THE SPOTLIGHT

<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ George W. Bush tries not to show it. But at
times, even the well-disciplined politician that he is cannot
contain his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Take last week at the Isaac Newton Christian Academy here.
Before launching into a speech, the Texas governor urged students
to fire questions at him when he was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' Bush noted, ``you may be asking questions of the
next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame the Republican for feeling good these days,
especially in Iowa, where the first major presidential test will be
staged Jan. 24. In Des Moines the day before he visited the
academy, Bush accepted the endorsements of former challenger
Elizabeth Dole and influential Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier, Bush had garnered the backing of an impressive
array of religious conservatives, a move aimed at putting the cork
into doubts about his suitability to the GOP's vocal right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Governor Bush because he is the most effective
pro-life person running for president,'' Ione Dilley, chairwoman of
the Christian Coalition of Iowa, said in a statement that day.
</P>
<P>
   A huge lead in the polls and more than $60 million raised only
add to the campaign's aura of invincibility. In Cedar Rapids, Bush
was asked how well he hopes to perform in the caucuses, a race that
pits him against five other Republicans, including two, Steve
Forbes and Gary Bauer, with extensive organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't hesitate. The highest finish ever for a Republican
is 37 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a good goal to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   While some in Bush's campaign worry that supporters may be
growing complacent, Bush appears loose and relaxed. He is a natural
back-slapper and acknowledges that he enjoys a good time. After
speeches, he plunges into crowds willing, even eager, to pose for
pictures, pump hands or answer questions from anyone willing to
wait around to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted one elderly man in a walker with an enthusiastic,
``How are you doing, buddy?'' When former Iowa Gov. Robert Ray
approached after a Des Moines speech, it was ``Guv!'' And there's
always a quip or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, I thought I was going to have to go on his
wife's endorsement alone,'' Bush joked the day Grassley endorsed
him. The senator's wife had come out for Bush long before her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers see a man who practically sweats charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great people person,'' said Eric Leonard of Cedar
Rapids. ``That's big in politics. It's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He relates. He connects,'' said Ray, recently voted Iowa's
most influential citizen by The Des Moines Register. ``He's real.
People like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, he has seemed more accessible, less scripted than he
seemed earlier in the campaign. Early controversies about his youth
appear to have blown over. His skill in debates is improving,
although few consider it a forte.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent exchange, Bush said he would take an attitude of
``Dear God, help me'' into the White House, causing Bauer to quip:
``So would we, governor.'' Bush had to smile, and replied: ``That
wasn't very Christian of you.''
</P>
<P>
   His clipped answers sometimes hint that he would prefer not to
delve too deeply into some issues. In a Des Moines radio interview,
he confused tax credits with tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about his readiness seem to be an issue mostly with his
opponents. Asked about the when Bush struggled to name some foreign
leaders, Blake Bottomley, a 35-year-old Cedar Rapids accountant,
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned,'' Bottomley MORE

FUND-RAISER AND FAN ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON IV 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson IV _ nicknamed Woody _ owns one of New
Jersey's most famous names. But the respected hospital in New
Brunswick and the foundation in Princeton were named for his
grandfather _ ``The General'' _ who built Johnson &AMP; Johnson into
one of the country's top health-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Johnson, 52, has made his name in quieter philanthropic
and political endeavors that have let him maintain an inconspicuous
public life below the intense radar of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   That changed dramatically Tuesday when the estate of the late
Leon Hess _ an oilman who defined flying below the news media's
crowded radar _ approved his purchase of the Jets for $635 million.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not have a grand plan to own a sports team nor was
he well known by National Football League owners. He was socially
acquainted with Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, who
was his chief rival to buy the Jets; owned courtside season tickets
to Knick games; and built a close friendship with Ernie Grunfeld,
the team's former general manager, through mutual charitable
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real passion for sports,'' said Grunfeld, now the
general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Holzberg, president of the Robert Wood Johnson University
Hospital, said Johnson briefly published a magazine dedicated to
``Monday Night Football'' after his graduation from Princeton
University and coveted buying the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an
expansion franchise. Although his courtside seats for Knick games
indicate a preference for basketball to football, the Jets'
availability after Hess' death last year focused his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider he's not a consortium, I'm surprised he
wanted to buy a team that cost so much,'' said the actress Mary
Tyler Moore, the international chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation, of which Johnson is the chairman. About his executive
style, Moore said: ``He pulls together the best and brightest and
empowers them to do the best. He would know no other way with the
Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzberg added: ``He'll delegate, he'll be available, but he'll
let his management manage. He's a competitive person, especially
about the things he cares dearly about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Cooley, the diabetes foundation's finance chairman,
described Johnson as a person whose passion to find a cure for
diabetes was animated when his daughter, Casey, now 20, was
stricken with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stretches everyone with goals. Challenges everybody to go
beyond average,'' Cooley said. ``He's bound and determined to make
sure the right scientists are selected to discover the cure. You
can't get any more competitive than trying to beat a disease. It's
a unique motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has contributed $12 million to the foundation and wrote
a book, ``Managing Your Child's Diabetes,'' with his wife, Sale,
and Casey. The Johnsons have two other daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Although his father served as president of Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Woody Johnson does not hold an executive position with the company,
but owns substantial stock, much of which accounts for his wealth.
He also bought and sold a cable television company in the 1970s. He
runs The Johnson Co., a personal investment company, from an office
on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He is a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust
and chairman of the Alliance for Lupus Research.
</P>
<P>
   He raised money for President George Bush, and served on the
President's Export Council. Between 1997 and 1998, he gave $130,000
to the Republican Party, and gave $22,583 to Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's re-election campaign, and is a major New York fundraiser for
Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, the New York City deputy mayor who is soon to
become president of the Yankees, said, ``He's a smart,
self-effacing team player. He has great energy and intellectual
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said he was not surprised by Johnson's pursuit of the
Jets. ``He's a renaissance man,'' he said, ``and a football fan.''

   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ ...35-year-old Cedar Rapids accountant,
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned,'' Bottomley said. ``The only mistake he
made was walking into that trap.''
</P>
<P>
   At events, Bush often says his aim is to tell people what's in
his heart. His message, he insists, is one of ``optimism, unity and
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He is most vocal about his plan for a $483 billion tax cut
spread over five years. The plan, Bush says, would benefit rich and
poor alike and exemplifies his theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is awash with cash and the fundamental question
is: Do we spend it on new programs or pass it on to the people?''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Cedar Rapids news conference, Bush introduced two families
who stand to gain under his plan. One middle-class family, the
Chases, earns about $50,000 a year and would save about $1,100
under the plan, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Jen Blair, a single mom making $25,000 a year, would see her
$723 income-tax bill slashed to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan,'' Bush said in a line that he uses often, ``will
knock down the tollbooth to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   He has left no doubt about his intent. ``This is not only `No
new taxes,' '' Bush said, recycling his father's famous line.
``This is `Tax cuts, so help me God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is running an attack ad claiming that Bush has
broken tax pledges as governor, criticizes the plan as ``timid.''
Democrat Al Gore, meanwhile, has called the cut so large that it
threatens Social Security. Bush disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Mister Vice President. What's risky is leaving the extra
money in Washington, because it's going to be spent,'' Bush said.
</P>

   Another Bush theme is education. Although he insists that he's
not running for federal superintendent of schools, Bush has
definite ideas. He advocates greater accountability _ not through a
national test, which would undermine local control, he says, but
through exams prepared by states and local districts.
</P>
<P>
   He would reward success with financial incentives and cast the
``spotlight of shame'' on failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no second-rate children in America,'' Bush says. ``No
second-rate dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors school vouchers because the nation ``cannot allow the
system to trap students in failed schools.'' He would allow
voluntary school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Bush advocates segregating the fund from the
main federal budget. He would not cut benefits or pour more money
into the program, and he opposes raising eligibility ages.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best applause lines comes when Bush pledges to uphold
the honor of the presidency should he be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pledge I'll make to America, and it's a pledge I'll
keep,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tells audiences that he is against abortion, but says he
recognizes that ``good people'' can disagree on the issue. He calls
for a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions and advocates a law
that would require parents to be notified before a youth could
undergo the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   As to the type of vice president he would seek, Bush points to
two he admires: His own father, who served under Ronald Reagan, and
Dan Quayle, who served under his father.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives in Iowa say they wish Bush took a harder line
on issues, such as abortion. But many still back him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can win, and the others can't,'' Bottomley explained.

   Perry Monroe Shoemaker, who started as a summer laborer for the
Pennsylvania Railroad for 7 cents an hour and rose to become the
president of two large railroads and the chairman of a third, died
on Dec. 25 in Tampa, Fla. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker was 46 in 1952 when he became president of the
Delaware, Lackawanna &AMP; Western Railroad after 12 years with the
Erie Lackawanna Railroad and the New York, New Haven &AMP; Hartford. At
the time he was said to be the nation's youngest president of a
major railroad. Eight years later, he became one of the earliest
railroad executives to fashion a large merger, that of Delaware,
Lackawanna and the Erie Lackawanna.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was named chairman of the merged company, Shoemaker
took a sizable salary cut in 1962 to become president and chief
executive of the ailing Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey. After
he resigned in 1968, he remained a trustee of the railroad, then
moved to Tampa, where he was a transportation consultant.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch believer in rail transportation, he believed just as
strongly that the main source of the railroads' problems was what
he described as ``bungling and mismanagement of promotional and
regulatory activities of the federal government'' and heavy taxes
imposed by state governments. ``The State of New Jersey does not
tax the right-of-way of buses, trucks or airplanes,'' he said in
the mid-1950s, ``but it does tax railroads. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Elmira, N.Y., on July 15, 1906, the young Shoemaker
asked for and received toy trains for Christmas, and during his
high school days he cut chemistry class so that he could watch the
trains come in. That early fascination led him to work as a track
laborer for the Pennsylvania Railroad after he graduated from high
school in Elmira. After graduation in 1928 from the University of
Michigan, where he majored in mechanical engineering, he worked as
a freight house laborer, a yardmaster, terminal yardmaster, general
manager and superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker headed the task force on transportation for the
Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the
Government, whose chairman was former President Herbert Hoover.
Shoemaker was also a past president of the New York State Chamber
of Commerce and was a director of several companies, including the
National Biscuit Co. and the Railway Express Co.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Iva Brown Shoemaker; four children
by his first wife, Emily Hane Shoemaker, who died in 1964: Linda S.
Wolfberg, of Canandaigua, N.Y.; Kent P. Shoemaker, of Minneapolis;
Karen S. Fitzgerald, of Washington; and Craig M. Shoemaker, of
Jamestown, N.C.; three brothers, Richard, of Chicago, David, of
Montour Falls, N.Y., and Donald, of Charlotte, N.C.; seven
grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
