Hall of Fame quarterback dead at 81

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman, who led the
Chicago Bears to four National Football League championships in the
1940s, died Sunday. He was 81.
	   In his 12 seasons with the Bears, Luckman became the team's
career leader in touchdowns with 137, and yards gained _ 14,686.
	   Luckman once said he wanted three sentences on his tombstone:
``He had it all. He did it all. He loved it all.''
	   Luckman died at Aventura Hospital in North Miami Beach, Florida,
where he was a patient, according to the nursing supervisor, who
would not give her name. The cause of death was not given.
	   Born in New York in 1916, Luckman attended Erasmus Hall High
School in the city's Brooklyn borough. He went to Columbia
University where he earned All-America status as a senior 1938.
	   Luckman made the cover of Life Magazine in his senior year, with
the headline, ``Best Passer,'' printed under his picture.
	   Bears owner George Halas traded two players and a draft choice
to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1939 to acquire the 5-foot-11 inch
(1.80-meter), 190-pound (86.18-kilo) Luckman. Halas offered Luckman
the highest salary ever paid by the team at the time, dlrs 5,000 a
year.
	   Luckman played his first game against the New York Giants in
1939, a 16-14 loss.
	   ``You'll never know the emotion, stress,'' Luckman once said of
that game. ``That had to be the most emotional time in my football
history. My family, my friends from college, the Columbia coaches,
the dean of the college ... they were all at the game.''
	   In 1940, Luckman led the team to a 73-0 victory over the
Washington Redskins for the NFL championship.
	   Luckman was named NFL MVP three times during his 12 seasons as a
pro, and was selected All-Pro seven times.
	   When he stopped playing football in 1950, Luckman's salary was
dlrs 23,000, matched only by Redskins quarterback Sammy Baugh.
	   He then began a 14-year part-time coaching career for the Bears
and other teams Halas wanted to teach about the T-formation.
Luckman never accepted a coaching salary from the Bears.
	   ``I can never repay the Bears for making my life a more
enchanting life,'' he said.
	   Luckman left football in 1950 and went to work for Cellu-Craft
Inc.
	   In 1946, he bought a half interest in the company, which
manufactured wrapping materials for processed foods companies. He
later sold his interest in the company.
	   ``George Halas told us that football was a means to an end,''
Luckman said of activities after retiring from the game. ``All of
us had to seek a way to keep up our income, because you never
really know in professional football what could happen on any given
Sunday.''
	   Luckman is survived by a son and two daughters. His wife,
Estelle, died in 1981.
	   No details were available about funeral services.

Hashimoto throws cold water on talk of Japan tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with spokesman denying promise of tax cut;
ADDS earlier statements on tax policy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's tax policy became increasingly confused on
Monday after top government officials, including the prime
minister, appeared to step back from earlier indications a
permanent income tax cut was in the works.
	   Speaking on national television Sunday, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said that while his government would debate permanent
reforms to Japan's income tax system, it was not certain there
would be any net reduction in taxes.
	   ``I don't think the result of the debate will be a tax rise ...
but it's possible the result will be neutral'' in terms of the tax
burden, Hashimoto said.
	   The comments came one week before upper house elections for
Parliament and days after Hashimoto said he ``hoped'' Japan would
have ``not temporary tax cuts, but so-called permanent tax
reforms.''
	   Following that comment on Friday, media reports had said the
government was considering up to 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion)
in income tax cuts for next year to boost consumer spending and
help spur growth.
	   Japan is under increasing pressure from its trading partners to
boost its recession-plagued economy and create a market for goods
from troubled Asian neighbors.
	   On Saturday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi met U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Tokyo and, in a joint news conference,
described permanent tax cuts as a ``promise'' which Japan intended
to keep.
	   But on Monday, government spokesman and Deputy Chief Cabinet
Minister Teijiro Furukawa said no government officials had pledged
permanent tax cuts.
	   While Hashimoto had mentioned tax reforms he hadn't ``used the
words `permanent tax cuts,''' Furukawa said.
	   As for Obuchi's ``promise,'' Furukawa said the the Foreign
Minister had simply used the wrong word.
	   ``He was influenced a little by newspaper reports. He didn't
make a public promise,'' Furukawa told reporters.
	   During campaigning Sunday, Koichi Kato, a key official in
Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, reportedly said any
tax relief would be much more modest than press reports suggested.
	   Kato said a tax cut should amount to no more than 200 billion
yen (dlrs 1.43 billion), Kyodo news agency reported.
	   The confusion suggested the tax issue has become hostage to
political rhetoric ahead of the July 12 elections and may be a sign
of bickering within the government over plans to revive the
economy.
	   In the upcoming election, Hashimoto's party is hoping to gain a
majority in the upper house of Parliament for the first time since
1989. The party now holds 118 of 252 seats there.
	   But despite the weak economy, the party is in little danger of
losing effective control of the government. That's because the
Liberal Democrats control the more powerful lower house, holding
262 of the 500 seats.
	   Currency markets expressed disappointment with the apparent
policy flip-flop, pushing the yen lower against the U.S. dollar in
Asian trading Monday.
	   In Tokyo, the U.S. dollar bought 140.42 yen as of midday, up
1.18 yen from late Friday in Tokyo.

Three state elections key to Mexican presidential race

	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ An opposition party claimed victory in
one northern Mexican state Sunday, the country's ruling party was
poised to win in another state and a third contest was too close to
call. The governor races were seen as tests of party strategy for
presidential elections in two years.
	   Leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party in Zacatecas state
declared victory after two exit polls showing them 7 percentage
points ahead of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   If Democratic Revolution holds on, it would be the first time
the leftist party had won a state governorship, though it did
capture Mexico City's mayorship last year.
	   In Chihuahua state, the ruling party, known as the PRI, was in a
race too close to call.
	   An exit poll by Azteca television network showed PRI candidate
Patricio Martinez with 48 percent to 44 percent for Ramon Galindo
of the center-right National Action Party (PAN). But a 5 percentage
point margin of error made the difference statistically
insignificant.
	   The PRI tried a new strategy to recapture the governor's seat
from the PAN. It abandoned the tradition of party leaders choosing
candidates and held a primary election in March that was open to
all voters.
	   A win by Martinez, a former Chihuahua mayor, would mark the
first time the PRI has recaptured a state lost to the opposition.
It would also strengthen the hand of party members who favor a
national primary to chose a presidential candidate in 2000, a plan
favored by President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   In Zacatecas, two exit polls had Democratic Revolution candidate
Ricardo Monreal ahead of the PRI's Jose Olvera Acevedo, about 45
percent to 38 percent. The margin of error was 5 percentage points.
	   Monreal was a popular PRI federal congressman until he bolted
from the party when officials passed him over for the gubernatorial
nomination.
	   His candidacy has given Democratic Revolution its strongest
challenge yet in northern Mexico, where it is traditionally weak.
	   Voting was heavy, and few regularities were reported in the
three governorship elections.
	   The PRI was expected to hang on to the governorship of Durango
state, which borders both Zacatecas and Chihuahua, according to an
Azteca poll that gave the PRI 39 percent of voter preferences,
compared to 29 percent for PAN and 20 percent for the smaller Labor
Party.
	   While scattered early returns were expected late Sunday,
Mexico's complex vote-counting mechanism means definitive counts
were unlikely until Monday.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seeking to secure its place as a transportation
hub for the 21st century, Hong Kong opened its futuristic new
airport Monday after a nostalgic farewell to old and overcrowded
Kai Tak.
	   Workers moved 1,300 vehicles and 16 barges of equipment, as well
as 31 aircraft overnight from the old airport to Chek Lap Kok,
which was built by leveling two small islands and reclaiming land
30 kilometers (22 miles) away.
	   Officials said that operation went well, and no major problems
were reported in the first hours of airport operation.
	   Compared to the rocky start of another new Asian e largest
construction project in Hong Kong's history, was ``an outstanding
achievement, and proof yet again that Hong Kong's can-do spirit is
alive and well,'' said Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   The last operations of downtown Kai Tak, famous for its low
approach and sharp final turn over crowded Kowloon, and the first
at Chek Lap Kok were full of symbolism.
	   Chek Lap Kok's first arrival was an inaugural non-stop polar
flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline from New York at 6:25
a.m. (2220GMT Sunday). Officials said the 15 hour, 35-minute flight
was the longest commercial flight in history.
	   Like many people, co-pilot Mike Lowes, who landed the flight
from New York, said he would miss Kai Tak, but he was full of
praise for the new facility. ``It's just very smooth and
up-to-date,'' he said.
	   Passengers reported no problems getting through immigration, and
one of 14 carosels began churning out their luggage 20 minutes
after the New York flight arrived. It was followed within the hour
by planes from Rome and Mauritius. Early flights left for Asian
destinations without problems.
	   Restaurants and shops opened as scheduled, and appeared to be
surprised at the amount of business as more passengers arrived.
	   Kai Tak's last operations were a departure for Britain _ Hong
Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from China _ the new
sovereign after Britain returned the territory to China last year.
	   Piloted by Capt. Kim Sharman, a 21-year veteran making his last
flight, the London-bound Cathay Pacific jumbo jet left at two
minutes past midnight on Monday, closing Kai Tak's 73-year history.
	   A little more than an hour later, after several planes left to
be rebased at the new airport, officials shut down the runway
lights, making Kai Tak a piece of history. Eventually, the site on
Kowloon Bay is to be redeveloped for housing, which is in
chronically short supply in crowded Hong Kong.
	   Throughout the day on Sunday, Hong Kong residents jammed the old
airport, bringing children and cameras for a last, nostalgic look.
	   But as Monday dawned, the focus shifted to the future.
	   Economically, the new airport couldn't be opening at a worse
time. Moving their headquarters has driven costs up for airlines at
a time when business is down due to the regional recession. For
Cathay Pacific, passenger loads are at a 10-year low.
	   Landing charges will be about 20 percent higher.
	   The new airport was under discussion for years because of the
limits imposed by Kai Tak's downtown location. But work wasn't
begun until 1989, in the midst of British-Chinese negotiations over
the details of the handover.
	   China accused Britain of trying to empty Hong Kong's coffers
with the huge airport, and their were construction delays and
controversies. The entire project at one point included half the
world's dredging fleet. A 1.38 kilometer (4,475-foot) suspension
bridge, an express highway and a railway link were all built from
the remote airport to the city center.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level terminal, with a metal wing-like roof
designed by British architect Norman Foster, is one of the biggest
enclosed spaces in the world at 516,000 square meters (6 million
square feet).
	   Its glass walls allow a sweeping view of mountains, a glimpse of
the ocean, and plenty of sunlight. Unlike the old airport, which
closed nightly because of the noise, it will be open around the
clock.
	   A second runway is to open later this year. Officials have
estimated it will take 35 million passengers in its first year, and
eventually be able to handle 87 million annually.

Philippine inflation rises to 10.7 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Higher prices for food and clothes
helped push inflation in the Philippines up to 10.7 percent in June
compared to a year earlier, the highest level in two years, the
government said Monday.
	   The June inflation results pushed the average rate for the first
six months of 1998 up to 9 percent, the government said.
	   The rise in the consumer price index compared to a 10.3 percent
increase in May, the highest level since June 1996, when inflation
was 9.8 percent.
	   Since May, the government has been using a new base year of 1994
instead of 1988 and a revised basket of goods to calculate the
consumer price index in an effort to more accurately reflect the
impact of prices on a typical family.
	   Based on the previous calculation method, the June inflation
rate was 9.9 percent.
	   The effects of the Asian currency crisis and declines in
agricultural production caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon
have been pushing inflation higher in recent months.
	   Average inflation for 1997 was calculated at 5.9 percent using
the new CPI index. The old index showed it to be 5 percent.
	   Audi Pantillano, an economist at Securities 2000 Inc., says the
country is experiencing the tail-end effects of the El Nino crisis,
which nevertheless is continuing to have a ``significant impact''
on food prices.
	   Among the areas severely affected by the El Nino drought is the
southern Philippine region of Mindanao, which accounts for 30
percent of the areas surveyed by the government for its inflation
data.
	   Prices of food, beverages and tobacco, which account for 55.1
percent of the consumer price index, rose 10.1 percent on an annual
basis in June, compared to 9.0 percent in May, the government said.
Clothing rose 8.7 percent after an 8.3 percent increase the
previous month.
	   The government has set an average inflation target of between
7.5 percent and 8.5 percent for 1998, although this is expected to
be shortly revised upwards, possibly to between 9.5 percent and
10.0 percent.
	   Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson has expressed concern over
the relatively high inflation average, but noted that it is still
below the level of some other Asian countries embroiled in the
region's financial crisis.

Prosecutors demand death sentence for cult member in murder of
</HEADLINE>
lawyer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday demanded the death sentence
for a former senior member of Japan's doomsday cult for his alleged
role in the 1989 murders of an anti-cult lawyer and his family.
	   Kazuaki Okazaki, 37, was the first member of the Aum Shinri Kyo,
or Supreme Truth cult, to face the death sentence.
	   In Monday's trial, a prosecution lawyer to the Tokyo District
Court that Okazaki's criminal responsibility was ``extremely
grave,'' Kyodo News Service said.
	   The public broadcaster NHK quoted the prosecution as telling the
court that Okazaki strangled Sakamoto while the lawyer slept at his
home in Tokyo.
	   Sakamoto, his wife and their infant son were murdered on Nov. 4,
1989, and buried in remote central Japan Mountains by cult members.
Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult at the time he
was murdered.
	   A total of six cult members, including Okazaki and former cult
leader Shoko Asahara, were charged with the murders. Prosecutors
have said Asahara masterminded those killings as well as the March
1995 gas attack on Tokyo subways in which 12 people died.
	   The cult has been disbanded and more than 100 of its members
have been convicted on various charges.
	   The toughest penalty a cult member has received so far was life
in prison. That verdict was handed down May 26 to Ikuo Hayashi, 51,
a heart surgeon found guilty of murder for the Tokyo subway
gassing.
	   Okazaki, who left the cult in 1990, initially denied his
involvement in the murders of the lawyer and his family. But he
confessed to police details of his role in the murder in April
1995, when police launched a full-scale investigation into the
cult.
	   The ruling in Okazaki's case is expected sometime in the fall.
	   Okazaki was also charged with murdering a cult member who had
tried to quit the religious group in February 1989.
	   Asahara is still on trial separately for the Sakamoto murder and
nearly 20 other criminal charges, including another nerve gas
attack in the central Japan town of Matsumoto in 1994 that killed
seven people.
	   In a related development, the parents of a man allegedly killed
by cult members with VX gas in 1994 filed a lawsuit with the Osaka
District Court in western Japan Monday, seeking compensation from a
public system for people killed or injured while working.
	   The man, Tadahito Hamaguchi, then 28, died at a hospital ten
days after the VX gas attack by several cult members. He had been
on his way to work.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A family of five was electrocuted while

	   The incident occurred last Wednesday in the southernmost

Cambodian opposition prays for coup victims one year later

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prominent opposition leader Sam
Rainsy held a prayer ceremony Monday for the victims of last year's
coup, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians caught in the
crossfire of two days of heavy fighting.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-prime minister deposed by his
arch-rival, Hun Sen, in the bloody takeover was to lead a separate
ceremony later in the day.
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh are the leading opposition candidates
in elections Hun Sen has set for July 26 in an effort to legitimize
his rule after seizing near-total power July 5-6, 1997.
	   At Sam Rainsy Party headquarters, 100 Buddhist monks chanted for
peace and tossed jasmine petals from silver platters on the ground.
Incense was burned in memory of the dead.
	   ``This ceremony is for the victims of families and a celebration
for the souls of our dead compatriots who suffered during the July
5-6 coup,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``A lot of people suffered damage to
their property because of these brutal events.''
	   Addressing a crowd of about 500, Sam Rainsy refrained from
pointing fingers at those responsible, saying that now is the time
for peace.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored polls backed by thousands of
peacekeeping troops in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a
tense coalition by threatening civil war.
	   Four years of tension erupted in fighting between their armed
factions last year. Tanks, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic weapons fire ripped through Phnom Penh's streets.
	   After Ranariddh's faction was routed, Hun Sen's victorious
troops went on a looting rampage. The airport, hospitals,
factories, warehouses, businesses and homes were stripped bare.
	   The prince, Sam Rainsy and other opponents were driven into
exile but were eventually allowed by Hun Sen to return _ the prince
only after a show trial where he was found guilty of plotting his
own coup with former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   Ranariddh's party issued a statement Sunday paying homage to
slain members. As many as 100 of Ranariddh's supporters were killed
in the months following the coup, according to human rights
workers. No one has ever been arrested.
	   Several other political killings linked to the election campaign
have also gone unpunished.
	   Hun Sen has been accused of using violence and fear to terrorize
his opponents. The electoral bodies are packed with his supporters
and rival parties have little access to the vital broadcast media.
	   Sam Rainsy urged coup survivors Monday to remember those who
died, but to put aside anger and work toward peace.
	   ``Revenge is not a good way,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If you are
thinking just of revenge, then the suffering will not end.''
	   Sam Rainsy recalled other victims of political violence,
including the 16 who died and more than 100 who were injured in a
grenade attack on a peaceful rally he led in March 1997.
	   Hun Sen was widely believed to have been behind that attack,
seen as an assassination attempt against Sam Rainsy, one of his
most vocal critics. The opposition leader was slightly injured.

Statistics show 680,000 abortions in Vietnam in first half of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 680,000 Vietnamese women
underwent abortions in the first half of 1998, putting the country
on a pace to surpass last year's total, the Lao Dong (Labor)
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The figure came from official statistics released by the
Ministry of Public Health. The actual total was believed to be
higher.
	   Abortion has been on the rise since 1995, with 1.1 million
reported last year.
	   The ministry's statistics for this year showed abortion rates of
13 per 1,000 for females ages 15-19, 25 per 1,000 for the 25-29 age
group and seven per 1,000 for women 45-49.

Two guards suspended after World Cup jail break

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two jail guards were suspended from
duty Monday for negligence following the escape of eight prisoners
during Croatia's 3-0 quarterfinal victory against Germany in the
World Cup.
	   Two inmates in the embarrassing mass escape from the jail in
Rayong, 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of Bangkok, were recaptured
Sunday but six remained at large, including one charged with murder
and one with rape, police said Monday.
	   Thai media reported that jail staff were so engrossed by the
televised broadcast of the match that they paid no attention to
video monitors that would have shown the inmates sawing through
their cell bars.
	   Police blamed a heavy rain for not hearing the inmates cutting
their way to freedom. They were not found to be missing until about
four hours after the match started.

Deal for relocated tournament expected to be signed Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A top Asian Football Federation official
is expected to sign a contract with Vietnam this week to host the
second Tiger Cup soccer tournament next month, a Vietnam Football
Federation official said Monday.
	   The competition was originally set to be held in Indonesia, but
the plans were canceled because of the economic and political
turmoil there.
	   Vietnam then bid to replace Indonesia, but the Southeast Asian
Football Confederation first offered the competition to Johore,
Malaysia. Malaysia then bowed out, saying it would be too busy with
the Commonwealth Games.
	   The Vietnamese official said the AFF's general secretary is
expected to arrive Wednesday in Hanoi to sign a contract.
	   The eight-team competition features national squads from eight
regional countries: Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia,
Singapore, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines.
	   The Lao Dong (Labor) newspaper reported Monday that a delegation
of Asian soccer and sports-advertising officials visited Vietnam
last week to assess facilities and ensure that matches can be
televised live from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
	   Although Vietnam never has advanced to the World Cup finals,
soccer is by far the top sport in the country. The country has been
mesmerized by the ongoing tournament in France, even though some
matches are shown live at 2 a.m.

Japan's central bank head warns stimulus may have limited impact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's central bank head warned Monday that the
impact of a recent government stimulus package to boost the
nation's sluggish economy could be undermined by worsening
unemployment and low income growth.
	   Speaking at a quarterly meeting of central bank branch managers,
Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said the economy has been hurt
by weak demand for goods and rising joblessness.
	   ``Given the recent rapid deterioration in jobs and income
environments, there is risk that (this) could limit consumption and
corporate investment activities further,'' Hayami said.
	   Last month, the government reported that the number of people
without jobs in May rose to a record high of 2.93 million. The
unemployment rate remained steady at a record 4.1 percent.
	   In June, Japan's Parliament passed a supplementary budget to
help fund the country's largest-ever economic stimulus spending
package.
	   Hayami said the package will prove helpful and he held out hope
for a gradual recovery. But he signaled that interest rates will
remain at record lows until the economy shows signs of renewed
vigor.

Foreign fishers face losing vessel after no-show in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ An Argentine skipper and a Danish
fishing master caught allegedly plundering Australian fish stocks
face the loss of their ship after failing to show for a court
appearance Monday.
	   Fisheries officers said if the two failed to return to Australia
within six months the 145-foot (44-meter), U.S. dlrs 5.8 million
(9.4 million Australian dollars) Aliza Glacial will be forfeited.
	   Argentine skipper Fernando Gabriel Miranda, 33, and fishing
master Jakup Andrias Andreassen, 42, of the Faroe islands, were due
to appear in Perth Magistrates Court for a committal hearing
Monday.
	   A bench warrant was issued for their arrest when they did not
turn up.
	   The two were granted bail with their ship as security and
allowed to return home shortly after their October arrest near
Heard and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean, 2,500 miles
(4,000 km) southwest of Perth.
	   They have pleaded not guilty to illegally fishing without a
license for the highly prized Patagonian Toothfish within
Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone.
	   It was alleged they carried 21 metric tons of the fish in their
265-ton-capacity vessel.
	   ``The Heard Island and McDonald Island area is a pristine area;
there's two Australian fishing vessels licensed to fish down
there,'' senior fisheries officer Mike Flanagan said outside the
court.
	   ``They're reporting quite a few foreign fishing vessels
operating down there, so we're quite keen to stop those vessels.''
	   Aliza Glacial's owner, Cayman Islands company Ravenor Overseas,
had instigated proceedings in the Federal Court in Melbourne to
have the vessel returned, Flanagan said.
	   Patagonian Toothfish is exported to the United States, Japan and
Europe.
	   It was only discovered in Australian waters two years ago, and
the level of stocks in the Heard and McDonald Islands area are
unknown.
	   Fisheries officers, who worked with the Navy to apprehend Aliza
Glacial, planned to step up their patrols of the Southern Ocean,
Flanagan said.
	   Two other foreign fishermen caught in the same area as Aliza
Glacial in October have pleaded not guilty to illegally plundering
Australian stocks.
	   Salvora skipper Jose Santome, 27, and his 38-year-old fishing
master Jose Paz, both of Argentina, will face trial in Perth
District Court on Aug. 3.
	   Spanish skipper Juan Antonio Argibay, 35, was charged with the
same offense in March when his vessel, Big Star, was apprehended
near Heard Island.
	   He was yet to plead to the charge, which carries a maximum
penalty of U.S. dlrs 155,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), as well
as the forfeiture of the vessel, equipment and catch.

<TEXT>
	   Two of the paintings were recovered in Rome, and one in Turin,
the ANSA news agency said. More details were expected to come out
at a news conference later in the day.
	   The thefts of the only two van Goghs hanging in Italian museums,
and of one of Cezanne's last paintings, had provoked a storm of
criticism over museum security in Italy.
	   Three armed men apparently hid in the museum until it closed for
the night. They turned off the alarm system, locked up the guards
and walked away with van Gogh's ``A Woman from Arles'' and ``The
Gardener,'' and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of Jourdan,'' an unfinished
painting done the year he died.
	   The museum's closed-circuit surveillance system was broken at
the time.
	   ANSA said officers for the art protection squad of the
Carabinieri paramilitary police broke the case.

Russian-Vietnamese joint venture on target for production goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ VietsovPetro has produced 5.32 million
tons of crude oil in the first six months of 1998, 51.6 percent of
its goal for the year, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan
reported Monday.
	   The output was 613,000 tons higher than for the same period of
1997.
	   The report said the joint venture with a Russian company has
exported 5.24 million tons of commercial oil, earning dlrs 611
million, and paid dlrs 345 million to the Vietnamese state budget.
	   The company currently is pumping 30,000 tons a day.
	   It also has brought ashore 570 million cubic meters (20 billion
cubic feet) of natural gas, which is above its target and last
year's figures.
	   VietsovPetro is the only joint venture exploring and exploiting
oil and gas in Vietnam. The government says it will set up one more
joint venture with U.S., French and South Korean companies.
	   Vietnam ships virtually all of its oil overseas for processing,
although site preparation work is under way on its first refinery.

South Korea complains about Russia's expulsion of diplomat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry called in
Russia's acting ambassador Monday to complain about Russia's
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat on spy charges.
	   Vice Foreign Minister Sun Joon-young told acting ambassador
Valery Suhinin that Seoul was unhappy that Moscow acted without
consulting South Korea, ministry officials said.
	   Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at the South Korean Embassy in
Moscow, was ordered expelled after being detained overnight on spy
charges last Friday.
	   Cho was taken into custody as he met with an alleged contact,
identified by Russia's intelligence agency as Valentin Moiseyev,
deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's Asia Affairs Bureau.
	   Moiseyev was also detained for investigation by the Federal
Security Service, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
	   Moiseyev was accused of ``providing confidential information to
South Korean security services that was damaging to Russia's
political and economic interests,'' the Federal Security Service
said in a statement.
	   Cho has diplomatic immunity and was released after questioning.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry later ordered Cho to leave Russia
within three days for ``unlawful activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status.''
	   It's the first time that a South Korean diplomat has been
expelled by Russia since the two countries opened diplomatic ties
in 1990.
	   Seoul officials said Cho was expected to arrive in Seoul
Tuesday. They earlier had said they will take ``due action''
against Russia after investigating the case after Cho returns home.
	   One ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
his government would not rule out the possibility of retaliatory
action.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and
currency prices; ADDS trader quote in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Monday on
receding hope the Japanese government will announce major tax cuts
to spur the economy. Japanese stock prices lost ground.
	   The dollar bought 140.46 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.22
yen from late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York were
closed Friday for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   The yen weakened following comments from top government
officials which seemed to backpedal on earlier suggestions that
permanent tax cuts would be implemented.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made remarks which
appeared to back permanent income tax cuts. But speaking on
national television Sunday, Hashimoto said although permanent tax
reforms would be debated, there might not be any net reduction in
the overall tax burden.
	   ``It's just too confusing,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign
exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   ``Friday, Hashimoto hints at tax cuts and we send the dollar
down to the 138 yen level. Then we come in this morning and the
dollar's near 141 yen because of Sunday's comments,'' Nakauchi
said.
	   Also, on Monday, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa
told reporters that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi misspoke Saturday
when he promised U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that
Japan would adopt permanent tax cuts.
	   The tax-cut talk comes amid fierce campaigning ahead of July 12
elections to the upper house of Parliament.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 160.79 points, or 0.97 percent, to close at
16,350.45. The Nikkei index had gained 39.66 points, or 0.24
percent, on Friday, for its eighth straight rise.
	   Many investors retreated to the sidelines on Monday to monitor
developments regarding tax cuts.
	   ``Investors want to see in what way a tax cut is implemented,''
said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the stock trading division of Tokyo
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,258.45. The
TOPIX had closed down 2.10 points, or 0.17 percent on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.295 percent from Friday's finish of 1.340 percent,
driving its price up to 111.22 yen from 110.90 yen.

Police arrest 16 Tamil rebels for attack on lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police arrested 16 Tamil Tiger
guerrillas suspected of attacking a former rebel turned politician
while he was visiting a prison near Colombo, officials said Monday.
	   Douglas Devananda, secretary general of the Eelam People's
Democratic Party, was beaten into a coma last week in the prison in
Kalutara, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Colombo, the capital.
Devananda had gone to the prison to check on the condition of Tamil
militants being held there.
	   The militants among Sri Lanka's Tamil minority have fought for a
separate homeland in the north and east of the island nation since
1983, saying the majority Sinhalese discriminate against them.
	   Tamil militants dislike Devananda because he now sides with the
government and advocates a peaceful settlement of the Tamil
homeland issue.
	   Devananda, 40, set up the EPDP after he broke away from a rebel
group in 1985.
	   On Monday, doctors said Devananda showed improvement and was
expected to survive. He received serious head injuries.
	   All 16 suspects had been detained in the prison for months
without trial. They appeared in a court over the weekend, and
Magistrate D.A. Rajapakse sent them into police custody for ten
days, government officials said.

China agrees to open skies to British carrier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has agreed to give British airlines direct
access to Shanghai for the first time and allow more flights
between London and Beijing, British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott said Monday.
	   Although details of the air passenger service agreement were
still being worked out, Prescott pointed to the deal as a
substantive achievement of what he called his ``successful and
productive'' week-long China visit.
	   Relations between London and Beijing, poisoned for much of the
1990s by disputes on Hong Kong's handover to China, have greatly
improved in the year since Britain smoothly relinquished control of
the colony.
	   Prescott was the fifth Cabinet member of the 15-month-old Labor
government to visit China. The quickening exchanges are scheduled
to culminate with British Prime Minister Tony Blair's trip to
Beijing in October.
	   During a three-hour meeting Friday, Prescott said Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji conveyed his hopes for the Blair visit. The
British deputy prime minister said arrangements for the trip were
being made by other officials.
	   His agenda focused on a range of environmental and business
issues. The latter included shipping, finance, insurance, aviation
and water treatment. He brought along representatives from water
and aerospace companies.
	   The air services agreement will begin next spring at the
earliest and initially involve only one British airline. Others
will be added later, Prescott said, but details on which carriers
and how many flights will be allowed are still under negotiation.
	   During a weekend visit to central Xi'an city, Prescott also
discussed a troubled project to build a 100-seat commercial
passenger jet involving a consortium of European aerospace
companies led by Airbus Industrie.
	   Prescott had high praise for Premier Zhu but he did relay one
complaint. He found the Peking duck he was served here not as meaty
as the kind he frequently enjoys in Britain.

Philippine inflation rate rises to 10.7 percent in June

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sharp rises in food and clothing
prices helped push the Philippine inflation rate up to 10.7 percent
in June on a year-on-year basis, the highest level in two years,
the Philippine government said Monday.
	   For the first six months of 1998, inflation averaged 9 percent,
the government said.
	   The rise in the consumer price index exceeded the 10.3 percent
year-on-year increase in May, which had been the highest level
since June 1996's 9.8 percent.
	   Manila markets took the second month of double-digit inflation
in stride, with the Philippine Stock Exchange Index closing only
4.85 points lower Monday at 1,854.39 points.
	   Both currency and stock-market traders said a high inflation
number had been widely expected, although the June data were
considerably worse than many economists had forecast.
	   With little likelihood that the government will be able to
achieve its 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent inflation target for the
year, economic planners are recommending that the target be raised
to between 9.5 percent and 10.0 percent. The new target is expected
to be adopted shortly by President Joseph Estrada's new
administration.
	   With inflation at just 4.8 percent a year ago, last month's
inflation performance was a stark reminder of the impact on prices
of not just the long drought attributed to the El Nino weather
phenomenon but also the year-old regional financial crisis.
	   Economists, however, are optimistic that inflation won't
dramatically worsen over the rest of the year.
	   Since May, the government has been using a new base year of 1994
instead of 1988 and a revised basket of goods to calculate the
consumer price index in an effort to more accurately reflect the
impact of prices on a typical family.
	   Based on the previous calculation method, the June inflation
rate was 9.9 percent.
	   Average inflation for 1997 was calculated at 5.9 percent using
the new CPI index. The old index showed it to be 5 percent.
	   Among the areas severely affected by the El Nino drought is the
southern Philippine region of Mindanao, which accounts for 30
percent of the areas surveyed by the government for its inflation
data.
	   Prices of food, beverages and tobacco, which represent 55.1
percent of the consumer price index, rose 10.1 percent on an annual
basis in June compared to 9.0 percent in May, the government said.
Clothing rose 8.7 percent after an 8.3 percent increase the
previous month.
	   Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson has expressed concern over
the relatively high inflation figures, but noted that they are
still below the level of some other Asian countries embroiled in
the region's financial crisis.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seeking to secure its place as a transportation
hub for the 21st century, Hong Kong opened its futuristic new
airport Monday after a nostalgic farewell to old and overcrowded
Kai Tak.
	   Workers moved 1,300 vehicles and 16 barges of equipment, as well
as 31 aircraft, overnight from the old airport to Chek Lap Kok,
which was built by leveling two small islands and reclaiming land
30 kilometers (22 miles) away.
	   Officials said that operation went well. Some glitches developed
in the new airport's computer systems, but no major problems were
reported in the first hours of operation.
	   Compared to the rocky start of another new Asian airport, in
Kuala Lumpur, the move was a morale booster for Hong Kong. The
territory is suffering from a loss of its traditionally strong
self-confidence as it slides into recession.
	   Building of the new, dlrs 20 billion airport, the largest
construction project in Hong Kong's history, was ``an outstanding
achievement, and proof yet again that Hong Kong's can-do spirit is
alive and well,'' said Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   The last operations of downtown Kai Tak, famous for its low
approach and sharp final turn, and the first at Chek Lap Kok were
full of symbolism.
	   Chek Lap Kok's first arrival was an inaugural non-stop polar
flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline from New York at 6:25
a.m. (2220 GMT Sunday). Pilots said the 15-hour, 35-minute flight
was the longest commercial flight in history.
	   Like many people, co-pilot Mike Lowes, who landed the flight
from New York, said he would miss Kai Tak, but he was full of
praise for the new facility. ``It's just very smooth and
up-to-date,'' he said.
	   One of 14 carousels began churning out luggage 20 minutes after
the New York flight arrived. It was followed within the hour by
planes from Rome and Mauritius. Early flights left for Asian
destinations without problems.
	   But by noon, a problem in the baggage claim display boards
forced passengers to wait up to 90 minutes for information on which
carousel would have their luggage. The airport flight information
display systems also broke down briefly, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   ``Most software problems _ particularly in the early operational
stages _ develop glitches,'' airport director of corporate affairs
Clinton Leeks told the radio.
	   Restaurants and shops opened as scheduled, and workers appeared
to be surprised at the amount of business.
	   Kai Tak's last operations were a departure for Britain _ Hong
Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from China _ the new
sovereign after Britain returned the territory to China last year.
	   Officials then shut down the runway lights, making Kai Tak a
piece of history. Eventually, the site on Kowloon Bay is to be
redeveloped for housing, which is in chronically short supply in
crowded Hong Kong.
	   Throughout Sunday, Hong Kong residents jammed the old airport,
bring their children and their cameras for a last look.
	   But as Monday dawned, the focus shifted to the future.
	   Economically, the new airport couldn't be opening at a worse
time. Higher landing charges and the costs of moving are hitting
airlines at a time when business is down.
	   The new airport was under discussion for years because of the
limits imposed by Kai Tak's downtown location. But work wasn't
begun until 1989, in the midst of British-Chinese negotiations over
details of the handover. That was the same year as the Tianamen
massacre in Beijing, which rattled Hong Kong.
	   The project at one point included half the world's dredging
fleet. A 1.38-kilometer (4,475-foot) suspension bridge, an express
highway and a railway link were all built from the remote airport
to the city center.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level terminal, with a metal wing-like roof
designed by British architect Norman Foster, is one of the biggest
enclosed spaces in the world at 516,000 square meters (6 million
square feet).
	   Its glass walls allow a sweeping view of mountains, a glimpse of
the ocean, and plenty of sunlight. Unlike the old airport, which
closed nightly because of the noise, it will be open around the
clock.
	   A second runway opens later this year. Officials have estimated
the airport will take 35 million passengers in its first year, and
eventually be able to handle 87 million annually.

Philippine companies seeking debt relief have dlrs 2.5 billion in

loans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine companies that have sought
debt relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission since the
start of last year's Asian currency crisis have a total of 102.4
billion pesos (dlrs 2.5 billion) in outstanding loans, the
government says.
	   Much of that amount represents the loan exposure of
cash-strapped Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier,
which has sought a temporary suspension of debt payments after a
crippling pilots' strike.
	   Since the peso weakened sharply against the dollar last July, a
growing number of companies have been unable to service their
debts.
	   The central bank sought to make the peso more attractive to
investors by raising interest rates, but this made it more costly
for debt-laden companies to pay back their loans. Those with
dollar-denominated debts also found it harder to repay their loans
since the dollar has become more expensive in terms of the local
currency.
	   Documents obtained from the SEC over the weekend showed 27
cash-strapped companies have sought debt relief from the SEC since
last July. In the first half of 1998, 15 companies sought debt
relief compared to seven in the same period last year.
	   Assets of companies that applied for debt suspension in the
first half of 1998 stood at 95.92 billion pesos (dlrs 2.3 billion),
while assets of companies that sought suspensions in the same
period the previous year totaled 2.61 billion pesos (dlrs 63.6
million).
	   Philippine Airlines has the biggest loan exposure _ 85.11
billion pesos (dlrs 2.08 billion) _ while its assets total 90.64
billion pesos (dlrs 2.21 billion).
	   The SEC has already formed an interim receiver committee to
handle the case of Philippine Airlines.

New technology lets Japanese builders go deep underground

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo is an urban planner's nightmare. Just about
every nook and cranny is filled with narrow, twisting roads,
crowded neighborhoods and people, people, people.
	   So officials are beginning to exploit a new frontier _ deep
underground.
	   Bolstered by an arsenal of technological advances that allow
construction at far greater depths than in the past, government
planners envision an array of projects, from better water and gas
mains to tunnels for highways and high-speed trains.
	   ``The time for this sort of construction has come,'' said
Yoshitaka Kuwabara, an official at the National Land Agency.
	   Kuwabara said new technologies have opened the way for
construction as far as 330 feet (101 meters) beneath the earth.
Conventional tunnels for utilities or subways usually run at depths
of no more than 35 feet (11 meters).
	   Tokyo's dive down has already begun.
	   The first of the capital's deep subterranean projects _ a
highway tunnel running 66 feet (20 meters) below the floor of Tokyo
Bay _ was completed in April 1997.
	   One of the biggest obstacles to deep tunneling was the increased
danger of cave-ins.
	   Engineers have overcome that with cylinder-shaped ``shield
machine'' robots the size of a house that use a combination of
rotating teeth and high-pressurized water to slowly bore through
the ground.
	   Workers follow behind, stabilizing the tunnel with fast-drying
concrete and loading the loosened dirt and rocks into dump trucks
to take to the surface.
	   The world's biggest shield digger, almost 50 feet (15 meters) in
diameter, is now cutting a tunnel beneath Tokyo that will capture
overflow from the city's rivers and prevent flooding.
	   Going deep is allowing planners to get around another persistent
headache in Japan _ obtaining permission from landowners to dig
under their property.
	   Kansai Electric Power in Osaka, Japan's second-largest city,
found private landowners so demanding that it decided to avoid them
altogether.
	   It is building a tunnel for high-voltage cables in the city's
crowded downtown by threading it far below the maze-like streets.
The company uses advanced ultrasound technology to keep track of
the exact location of the construction work 220 feet (67 meters)
below ground.
	   To make such projects easier in the future, Japanese officials
say they will propose a law that would end land ownership at a
point 132 feet (40 meters) beneath the surface. Anything below that
would be in the public domain, opening the way for companies to
begin construction with only a public permit.
	   ``We can avoid all the hassles of surface or shallow
subterranean building,'' said Masahiro Iwatsuki, one of the
officials drafting the bill.
	   The government is also working up guidelines for deep
subterranean construction. These would likely require builders to
ensure that projects do not contaminate underground water supplies
or undermine subways, buildings or other structures above.
	   Technology is being used to address other problems with
underground structures.
	   Engineers who built the four-lane Aqualine freeway beneath Tokyo
Bay worried the 6-mile-long (10-kilometer-long) tunnels would
become a deathtrap if a fire broke out. Their answer was an
innovative escape system that allows motorists to slide down
emergency chutes to a separate walkway beneath the road with its
own air supply.
	   Surprisingly for many people, a benefit of deep subterranean
construction is that it's safer during a strong earthquake than
tunnels at shallower depths. That appeals to many in Japan, which
is one of the most earthquake-prone nations on Earth.
	   The safety factor persuaded Tokyo Gas to build a new natural gas
main at a depth of 230 feet (70 meters), even though it could have
done it cheaper at a much shallower depth.
	   ``The deeper soil is actually firmer,'' said Hiroshi Hanada, a
spokesman for the utility. ``We've found that deep structures
actually shake much less, unless it's right where the earth splits.
	   ``But in that case, you'd have problems at any depth.''

Australia skeptical of Pakistan nuclear strike story
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian officials cast doubt
Monday on claims Pakistan had planned a pre-emptive nuclear strike
against India before both countries resumed nuclear testing in May.
	   The allegation was made last week by a man claiming to work for
Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission in support of his demand for
asylum in the United States.
	   But Australian officials supported Pakistan's claim that the
man's allegations did not make sense.
	   ``If there was such a plan, it hasn't been a plan for a very
long time,'' a Department of Foreign Affairs official told
reporters, speaking under the customary departmental rule of
anonymity.
	   ``Because it's very clear Pakistan's testing was in response to
India's.''
	   Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices in late May, a fortnight
after India sparked a regional arms race by exploding five nuclear
devices.
	   Australia imposed tough sanctions on both countries in response
to the testing, and senior Australian officials will head to London
Tuesday for a conference designed to keep up the pressure on India
and Pakistan.
	   ``One of the principal motivations, it's generally agreed, for
these tests was to jump start them into the big league, the major
league of global powers,'' an official said.
	   ``It's a sort of anachronistic 1950s way of doing it and we're
keen for them to realize that it hasn't worked.
	   ``We're fully reconciled to the fact that that could be a
long-term strategy because at the moment they're on a testosterone
high and it will take a while for the euphoria to wear off.''
	   Australia will be joined at the conference by the world's five
declared nuclear powers _ the United States, Russia, Britain, China
and France _ as well as Germany, Japan and other states such as
Argentina and Brazil that have come close to developing their own
nuclear weapons.
	   It will be the first of a series of forums to keep up the
pressure on Pakistan and India and send a warning to other states
considering joining the nuclear arms race.

World Cup: Brazil and Netherlands relive grudges, artistry in Cup
</HEADLINE>
semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Brazil-Dutch History &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ In art, style and history, Brazil and
the Netherlands went to the same school.
	   The two World Cup semifinalists are practically a mirror image.
They have in common a relentless attack, a patient, ball-control
midfield, a suspect defense _ even a missing lineman on the same
side of the field.
	   And, not least, a reverence for the Old Masters, from Johan
Cruyff to Pele.
	   Ronaldo and Dennis Bergkamp lead their teams Tuesday night in
Marseille, the latest chapter of a rivalry rich in history, grudges
and a tradition of soccer artistry.
	   ``We are the teams that have presented the best football in the
Cup so far,'' said Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo. ``This will be
lion eating lion.''
	   The Netherlands, perhaps the best team never to win a World Cup,
hopes to build on its 2-1 victory over Argentina in the
quarterfinals and dispatch the remaining South American team.
	   The Oranje had their best game of the Cup against Argentina.
They showed no sign of a second-half wilt and capped the game with
a show-stopping goal by Bergkamp in the final minute.
	   The Dutch also have a score to settle with the four-time Cup
champions. Brazil knocked them out of the 1994 Cup quarterfinals
with a 3-2 win.
	   ``We know Brazil, Brazil knows us,'' says Dutch coach Guus
Hiddink. ``It will be an interesting contest.''
	   If the team's go-to player is unquestionably Bergkamp,
Brazilians also single out striker Patrick Kluivert for special
attention, as well as playmakers Clarence Seedorf and Edgar Davids.
	   ``Kluivert and Bergkamp are very strong,'' admitted Leonardo,
Kluivert's teammate on AC Milan AC. ``They can do a lot of damage
at any moment.''
	   But the Dutch defense is at best shaky. Star fullback Jaap Stam
has been a disappointment. And the left side of the line is a hole
_ starter Arthur Numan was expelled against Argentina, and his
replacement Winston Bogarde broke his leg.
	   ``We're teams with the same style,'' says Brazil's team
coordinator Zico. ``They play on the attack, always looking for the
victory, and run risks like any team that plays to win.''
	   Not a bad portrait of Brazil, which has scored 13 goals this Cup
and let in five _ the best attack and the worst defense of any team
in the Final Four.
	   Brazil has its own momentum going, after a 4-1 thrashing of
Chile and a gripping 3-2 win over Denmark in the quarterfinals.
	   Against Denmark, Ronaldo revealed his talent as playmaker,
passing for two goals and showing a newfound mobility. Rivaldo also
seems more at home in his new midfield slot and scored a pair of
goals. In a sign of Brazil's versatility, four players are tied for
scoring honors with three goals apiece.
	   But the defense, as usual, is a question mark.
	   Right wing defender Cafu drew his second yellow card against
Denmark and will sit out against the Dutch. Aldair, Leonardo and
Roberto Carlos have one yellow each and will be cautious not to
risk a second that would scratch them from the final.
	   Cafu's replacement is Ze Carlos, an obscure defender from Sao
Paulo who will make his Cup debut. Until now, he was known mainly
for his talent for animal imitations.
	   ``I told Ze Carlos that since he can imitate dogs, parrots and
owls, now he'll imitate Cafu,'' Zagallo joked.
	   Zagallo has his own motivation to beat the Dutch. He was coach
in the 1974 Cup, when Brazil lost 2-0 in the semifinals to Cruyff
and the great ``Clockwork Orange'' team. It was his only failure to
win a Cup in five tries.
	   Still, Zagallo admits a bond with the country that gave the
world one of its last great expressions of ``art soccer.'' He even
picked the Dutch as a candidate to win the Cup.
	   Crossing paths again was written in the stars, he says.

Aborigines express mourning as land rights debate begins in Senate

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ As senators began Monday debating a
legislative deal that restricts Aborigines' land rights, elders
asked that Aboriginal flags flying over Parliament be lowered to
half-staff as a sign of mourning.
	   ``The Commonwealth (government) is throwing us back to the
sharks,'' Aboriginal negotiator Parry Agius said. ``I would like to
see the flags lowered. They should not be flying high.''
	   Two rows of Aboriginal flags and those of Australia's Torres
Strait islanders have been raised outside Parliament for a weeklong
celebration of Aboriginal and islander culture, the start of which
coincided with the Senate debate.
	   More than 1,000 Aborigines and white supporters rallied Monday
on the lawns outside Parliament House to oppose the conservative
government's native title legislation being debated inside. They
planted hundreds of colored cutouts of hands on the lawn to spell
out the word ``shame.''
	   Prime Minister John Howard reached a deal last week with key
independent Sen. Brian Harradine that is expected to see the
government's bill passed into law by the closely divided Senate
later this week.
	   By reaching a compromise with Harradine, Howard averted having
to dissolve Parliament and call an early election to get action on
his bill, which previously had been blocked twice in the Senate.
	   The bill limits claims by Aborigines on access to the vast
tracts of lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and
miners _ some 42 percent of Australia's land mass.
	   Aboriginal access mainly consists of the right to cross the land
to hunt or seek water, to visit sacred sites, or to hold clan
gatherings.
	   The ranchers, farmers and miners say they can't manage their
businesses properly if the land is subject to Aboriginal access
claims.
	   The architect of the government's bill, Nick Minchin, said the
new law would create greater certainty for farmers and miners, and
also help clear a backlog of Aboriginal land claims.
	   ``The amendments we put before you ... will start to produce
real outcomes for Aboriginal people,'' Minchin told the Senate.
	   Opposition justice spokesman Nick Bolkus said the debate was
historic, but future Australians would judge senators harshly
because the law takes away Aborigines' rights.
	   ``They will judge this day as a day of national shame because
today is the day of appeasement of racists and racism,'' Bolkus
said.
	   The senate debate follows six years of divisive and often bitter
wrangling over native title.
	   The debate started in 1992 when the country's most powerful
judicial body, the High Court, ruled that native title rights to
land can still exist in Australia in certain circumstances.
	   This reversed a previous legal fiction called ``terra nullius,''
which held that Australia was an empty land when the first white
settlers arrived in 1788.

World Cup: Rivalry, artistry bind Brazil and the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Brazil-Netherlands &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Brazilians know all about Dutch
art and history. For them, it means soccer.
	   When the two countries play Tuesday in a World Cup semifinal in
Marseille, it will be their third Cup meeting and the latest
chapter in a rivalry steeped in tradition.
	   Leonardo recalled his frustration at Brazil's dramatic 3-2 win
in the 1994 Cup, while he watched from the bench with a four-game
suspension for elbowing U.S. striker Tab Ramos. Now, his time has
come.
	   ``It's funny how history repeats itself,'' he mused after
practice Sunday. ``I missed that chance to face the Netherlands,
and now I get another.''
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo has his own history with the
Dutch. They were his nemesis in the only Cup he failed to win in
five tries as player, coach or team coordinator.
	   After coaching Brazil to victory in the 1970 Cup, Zagallo
returned in 1974 confidently predicting a repeat. But in the
semifinals Brazil ran into the legendary ``Clockwork Orange'' Dutch
team led by Johan Cruyff and was eliminated 2-0.
	   For Zagallo, facing the Dutch again means more than history.
It's destiny.
	   ``We cannot fight it,'' he said. ``I've always said that destiny
is inscribed. And our destiny is the Netherlands.''
	   His respect for the Dutch team is such that he picked them as a
candidate to win it all.
	   But the bond between Brazil and the Netherlands also is strong
in their admiration for what Zagallo calls ``art soccer.'' And no
one played it quite like they did.
	   The twin paragons were the Dutch ``carousel'' conceived by coach
Rinus Michels in 1974 and Brazil's virtuoso 1970 Cup champions
featuring Pele, Jairzinho and company.
	   ``They were players with a high IQ,'' Zagallo said. ``They had
to be intelligent to understand what the coach wanted. To do that
movement, any mistake would be fatal.''
	   Now there's little room left for art, Zagallo said. Players are
faster and stronger, and the masters have less time and space to
create.
	   ``Today, the idea is not to let the other team play,'' he said.
``Back then, we played football.''

Aborigines win rights to the sea, but not exclusive use
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Aborigines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ In a ruling that extends the concept of
native title, the Federal Court ruled Monday that Aborigines from
Croker Island off northern Australia have communal rights over the
sea and seabed.
	   In the first judicial decision on a native title claim to a
region of ocean, Justice Howard Olney said Aborigines from five
clans had limited rights in relation to the sea and seabed in an
area of about 1,000 square miles (2,600 square kilometers) north of
the Coburg Peninsula.
	   But the judge said the rights are not exclusive and that anglers
and commercial fishermen can use the waters.
	   ``The native title rights and interests do not confer
possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the sea and seabed
within the claimed area to the exclusion of all others,'' Olney
said.
	   The Croker Island claim is considered a test case for at least
120 claims to sea area over thousands of square miles (kilometers)
off Australia's coast, including prime fishing and resort areas.
	   The claim was opposed by the government and fishing companies,
which argued that successful native title claims over the sea could
threaten Australia's U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion (1.8 billion Australian
dollar) coastal fishing industry.
	   Before Monday's decision, lawyers for the Aborigines believed
the matter would ultimately be decided in the nation's highest
court, the High Court.
	   After Olney's ruling, Aboriginal leaders said they might appeal
to the High Court on matters relating to exclusive possession.
	   In 1992, the Mabo case in the High Court established Aborigines'
common law right to claim native title to vacant government lands.
This case reversed a previous legal fiction called ``terra
nullius,'' which held that Australia was an empty land when the
first white settlers arrived in 1788.
	   In 1996, the High Court said in the Wik case that Aborigines
could have the right of access for religious and cultural
ceremonies to the vast lands that the government leases long term
to ranchers, farmers and miners, which cover some 42 percent of
Australia.
	   The Croker case again widens the scope for native title claims.
	   But potential new claims to areas off shore may be cut off by a
government bill currently before Parliament, which would remove
Aborigines' right to lodge sea claims.
	   In his decision, Olney recognized the Aborigines' belief that
they are traditional custodians of the claimed area, ruling that
the native title rights included access for protecting culture and
custom.
	   Mary Yarmirr of the Mandilarri-Ildugij clan said she was both
happy and disappointed with the decision.
	   ``I feel quite happy that my people and I fully identified
ourselves in our own country, regarding our traditions and
cultures,'' she said outside the court.
	   ``(I'm) very disappointed that most of our native title rights
were not fully accepted.''

Roche signs licensing agreement for new cancer treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche and
U.S. firm Genentech Inc. announced Monday they have signed an
agreement giving Roche exclusive marketing rights outside the
United States for the breast cancer drug Herceptin.
	   Herceptin, discovered and developed by Genentech, is a
monoclonal antibody, one of a group of drugs designed to attack
specific cancer cells.
	   A recent study suggested it can benefit patients with breast
cancer that has spread. Researchers found that, when added to
standard treatment, Herceptin lengthened lives an average of three
months.
	   Roche said in a statement it will pay a ``substantial'' upfront
fee and will make further cash payments tied to product development
activity. The size of the amount paid wasn't disclosed.
	   Roche also will contribute equally with Genentech to global
development costs and will make royalty payments on product sales.
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has designated Herceptin a
``fast track'' product and granted it priority review.
	   The FDA is expected to make a decision by November 1998, Roche
said. The company will file for approval with other regulatory
authorities worldwide in the coming months.

Automakers deny claims of price-fixing in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have
agreements with dealers which keep car prices artificially high in
Britain, a television documentary alleges _ a claim denied by all
three automakers.
	   The government's consumer affairs minister says that he is
seeking more information on why cars appear to be more expensive in
Britain than elsewhere in Europe.
	   The charge that car prices are artificially high is made in a
documentary scheduled for broadcast Monday night on British
Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Independent accountants commissioned by the Panorama documentary
program figured that car prices in Britain are 6.6 percent higher
on average compared to continental prices, and as much as 10
percent higher on some makes compared to prices in France, Belgium
and the Netherlands.
	   ``We want to know why consumers in Britain are paying high
prices,'' Consumer Affairs Minister Nigel Griffiths says in an
interview on the program.
	   ``Certainly there is evidence and allegations that there are
markups, that there's a failure to supply and that dealers may be
discriminated against if they want to discount cars.''
	   All three automakers denied that prices are artificially
inflated.
	   ``We categorically deny that we impose any penalties on dealers.
We have a maximum list price which they can't exceed but they are
free to discount to any level they wish.,'' said Paul Buckett, a
spokesman for Volkswagen.
	   ``It is perfectly correct that Britain is currently more
expensive for cars than the Continent due to the currency rates.
But until recently the opposite was the case and manufacturers were
underwriting the losses,'' Buckett said.
	   Doug Wallace, spokesman for Mercedes-Benz U.K., said the company
did not limit the discounts dealers could give to customers.
	   ``We have a recommended price list and it's entirely up to the
dealers at which price they sell the car,'' Wallace said.
	   Volvo said that it did not offer discounts because cars are made
to order for customers.

Pauline Hanson fed up with `biased media'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IPSWICH, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson had a reporter and photographer ejected from a news
conference Monday and launched an attack on the media, saying she
was fed up with ``biased reporting.''
	   The independent member of Parliament from Queensland spoke at a
news conference at her electorate office after having a reporter
and photographer from The Queensland Times escorted from the
building by security guards.
	   Hanson had called the conference to reject claims by federal
legislator Tony Abbott that U.S. dlrs 310,000 (500,000 Australian
dollars) in electoral funding would go directly to her. She said
the funds would reimburse her candidates who had campaigned with
their own funds.
	   Hanson told about 20 reporters she had the Queensland Times
journalists evicted because she believed biased reporting by the
newspaper was directly responsible for two of her One Nation party
candidates losing the June 13 Queensland election.
	   One Nation stunned the mainstream political parties by capturing
11 of the 89 seats in Queensland's state parliamentary election.
	   Hanson said that for too long, the media had believed they could
report anything negative about her One Nation party without
substantiating the truth.
	   It was very clear there was a ``disgraceful bias which must be
brought to an end or exposed,'' she said.
	   Hanson said she would never allow the Queensland Times into any
further One Nation news conferences: ``I'm like a damned old
elephant. I don't forget.''
	   Queensland Times editor Mark Hinchliffe said the incident would
do One Nation more harm than good.
	   ``A media conference called is a call for all media,'' he said.
	   ``When you start being selective about the media, you're
prohibiting freedom of the press and freedom of the media, which is
something that One Nation has been very strong on _ the ability to
be able to have your say.
	   ``But it doesn't seem like it's good medicine for them to take
as well,'' Hinchliffe said.

Korean, Canadian, Norwegian paper firms to form joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hansol Paper Co. said Monday it has
tentatively agreed to form a joint venture with Canadian and
Norwegian companies and sell its South Korean newsprint plant to
the new enterprise.
	   Hansol, South Korea's largest newsprint maker, signed a letter
of intent over the weekend to form the joint venture with Abitibi
Consolidated of Canada and Norske Skog of Norway, company officials
said.
	   The joint venture, to be owned equally by the three companies,
will buy a Hansol plant in Jonju, 280 kilometers (168 miles)
southeast of Seoul, with an annual production capacity of 1.04
million tons. It is the world's third largest newsprint plant.
	   It also plans to buy a 53 percent stake in another Hansol
newsprint plant in Shanghai, China, which can produce 130,000 tons
of newsprint annually.
	   The two deals are worth dlrs 1 billion, Hansol officials said.
	   The joint venture also plans to buy unspecified stakes in two
other newsprint plants in South Korea and Thailand, owned by South
Korea's Shinho group, Hansol officials said.
	   The joint venture hopes to gain 18 percent of the newsprint
market in the Asia-Pacific area, they said.
	   Abitibi is the world's largest newsprint maker. Norske Skog is
Norway's largest newsprint producer.

China reportedly will try and release alleged Taiwanese spies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China plans to try and convict four
Taiwanese businessmen accused of spying, but then release them in
an act of goodwill, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The authoritative newspaper China Times, quoting unidentified
sources, said mainland authorities would stage an open trial soon
and release the evidence it says it has against the four.
	   The men will be repatriated to Taiwan immediately after being
found guilty, allowing them to avoid lengthy prison terms, it said.
	   Wu Hsing-jung, wife of Chen Shao-yu, one of the men being held,
said Chinese officials had informed her by phone two weeks ago that
the four would ``get off lightly.'' But she said they gave no exact
date for the men's release.
	   China claims to have discovered a trail of money linking the men
to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.
	   The case has highlighted China's opaque legal system and worried
Taiwanese investors who have sunk an estimated U.S. dlrs 30 billion
into the mainland without firm legal guarantees.
	   Feeling the effects of the Asian economic crisis and a drop in
foreign investment, China may be eager to reassure investors.
	   By expelling them rather than forcing them to serve their
sentences, China also would give impetus to a warming trend in
relations between the sides. Hopes are high that they will resume
negotiations this year after a break of more than three years.
	   China identified the four businessmen as Kou Chien-ming, 42; Han
Yueh-ting, 35; Chen, 43; and Chou Chang-ming, 36. Kou is the
founder and secretary general of the Civic Exchange Association, a
private Taiwanese group set up to promote trade, technology and
cultural exchanges with the mainland. The other three are members.
	   China claims the organization is a spy front. China's official
Xinhua News Agency said the men were seeking access to military
secrets when arrested in March, and all have admitted to the
charges.
	   But the charges have been strongly denied by Taiwan's Defense
Ministry and the National Security Bureau, which is responsible for
intelligence gathering. Others familiar with the case have said the
men were seeking to compile business information on the Internet.

Greens anger German auto drivers with proposal for autobahn speed
</HEADLINE>
limit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder swerved Monday to avoid another anti-car proposal from
his prospective coalition partner, the Greens, this time for a
speed limit on the autobahn.
	   ``This is a grab for an old hat out of an even older closet of
traffic policy and won't be done with me,'' Schroeder, a Social
Democrat, insisted in Monday's Bild newspaper. ``Demands like this
show more and more that apparently a big desire to go down has
broken out among the Greens.''
	   The environmental Greens party's traffic expert in parliament,
Gild Altmann, told Bild over the weekend that her party would seek
a 100 kph (62.5 mph) autobahn speed limit as part of their price
for joining a coalition with the Social Democrats, should they win
the Sept. 27 elections.
	   Polls show such a ``red-green'' coalition ahead of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's center-right grouping.
	   But the Greens have seen their support decline since they called
in March for a tripling of gasoline prices to discourage auto use _
a proposal Schroeder immediately rejected.
	   The speed limit idea met with similar criticism in car-happy
Germany, where cruising down the autobahn at speeds of 200 kph (125
mph) or more is considered by many to be a birthright.
	   Free Democrats general secretary Guido Westerwelle called it a
``typical reflex of an anti-progress and anti-technology party.''
	   Even fellow Greens, like Bavarian lawmaker Elisabeth Altmann,
called the 100 kph limit ``illusionary and harmful.'' She
recommended Germany adopt a top limit of 130 kph (81 mph), which is
standard across most of Europe.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine air force grounded its
fleet of about 30 U.S.-made MG-520 attack helicopters Monday while
it investigated why two of the aircraft collided, killing three
people, officials said.
	   The two helicopters, armed with rockets, collided and crashed
shortly after taking off from a southern Philippine air force base
Sunday, killing three men in one chopper and injuring three in the
other.
	   Air force spokesman Col. Jose Mendoza said the helicopters will
be inspected and remain grounded until the cause of Sunday's
accident is determined.
	   The helicopters, acquired from the U.S. military some years ago,
are mainly used to support troops in combat against Marxist and
Muslim guerrillas.
	   Air force officials and witnesses said one of the helicopters
flew too close to the other after they took off from Zamboanga
City's Andrews air force base, causing its propeller to hit the
rotor blades of the other. Both crashed to the ground.
	   No one on the ground was injured and air force officials safely
removed the rockets from the wreckage.
	   Officials said the collision appeared to be an accident but they
did not rule out sabotage.
	   The helicopters were bound for Cotabato city in southern
Maguindanao province, where there are many Muslim guerrillas, the
air force officials said.
	   Zamboanga is about 850 kilometers (525 miles) south of Manila.

Coca-Cola Amatil shareholders to sell 195 million shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian soft drink bottler Coca-Cola
Amatil said Monday its shareholders will sell 195 million shares in
offshoot Coca-Cola Beverages PLC through a so-called book-building
process.
	   This includes up to 100 million shares in the Europe-based
Coca-Cola Beverages that San Miguel Corp. of the Philippines has
indicated it wishes to sell, Coca-Cola Amatil said in a statement.
	   Another major shareholder, Richard Kuok's Kerry Group, is
believed to have put the bulk of its 46 million shares into the
book-build.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages will comprise Coca-Cola Amatil's Europe
operations, as well as the north and central Italy bottling
operations acquired from the Coca-Cola Co.
	   Shareholders in the Australian company will receive one share in
Coca-Cola Beverages for each one they hold in Coca-Cola Amatil.
	   Those who don't want shares in Coca-Cola Beverages may elect to
sell their entitlement into a pool, which institutions will bid for
under a book-building process.
	   Coca-Cola Amatil said about 2,600 of its shareholders have
elected to sell, although they're allowed to revoke their decision
prior to the book building on July 10.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages will list on the London Stock Exchange July
13.

Jewish settler arrested for smashing windows of Arab-owned cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A 16 year-old Jewish settler was
arrested Monday on suspicion that he and two others smashed the
windows of Arab-owned cars in this tense divided city.
	   On Friday, three Israelis on horseback shattered windshields and
dented the bodies of cars belonging to Palestinians in Hebron. The
attackers were armed with chains and wore checkered Arab head
dresses.
	   One suspect, 19-year-old Nathaniel Nir from Jerusalem, was
arrested during the rampage. A second suspect, a 16-year-old
resident of Hebron, was arrested Monday, police said. His name was
not released because he is a minor.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, a city of 130,000
Palestinians. The center of town is patrolled by Israeli troops
deployed there to protect the center, while 80 percent of the city
is under Palestinian control.
	   Hebron is one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and the
Palestinian residents have long complained that Israeli police do
little to protect them against vigilante attacks by settlers.

Asian crisis unravels demand for wool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Asia's economic crisis is causing a
decline in consumer confidence and a bleak outlook for the global
wool market, a leading wool promotion and research company's report
said Monday.
	   The effects of the Asian downturn are being felt in general
apparel areas, particularly in higher priced clothing lines, The
Woolmark Co.'s monthly market briefing said.
	   Woolmark said there appeared to be little hope of an upturn in
economic activity this year, with unemployment expected to rise
further and wool apparel purchases likely to remain depressed.
	   ``With the exception of North America, the fundamental consumer
pull for wool is still lacking in the major apparel retail
markets,'' the report said.
	   Consumer confidence was improving in key European markets, but
remained sluggish.
	   ``With the severe downturn in Asia and a sluggish recovery in
key European retail markets, the global wool textile pipeline is
working off high stocks and the outlook for raw wool remains
difficult for the first quarter of the new 1988/99 season,'' it
added.
	   The situation in the United States looked more promising with
demand at a 10-year high, the report said.
	   ``At the same time, the wool industry is likely to struggle to
maintain last year's activity levels as exports to Asia fall off
and imports from Asia increase into Europe,'' it said.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police recovered two van Gogh paintings and one by
Cezanne which had been stolen May 19 from the National Gallery of
Modern Art, officials said Monday. Eight people were arrested.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni told RAI state radio that the
daring theft was carried out by an organized band of thieves. He
said the paintings had not been damaged.
	   Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of
Jourdan,'' an unfinished painting done the year he died, were
recovered in Rome, police said.
	   The other van Gogh, ``A Woman from Arles,'' was found in Turin.
The van Goghs are the only two by the artist hanging in Italian
museums.
	   Police said the gang apparently had sought to sell the works
secretly to a private collector. ``Fortunately, (the paintings)
were found before this could happen,'' said Veltroni, who also is
minister of culture.
	   The works _ worth at least dlrs 30 million _ were too famous to
sell openly.
	   The theft had provoked a storm of criticism over museum security
in Italy.
	   Three armed men apparently hid in the gallery until it closed
for the night. They turned off the alarm system, locked up the
guards and walked away with
	   The museum's closed-circuit surveillance system was broken at
the time.
	   One of the suspects worked as a guard in the museum, the ANSA
news agency said.
	   ANSA said officers for the art protection squad of the
Carabinieri paramilitary police broke the case.
	   More details were expected at a news conference later Monday.

Spain's jobless claims drop in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jobless claims in Spain fell to 11.51
percent of the active population in June from 11.77 percent the
previous month, the Labor Ministry reported Monday.
	   At the end of June, a rounded 1.86 million people had filed for
unemployment payments, 41,539 people less than at the end of May,
the ministry said.
	   Another method to measure unemployment in Spain, and the one
watched more closely by analysts and investors, is based on a
quarterly survey of 64,000 households. The most recent survey put
the unemployment rate at 19.6 percent for the first quarter of
1998.

Mexico ruling party claims major state victory

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with PRI claiming victory in Chihuahua
election, opposition refusing to concede defeat. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party claimed Monday to
have won its most dramatic state election in a decade, but its main
opponent in northern Chihuahua was refusing to concede defeat.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party said it has snatched a
governorship away from an opposition party for the first time.
	   ``Mission completed. We have triumphed in Chihuahua,'' Patricio
Martinez of the party, known as the PRI, declared late Sunday
night.
	   Even as Martinez led party members on a giddy horn-honking
celebration through the streets early Monday, the conservative
National Action Party insisted that its own figures showed the race
too close to call.
	   ``The coin is still in the air,'' National Action state chairman
Guillermo Lujan told supporters gathered before the party
headquarters early Monday, with the sound of PRI celebrations
echoing in the background. He called PRI claims of victory
``irresponsible.''
	   The PRI itself apparently suffered a damaging loss in another
northern state, Zacatecas, where a man party leaders had snubbed
for the gubernatorial nomination jumped to a rival party _ and was
beating his old comrades early Monday.
	   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party claimed its Ricardo
Monreal had beaten the PRI's Jose Olvera Acevedo for the party's
first governorship _ and in the north, where Democratic Revolution
has been historically weak.
	   The party's greatest victory came last year in the Mexico City
mayor's race as part of a national election that stripped the PRI
of its majority in the lower house of Congress for the first time.
	   Election officials said a quick count of 25 percent of precincts
showed Monreal with 74,298 votes to 62,559 for Olvera. No
percentages were given.
	   However, the PRI was leading in most state legislative districts
and cities _ indicting that many PRI voters crossed over to vote
for Monreal but stayed loyal to other candidates.
	   In Chihuahua, confusion increased because no official figures
were available early Monday morning, more than eight hours after
polls closed at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) Sunday. An election tribunal had
ruled a quick count of selected precincts illegal. Each party based
its claims on its own, partial reports from individual polling
places.
	   A PRI victory in Chihuahua would deflate the widespread idea
that the party is steadily unraveling after a series of electoral
setbacks.
	   It would also be a successful test of the PRI's experiment with
an open primary in the state, open to voters of any party. It was
an unprecedented break with the usual policy of having party
leaders choose candidates.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has said he favors a similar system to
chose the party's presidential candidate in the year 2000, though
some party leaders are wary of the idea.
	   Early returns indicated that the PRI had easily held the
governorship in Durango, a third northern state.

Lawyer named new health minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A lawyer has been appointed as the new
health minister after his predecessor resigned because he
collaborated with the secret police under the Communists, a daily
reported Monday.
	   Gabor Hajdu, 59, has been a member of the Senate, parliament's
upper chamber since 1989, when Communist dictatorship ended. His
expertise is labor and social problems, Evenimentul Zilei reported.
	   Predecessor Francisc Baranyi was forced to resign after his
Securitate file was leaked. Baranyi, like Hajdu an ethnic
Hungarian, acknowledged he had been an informer but said he never
harmed anyone.
	   Romania's poorly funded and outdated health system, which often
functions on bribes, make the health ministry difficult to run.
	   In past weeks, a series of sensational exposes have exposed top
politicians as informers for the Securitate, the communist secret
police. Most have resigned from their jobs.
	   One in four adults was said to have collaborated with the
Communist secret police under Nicolae Ceausescu, the dictator
deposed, summarily tried and executed in December 1089.

Jewish settler arrested for smashing windows of Arab-owned cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A 16-year-old Jewish settler was
arrested Monday on suspicion that he and two others smashed the
windows of Arab-owned cars in this tense, divided city.
	   On Friday, three Israelis on horseback shattered windshields and
dented the bodies of cars belonging to Palestinians in Hebron. The
attackers were armed with chains and wore checkered Arab head
dresses.
	   One suspect, 19-year-old Nathaniel Nir from Jerusalem, was
arrested during the rampage. A second suspect, a 16-year-old
resident of Hebron, was arrested Monday, police said. His name was
not released because he is a minor.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, a city of 130,000
Palestinians. The center of town is patrolled by Israeli troops
deployed there to protect the settlers, while 80 percent of the
city is under Palestinian control.
	   Hebron is one of the tensest areas in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank. Palestinian residents have long complained that Israeli
police do little to protect them against vigilante attacks by
Jewish settlers.

Japanese stock rally ends, dollar gains in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index ended an
eight-session rally Monday when hopes receded that the government
would announce major tax cuts to spur the economy. The U.S. dollar
rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei stock average shed 160.79 points, or 0.97
percent, closing at 16,350.45, the first decline since June 23. The
Nikkei index had gained 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, on Friday,
and had climbed 1,456.64 points, or 9.7 percent, over eight
sessions.
	   Share prices tumbled Monday amid growing uncertainty over the
government's tax policy following comments from top officials who
seemed to backpedal on earlier suggestions that permanent tax cuts
would be implemented, traders said.
	   ``Investors want to see in what way a tax cut is implemented,''
said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the stock trading division of Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made remarks that
appeared to back permanent income tax cuts. But speaking on
national television Sunday, Hashimoto said that although permanent
tax reforms would be debated, there might not be any net reduction
in the overall tax burden.
	   Adding to the sense of confusion, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
Teijiro Furukawa told reporters Monday that Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi misspoke Saturday when he promised U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that Japan would adopt permanent tax cuts.
	   The tax-cut talk comes amid campaigning for July 12 elections
for the upper house of Parliament.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,258.45. It
had slipped 2.10 points, or 0.17 percent, on Friday.
	   An estimated 530 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 581.5 million
Friday. Advances outnumbered declines 665 to 493, with 118 issues
unchanged.
	   The apparent flip-flop on permanent tax cuts, which many
investors favor to revive Japan's moribund economy, also affected
currency trading.
	   The dollar bought 140.53 yen in late afternoon, up 1.29 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York were closed
Friday for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   ``Friday, Hashimoto hints at tax cuts and we send the dollar
down to the 138 yen level. Then we come in this morning and the
dollar is near 141 yen because of Sunday's comments,'' said Takashi
Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   ``It's just too confusing,'' Nakauchi said.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar traded as low as 140.15 yen and as high as
140.85 yen Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.300 percent from Friday's finish of 1.340 percent,
driving its price up to 111.19 yen from 110.90 yen.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, embarking on a visit to the province's volatile
southwest, the scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Some of the route touches on territory held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the diplomats apparently hoped to make contact
with members of the militant separatist organization.
	   Among the diplomats participating were Richard Miles, the U.S.
charge d'affaires in Belgrade. Journalists were accompanying the
observers.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke spent the weekend shuttling between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
trying to lay the ground work for talks between the Yugoslav
government and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   After meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke said in Belgrade late Sunday that the past three days in
the region had been ``very useful in clarifying many issues.''
	   ``I'm not going to say it's making progress because that would
mislead you,'' he said. ``But it's certainly not a failure.''
	   Milosevic approved the diplomats' visits Monday under an
agreement last month with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``Tomorrow's launching of the Kosovo observer mission ... is the
return of an important major international diplomatic observer
presence in Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said.
	   In Pristina Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met with representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian
parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks. The group is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.
	   It was unclear whether Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed
the differences within the factious Albanian community. But
Holbrooke stressed his support for Rugova and said he would
continue to talk with talks with the Albanian leader and Milosevic
would continue.
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Yugoslavia consider a terrorist group.
	   The U.S. and Russian mediators are encouraging the Albanians to
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Milosevic over the future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989. On Sunday Holbrooke refused to say if a form of
autonomy is shaping up for Kosovo, although ``some change in the
current status of Kosovo within the international boundaries of
Yugoslavia is essential.''
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.
	   The Serb crackdown, which has claimed hundreds of lives since
late February, has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal and helped
bolster support for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

Kazak president meets Yeltsin to divide Caspian Sea resources
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin welcomed Kazakstan's
president Monday to sign a pivotal agreement aimed at resolving a
long-running dispute over the rich oil resources in the Caspian
Sea.
	   The five nations on the Caspian have been divided for years over
the question of who owns the oil in the seabed. The three nations
with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into national sectors so
they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   Not surprisingly, Russia and Iran, the two nations with little
or no oil near their Caspian coasts, want the sea's resources to be
shared by all.
	   In a compromise, Russia and Kazakstan planned to sign an
agreement that would divide the northern part of the Caspian seabed
into separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
	   It's seen as a victory for Kazakstan, because it recognizes its
claim to the oil near its coast and sets a precedent for future
agreements.
	   However, the deal also calls for a sharing of the Caspian's
waters, which means both nations will have equal access to the
sea's fishing grounds.
	   The other Caspian nations were not part of Monday's agreement.
	   The Caspian oil reserves are vast, but developing the fields has
been a slow process due to numerous legal disputes and the lack of
an adequate pipeline system needed to export the oil to world
markets.
	   Yeltsin had planned to go to Kazakstan last week for the signing
ceremony, but canceled the trip to address Russia's economic
crisis. Eager to sign the agreement, Nazarbayev, who turned 58 on
Monday, came to Moscow for the meeting.
	   ``There are small knots in our relations which can only be
untied on the top,'' Yeltsin said as he welcomed Nazarbayev at the
Kremlin.

 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Mandela says members of Security Council should
surrender veto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela urged developing countries to demand that the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council give up their veto
power.
	   Speaking Saturday night before a summit of the Caribbean
Community trade bloc on the island of St. Lucia, Mandela called for
the ``democratization'' of the United Nations and said it is unfair
that China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain can
override decisions by the 10 rotating members of the council.
	   The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and
stability among the 185 members of the United Nations.
	   Mandela said the issue would dominate a meeting of nonaligned
countries in South Africa in August. Nonaligned countries do not
belong to Western or Eastern military alliances.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: U.S. policy on Cuba wrong, new Caricom leader says
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ In the trade group's boldest
criticism yet of U.S. policy toward Cuba, the Caribbean Community's
new chairman said the U.S.-backed embargo denies Cubans ``a right
to live.''
	   ``We do not feel that Cuba should be penalized for its failure
to approach democracy at the dictate of any particular
government,'' said Kenny Anthony, prime minister of St. Lucia and
the new chairman of the 15-member group.
	   Anthony said the Caribbean Community would offer to help mediate
talks to improve relations between Cuba and the United States. He
made the comments following a summit of Caribbean leaders in St.
Lucia.
	   Caribbean nations have grown increasingly friendly to Cuba in
the last year, striking dozens of new economic development deals
with Fidel Castro's government and sending business and government
delegations to Havana.
	   ``All of these islands are in the process of building their own
democracies and they feel very strongly that economic measures
should not be used to deny people a right to live,'' Anthony said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government, residents brace for general strike
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Airports, utilities and government
agencies began bracing Sunday for a two-day general strike to
protest privatization of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   Workers on the government-run ferries that connect Puerto Rico
to the smaller islands of Culebra and Vieques told passengers that
they would not show up to work on Tuesday and Wednesday, and both
the power and water utilities warned customers they would be
operating on skeleton crews.
	   About 4,000 airport workers vowed to walk off the job, prompting
the Caribbean airline LIAT to cancel its flights during those two
days, the San Juan Star reported.
	   ``We are going to paralyze our workplaces,'' said Oscar Valdez,
president of the Independent Union of Airport Employees. Taxi
drivers pledged to stop working, and teachers promised to join
striking telephone workers on the picket lines.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Banana trade could divide U.S. and Caribbean, leader
warns
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ U.S. relations with the Caribbean
could be ``severely compromised'' by challenges to the local banana
trade, the incoming head of the Caribbean Community trade bloc
warned Sunday.
	   Kenny Anthony, St. Lucia's prime minister and the group's new
leader, vowed to defend trade perks and price protections granted
by the European Union to its former colonies in the Caribbean. He
spoke during a summit of Caribbean leaders.
	   The United States and Latin American countries won a World Trade
Organization case last year declaring the trade benefits unfair.
U.S. officials have since rejected proposals for scaled-down
benefits packages.
	   The attitude has worried small countries in the southeast
Caribbean, known as the Windward Islands.
	   ``The U.S. continues to be reckless in its efforts to undermine
the viability of the banana industry in these islands,'' Anthony
said.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Miami attorney linked to phony loan scheme in
Antigua
	   GAINESVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Prosecutors say a Miami lawyer
helped run a money-laundering scheme through Antigua that bilked
victims, including entertainer Dionne Warwick, out of some dlrs 63
million.
	   Jerrell E. Breslin allegedly lured hundreds of people into an
``advance fee'' scheme, in which people pay fees to individuals or
businesses that pledge to get loans for them from legitimate
lending institutions.
	   But the loan never materializes, and the intermediary keeps the
money.
	   The scheme allegedly lured hundreds of victims from across the
United States and did its banking in the Caribbean tourist stop of
Antigua.
	   Warwick lost dlrs 100,000 to the scheme in late 1995 and early
1996, court records show. She had tried to get money for a company
called the Dionne Warwick Design Group and needed to pay off an IRS
debt totaling dlrs 600,000.
	   The entertainer paid a dlrs 100,000 fee in exchange for a dlrs
2.5 million loan that never materialized.

Protestants go on rampage after Orangemen blocked at Portadown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with policeman badly injured, comment, morning detail
from Drumcree; RAISES mention of Parades Commission judgments
imminent, edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant hard-liners attacked
police, hijacked cars and blocked roads in many parts of Northern
Ireland overnight after British authorities blocked the province's
most controversial Orange Order march.
	   ``This is a battle that has to be won _ no ifs, no buts,'' the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the leading opponent of Northern Ireland's new
peace agreement, declared early Monday morning in a visit to
Orangemen camped out near a church where their parade was stopped
on Sunday.
	   Hooligans confronted riot police and British soldiers in several
parts of Belfast overnight, and a policeman was hospitalized with a
fractured skull in Londonderry.
	   Disorder threatens to continue unless Orangemen are allowed to
parade down their usual route through the main Catholic section of
Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast. But Catholic
areas rioted in 1996 and 1997 when police and British soldiers
forced the same parade through.
	   At daybreak Monday, several hundred Protestants were camped
outside Drumcree Anglican church on the outskirts of Portadown.
	   ``It's impossible to make decisions that please everybody,''
said Mo Mowlam, the British minister responsible for governing
Northern Ireland, noting that the government-appointed Parades
Commission would rule on 28 more disputed Orange parades later
Monday.
	   ``Mo Mowlam thinks she can break the backbone of the Protestant
people by facing down the Orangemen of Portadown,'' said Mark
``Swinger'' Fulton, reputed commander of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, who visited the encampment on Sunday. The outlawed group
resorted to murder in previous years in support of the Orange
marchers.
	   ``Portadown brethren have said they'll stay there for the year
if need be. It's up to us on the outside to do what we can to get
them out,'' said Robert Saulters, grand master of the Orange Order,
which has 80,000 members in Northern Ireland.
	   Orangemen and supporters pitched their tents in pastures around
the church, erected barbecues and played traditional Protestant
tunes on fife and drum near the ``no man's land'' designed by army
engineers.
	   A broad, deep trench and four lines of barbed-wire coils made it
impossible for them to breach police and army lines and reach
nearby Garvaghy Road, where local Catholics have organized
anti-Orange protests since 1995.
	   While Protestants insist their tradition of marching across
Northern Ireland each summer is unfairly under attack, many
Catholics say Orange parades are inherently anti-Catholic.
	   The confrontation inflames Northern Ireland's simmering
sectarianism and directly challenges the compromise spirit of
April's peace agreement. Among the backers for the deal
establishing a new government for Northern Ireland are the Ulster
Unionists, which is formally linked to the Orange Order, and the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, the catalyst for anti-Orange protests
in Portadown and elsewhere.
	   Saulters said opponents of parades wanted to destroy Northern
Ireland. He appealed for Protestants not to attack the
13,000-member, overwhelmingly Protestant police force, or the
19,000-member army garrison.
	   ``This is what Sinn Fein wants, Protestants fighting with our
police force,'' Saulters said. ``... We do not want traffic
stopped. That is not the way to win friends, by burning.''
	   But in Belfast, forklifts and bulldozers were clearing away the
rubble and charred debris left by several hours of violence in
working-class Protestant districts.
	   In south-central Belfast, rioters briefly spilled onto the
``golden mile'' of yuppie shops, bistros and pubs before police
chased them back into the working-class Sandy Row neighborhood.
Several vehicles were overturned and set afire. Masked youths
tossed gasoline bombs at police, who responded with sporadic
plastic-bullet fire.
	   Police said no serious injuries were reported in Belfast. They
also arrested four Catholic men and four teen-agers on the roof of
an Orange hall in Newry, 30 miles (50 kms) south of Belfast, on
suspicion of trying to burn it down.
	   In 1996, police tried to block the Orangemen at Drumcree but
relented after four nights of disruption and bloodshed, including
the murder of a Catholic by the Loyalist Volunteer Froce.
	   In 1997, the police commander cited the prospect of random LVF
killings of Catholics as one reason why he forced the march through
Catholic protesters.

Van Goghs, Cezanne stolen in Rome recovered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with thieves acting on commission, details on how
paintings found, quotes, details on arrests, investigation; news
conference scheduled for 1030 gmt &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police recovered two paintings by van Gogh and one
by Cezanne and arrested eight people, officials said Monday,
resolving an art theft that had become a major embarrassment for
Italy.
	   The gang, who included experienced art thieves and a security
guard at the National Gallery of Modern Art, apparently were acting
on commission, authorities said.
	   The three works were stolen from the Rome gallery May 19.
	   Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of
Jourdan,'' an unfinished painting done the year he died, were
recovered in Rome, police said. The other van Gogh, ``A Woman from
Arles,'' was found in Turin.
	   The van Goghs are the only two by the artist hanging in Italian
museums.
	   The paintings were found in two apartments, rolled up in
blankets, Rome prosecutor Italo Ormanni was quoted as saying by the
AGI news agency.
	   The canvasses were undamaged, Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni
told RAI state radio.
	   Police said the gang apparently had sought to sell the works
secretly to a private collector. ``Fortunately, (the paintings)
were found before this could happen,'' said Veltroni, who also is
minister of culture.
	   The works _ worth at least dlrs 30 million _ were too famous to
sell openly.
	   The brazen heist had provoked a storm of criticism over museum
security in Italy, where theft and damage to a vast artistic
patrimony is all too common.
	   Three armed men apparently hid in the gallery until it closed
for the night. They turned off the alarm system, locked up the
guards and walked away with the paintings.
	   The museum's closed-circuit surveillance system was broken at
the time.
	   The theft caused a ``deep wound'' to Italy, Veltroni told RAI
state television Monday. When news of the arrests spread, Italian
officials exulted.
	   ``Bingo!'' Veltroni's spokeswoman, Cecilia Mastrantonio, shouted
over the telephone.
	   Ormanni said police had zeroed in on the suspects about a month
ago, and that the investigation came to a head in the last 48
hours. The suspects were arrested in Turin and Rome during the
night.
	   During the arrests, officials seized rifles, pistols and wigs,
AGI reported.
	   Officers for the art protection squad of the Carabinieri
paramilitary police broke the case.
	   More details were expected at a news conference later Monday.

China agrees to open skies to British carriers

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has agreed to give British airlines direct
access to Shanghai for the first time and allow more flights
between London and Beijing, British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott said Monday.
	   Although some details of the air passenger service agreement
were still being worked out, Prescott pointed to the deal as a
substantive achievement of what he called his ``successful and
productive'' weeklong China visit.
	   Relations between London and Beijing, poisoned for much of the
1990s by disputes over Hong Kong's handover to China, have greatly
improved in the year since Britain smoothly relinquished control of
the colony.
	   Prescott was the fifth Cabinet member of the 15-month-old Labor
government to visit China. The quickening exchanges are scheduled
to culminate with British Prime Minister Tony Blair's trip to
Beijing in October.
	   In a three-hour meeting Friday, Prescott said Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji conveyed his hopes for the Blair visit. The British
deputy prime minister said arrangements for the trip were being
made by other officials.
	   His agenda focused on a range of environmental and business
issues. The latter included shipping, finance, insurance, aviation
and water treatment. He brought along representatives from water
and aerospace companies.
	   Under the air services agreement Prescott sealed with Vice
Premier Wu Bangguo, British carriers will begin two flights a week
to Shanghai this year, with two more added in 2000. Weekly flights
between London and Beijing will rise to five next summer and six a
year later, the British Embassy said in a statement. Prescott said
it had not been decided which British carriers would get the
access.
	   During a weekend visit to central Xi'an city, Prescott also
discussed a troubled project to build a 100-seat commercial
passenger jet involving a consortium of European aerospace
companies led by Airbus Industrie.
	   Prescott had high praise for Premier Zhu but he did relay one
complaint. He found the Peking duck he was served here not as meaty
as the kind he frequently enjoys in Britain.

Mahathir tells Muslims to pray less, work harder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Urging Muslims to evolve their
brand of Islam to suit modern times, Malaysia's prime minister said
Monday a more secular, less ritualistic faith was the key to
greater success and power.
	   ``Is it sufficient for Muslims to only pray and spend all their
time on certain rituals?'' Mahathir Mohamad told an assembly of
12,000 worshipers gathered to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet
Muhammad, the religion's ancient founder.
	   ``Not all ambitions and dreams can be achieved in the wink of an
eye.''
	   In his speech, Mahathir chided Muslims, many of whom, he said,
limited their practice to prayer and ritual and believed the
Islamic way of life should be a preparation for the afterlife.
	   Muslims should strive to achieve greater worldly success,
Mahathir said. He exhorted them to work harder at a time when the
country was facing its worst economic crisis in more than a decade.
Malaysia's economy shrank in the first quarter of 1998 and the
nation could slip into a recession if it doesn't grow this year.
	   ``Don't Muslims have to command and develop medical and health
knowledge? Don't Muslims have to command all knowledge that can
help save and defend the Muslims and Islamic nations?'' Mahathir
asked.
	   ``Where is our place in the hereafter if we only practice part
of the Islamic teachings? Are we not at fault if we ignore, even
reject the role demanded of us in the world?'' he added.
	   About 60 percent of the 21 million Malaysians are Muslims. The
others are Buddhists, Christians and Hindus.

Thai rice mill owners insist on keeping foreign workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai rice mill owners insisted Monday
that the government exempt them from a ban on employing foreign
workers, contending that neither raising salaries nor easing job
conditions would attract enough Thais to grueling mill jobs.
	   Some 400 rice mills reportedly suspended operations last week to
protest the ban, part of the government's policy to eject hundreds
of thousands of illegal immigrants to combat unemployment among
Thais.
	   The industry claims to be facing a shortage of 20,000 workers
because of the ban, due to take effect Friday.
	   ``No one wanted to close their mills down, especially in the
midst of this economic crisis,'' said Kriengsak Tapananond, an
official of the Thai Rice Mill Association. ``But we can't operate
under these conditions.''
	   Kriengsak said association members, meeting Sunday and Monday,
unanimously supported a resolution urging the government to exempt
rice mills from the foreign worker ban.
	   So far, only the fishing industry has been exempted, on the
grounds that its work is too physically grueling to attract Thai
workers.
	   In the rice mills, workers must be able to haul a minimum of 200
sacks of rice a day, each weighing 100 kilograms (220 pounds). They
are paid the minimum wage _ 162 baht (dlrs 4) _ or close to it.
	   Kriengsak on Monday dismissed the suggestion that the mills
should raise pay to attract Thai workers.
	   ``We believe the wages the workers receive is adequate,
considering the benefits they receive,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   ``Rice mill workers in the (Bangkok) area make between 200 and
250 baht (dlrs 5 and dlrs 6.25) for an eight-hour shift,'' he said.
``They also get free food, a living allowance, and medical care
paid for by their employers. So in this sense, they make more than
minimum wage.''
	   His claim of benefits was impossible to verify, and unlikely to
be applied universally, especially outside of areas where labor
department inspectors might turn up.
	   Last week, the government introduced a draft regulation to
reduce the maximum weight of a rice sack to 55 kilograms (120
pounds).
	   Kriengsak said that measure also ``would not get to the heart of
the problem,'' although the millers would abide by it. Newspaper
reports quoted millers as saying changing the size of the sacks
would double their expenses, though they did not explain why.
	   Despite widespread unemployment, efforts to recruit Thais to
work at the mills have failed miserably, and a good number of the
handful who signed on reportedly quit after several days.
	   The government begin to crack down on foreign workers last year
as the economic crisis made it evident there would be layoffs in
almost every business sector. Unemployment is forecast to double to
2 million this year, about 6 percent of the work force.
	   Thailand has about 1 million illegal immigrant workers, about 90
percent of them from neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma.

Hong Kong share prices close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong slumped for a second
consecutive session Monday because of uncertainty over Japan's
economic reforms.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 155.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 8,484.12. On Friday, the
index had tumbled 226.85 points.
	   Turnover fell to 3.12 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 400
million) from Friday's 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
578 million).
	   Brokers attributed the downtrend to concerns among investors
that the Japanese government may not announce tax cuts to boost
that country's faltering economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Sunday that
although permanent tax reforms would be debated, there might not be
any net reduction in the overall tax burden.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.90 Hong Kong
dollars to 31.80, and Cheung Kong fell 1.60 dollars to 37.40.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 3.00 dollars to
187.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.80 dollars to 43.30.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.10 dollars to 40.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 45 cents to 29.15.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, embarking on a visit to the province's volatile
southwest, the scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Some of the route touches on territory held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the diplomats apparently hoped to make contact
with members of the militant separatist organization.
	   Among the diplomats participating were Richard Miles, the U.S.
charge d'affaires in Belgrade. Journalists were accompanying the
observers.
	   Miles suggested the observers were prepared to take chances.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip, we have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' he told reporters on departure. ``But
towards the end of the week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yasser Arafat, who may already have more
nicknames and titles than any other leader, has added to more to
his list: ``faithful president'' and ``friend of the prophet.''
	   Arafat, whose nom de guerre has been ``Abu Ammar'' (father of
the builder) for decades, is also known to his people by more than
a dozen other names.
	   Palestinians call their 69-year-old leader ``al khityar,'' (old
man), ``al qaed'' (leader) and ``al-ab'' (father). He is also known
as ``al ramz'' (the symbol), ``the man of peace and war'' and ``al
raqam al saab'' (literally hard number, or tough guy).
	   On Sunday, during celebrations of the Prophet Mohammed's
birthday in a Gaza City mosque, Sheikh Nimr Masri came up with two
more unofficial titles - ``faithful president'' and ``friend of the
prophet'' - during a speech about Arafat's achievements.
	   Most Palestinians would not dare call Arafat anything but ``his
excellency, the president'' to his face, but his closest advisers
can get away with the other nicknames.

Akebono, Takanonami suffer upsets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono and ozeki
(champion) Takanonami both suffered upsets Monday, second day of
the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Yokozunas Wakanohana and Takanohana and ozeki Musashimaru all
improved to 2-0.
	   No. 1 maegashira (senior wrestler) Takatoriki pulled down
Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, after driving him to the ring's
edge with hand thrusts, leaving both at 1-1.
	   No. 2 maegashira Musoyama grabbed Takanonami's belt and toppled
him with an arm throw. They also were 1-1.
	   New yokozuna Wakanohana charged No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki
(0-2) with an arm throw attempt and sent him out from behind.
	   Takanohana held off komusubi (junior champion second class)
Kotonishiki's hand thrusts and pushing attempts and pushed him
down, leaving Kotonishiki at 1-1.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, and No. 2
maegashira Tochinonada (0-2) pushed each other for almost 3 minutes
before Musashimaru forced his foe down. A sumo bout usually ends in
10 or 15 seconds.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
fought off No. 12 maegashira Kotoinazuma's driving attempts at the
ring's edge and threw him down. Both are 1-1.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
suffered his second defeat against no victories as No. 13
maegashira Mitoizumi (1-1) clamped his arms from outside and drove
him out.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 2-ranked Hoshitango,
or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, pulled down equally ranked
Tochinoiwa for his first victory against no defeats.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshiandesu (1-0), or Argentine Jose Antonio
Juarez, sent out No. 11-ranked Torafusuyama from behind.
	   No. 27-ranked Wakaazuma (0-1), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
was pushed out by equally ranked Kotoiwakuni, and No. 50-ranked
Ikemori (0-1), or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, was forced out by No.
51-ranked Kotonoyama.
	   No. 56-ranked Kitaazuma (0-1), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, was
sent out by No. 57-ranked Musashifuji.
	   In the sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No.
17-ranked Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, downed
equally ranked Moriyasu with a leg trick for his first victory
against no defeats.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

In Ukraine, officials refuse to register former mayor as candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ In an ongoing political feud in the Black
Sea port of Odessa, the city's ex-mayor has had his application to
run for re-election turned down, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The city's electoral commission has refused to register the
ex-mayor Eduard Hurvits, but has approved nine candidates,
including one allied with President Leonid Kuchma, the Kievskiye
Vedomosti daily reported.
	   Kuchma's ally, Ruslan Bodelan, lost the mayoral election to
Hurvits in March in a turbulent campaign. There were several
outbreaks of violence and the two rivals accused each other of
having links to organized crime.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court invalidated the election results, and
Kuchma then dismissed Hurvits and Bodelan, who was the regional
administration chief.
	   The president has sent a personal representative to head the
Odessa city government until a new election is held Aug. 23.
	   The city's electoral commission so far has registered candidates
that include a science fiction writer, a train station porter and a
businesswoman, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.
	   But the commission voted against registering Hurvits, now a
legislator in the new Ukrainian parliament. It cited the court
decision that annulled his March election, the newspaper said.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Hurvits would appeal the
decision.
	   Control over Odessa, one of Ukraine's major business centers and
the site of a key oil export terminal, is vital for the central
government.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, embarking on a visit to the province's volatile
southwest, the scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica and Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Some of the route touches on territory held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the diplomats apparently hoped to make contact
with members of the militant separatist organization.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of the province,
which Serbs regard as their historic heartland.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke spent the weekend shuttling between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
trying to lay the ground work for talks between the Yugoslav
government and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   After meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke said in Belgrade late Sunday that the past three days in
the region had been ``very useful in clarifying many issues.''
	   ``I'm not going to say it's making progress because that would
mislead you,'' he said. ``But it's certainly not a failure.''
	   Milosevic approved the diplomats' visits Monday under an
agreement last month with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   In Pristina Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met with representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian
parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks. The group is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.
	   It was unclear whether Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed
the differences within the factious Albanian community. But
Holbrooke stressed his support for Rugova and said he would
continue to talk with the Albanian leader and Milosevic would
continue.
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Yugoslavia consider a terrorist group.
	   The U.S. and Russian mediators are encouraging the Albanians to
speak with a single voice in negotiations with Milosevic over the
future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore the autonomy he
canceled in 1989.
	   ``Some change in the current status of Kosovo within the
international boundaries of Yugoslavia is essential,'' Holbrooke
said Sunday.
	   Rugova and others are demanding full independence, but Rugova is
considered a more acceptable negotiating partner because he opposes
violence.
	   The Serb crackdown has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal and
helped bolster support for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical opens dlrs 14 million Singapore plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. opened a dlrs
14 million factory in Singapore Monday to produce a key component
for photocopiers and laser printers.
	   Under Mitsubishi Chemical's wholly owned subsidiary Mitsubishi
Chemical Infonics, the plant will begin producing organic photo
conductor drums in the third quarter of 1998, a company statement
said.
	   The product is used in photocopiers and laser printers to copy
text or images on to paper or other material.
	   The 24 million Singapore dollar investment, which is
Mitsubishi's fourth such factory in the world, is to be increased
to 40 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 23.4 million) by 2000 with
the addition of another production line.
	   The plant's initial capacity will be 270,000 drums per month,
expanding to 600,000 in two years.
	   Mitsubishi Chemical Infonics' fixed assets in Singapore grew to
544 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 318 million) with the opening
of the facility, and will total 560 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
327.5 million) when the new line is opened.

About 80 would-be immigrants taken to safety near Sicily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian navy vessel carried ashore more than 80
would-be immigrants who had been stuck on a ship off the southern
coast for four days, the ANSA news agency reported Monday.
	   Several of the would-be immigrants, most of whom are from
northern Africa, were treated for broken bones and dehydration at a
local hospital.
	   They were taken ashore Sunday night from the waters off the tiny
island of Lampedusa, which sits south of Sicily and about 100
kilometers (60 miles) east of Tunisia.
	   With warm temperatures and calm waters, migrants have been
arriving nearly every day on Italy's long coastlines.
	   ANSA said the new arrivals would be expelled Monday, in
accordance with tough new immigration laws passed under pressure
from Italy's European allies.

Israeli court rules on detention of two Lebanese guerrilla leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli court ruled Monday on a
petition seeking the release of two Lebanese guerrilla leaders but
banned publication of its decision, a court spokesman said.
	   The two leaders of the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah,
Abdel-Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, were kidnapped by Israeli
commandos in southern Lebanon in 1989 and 1994, respectively.
	   Israel hopes to use them as bargaining chips if and when it
begins negotiations on the release of missing Israeli airman Ron
Arad who was shot down over Lebanon during a 1986 bombing raid.
	   Arad's whereabouts are unknown, but Israel holds Iran
responsible for his fate. Hezbollah is backed by Iran.
	   Both Obeid and Dirani are being held in so-called administrative
detention, without charges or trial. In all, Israel holds 21
Lebanese administrative detainees.
	   A petition to free Obeid and Dirani was submitted by Israeli
human rights lawyer Zvi Rish to the Tel Aviv District Court.
	   Earlier this year, Israel's Supreme ruled that Israel was
justified in holding the Lebanese guerrillas as bargaining chips.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seeking to secure its place as a transportation
hub for the next century, Hong Kong opened its futuristic, dlrs 20
billion airport Monday after a nostalgic farewell to old and
overcrowded Kai Tak.
	   A few computer glitches were reported, causing delays in
baggage-handling and flight information displays, and at least one
passenger to miss a flight. But officials said they were fixing the
bugs as soon as they cropped up, and pronounced themselves
generally satisfied with the first day.
	   Compared to the rocky start of another new Asian airport, in
Kuala Lumpur, the move was a morale booster for Hong Kong. The
territory is suffering from a loss of its traditionally strong
self-confidence as it slides along with much of Asia into
recession.
	   The largest construction project in Hong Kong history is set on
two small, flattened islands and reclaimed land about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) from the city. It was ``an outstanding achievement, and
proof yet again that Hong Kong's can-do spirit is alive and well,''
said Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Workers moved 1,300 vehicles and 16 barges of equipment, as well
as 31 aircraft, overnight. They shut off runway lights and closed
Kai Tak, famous for its low approach and sharp final turn before
landing.
	   The Kai Tak location eventually will be used for housing, which
is in chronically short supply in Hong Kong.
	   The new Chek Lap Kok airport's first arrival was an inaugural
non-stop polar flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline from
New York at 6:25 a.m. (2220 GMT Sunday). Pilots said the 15-hour,
35-minute flight was the longest commercial flight in history.
	   Like many people, co-pilot Mike Lowes, who landed that flight,
said he would miss Kai Tak, but he was full of praise for the new
facility. ``It's just very smooth and up-to-date,'' he said.
	   One of 14 carousels began churning out luggage 20 minutes after
the New York flight arrived. It was followed within the hour by
planes from Rome and Mauritius. Early flights left for Asian
destinations without problems.
	   But by noon, a problem in the baggage claim display boards
forced passengers to wait up to 90 minutes for information on where
to find their luggage. The airport flight information display
systems also broke down briefly, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Clinton Leeks, airport director of corporate affairs, told the
radio that officials had solved several software problems during
the day, but more were likely and it could take a week to iron them
out.
	   He said airport officials were ``basically happy'' with how the
system was functioning.
	   Hong Kong radio said there were also problems with some
escalators and elevators not functioning.
	   Restaurants and shops opened as scheduled.
	   Kai Tak's last operations were a departure for Britain _ Hong
Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from China _ the new
sovereign after Britain returned the territory to China last year.
	   Throughout Sunday, Hong Kong residents jammed the old airport,
bring their children and their cameras for a last look. On Monday,
the neighborhood around Kai Tak, accustomed to the roar of planes
low overhead every couple of minutes, was quiet.
	   ``I'm not used to not hearing the noise,'' said Alex Ho, a fruit
stall owner who grew up in the neighborhood. ``It's like
something's missing.''
	   ``I feel like I'm in a newly developed town,'' Ho said.
	   But much more of Hong Kong's attention was on the future, and
the new airport.
	   Economically, it couldn't be opening at a worse time. Higher
landing charges and the costs of moving are hitting airlines at a
time when business is down.
	   The project at one point included half the world's dredging
fleet. A 1.38-kilometer (4,475-foot) suspension bridge, an express
highway and a railway link were all built from the remote airport
to the city center.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level terminal, with a metal wing-like roof
designed by British architect Norman Foster, is one of the biggest
enclosed spaces in the world at 516,000 square meters (6 million
square feet).
	   Its glass walls allow a sweeping view of mountains, a glimpse of
the ocean, and plenty of sunlight. Unlike the old airport, which
closed nightly because of the noise, it will be open around the
clock.
	   A second runway opens later this year. Officials have estimated
the airport will take 35 million passengers in its first year, and
eventually be able to handle 87 million annually.

Millions battle Yangtze River floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Millions of people strengthened dikes and
repaired breached banks along the Yangtze River Monday to prevent
flooding in central China, state media reported.
	   Heavy rains since the second half of June have pushed Yangtze
waters above flood-warning levels along its middle reaches for
1,000 kilometers (600 miles), the China Daily reported.
	   In Anhui province, 46 people had died and 370,000 others were
stranded as of Sunday in flooding on the Yangtze, Huai and other
rivers. The Wenhui Daily described the flooding as the worst since
the disastrous floods of 1991.
	   Just upstream in Jiangxi province, rain-swollen rivers and lakes
broke all previous high-water marks. Flooding swept away homes and
submerged farmland, the Xinhua News Agency reported. It did not
mention casualties.
	   With the deaths in Anhui, about 440 people have been killed in
flooding caused by heavier and earlier than usual seasonal rains.
	   The state-run China Central Television showed footage of
bulldozers and people piling sand and sandbags at building
entrances and roadways in cities along the Yangtze.
	   In Jiangxi, the Yangtze swelled its banks near Jiujiang city,
placing half the city's 4.4 million people at risk, city officials
said. Although 110,000 hectares (270,000 acres) of farmland,
several major rail lines and 82 enterprises are also threatened, no
casualties have been reported, they added.
	   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice Premier Wen Jiabao braved
rain and mud to comfort flood victims in one swamped village near
Jiujiang Saturday, Xinhua reported. Zhu reportedly ordered
officials to make sure the villagers had places to stay, food,
clothes and medicine.
	   The leaders also monitored efforts to shore up crumbling
embankments by some of the 3 million people mobilized to fight
floods in Jiangxi, Xinhua said.
	   Nearly a million officials, soldiers and ordinary citizens were
combating flooding in neighboring Anhui, Xinhua said in a separate
report.
	   In southern Guangdong province, the North and West rivers
overran their banks and swamped surrounding areas for four days
before being contained over the weekend, China Daily said.
	   Beijing has been hit by four severe downpours in the past nine
days. One driver drowned when he drove into a suburban underpass
inundated with rain water, Xinhua said.

World Cup: Coach of famed Dutch teams hospitalized with heart

attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rinus Michels, whose ``Clockwork Orange'' teams of
the 1970s turned Dutch soccer into a virtual art form, was
hospitalized in stable condition Monday after suffering a heart
attack.
	   Michels, 70, was stricken after the Netherlands' 2-1 victory
over Argentina in Marseille on Saturday, FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said.
	   After initial treatment by Argentine team physician Dr. Raul
Madero, Michels was taken to a hospital in Paris, the spokesman
said.
	   ``His condition has improved to stable and he is expected to
stay in the hospital for a couple days yet,'' Cooper said.
	   Michels had a heart-bypass operation 15 years ago.
	   Michels coached the Dutch to the heights of world soccer in the
mid-1970s. That team, featuring Johan Cruyff, was nicknamed
``Clockwork Orange'' after the bright hue of its shirts and the
unorthodox, flowing style of play, which itself was described as
``art soccer.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. opened a dlrs
14 million factory in Singapore Monday to produce a key component
for photocopiers and laser printers.
	   Under Mitsubishi Chemical's wholly owned subsidiary Mitsubishi
Chemical Infonics, the plant will begin producing organic photo
conductor drums in the third quarter of 1998, a company statement
said.
	   The product is used in photocopiers and laser printers to copy
text or images on to paper or other material.
	   The 24 million Singapore dollar investment, which is
Mitsubishi's fourth such factory in the world, is to be increased
to 40 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 23.4 million) by 2000 with
the addition of another production line.
	   The plant's initial capacity will be 270,000 drums per month,
expanding to 600,000 in two years.
	   Mitsubishi Chemical Infonics' fixed assets in Singapore grew to
544 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 318 million) with the opening
of the facility, and will total 560 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
327.5 million) when the new line is opened.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's central bank head warned Monday that the
impact of a recent government stimulus package to boost the
nation's sluggish economy could be undermined by worsening
unemployment and low income growth.
	   Speaking at a quarterly meeting of central bank branch managers,
Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said the economy has been hurt
by weak demand for goods and rising joblessness.
	   ``Given the recent rapid deterioration in jobs and income
environments, there is risk that (this) could limit consumption and
corporate investment activities further,'' Hayami said.
	   Last month, the government reported that the number of people
without jobs in May rose to a record high of 2.93 million. The
unemployment rate remained steady at a record 4.1 percent.
	   In June, Japan's Parliament passed a supplementary budget to
help fund the country's largest-ever economic stimulus spending
package.
	   Hayami said the package will prove helpful and he held out hope
for a gradual recovery. But he signaled that interest rates will
remain at record lows until the economy shows signs of renewed
vigor.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of imported vehicles in Japan plummeted more
than 25 percent in June from the same month last year _ the 15th
straight month of decline, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said Monday.
	   In a sign of sluggish demand due to Japan's prolonged economic
slump, sales of imports during the month slid 25.5 percent to
23,982 vehicles, most of them passenger cars, the association said.
	   Sales of vehicles produced in the United States plunged 50.7
percent to 3,645, with Chrysler, Ford and General Motors all
suffering double-digit declines.
	   German-made vehicle sales in June fell 13.3 percent to 13,371.
	   For the year's first six months, sales of imported cars, trucks
and buses dropped 28.7 percent from a year earlier to 138,836
vehicles, it said.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sharp rises in food and clothing
prices helped push the Philippine inflation rate up to 10.7 percent
in June on a year-on-year basis, the highest level in two years,
the Philippine government said Monday.
	   For the first six months of 1998, inflation averaged 9 percent,
the government said.
	   The rise in the consumer price index exceeded the 10.3 percent
year-on-year increase in May, which had been the highest level
since June 1996's 9.8 percent.
	   With inflation at just 4.8 percent a year ago, last month's
performance was a stark reminder of the impact on prices of not
just the long drought attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon
but also the year-old regional financial crisis.
	   Economists, however, are optimistic that inflation won't
dramatically worsen over the rest of the year.
	    &UR; ___
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ VietsovPetro has produced 5.32 million
tons of crude oil in the first six months of 1998, 51.6 percent of
its goal for the year, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan
reported Monday.
	   The output was 613,000 tons higher than for the same period of
1997.
	   The report said the joint venture with a Russian company has
exported 5.24 million tons of commercial oil, earning dlrs 611
million, and paid dlrs 345 million into the Vietnamese state
budget.
	   The company currently is pumping 30,000 tons of crude oil a day.
	   It also has brought ashore 570 million cubic meters (20 billion
cubic feet) of natural gas, which is above its target and last
year's figures.
	   VietsovPetro is the only joint venture exploring and exploiting
oil and gas in Vietnam. The government says it will set up one more
joint venture with U.S., French and South Korean companies.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai rice mill owners insisted Monday
that the government exempt them from a ban on employing foreign
workers, contending that neither raising salaries nor easing job
conditions would attract enough Thais to grueling mill jobs.
	   Some 400 rice mills reportedly suspended operations last week to
protest the ban, part of the government's policy to eject hundreds
of thousands of illegal immigrants to combat unemployment among
Thais.
	   The industry claims to be facing a shortage of 20,000 workers
because of the ban, due to take effect Friday.
	   ``No one wanted to close their mills down, especially in the
midst of this economic crisis,'' said Kriengsak Tapananond, an
official of the Thai Rice Mill Association. ``But we can't operate
under these conditions.''
	   Kriengsak said association members, meeting Sunday and Monday,
unanimously supported a resolution urging the government to exempt
rice mills from the foreign worker ban.
	   So far, only the fishing industry has been exempted, on the
grounds that its work is too physically grueling to attract Thai
workers.
	   In the rice mills, workers must be able to haul a minimum of 200
sacks of rice a day, each weighing 100 kilograms (220 pounds). They
are paid the minimum wage _ 162 baht (dlrs 4) _ or close to it.

Sikhs hold protest march against India's nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ More than 2,000 Sikh nationalists
rallied in downtown New Delhi Monday in the biggest nuclear protest
since Indian weapons tests in May sparked worldwide condemnation
and answering tests from rival Pakistan.
	   The march had a political edge. It was organized by a politician
who once advocated a separate homeland for the Sikh religious
minority in Punjab, the northwestern state that is home to most of
the Sikhs in predominately Hindu India.
	   ``Sikhs condemn Hindu Bomb,'' read one of the placards carried
by men and women who traveled by bus overnight from various parts
of Punjab for the march in the Indian capital. Some of the marchers
declared they were Sikh, not Indian.
	   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party that leads India's
governing coalition portrayed the nuclear tests as proof of the
country's scientific expertise and of its ability to defy Western
powers. Though initial euphoria has died down in the face of
Pakistan's tests and international economic sanctions, protest
against India's nuclear ambitions has been muted and confined
mostly to a small number of peace activists.
	   Protesters Monday said heightened tension between India and
Pakistan made them feel particularly vulnerable because Punjab lies
on the Pakistani border.
	   ``We don't want Punjab state to be another Hiroshima,''
Simaranjeet Singh Mann, leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal party,
said in a speech to the protesters.
	   Mann said the economic sanctions imposed by the United States
and other countries in response to India's test ``should be as
tough as those clamped against Iraq.''
	   ``India has emerged as a big bully in South Asia and threatened
the Sikh civilization to extinction in Punjab, the homeland of
Sikhs,'' said a memorandum that organizers of the march decided to
send to the United Nations after police denied them permission to
hand it to the Indian president.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, embarking on a visit to the province's volatile
southwest, the scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica and Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Some of the route touches on territory held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the diplomats apparently hoped to make contact
with members of the militant separatist organization.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip. We have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' said one participant, the U.S. charge
d'affaires in Belgrade, Richard Miles. ``But towards the end of the
week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''

Asian stock markets closed mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
share prices falling both in Tokyo and Hong Kong because of
uncertainty over Japan's economic reforms.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei stock average shed 160.79 points, or
0.97 percent, closing at 16,350.45, the first decline since June
23. The Nikkei index had gained 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, on
Friday, and had climbed 1,456.64 points, or 9.7 percent, over eight
sessions.
	   Share prices fell amid growing uncertainty over the government's
tax policy following comments from top officials who seemed to
backpedal on earlier suggestions that permanent tax cuts would be
implemented, traders said.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made remarks that
appeared to back permanent income tax cuts. But speaking on
national television Sunday, Hashimoto said that although permanent
tax reforms would be debated, there might not be any net reduction
in the overall tax burden.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 140.53 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.29 yen from late Friday in Tokyo.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong slumped for a second consecutive
session.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 155.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 8,484.12. On
Friday, the index had tumbled 226.85 points.
	   New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher, with the key
index rising 2.2 percent.
	   Traders said the surge reinforced broker and fund manager
expectations that the worst may be behind the New Zealand equities
market, provided the downtrend in interest rates remains intact.
	   The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 45.81 points to 2,088.85. It was
the index's highest close since 2,098.14 on June 9.
	   The markets were closed in Malaysia and Indonesia for holidays.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, boosted by an agreement
between the government and a Taiwanese consortium to build a
high-speed rail project in Taiwan. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index rose 18.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,894.85.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The Straits Times
Industrial Index rose 4.84 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,127.51.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed slightly lower in listless
trading. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected issues
fell 4.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,854.39.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 2.74 points, or 1 percent, to
271.00.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with industrial
blue chips leading the way. The All Ordinaries Index rose 8.7
points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,751.8.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Korea Composite
Stock Price Index rose 1.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 309.61.

crowded, urban life on Monday, but still eerily quiet.
	   The one noise that dominated life here for as long as anyone
could remember, the roar of jet engines at adjacent Kai Tak
airport, was gone.
	   Hong Kong shut down the only international airport it ever knew
just after midnight, and moved it overnight 30 kilometers (22
miles) to the west.
	   Residents of the congested, dilapidated neighborhood woke up
Monday mourning the loss of a source of pride and identity.
	   ``The airport seems to have taken the life of this place away
with it,'' said Choi So-lui, a native of the neighborhood and owner
of a corner grocery store. ``That's what made this place magical.''
	   ``I'm not used to not hearing the noise,'' added Alex Ho, a
fruit stall owner who also grew up in the neighborhood. ``It's like
something's missing.''
	   Residents learned to love, and hate, the airport. Previous
property booms largely bypassed this part of Hong Kong because of
the noise and pollution, although most residents said they had
become used to the constant roar.
	   Redevelopment has been slow because of height restrictions.
Planes used to fly just meters (yards) over low-rise apartment
buildings, casting long shadows over the streets. For decades, the
roars of arriving planes interrupted conversations and TV programs,
woke up babies and scared visitors.
	   On Monday, the streets were empty, and restaurants were only
half-full during lunch hours. There were no more planes, no roar.
To some, it was no fun. To others, it meant no business.
	   ``People used to always ask for tables next to the windows to
see the planes and feel the windows vibrating. No one is asking for
that today,'' said Virginia Wong, head waitress of Top Banana
restaurant, which is across the street from Kai Tak and offers a
full view of the runway.
	   Thanks to the airport, the neighborhood of garages and small
metal and woodshops became a unique, bustling collection of
restaurants. In the airport's last weekends, Hong Kong residents
seized the chance to take pictures of low-flying planes and turned
the neighborhood into a mini outdoor carnival.
	   ``It used to be the sort of close, traditional kind of
neighborhood. Now you see more strangers coming in for food, and I
think it's good for business,'' said 65-year-old Ng Cheong, who
worked for 15 years in the 40-year-old Kung Wo Tofu Shop.
	   Officials plan to rent out stores in the passenger terminal
temporarily, and eventually build a residential town. Some store
owners, who expect business to drop by half, say a lack of business
may force them to close before the airport is redeveloped.
	   However, property owners also have reason to celebrate. Joyce
Chan, a property agent, said values of apartments already have
risen 20 percent.

Night club patron who sang off-key stabbed to death in Philippines

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Drunken revelers fatally stabbed a
man who sang an off-key rendition of a popular love song at a
Manila pub, police and news reports said Monday.
	   Police said the 29-year-old seaman was also drunk Sunday when he
took a microphone and belted out a local song titled ``Remember
Me'' out of tune, drawing jeers from 10 men at a nearby table.
	   The jeering led to an argument. Later, the men left the pub and
waited with knives, bottles, wooden clubs and a gun, police said.
	   They attacked the man when he walked out of the pub with two
friends, killing him instantly and injuring his companions, police
said.
	   Police are looking for the killers.

Prime minister says women's bill not dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
assured women Monday that a bill to set aside a third of the seats
in parliament for them would be presented for a national assembly
vote _ but only after he first tried to build support for it.
	   News agencies reported that several female members of the Indian
senate raised the issue during debate Monday. Parliamentary Affairs
Minister Madan Lal Khurana indicated last week that the bill would
only be introduced after politicians won consensus support. Members
of the governing coalition were to meet outside parliament on July
10 to discuss the bill.
	   Vajpayee, quoted by Press Trust of India news service, said in
the senate Monday that he wanted to try to arrive at consensus
first, but ``even if there is no consensus on the bill, it will be
introduced in the house.''
	   He set no date for tabling the bill, which was first introduced
in 1996 by a previous government but never put to a vote.
	   The bill had been on the legislative calendar for last Friday
but was taken off. The delay angered women's rights activists, who
said Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party was retreating from its
promise to push the bill through.
	   The main objection to the bill came from the Democratic Front
party, which wants the quota to be lowered from 33 percent to 15
percent. The Front, which represents lower castes and Muslims in
northern India, also wants a quota within the quota for women from
the groups they represent.
	   A 1995 federal law set aside a third of the seats on municipal
and village councils for women.
	   In many cases the law has had the intended effect _ increasing
the participation of women in India's democracy.
	   But some women face opposition at the local level. Male
politicians have attended council sessions in place of their
elected wives or daughters, ousted women in no-confidence votes,
and scheduled meetings late in the evening _ a time when women in
small, traditional communities would be unlikely to leave their
homes.

Singapore announces humanitarian aid for struggling Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A day after Indonesia's president asked his
country's 200 million people to fast twice a week due to dwindling
rice supplies, Singapore announced Monday it will send dlrs 7
million in humanitarian aid to its beleaguered neighbor.
	   The Singapore government ``recognizes the hardships that the
current economic crisis has caused Indonesia,'' and will send 12
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 7.1 million) worth of rice and
medicine to help the country, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in
a statement.
	   It said a first shipment of 10,000 metric tons of rice, plus
some medicine, would be sent ``as soon as possible,'' to be
followed by subsequent deliveries.
	   On Sunday, Singapore's Red Cross Society sent two planeloads of
food and medicine to Indonesia as part of its own efforts to help
its neighbor cope with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The society has raised about 1.2 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
702,000) for the purchase of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and
food, half of which was airlifted to Jakarta Sunday.
	   That was the first of four relief missions planned through
November 1998, with a total aid target of 5 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 2.9 million).
	   The Red Cross supplies are earmarked for children, the elderly,
needy families and pregnant or lactating mothers in various parts
of Indonesia.

Singapore dollar sinks as Brunei's largest company reported in
</HEADLINE>
trouble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore dollar declined against the U.S.
dollar Monday, weighed down by reports that an investment company
owned by the Sultan of Brunei's brother faces losses of about dlrs
16 billion.
	   Heavy losses at Amedeo, the investment and construction group
run by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, could put pressure on the Brunei
dollar, which is pegged to the Singapore dollar through a currency
board, currency traders in Singapore said.
	   Late in Asian trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.7128
Singapore dollars, down from its earlier high of 1.7170 but still
well above 1.6966 late Friday.
	   The Sunday Telegraph of London reported that Amedeo had
collapsed under the weight of the losses and its managers were
being sought for questioning. It said the government had hired
financial experts to examine the books of Amedeo, Brunei's largest
private company.
	   Government offices in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of
Brunei, were closed Monday for a public holiday, and no one could
be reached for confirmation.
	   Last week, the Borneo Bulletin, the only English-language
newspaper in Brunei, reported that Amedeo was ``troubled'' and
quoted Development Minister Haji Ismail as saying: ``I wish I knew
what was going wrong. I do not know what went wrong.''
	   Ismail said he wanted the company's managers to come forward to
help the government find out.
	   Among Amedeo projects are the six-star Jerudong Park House hotel
and power-generation projects in partnership with Germany's Siemens
AG, the Bulletin said.
	   Brunei, a tiny oil-rich sultanate on the northwestern coast of
Borneo, has one of the world's highest per-capita incomes.
	   A potential loss on the scale suggested by the Daily Telegraph
article wouldn't affect the oil and gas companies already operating
in Brunei, such as Shell, New Zealand's Fletcher Energy and Elf
Aquitaine of France, said Duncan Clarke, Sydney-based chairman of
the consulting company Global Pacific and Partners.
	   But the combination of a potential squeeze on the country's
offshore revenues and this year's weakness in oil and natural gas
prices would put a squeeze on Brunei's finances, Clarke said.

Statistics show 680,000 abortions in first half of year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 680,000 Vietnamese women
underwent abortions in the first half of 1998, putting the country
on a pace to surpass last year's total, the newspaper Lao Dong
(Labor) reported Monday.
	   The figure came from official statistics released by the
Ministry of Public Health. The actual total was believed to be
higher.
	   Abortion has been on the rise since 1995, with 1.1 million
reported last year. Vietnam's population is around 76 million.
	   The ministry's statistics for this year showed abortion rates of
13 per 1,000 for females ages 15-19, 25 per 1,000 for the 25-29 age
group and seven per 1,000 for women 45-49.
	   In February, the vice chairman of the National Assembly's
Commission on Social Affairs said Vietnam has the world's highest
abortion rate, with two pregnancies ended in rural areas for every
live birth.
	   Le Quoc Khanh said the overall proportion was 50-50 when cities
were included.
	   Traditionally, large families have been common in Vietnam's
agriculture-based society, with children taught at an early age to
help out in the rice paddies.
	   But in recent years, with the population booming, the government
has been encouraging couples to have two children or less.
Contraceptives have been used rarely, and teen-age pregnancies also
are a problem.

Russian, Kazak presidents agree to divide Caspian Sea resources

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and Kazakstan's leader
signed a key agreement Monday aimed at settling a long-running
dispute over control of the oil riches in the Caspian Sea.
	   The five nations on the Caspian have been divided for years over
the question of who owns the oil in the seabed. The three nations
with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into national sectors so
they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   But Russia and Iran, two nations with little or no oil near
their Caspian coasts, wanted the sea's resources to be shared by
all.
	   However, Russia has eased its position, and Yeltsin and
Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed an agreement
Monday that divides the northern part of the Caspian seabed into
separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
	   It's seen as a victory for Kazakstan, because it recognizes its
claim to the oil near its coast and sets a precedent for future
agreements. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Nazarbayev said
the agreement helped settle nagging political and legal questions.
	   ``This agreement will serve not Yeltsin or Nazarbayev, but
future generations,'' Nazarbayev said, according to Russian news
reports. ``Oil can bring either wealth or blood.''
	   ``It makes no sense to speak about the oil without ensuring
political stability,'' he added.
	   The Caspian oil reserves are vast, but developing the fields has
been a protracted process due to numerous legal disputes and the
lack of an adequate pipeline system needed to export the oil to
world markets.
	   Kazakstan also offered a compromise to help seal the deal. It
agreed to a sharing of the Caspian's waters, which means both
nations will have equal access to the sea's fishing grounds.
	   The other three Caspian nations were not part of Monday's
settlement, but the deal could set the tone for additional
agreements.
	   Yeltsin had planned to go to Kazakstan last week for the signing
ceremony, but canceled the trip to address Russia's economic
crisis. Eager to sign the agreement, Nazarbayev came to Moscow for
the meeting.
	   The two leaders also signed a document giving their cabinets two
months to settle financial disputes before Yeltsin makes a visit to
Kazakstan, now scheduled for September.
	   Russia signed a 1994 agreement with Kazakstan to lease the
Baikonur cosmodrome, which was built on Kazak territory during the
Soviet era.
	   The 20-year lease calls for Russia to pay an annual rent of dlrs
115 million to use the cosmodrome. But Moscow has not yet paid
anything, saying that Kazakstan has even larger debts to Russia.
	   In March, Nazarbayev threatened to break the lease agreement
unless Russia paid dlrs 460 million for four years of back rent.
But it now appears he has softened his stance as part of a
compromise with Russia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, visiting the province's volatile southwest, the
scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   The group departed amid reports of fighting west of their
planned route, near Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides, sending smoke
billowing into the air. Serb sources said the attack was started by
armed Albanians opening fire on Serb families, forcing Serb
villagers, aided by police, to repel the assault.
	   Some of the route of the observer mission touches on territory
held by the Kosovo Liberation Army. A participant, Richard Miles,
the U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade, said the observers hoped to
make contact with the militant separatist organization on the road
from Srbica to Klina.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip, we have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' he told reporters on departure. ``But
towards the end of the week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''
	   Russian Ambassador Yuri Kotov said the observer mission would be
a ``stabilizing factor'' in Kosovo.

Miners close Trans-Siberian railroad for a fourth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Siberian coal miners blocked the Trans-Siberian
railway for a fourth day Monday while other labor unions sought to
have the blockade lifted to keep their own industries going.
	   At least 29 freight trains with as much as 250 tons of cargo
were halted Monday, the Railway Ministry said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Metallurgy and chemical workers' unions appealed to the miners
to lift the blockade to avoid shutting down their industries, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Agricultural workers who are experiencing shortages of fuel and
grease at a time when animal food is being stored for the winter
also asked the miners to allow trains to go through, Interfax said.
	   Several hundred miners in the central Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close their mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related
industries.
	   The miners are demanding that the government make good on
promises made in May to pay up to six months of back wages. They
are also demanding the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Because of the blockade, trains have also been stopped on
approaches to the Trans-Siberian line, with up to 40 trains
standing idle in the Kemerovo region of Siberia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In Moscow, several hundred coal miners continued a sit-in near
the Russian White House, the government's headquarters. Their
permit to demonstrate expired Saturday, but authorities so far have
made no move to oust them.
	   The miners have asked authorities to let them demonstrate
outside the Kremlin, news agencies said Sunday.
	   The protests came about six weeks after a wave of protests by
coal miners around the country, who blocked the Trans-Siberian and
other railways in May to demand support from the federal
government.
	   Those strikes ended when the government pledged to pay a portion
of the back wages. The Kremlin insists that the money has been paid
out, but miners' union officials say only a portion has reached the
mines.
	   Russia has been slowly shutting down many of its coal mines,
which have been losing money steadily. But since many are located
in isolated regions, it has been difficult to find new employment
for the miners and workers in affiliated industries.

For India, 2000 computer bug is an opportunity running out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India had hoped to make a bundle on the
worldwide rush to program computers to cope with the year 2000.
	   Instead, it's missing out on an estimated dlrs 14 million a day
in business lost to other nations because of a shortage of computer
programmers here.
	   ``Though India appears to have unlimited manpower, there is a
crunch, a shortage'' of skilled people, said Partha Iyengar at
Gartner Group, a consulting firm that is studying how well various
nations are preparing for what's known in the computer industry as
the ``Y2K problem.''
	   For economy's sake, computer software was long designed to
recognize years by just the final two digits rather than all four.
Come 2000, computer systems that have not been reprogrammed will
interpret double zero to mean 1900 and many could stop functioning.
	   India has produced large numbers of computer professionals, but
many have moved to the United States and other Western countries
where companies pay more for their skills.
	   India's National Association of Software and Service Companies
had set its sights on grabbing dlrs 5 billion in ``Y2K'' work, but
says that would require at least 125,000 programmers. Only 30,000
currently live in India.
	   According to some estimates from industry executives, India has
bagged just dlrs 700 million worth of Y2K projects.
	   China, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand are some of
the countries getting the reprogramming business India wanted.
	   In addition to the programmer shortage, India has few of the
mainframe computers on which most of the year 2000 repair work is
done. One such computer costs dlrs 5 million.
	   The government had announced last year it would set up a
mainframe computer that would be linked to Indian software firms
handling 2000 repair orders from around the world. But the project
has been delayed, and with only 18 months until 2000, the mainframe
may be too little, too late.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
share prices falling both in Tokyo and Hong Kong because of
uncertainty over Japan's economic reforms. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei
stock average shed 160.79 points, or 0.97 percent, closing at
16,350.45, the first decline since June 23. The Nikkei index had
gained 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, on Friday, and had climbed
1,456.64 points, or 9.7 percent, over eight sessions. Share prices
fell amid growing uncertainty over the government's tax policy
following comments from top officials who seemed to backpedal on
earlier suggestions that permanent tax cuts would be implemented,
traders said. On Friday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made
remarks that appeared to back permanent income tax cuts. But
speaking on national television Sunday, Hashimoto said that
although permanent tax reforms would be debated, there might not be
any net reduction in the overall tax burden. (ASIAN-MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's tax policy became increasingly confused on
Monday after top government officials, including the prime
minister, appeared to step back from earlier indications a
permanent income tax cut was in the works. Speaking on national
television Sunday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said that while
his government would debate permanent reforms to Japan's income tax
system, it was not certain there would be any net reduction in
taxes. ``I don't think the result of the debate will be a tax rise
... but it's possible the result will be neutral'' in terms of the
tax burden, Hashimoto said. The comments came one week before upper
house elections for Parliament and days after Hashimoto said he
``hoped'' Japan would have ``not temporary tax cuts, but so-called
permanent tax reforms.'' Following that comment on Friday, media
reports had said the government was considering up to 4 trillion
yen (dlrs 29 billion) in income tax cuts for next year to boost
consumer spending and help spur growth. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Upscale retailer Saks Fifth Avenue is being
bought for dlrs 2.1 billion in stock by Proffitt's Inc., which has
grown to one of the nation's biggest department store chains
through acquisitions, it was announced Sunday. The combined company
will have a total of 330 stores in 38 states and estimated 1998
revenues of more than dlrs 6 billion. The new parent company will
change its name from Proffitt's to Saks Inc. and will be based in
Birmingham, Alabama, where Proffitt's moved recently from
Knoxville, Tennessee. Saks' stores will keep their name. Saks had
disclosed in late June that it was putting itself up for sale. The
decision came from the board of directors of Saks Holdings, the
parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, but the company had reportedly
come under pressure from Investcorp International, an investment
bank based in Bahrain which owns a majority stake in Saks.
(US-SAKS-PROFFITT'S)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seeking to secure its place as a transportation
hub for the next century, Hong Kong opened its futuristic, dlrs 20
billion airport Monday after a nostalgic farewell to old and
overcrowded Kai Tak. A few computer glitches were reported, causing
delays in baggage-handling and flight information displays, and at
least one passenger to miss a flight. But officials said they were
fixing the bugs as soon as they cropped up, and pronounced
themselves generally satisfied with the first day. Compared to the
rocky start of another new Asian airport, in Kuala Lumpur, the move
was a morale booster for Hong Kong. The territory is suffering from
a loss of its traditionally strong self-confidence as it slides
along with much of Asia into recession. (HONG KONG-AIRPORT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's central bank head warned Monday that the
impact of a recent government stimulus package to boost the
nation's sluggish economy could be undermined by worsening
unemployment and low income growth. Speaking at a quarterly meeting
of central bank branch managers, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru
Hayami said the economy has been hurt by weak demand for goods and
rising joblessness. ``Given the recent rapid deterioration in jobs
and income environments, there is risk that (this) could limit
consumption and corporate investment activities further,'' Hayami
said. Last month, the government reported that the number of people
without jobs in May rose to a record high of 2.93 million. The
unemployment rate remained steady at a record 4.1 percent. In June,
Japan's Parliament passed a supplementary budget to help fund the
country's largest-ever economic stimulus spending package.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine companies that have sought
debt relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission since the
start of last year's Asian currency crisis have a total of 102.4
billion pesos (dlrs 2.5 billion) in outstanding loans, the
government says. Much of that amount represents the loan exposure
of cash-strapped Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier,
which has sought a temporary suspension of debt payments after a
crippling pilots' strike. Since the peso weakened sharply against
the dollar last July, a growing number of companies have been
unable to service their debts. The central bank sought to make the
peso more attractive to investors by raising interest rates, but
this made it more costly for debt-laden companies to pay back their
loans. Those with dollar-denominated debts also found it harder to
repay their loans since the dollar has become more expensive in
terms of the local currency. (PHILIPPINES-DEBT RELIEF)

Philippine peso slips, stocks end lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso slipped against
the U.S. dollar Monday, buoyed by banks offering higher dollar
rates while awaiting a clearer direction for the value of the local
currency, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.410 pesos for the day, up from Friday's
41.306 pesos. The dollar was last traded at 41.480 pesos, the
peso's lowest level of the day.
	   Dealers said the rate didn't move much because of the lack of
significant positive or negative news. The government's release of
worsening inflation data, which showed consumer prices rising 10.7
percent in June, didn't move the market because players already
expect inflation to stay at the double-digit level for the rest of
the year, they said.
	   On the stock market, shares ended slightly lower in trading
clouded by the yen's continued weakness versus the dollar and the
high June inflation rate, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 4.85 points to
1,854.39, following Friday's 3.05-point rise.
	   Gainers trailed decliners 40 to 50, while 41 issues were
unchanged.
	   With Asian markets still vulnerable to the travails of the yen,
investors have been very quick to take profits at the first sign of
a rally, said Joey Roxas, president of Eagle Equities Inc.
	   He said the main index was inching higher for most of Monday's
session before profit-taking set in at the close of trading.
	   Roxas advised long-term investors to stay out of the market
until there is more clarity in the direction of Asian financial
markets.
	   ``There are still bargain stocks out there, but we're not
expecting any upturn yet as the regional economies are still
down,'' he said.

World Cup: High-flying Dutch relax in mountaintop luxury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE-CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Improved team spirit, more mature
players, experienced coaches. There are plenty of theories why the
Dutch are doing so well at the World Cup.
	   Training camp ambiance could also be a factor. The longer the
Dutch remain in the World Cup, the longer they stay in their
luxurious hotel clinging to a cliff-face overlooking Monaco and the
stunning scenery of France's Cote d'Azur.
	   ``It's a nice little hotel,'' Ronald de Boer said, employing
typical Dutch understatement.
	   Reaching Tuesday's semifinal in Marseille against Brazil means
the team will stay here until Friday, when it heads to Paris for
either the final or the third-fourth place playoff.
	   Standing on a sun-drenched terrace overlooking the sparkling
blue waters of the Mediterranean and the Principality of Monaco,
Van de Boer pointed towards one of the many high-rise apartment
blocks that jut out of the steep mountainside. ``That's where Frank
lives,'' he said.
	   Frank Rijkaard, now an assistant trainer with the Dutch team,
owns an apartment in Monaco.
	   Surrounded by breathtaking scenery, most of the Vista Palace's
68 rooms and suites overlook the hotel's 10 acres (four hectares)
of manicured gardens and its swimming pool built into the cliff.
	   On the rare occasions when they have been let into the hotel,
sports journalists have admired the view and sought to make out the
winding streets that form the track for Formula One's Monaco Grand
Prix.
	   In their few hours off during the tournament, the Dutch players
have indulged themselves with trips to a nearby golf course,
shopping sprees in the swanky boutiques of Monte-Carlo and even a
few rides on rented jet skis.
	   ``I wanted somewhere secluded but also somewhere that the
players would have something to do. I wanted to avoid them getting
bored,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said.
	   In the past, boredom has played a role in team disputes which
have hurt Dutch chances at big tournaments.
	   Accustomed to rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, few
locals have made the trip up to AS Monaco's training ground cut out
of the mountains above Monte-Carlo to watch the Dutch train.
	   But one resident does seem more interested than most _ Prince
Albert has twice visited Dutch training sessions.
	   ``They are a great team and it's a pleasure to have them in
Monaco,'' the sports-loving prince and International Olympic
Committee member said.

Former wrestling champion and two others killed in North Ossetia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen killed a well-known former wrestling
champion as he sat in his car in the capital of North Ossetia on
Monday, a news agency reported.
	   Sokrat Kasoyev, at one time Russia's judo champion, died along
with his son and an attendant at a gas station in Vladikavkaz after
unknown assailants fired repeatedly from a car, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said. Two other gas station employees were wounded.
	   An investigation into the killing is underway.
	   Kasoyev was the director of Orion, a fuel and oil supplier. He
frequently told friends that he had been blackmailed by racketeers,
and his death is believed to be a contract killing, ITAR-Tass said.

Oil official: Iraq boosts oil export capacity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has boosted the capacity of its main
oil terminal to 1.8 million barrels a day, a senior oil official
said in remarks published Monday.
	   The figure, the first revealed by Iraq, is higher than the 1.6
million barrels a day that the Oil Ministry had previously
disclosed and suggests that Iraq's oil infrastructure is in better
shape than Iraqi officials had claimed.
	   Rafid Mohamed al-Dobouni, chairman of Iraq's Southern Oil
Company, said the Mina al-Bakr terminal is now capable of loading
75,000 barrels an hour, also the highest capacity since 1990.
	   Al-Dobouni's remarks, carried by official media Monday, sharply
contrast with those of Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid who warned
last weekend that Iraq's production and export facilities were
``running at a very critical level.''
	   The largest portion of Iraq's exports under its oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations goes via Mina al-Bakr. The remainder
is shipped through the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan on the
Mediterranean.
	   Al-Dobouni said Iraq exported 20 million barrels via Mina
al-Bakr in June and expected the amount to be doubled this month.
	   The deep sea loading terminal on the Gulf was one of the early
casualties of the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, and its repair was a
top priority of Iraq's reconstruction program.
	   Its four docks, each with a crude handling capacity of 400,000
barrels a day, were brought progressively back into operation
between January and August 1992, restoring the terminal's loading
capacity to its prewar level of 1.6 million barrels a day.
	   Al-Dobouni also said production from southern oil fields was
``running at a good level'' and that his company has thrown other
``dormant fields'' into operation to boost exports.
	   He said repairs were under way at the Khor al-Amaya terminal,
which was destroyed during the 1980-1988 war with Iran. The
terminal will begin working again by the end of the year, adding
600,000 more barrels a day to Iraq's export capacity, al-Dobouni
said.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Wildlife experts are concerned about the
increasing number of deadly encounters between man and beast as the
human population _ and that of leopards, elephants and other
animals _ expands in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state.
	   ``More and more animals are coming in contact with humans,
resulting in bloody skirmishes in which, most of the time, the
animals lose their lives,'' Uttar Pradesh wildlife officer R.L.
Singh said in an interview last week.
	   Uttar Pradesh is home to several protected forests, including
the 62-year-old Corbett Tiger Reserve, India's first national park
and one of its most popular. Singh said government efforts to
protect animals from disease and poachers had succeeded within the
reserves. But the human population was also increasing, and
land-hungry villagers were carving out farms in areas bordering the
parks.
	   ``The animals, which used to stray unhindered into these buffer
zones in the past, cannot do so now,'' Singh said. ``But the
straying habit is strong in animals, and so they come in contact
with humans.''
	   In 1994, 27 leopards were killed by humans in the hills of Uttar
Pradesh, most of them poisoned by farmers. The toll rose to 31 last
year.
	   More and more leopards are turning into man-eaters, a
consequence of their increased contacts with humans, Singh said. Of
the 27 leopards killed in 1994, three were hunted down by wildlife
authorities because they had attacked villagers. The number
declared man-eaters was 26 last year.
	   The last wildlife census in 1997 put the number of leopards in
Uttar Pradesh state at 1,412, up from the 958 counted in the
previous census in 1995. The number of elephants rose by almost 400
to 1,984 over those two years.
	   The elephants are moving out of the reserves to feed in
villagers' sugarcane and paddy fields. Farmers had responded by
erecting electric wire fencing with charges powerful enough to kill
an elephant. Five Uttar Pradesh elephants have been killed in the
last six months.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A series of glitches delayed some passengers
Monday on the first day of operations at the futuristic, dlrs 20
billion airport that is intended to secure Hong Kong's place as a
transportation hub for the next century.
	   Computer troubles caused delays in baggage-handling and flight
information displays, and at least one passenger was reported to
have missed a flight. Some passengers reportedly had to wait up to
three hours to disembark.
	   But officials said they were fixing the bugs as they cropped up,
and pronounced themselves generally satisfied.
	   Compared to the rocky start of another new Asian airport, in
Kuala Lumpur, the move was a morale booster for Hong Kong. The
territory is suffering from a loss of its traditionally strong
self-confidence as it slides along with much of Asia into
recession.
	   The largest construction project in Hong Kong history is set on
two small, flattened islands and reclaimed land about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) from the city. It was ``an outstanding achievement, and
proof yet again that Hong Kong's can-do spirit is alive and well,''
said Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   The chairman of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline, Peter Sutch,
rejected criticism that the airport was too expensive for current
economic conditions, and predicted it would draw visitors.
	   ``An airport is an investment for 50 years,'' he said. ``It's an
investment, not only in aviation, but in the whole Hong Kong
economy.''
	   Workers moved 1,300 vehicles and 16 barges of equipment, as well
as 31 aircraft, overnight. They shut off runway lights and closed
Kai Tak, famous for its low approach and sharp final turn.
	   The Kai Tak location eventually will be used for housing, which
is in chronically short supply.
	   The new Chek Lap Kok airport's first arrival was a non-stop
polar flight by Cathay Pacific from New York at 6:25 a.m. (2220 GMT
Sunday). Pilots said the 15-hour, 35-minute flight was the longest
commercial flight in history.
	   Co-pilot Mike Lowes, who landed the flight, said he would miss
Kai Tak, but he was full of praise for the new facility. ``It's
just very smooth and up-to-date,'' he said.
	   One of 14 carousels began churning out luggage 20 minutes after
the New York flight arrived. It was followed within the hour by
planes from Rome and Mauritius. Early flights left for Asian
destinations without problems.
	   On its first day of operations, the new airport was expected to
handle about 450 flights and 80,000 passengers.
	   By noon, problems were cropping up.
	   A glitch in the baggage claim display boards forced passengers
to wait up to 90 minutes for information on where to find their
luggage. The airport flight information display systems also broke
down briefly, and passengers arriving from Taiwan reported having
to stay on the plane for three hours before disembarking, Radio
Hong Kong said.
	   Clinton Leeks, airport director of corporate affairs, told the
radio that it would likely take a week to sort out the problems. He
said airport officials were ``basically happy'' with the system.
	   Throughout Sunday, Hong Kong residents jammed the old airport,
bringing their children and their cameras for a last look. On
Monday, the neighborhood, accustomed to the roar of planes low
overhead every couple of minutes, was quiet.
	   But much more of Hong Kong's attention was on the future.
	   Economically, the new airport couldn't open at a worse time.
Higher landing charges and the costs of moving are hitting airlines
at a time when business is down.
	   A 1.38-kilometer (4,475-foot) suspension bridge, an express
highway and a railway link were all built from the remote airport
to the city center.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level terminal, with a metal wing-like roof
designed by British architect Norman Foster, is one of the biggest
enclosed spaces in the world at 516,000 square meters (6 million
square feet).
	   Its glass walls allow a sweeping view of mountains, a glimpse of
the ocean, and plenty of sunlight. Unlike the old airport, which
closed nightly because of the noise, it will be open around the
clock.
	   A second runway opens later this year. Officials have estimated
the airport will take 35 million passengers in its first year, and
eventually be able to handle 87 million annually.

Yeltsin pleased with austerity plan progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Monday he was
optimistic that the government could weather its current financial
troubles with the help of parliament.
	   Yeltsin said he was pleased that some bills in the government's
economic stabilization package have already won tentative approval
in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, and there was progress
on others.
	   The president and parliament clash on most issues, and have
disagreements on Yeltsin's financial package as well. But Yeltsin
was diplomatic when discussing parliament's approach to the
anti-crisis program, which includes more than 20 separate
proposals.
	   He acknowledged that the workload was of a ``big volume'' and
involved ``serious laws.''
	   Some laws to lower taxes have sailed through parliament, while
others that take money away from Russia's regions or put more
pressure on consumers to pay bills, have been shot down.
	   Russia's financial markets have been rocked by a falling stock
market, low prices for oil exports and the government's inability
to collect taxes.
	   The entire financial package was threatened last week when Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko vowed to come down hard on tax debtors
such as gas giant Gazprom.
	   Many opposition lawmakers denounced the move as an effort to
destroy one of the country's remaining economic treasures. The
government later eased its stance and agreed to negotiate a payment
plan with Gazprom.
	   But Kiriyenko, in a televised interview Sunday night, repeated
his stance that tax collectors will clamp down on companies that
haven't paid taxes, including Gazprom.
	   ``The state cannot live without taxes, so we will be ruthless in
connecting them,'' Kiriyenko said during the program.
	   Kiriyenko said that if Gazprom does not fulfill promises to pay
all required taxes by the end of July, the government will make
good on threats to take more control of the company by putting more
representatives on the company's board of directors.
	   In the interview, Kiriyenko also continued to lean on the State
Duma to push through the remaining bills in the government's
austerity package, and even said he would consider resigning if it
was necessary to push the program through.
	   ``The fate of the anti-crisis program is far more important than
that of the government,'' he said.
	   Kiriyenko's and Yeltsin's remarks did not calm Russia's stock
market on Monday, which had dropped 3 percent by the afternoon. The
stock market has lost half its value since the beginning of the
year and has been falling sharply for the past two months.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb accused of
orchestrating atrocities against scores of Muslims and Croats in
three notorious prison camps went on trial Monday in the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal's first genocide case.
	   Milan Kovacevic, 57, is charged with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity for his ``key role'' in atrocities
committed in the Prijedor municipality of northwest Bosnia in 1992.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all 15 charges. If convicted, he
faces a maximum life sentence.
	   His trial, the U.N. court's seventh, will publicize alleged
atrocities in three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   In her opening arguments, prosecutor Brenda Hollis said camp
guards ``were free to kill, torture and rape'' with no intervention
from their superiors.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, Hollis said.
	   The graying Kovacevic, wearing a white shirt and green pants,
sat in the dock and took notes occasionally.
	   According to Hollis, Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was among a
group of municipal officials who engineered a violent campaign to
expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and
December 1992.
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which ordered attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   The alleged atrocities began with attacks on non-Serb villages
involving heavy artillery bombardments by Serb forces.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   Hollis said prosecution witnesses would include camp survivors,
a rape victim, a journalist who visited Omarska and documents that
will establish Kovacevic's leadership during the alleged crimes.
	   Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, said Kovacevic was
appointed to political office by a pro-democracy coalition and did
not harbor ill feelings toward other ethnic groups.
	   ``The charge of genocide (against Kovacevic) is improper and it
can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Vucicevic said.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
	   He was arrested at the hospital without a fight, but another
genocide suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police
chief, was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.
	   Kovacevic is the first to stand trial on genocide charges, but
he is not the only suspect facing that charge.
	   The tribunal also has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic,
for genocide and war crimes. The pair, the top two suspects, remain
at large.
	   The tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia and has issued an unknown number of secret indictments.
Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

Atlanta Olympic champions beaten in Budapest track meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING story moved Sunday night to go along with results
just moved.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Mark Crear of the United States beat
1996 Olympic and 1997 World Champion Allen Johnson Sunday in the
110-meter hurdles event at the IAAF track meet in Budapest Sunday.
	   Crear, who placed second in the Atlanta Olympics behind Johnson,
proved that this year he is in better form than his rival, by
clocking 13.28 seconds, 0.03 seconds ahead of Johnson. Tony Jarrett
of England came in third, another 0.17 seconds behind.
	   Another Atlanta Olympic champion, Balazs Kiss of Hungary,
suffered a defeat in hammer in front of the home crowd. Kiss won
this event in Budapest last year but this time, he placed only
third, behind Vasily Sidorenko of Russia, and Igor Astapkovich of
Belarus, the leader of this year's world rankings.
	   The men's hammer and women's discus were Grand Prix events at
this competition at the request of the International Amateur
Athletics Federation. However, while the hammer field included nine
of the world's top thirteen athletes, none of the important names
in women's discus showed up.
	   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Judit Szekeres of Hungary, who
leads the European rankings this year, lost to Ionela Tirlea of
Romania who clocked 55.64 seconds, winning by 0.18 seconds ahead of
Szekeres. The time was not her best. Michelle Johnson of the United
States finished third, another 0.62 seconds behind.

Storms in Russia kill two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Storms across Russia's south killed two people
over the weekend, a news agency reported Monday.
	   One man was killed and four others injured on Sunday in the
Saratov region 900 kilometers (560 miles) south of Moscow when
strong winds ripped the roofs off more than 100 buildings, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Another person was killed in the Northern Caucuses republic of
Karachayevo-Cherkessia, 1300 kilometers (800 miles) south of
Moscow. Wind damaged more than 75 homes and felled trees across the
region, Interfax said.
	   More than 200 people are taking part in repair efforts in both
regions.

More than 2,400 policemen and soldiers implicated in crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 2,400 Philippine soldiers
and policemen have been implicated in various crimes, including
kidnapping, drug trafficking and gun smuggling, in the last three
years, officials said Monday.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he has ordered police to identify,
investigate and charge the soldiers and policemen linked to crimes,
whose names were compiled by a group of intelligence agents.
	   Estrada, who was sworn into office last week, has pledged to
make crime-busting a cornerstone of his six-year administration.
	   The former movie actor said he would be his own secretary of
interior and local government, in charge of the national police, to
personally supervise an anti-crime and -graft drive until most
criminals were driven ``to extinction.''
	   ``They still have time to change their mind,'' Estrada said in a
statement warning crime gangs.
	   A report by a presidential task force, composed mostly of
military intelligence agents, showed more than 1,800 of the
policemen and soldiers implicated in crimes were in active service,
a Manila newspaper reported.
	   The rest were dismissed or have abandoned their jobs, the report
said.
	   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, organized the task force in
1995 to covertly identify police and military men involved in crime
or coddling crime syndicates. Estrada is preparing an order to
convert the task force into a multi-agency force against crime.
	   Anti-crime groups have long complained of the involvement of
police and military men in crimes, specifically ransom kidnappings,
saying this has discouraged victims from seeking help or
cooperating with authorities.
	   Estrada has urged Filipinos to help in the anti-crime drive,
promising improvements in the country's justice system to ensure
criminals would be prosecuted and jailed.
	   On Sunday, he ordered police officials to turn in a ``big fish''
among the country's criminals in 100 days to prove a crackdown on
crime, graft and drug trafficking is real.

Draft bill to extend Israeli law to settlements approved
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A parliamentary committee on Monday approved a
draft bill to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he opposed the
legislation and it appeared unlikely it would pass.
	   Under the interim peace agreements with the Palestinians, the
future of the West Bank and Gaza is to be determined in
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Successive Israeli governments have refrained from annexing the
disputed lands, hoping to leave them as bargaining chips in peace
talks with the Palestinians.
	   Israel has said it would never return to the 1967 borders and
hopes to retain a large chunk of the West Bank, including many
settlements, in a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The draft bill was submitted to parliament's Law Committee by
legislator Benny Elon of the far-right Moledet Party, which is not
a member of Netanyahu's coalition. The bill won the support of
several coalition legislators.
	   Netanyahu said it was up to the government to determine whether
to annex parts of the West Bank and Gaza. ``The government has not
made such a decision and will oppose ... any attempt by individual
legislators to do so,'' he told reporters.
	   The chairman of the Law Committee, Hanan Porath of the National
Religious Party, said the vote on the bill was timed to coincide
with U.N. deliberations this week on the status of the PLO.
	   ``I saw fit to raise the draft bill today because tomorrow the
United Nations is to discuss the proposal to raise the status of
the PLO almost to that of a state,'' Porath said.
	   At present, the PLO has observer status at the United Nations.
Israel has condemned the PLO's move to raise its status as a
violation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   Under the accords, both sides pledged not to take any steps that
would pre-empt the outcome of negotiations on a permanent
agreement.
	   Deputy Attorney General Menni Mazzuz told the Law Committee that
the draft bill also violated the peace accords.
	   Opposition lawmaker Dedi Zucker warned that if the bill becomes
law it will cause a new wave of anti-Israel feeling in the Arab
world and perhaps in the international community.
	   ``Never has parliament gone so far towards annexation of the
territories to the state of Israel,'' he said.
	   Jewish settlers currently are subject to Israeli military
government. If the bill is passed, they will be subject to Israeli
civil law. The bill still has to pass three readings. No date has
been fixed yet for the first reading.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British army engineers
erected barbed-wire fencing and dug a moat through farm fields
Saturday in hopes of deterring thousands of Protestant Orangemen
from outflanking them and marching through a hostile Catholic area
nearby. The handiwork of about 700 soldiers, using bulldozers and
diggers, underlined British authorities' apparent determination to
block Portadown's Orangemen when they try to march Sunday from the
rural Drumcree Anglican church back into the staunchly Protestant
town through its main Catholic area. Soldiers and police also
blocked every other road leading into the Catholic area with
armored cars and steel barricades. The scale of the army operation
was bigger than 1996, when the government last ordered the town's
2,000 Orangemen not to raise sectarian tensions with their annual
march. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, embarking on a visit to the province's volatile
southwest, the scene of recent fighting. The group, comprised of
Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States, Russia, Poland and
the European Union, planned to cover about 200 kilometers (120
miles) and travel through the towns of Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica and
Poljance before returning to Pristina. Some of the route touches on
territory held by the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the diplomats
apparently hoped to make contact with members of the militant
separatist organization. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ROME (AP) _ Police recovered two paintings by van Gogh and one
by Cezanne and arrested eight people, officials said Monday,
resolving an art theft that had become a major embarrassment for
Italy. The gang, who included experienced art thieves and a
security guard at the National Gallery of Modern Art, apparently
were acting on commission, authorities said. The three works were
stolen from the Rome gallery May 19. Van Gogh's ``The Gardener''
and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of Jourdan,'' an unfinished painting done
the year he died, were recovered in Rome, police said. The other
van Gogh, ``A Woman from Arles,'' was found in Turin. The van Goghs
are the only two by the artist hanging in Italian museums. The
paintings were found in two apartments, rolled up in blankets, Rome
prosecutor Italo Ormanni was quoted as saying by the AGI news
agency. (ITALY-ART THEFT)
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party claimed Monday to
have won its most dramatic state election in a decade, but its main
opponent in northern Chihuahua was refusing to concede defeat. The
Institutional Revolutionary Party said it has snatched a
governorship away from an opposition party for the first time.
``Mission completed. We have triumphed in Chihuahua,'' Patricio
Martinez of the party, known as the PRI, declared late Sunday
night. Even as Martinez led party members on a giddy horn-honking
celebration through the streets early Monday, the conservative
National Action Party insisted that its own figures showed the race
too close to call. ``The coin is still in the air,'' National
Action state chairman Guillermo Lujan told supporters gathered
before the party headquarters early Monday, with the sound of PRI
celebrations echoing in the background. He called PRI claims of
victory ``irresponsible.'' The PRI itself apparently suffered a
damaging loss in another northern state, Zacatecas, where a man
party leaders had snubbed for the gubernatorial nomination jumped
to a rival party _ and was beating his old comrades early Monday.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb accused of
orchestrating atrocities against scores of Muslims and Croats in
three notorious prison camps is going on trial in the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal's first genocide case. Milan Kovacevic, 57, is
charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for
his ``key role'' in atrocities committed in the Prijedor
municipality of northwest Bosnia in 1992. He pleaded innocent to
genocide earlier and pleaded innocent to all other war crimes
charges ahead of his trial Monday. If convicted, he faces a maximum
life sentence. His trial, the U.N. court's seventh, was initially
scheduled for May but was delayed when prosecutors filed additional
charges against him. He now faces a total of 15 counts. Prosecutors
and defense lawyers were scheduled to present their opening
arguments in the trial, which will publicize alleged atrocities in
three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps: Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)

Indonesian police wound 24 with rubber bullets at protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police fired rubber bullets
and injured 24 people Monday when separatist protesters flew a
rebel flag on an island off the western half of New Guinea,
witnesses said.
	   Residents said shots were fired on Biak Island, 3,200 kilometers
(2,000 miles) east of Jakarta, when security personnel broke up a
rally around a flagpole just after dawn.
	   For three days, the crowd had refused repeated demands by the
Indonesian officials to lower the flag of the small Free West Papua
Movement, which wants the province of Irian Jaya to break away from
Indonesia.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that 180 people were
arrested.
	   The protest in Biak was the latest in a string of
anti-Indonesian rallies in the last few days in Irian Jaya.
	   Demonstrators have clashed with security forces in Jayapura, the
provincial capital, and in other towns. Officers have shot and
killed a student. One police officer in Jayapura died in a hospital
during the weekend after being beaten by protesters, Antara
reported.
	   Biak Island is part of Irian Jaya province, which covers the
western part of New Guinea.
	   Indonesia sent troops into Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony, in
1963. Six years later, in a U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the
territory formally chose integration with Indonesia.
	   The independence movement in Irian Jaya is not as widespread as
in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, where Indonesian
soldiers shot two protesters last week.
	   However, seizing on a new climate of political reform in the
wake of the May resignation of former President Suharto, activists
in remote, mineral-rich Irian Jaya are becoming more vocal.
	   Antara quoted the provincial police commander, Brig. Gen. Hotman
Siagian, as saying protests for political reform would be
tolerated, but demonstrations for independence from Indonesia would
not be allowed.

Taiwan farmers say nuts to anti-betel campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ More than 1,000 farmers protested Monday
that campaigns to discourage the chewing of betel nuts could cost
them their livelihoods.
	   About 1,500 farmers and their supporters rallied outside the
headquarters of the Formosa Plastics Group, whose chairman Wang
Yung-ching, is funding an anti-betel education drive.
	   ``What we grow, sell and eat is completely legal. Why oppress
us?'' rally leaders shouted through bullhorns, the nut's red juice
visible at the corners of their mouths.
	   Other participants poured out bags of nuts in front of the the
Formosa Group's offices to protest the conglomerate's in-house ban
on betel nut. A foundation controlled by Wang has also launched a
``just say no to betel nut'' campaign, complementing Health
Department warnings.
	   The fruit of the betel palm, the date-sized nuts are slaked with
lime and flavoring, served with a wedge of pepper or wrapped in a
leaf, then sold at roadside stalls around the island. The nuts' red
juice and chewed up husks litter streets throughout the island.
	   While some defend betel as a mild stimulant that is uniquely
Taiwanese, others blame the nut for illnesses, including mouth
cancer. The spreading palm plantations also are blamed for water
loss and soil erosion. And the retail trade, which centers on
scantily dressed young women who run boxes of nuts to customers in
their cars, is accused of eroding public morals.
	   Campaigns against it have sent the wholesale price of the nut
into a tailspin, the Pingtung County Betel Nut Association said in
a statement. Betel generates 20 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
571 million) for southernmost Pingtung County alone, supporting
30,000 households, it said.
	   The group claimed 4.5 million of Taiwan's 21 million people chew
betel regularly.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, visiting the province's volatile southwest, the
scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   The nine-car convoy departed amid reports of fighting west of
their planned route, near Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides, sending smoke
billowing into the air. Serb sources said the attack was started by
armed Albanians opening fire on Serb families, forcing Serb
villagers, aided by police, to repel the assault.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said two Serb
policemen were wounded by ``Albanian terrorists'' at Lodja but they
were expected to survive.

China's central bank urges financial sector to solve 2000 problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central bank is urging the financial
sector to work harder to avert widespread computer crashes in the
year 2000, the Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   People's Bank of China vice governor Shang Fulin, who is
overseeing the bank's efforts to defeat the ``millennium bug,''
said finding solutions would be crucial for maintaining the
sector's smooth operations, Xinhua said.
	   The central bank has made solving the problem a priority for
this year and has set up a commission to cooperate with other
financial departments, Xinhua added.
	   The glitch threatens computers that use two digits to designate
the year. When the year changes from 99 to 00, the computers won't
know if it's 2000 or 1900, which could cause them to go haywire or
shut down.
	   Zhang Qi, a Ministry of Information Industry official in charge
of the problem, was previously quoted by state media as saying
China's banks, railways and airlines were doing a good job of
tackling the problem, but that overall China was ill-prepared.
	   In a worldwide assessment, the investment corporation Merrill
Lynch recently reported that China's smaller banks and securities
firms were areas of greatest concern. They were looking to
government agencies for leadership and taking little or no
initiative, it said.

and its affiliates before serving 18 years as Bank Negara governor,
from 1962 to 1980.
	   His sister, Dr. Siti Hasmah, is the wife of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.

Selangor and another brother, Hashim Mohamed Ali, a former Defense
Forces chief, is the executive chairman of Sukom 98 Sdn Bhd, the
company organizing the 16th Commonwealth Games here in September,
Bernama news agency said.

the other an architect. His wife died in 1996.

Turkish foreign minister flies to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem flew to
Israel on Monday for a four-day visit to expand ties between the
two countries. He will also visit the Palestinian territories.
	   ``During my visit to Israel and Palestine, we will try to
improve bilateral relations and the Middle East peace process,''
Cem said before his departure.
	   While developing its ties with Israel, Turkey also gives strong
support to the Palestinian struggle. It was the first Muslim state
to recognize the Jewish state and also one of the first to
recognize Palestinian self-rule.
	   After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Cem is scheduled to meet Palestinian officials on Wednesday.
	   Ties between Turkey and Israel have been rapidly developing
since they signed a series of military agreements in 1996.
	   Iran and Arab nations have criticized the relationship, saying
it is a threat to peace and security in the region.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troy Neel of the Orix BlueWave received a severe
warning Monday for charging toward a pitcher who hit him with a
pitch in a game last week.
	   Pacific League President Kazuo Harano did not fine Neel, but
told the former Oakland Athletics player he must not repeat such
``violent'' acts.
	   Last Friday, Neel was ejected in the seventh inning after
charging toward Masaki Maki of the Kintetsu Buffaloes. Teammates

Family of athlete killed in bridge collapse demands inquiry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The family of an Australian athlete
killed when an Israeli footbridge collapsed last summer demanded
Monday that an independent parliamentary investigation be
conducted.
	   Yetty Bennet, 50, was one of four Australians who died after the
bridge leading to the opening ceremonies of the Maccabiah Games
collapsed last July 14, plunging dozens of team members into the
polluted Yarkon River below.
	   On Monday, Jeany and Andrew Simons, Bennet's sister and
brother-in-law, attended the trial of five defendants charged with
negligent homicide and building without proper permits in the case.
	   The couple is in Israel to talk with lawyers about filing a
lawsuit in the case, and to meet with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman on Thursday. Dozens of lawsuits are expected to be filed by
victims' families.
	   ``The only way to resolve this matter is by holding a truly
independent inquiry,'' Andrew Simons said. ``Justice is being done
in court, but we want to ensure that such a disaster will be
avoided in the future.''
	   Jeany Simons wiped away tears as she spoke to reporters after
the court hearing about her sister, a ten-pin bowler from Sydney,
and how the trip to Israel had been her dream.
	   ``We are angry because we want this commission of inquiry,''
Mrs. Simons said.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer visited Israel last
month and said Israel did not appear to be moving toward
establishing an independent inquiry.
	   A government-appointed panel of engineers looked into the cause
of the collapse last year and issued a scathing report blaming the
builders and organizers. A police investigation led to the trial in
Tel Aviv Magistrates Court of two contractors, the engineer who
designed the bridge, the director of the games and the chairman of
the Maccabiah organizing committee.
	   Netanyahu, who is scheduled to travel to Australia next month,
promised Downer he would finish looking into the matter before he
arrived, and said Israel wanted to help the families of the victims
as much as possible.
	   On Monday, two experts testified about pollution in the Yarkon
River, which has been blamed for the deaths of two athletes several
weeks after the bridge collapse.
	   Dr. Yishayahu Bar-Or, head of the Environment Ministry's water
and rivers department, said he conducted extensive biological and
chemical tests on the river's water in the weeks and months that
followed the disaster.
	   Bar-Or said he found ``a long list of pollutants,'' including
oils, fertilizers and industrial wastes, mostly from water
treatment plants at towns upriver from the bridge collapse site,
and a pesticide that had been sprayed on the river the day before
the collapse.
	   But Bar-Or said he was unable to identify the specific pollutant
that caused the victims' sicknesses.
	   And he said the Yarkon was ``not the most polluted river in
Israel. It's about average for Israel,'' he said.
	   Asked by a defense lawyer for the bridge engineer why no signs
were posted warning that the river was polluted, Bar-On said, ``It
is common knowledge that the river is not fit for swimming. Are
there signs by the sea saying it is not drinking water?''
	   The court also heard testimony from David Pergament, manager of
the Yarkon River Authority.

<SLUG> EU takes France to court over ozone monitoring, warns Belgium </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
take France to court fo violating EU rules on air pollution.
	   The EU Commission also issued separate warnings to France and
Belgium over their laws on, respectively, waste policy and
genetically-modified organisms.
	   ``Despite reminders, France has failed to provide the Commission
with certain necessary information on French ozone monitoring,''
the EU executive body said in a statement.
	   Under EU rules, EU countries must warn the public if ozone
concentrations reach high levels and provide the Commission with
information on monitoring stations, methods and results.
	   The Commission said it did not receive the necessary information
from France, which blamed data collection problems, and decided to
take the matter to the European Court of Justice.
	   The Commission also sent France a warning for not adopting EU
legislation on waste policy that should have been integrated into
national law five years ago.
	   Belgium received a warning for its failure to integrate EU
environmental safety norms into national legislation on
genetically-modified organisms.
	   Under EU procedure, Belgium and France now have two months to
update their laws on waste policy and genetically-modified
organisms.

with certain necessary information on French ozone monitoring,''
the EU executive body said in a statement.
	   Under EU rules, EU countries must warn the public if ozone
concentrations reach high levels and provide the Commission with
information on monitoring stations, methods and results.
	   The Commission said it did not receive the necessary information
from France, which blamed data collection problems, and decided to
take the matter to the European Court of Justice.
	   The Commission also sent France a warning for not adopting EU
legislation on waste policy that should have been integrated into
national law five years ago.
	   Belgium received a warning for its failure to integrate EU
environmental safety norms into national legislation on
genetically-modified organisms.
	   Under EU procedure, Belgium and France now have two months to
update their laws on waste policy and genetically-modified
organisms.

Italian transport workers on strike as holidays begin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gas station workers will walk off the job for three
days starting Tuesday, launching a series of transport strikes that
threaten to disrupt travel up and down Italy.
	   Gas stations plan to shut down from 7:30 p.m. Tuesday to 7 a.m.
Saturday. The protest follows the government's announcement of
plans to require the closing of 7,000 gas stations.
	   Train station masters called a 48-hour nationwide strike
beginning July 13 at 9 p.m, as well as an eight-hour strike July
23.
	   Dozens of flights are expected to be cancelled during a
nationwide strike by air traffic controllers July 14.
	   On Thursday, striking airport workers will disrupt flights to
and from the airport of Brindisi, in southern Italy.
	   Ferries departing from the port of Civitavecchia, north of Rome,
for the island of Sardinia will be delayed by eight-hours July 14
due to a strike by ferry personnel. The workers plan another strike
July 14.
	   Transport workers have long been in dispute with management over
plans to restructure, including new work schedules and duties.

Tobacco companies fight British anti-smoking report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four tobacco companies won clearance Monday to
fight back against an official British report calling for bans on
tobacco advertising and smoking in public places.
	   A High Court judge agreed the report from the Scientific
Committee on Tobacco and Health could inflict ``commercial damage''
on the tobacco companies, and they should have been given a chance
to comment before the document was published in March.
	   The four companies, British American Tobacco, Gallaher, Imperial
and Rothmans, went to court and got permission to seek an order
quashing the report.
	   The tobacco companies, who control 90 percent of Britain's
cigarette market, also want a court order that would stop the
government from taking the report into account when considering new
smoking and health laws.
	   The tobacco companies complained that the report unfairly took
the point of view that they are targeting children as new smokers
to replace older customers who die of cancer and other
smoking-related disease.
	   The judge, Sir Alan George Moses, said that parts of the
anti-smoking report appeared to be an unbalanced attack on the
``commercial morality'' of the big tobacco companies.
	   The judge said that the scientific committee that made the
anti-smoking report should either have sought comment from the
tobacco companies, or left some critical material out of the
report.
	   ``After all, it was intended to be a scientifically rigorous
report,'' the judge said. ``Arguably there was not much scientific
rigor about the passages I have quoted.''
	   Dr. Chris Proctor, head of science and regulation for British
American Tobacco, said outside the courthouse that the idea of
tobacco companies targeting children was ``absolutely outrageous.''
	   ``Children should not smoke,'' Proctor said. ``We want to work
with the government to ensure kids are not smoking.''

Transport Minister: New Kuala Lumpur airport's problems solved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The problems at Kuala Lumpur's new
airport have been solved, and officials now are trying to send
misplaced luggage on to its owners, the national news agency
reported Monday.
	   The 9 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.25 billion) airport opened last
Tuesday, and immediately was plagued by computer problems blamed on
faulty telephone cables. Check-in computers stopped, some
passengers waited up to four hours for their bags, and others were
reported stuck aboard their planes for hours while waiting for gate
assignments.
	   Bernama news agency quoted Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik as
saying Monday, ``All the teething problems faced by (the airport)
during the last few days, especially the check-in and
baggage-handling operations, had been resolved and passengers whom
I met today are smiling and congratulating Malaysia Airlines and
Malaysia Airports for their excellent service.''
	   It said efforts were being made to send luggage to passengers
whose planes left without their bags because of the computer
problems.
	   Ling said, ``The cargo-handling activities are back to normal
and most of the backlog cases and congestion due to several flight
delays on Saturday had been cleared.''
	   The airport had not been accepting perishable goods since
Saturday, when several flight delays caused congestion and some
goods were misplaced.
	   Bernama quoted Ling as saying that as of Tuesday, exporters
could resume making their bookings for perishable goods such as
fruit, flowers and fish.

Abkhazian separatists defy Georgia in bid to control sea border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia
has sent naval boats to patrol its Black Sea coast in defiance of
the government's plan to take over control of the shoreline.
	   Russia has been patrolling Georgia's coast since 1994, the same
year Moscow deployed peacekeepers to separate Georgian government
troops and Abkhazian separatist forces following a 13-month war.
	   Russia and Georgia agreed last month that Georgian border guards
would take over coastal patrols starting July 16.
	   But Abkhazia has opposed the move, which would strengthen the
Georgian government's control over the region, tighten an embargo
on arms deliveries to separatists, and possibly hurt trade.
	   A spokesman for the Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav
Ardzinba said Monday that Abkhazian boats began patrolling the
coast last Wednesday and would fully take charge once Russian
border guards withdraw.
	   ``If Georgian border guards try to assume control over the
Abkhazian sea border, hostilities will erupt,'' Ardzinba's
spokesman Astamur Taniya said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Despite the presence of Russian peacekee there have been
sporadic clashes since the end of the 1992-93 war. Dozens of people
were killed during fighting in May between Abkhazian separatists
and militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   Efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict have
remained stalled.

Diana's island also burial site for family pets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The island where Princess Diana is buried was also
a cemetery for family pets, including her favorite cat, Marmalade.
	   The wooded island, which was consecrated by the Bishop of
Peterborough before Diana's burial Sept. 6, is on an ornamental
lake on the Althorp estate, ancestral home of her Spencer family.
	   The island ``at one time'' was a burial site for pets, and there
are records of four or five of them, including Marmalade, said
Shelley-Anne Claircourt, spokeswoman for Diana's brother Earl
Spencer.
	   Ms. Claircourt confirmed the report in the Monday edition of The
Mirror newspaper that pets were buried on the island. It quoted
former Althrop housekeeper Maudie Pendrey as saying, ``I cannot
believe Earl Spencer could be so heartless as to bury his sister in
a dog burial ground. It is a desecration.''
	   The earl has opened Althorp to the paying public for two months
and has built a museum in his sister's memory. Visitors are not
allowed to go to the island, but can see it from the lakeside.

Stewart, 151 not out continues to defy the Proteas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart batted
defiantly against the odds Monday, frustrating South Africa's bid
for victory in the third cricket test at Old Trafford.
	   South Africa's birthday boy Makhaya Ntini took an important
catch to remove Mike Atherton (89) in the morning session but
Stewart remained unbeaten on 151 at lunch.
	   At 278 for three at lunch, England was still 91 runs behind
South Africa's first innings total of 552 with two sessions to bat.
	   But the home side's chances of salvaging a draw are increasing
the longer Stewart stays at the crease.
	   He has so far batted for 385 minutes and hit 23 boundaries.
	   Stewart and Mark Ramprakash, 16 not out, continued England's
stubborn resistance after Mike Atherton was dismissed in the first
hour.
	   Atherton, who kept captain Stewart company in a 237-run third
wicket stand, hooked medium paceman Kallis and Ntini took an
outstanding diving catch at long leg.
	   The third wicket pair was finally separated after a partnership
lasting almost five and half hours _ encompassing almost the entire
fourth day of the test.
	   England, following-on after being dismissed for 183 in its first
innings, resumed at 211 for two on Monday and continued to delay
South Africa's push for a win and a 2-0 lead in the five match
series.
	   Atherton, beaten in successive Allan Donald overs, added just
eight to his overnight 81 in an extra 56 minutes at the crease.
	   South Africa's medium paceman Lance Klusener (ankle sprain) has
managed just three overs, while Donald hobbled around in his spell
before lunch.
	   Kallis has shouldered most of the responsibility and has picked
up 2-60 in 31 overs.

More than 2,400 policemen and soldiers implicated in crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 2,400 Philippine soldiers
and policemen have been implicated in various crimes, including
kidnapping, drug trafficking and gun smuggling, in the last three
years, officials said Monday.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he has ordered police to identify,
investigate and charge the soldiers and policemen linked to crimes,
whose names were compiled by a group of intelligence agents.
	   Estrada, who was sworn into office last week, has pledged to
make crime-busting a cornerstone of his six-year administration.
	   The former movie actor said he would be his own secretary of
interior and local government, in charge of the national police, to
personally supervise an anti-crime and -graft drive until most
criminals were driven ``to extinction.''
	   ``They still have time to change their mind,'' Estrada said in a
statement warning crime gangs.
	   A report by a presidential task force, composed mostly of
military intelligence agents, showed more than 1,800 of the
policemen and soldiers implicated in crimes were in active service,
a Manila newspaper reported.
	   The rest were dismissed or have abandoned their jobs, the report
said.
	   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, organized the task force in
1995 to covertly identify police and military men involved in crime
or coddling crime syndicates. Estrada is preparing an order to
convert the task force into a multi-agency force against crime.
	   Anti-crime groups have long complained of the involvement of
police and military men in crimes, specifically ransom kidnappings,
saying this has discouraged victims from seeking help or
cooperating with authorities.
	   Estrada has urged Filipinos to help in the anti-crime drive,
promising improvements in the country's justice system to ensure
criminals would be prosecuted and jailed.
	   On Sunday, he ordered police officials to turn in a ``big fish''
among the country's criminals in 100 days to prove a crackdown on
crime, graft and drug trafficking is real.

Observer mission to cut through tense southwest Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two policemen reported wounded at Lodja, comments
from Russian diplomat on observer team, fighting. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On the heels of inconclusive
negotiations, diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease
Kosovo's violence, visiting the province's volatile southwest, the
scene of recent fighting.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to cover
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and travel through the towns of
Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   The nine-car convoy departed amid reports of fighting west of
their planned route, near Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides, sending smoke
billowing into the air. Serb sources said the attack was started by
armed Albanians opening fire on Serb families, forcing Serb
villagers, aided by police, to repel the assault.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said two Serb
policemen were wounded by ``Albanian terrorists'' at Lodja but they
were expected to survive.
	   Some of the route of the observer mission touches on territory
held by the Kosovo Liberation Army. A participant, Richard Miles,
the U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade, said the observers hoped to
make contact with the militant separatist organization on the road
from Srbica to Klina.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip, we have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' he told reporters on departure. ``But
towards the end of the week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''
	   Russian Ambassador Yuri Kotov said the observer mission would be
a ``stabilizing factor'' in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of the province,
which Serbs regard as their historic heartland.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke spent the weekend shuttling between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
trying to lay the ground work for talks between the Yugoslav
government and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   In Pristina Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met with representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian
parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks. The group is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.

Firefighters control blazes around Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters managed Monday to put out
most of the more than 180 brush and forest fires that raged around
Greece, leaving two people dead and dozens of houses destroyed.
	   Investigators, meanwhile, expanded probes into whether some of
the blazes were deliberately set.
	   More than two-thirds of the fires began within an hour of each
other Saturday. Hot, dry winds and temperatures above 38 degrees
Celsius (100 F) helped spread the flames that consumed thousands of
acres (hectares) of woods and grasslands.
	   In the past, fires have been set by people hoping to dodge
legislation that forbids building in forest areas. But authorities
have also raised speculation that organized arsonists could have
contributed to the rash of weekend fires.
	   Authorities have so far detained four people in connection with
the fires.
	   One man was arrested near the town of Volos, 160 kilometers (100
miles) northwest of Athens, on charges of arson after he was seen
setting fire to dried grass with a lighter, police added.
	   Another man has been accused of negligence after he lost control
of a fire he started to burn dead leaves and wood in Kranidi, about
85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   A mayor and a community leader in the area of Salonica in
northern Greece were also arrested after fires allegedly spread to
forest areas from local rubbish dump sites. The two have been
charged with failing to provide adequate fire control measures at
the sites.
	   Authorities were also examining part of a clock found in one of
the areas burn to determine whether it could have been used in a
firebomb, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   One woman died on Saturday while trying to escape from a burning
house on the island of Salamina west of Athens. An 80-year-old man
also died when he became trapped in his home on the island of Evia,
just north of the capital.
	   More than 70 homes around the country were completely destroyed
or suffered serious damage in the fires. Officials on Monday were
still evaluating the extent of damage caused by the blazes.
	   Summer brush fires are common during the dry and hot Greek
summers, but the weekend blazes far surpassed the usual number and
were fanned by unusual strong winds.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Monday
marked the anniversary of the coup that ousted him as co-premier
with religious observances for members of his party who died in the
political violence.
	   Ranariddh, speaking at the headquarters of his FUNCINPEC party,
vowed that he would bring to justice those responsible for the
killings of scores of his partisans if he regains power in
Cambodia's July 26 elections.
	   He said, however, that his party would not resort to violence to
achieve its aims, regardless of whether it wins or loses.
	   ``We have to learn from the lessons of the past,'' he said.
``FUNCINPEC has committed itself not to use any force like the
coup, which is illegal. We will not use any force to resolve any
problems.''
	   Some 700 people, including 130 elderly white-robed nuns with
shaven heads, attended the opening of a two-day prayer ceremony at
his party headquarters, one of the focal points of fighting during
the coup.
	   Another prominent opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, also held a
prayer ceremony Monday for the victims of last year's coup, which
killed and injured hundreds of civilians caught in the cross fire
of two days of heavy fighting.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are the leading candidates challenging
Hun Sen, who was Ranariddh's co-premier before ousting him. One
reason for Hun Sen to hold the election is to try to restore his
legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Several
donor countries cut off assistance to Cambodia to show their
disapproval of the takeover.
	   At Sam Rainsy Party headquarters, 100 Buddhist monks chanted for
peace and tossed jasmine petals from silver platters on the ground.
Incense was burned in memory of the dead.
	   ``This ceremony is for the families of victims and a celebration
for the souls of our dead compatriots who suffered during the July
5-6 coup,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``A lot of people suffered damage to
their property because of these brutal events.''
	   Addressing a crowd of about 500, Sam Rainsy refrained from
pointing fingers at those responsible, saying that now is the time
for peace.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored polls guarded by thousands of
peacekeeping troops in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a
tense coalition by threatening civil war.
	   Four years of tension erupted in fighting between their armed
factions last year. Tanks, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic weapons fire ripped through Phnom Penh's streets.
	   After Ranariddh's faction was routed, Hun Sen's victorious
troops went on a looting rampage. The airport, hospitals,
factories, warehouses, businesses and homes were stripped bare.
	   The prince, Sam Rainsy and other opponents were driven into
exile but were eventually allowed by Hun Sen to return _ the prince
only after a show trial where he was found guilty of plotting his
own coup with former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   As many as 100 of Ranariddh's supporters were killed in the
months following the coup, according to human rights workers. No
one has ever been arrested.
	   Several other political killings linked to the election campaign
have also gone unpunished.
	   Hun Sen has been accused of using violence and fear to terrorize
his opponents. The electoral bodies are packed with his supporters
and rival parties have little access to the vital broadcast media.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats gave negotiations a rest
and toured a Kosovo battle ground on Monday. After visiting a
devastated village that sparked the present violence, they pledged
many more observer missions.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, covered about 200
kilometers (120 miles) and traveled through the towns of Klina,
Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Richard Miles, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade who
participated in the monitoring mission, said the diplomats were
trying to find out ``who can control the guys with the guns _ the
KLA.''
	   He was referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which refuses to
take orders from Kosovo Albanian political leaders in its quest win
independence for the province through force. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of the Serbian province.
	   In a symbolic gesture, the group visited Donji Prekaz, site of
the Serb police crackdown in March that has resulted in the upswing
in violence and almost daily battles between Serb forces and
separatist ethnic Albanians.
	   At the village, in the Drenica region 30 kilometers (20 miles)
southwest of Pristina, the diplomats toured the ruins of houses
left in ruins by the Serb hunt for guerillas that killed 80 ethnic
Albanians, among them women and children.
	   The nine-car convoy moved unimpeded through three heavily
fortified Serb police checkpoints on its journey. It departed amid
reports of fighting west of their planned route, near Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides, sending smoke
billowing into the air. Serb sources said the attack was started by
armed Albanians opening fire on Serb families, forcing Serb
villagers, aided by police, to repel the assault.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said two Serb
policemen were wounded by ``Albanian terrorists'' at Lodja but they
were expected to survive.
	   In evidence of violence elsewhere, the bodies of three men _
ethnic Albanians last seen going into their cornfields Sunday _
were discovered Monday on the road between Prizren and Djakovica,
close to the southwest border of Kosovo and Djakovica.
	   Some of the diplomats' route touched on territory held by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and the diplomats hoped to make contact
with members of the militant separatist organization. But none were
sighted.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip, we have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' Miles told reporters on departure. ``But
towards the end of the week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He suggested Monday's tour was a dry run, on return to Pristina,
capital of the Serbian province, saying: ``The real patrolling will
start Thursday, and there will be many patrols every day.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''
	   Russian Ambassador Yuri Kotov said the observer mission would be
a ``stabilizing factor'' in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
	   Monday's mission followed a weekend of shuttling between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. He was trying to lay the groundwork
for talks between the Yugoslav government and leaders of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority.
	   After meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke said in Belgrade late Sunday that the past three days in
the region had been ``very useful in clarifying many issues.''
	   Milosevic approved the diplomats' visits Monday under an
agreement last month with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   In Pristina Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met with representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian
parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.
	   The U.S. and Russian mediators are encouraging the Albanians to
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Milosevic over the future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989.
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.

Bankrupt Kia Motors to be put for international bidding next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrests of two former Kia executives &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., South
Korea's third largest automaker, will be put up for international
auction next week, its main creditor bank said Monday.
	   Also Monday, two former top Kia executives were arrested on
charges of altering the car maker's account documents to help it
borrow money from banks.
	   The state-run Korea Development Bank, which has nearly dlrs 1
billion in non-performing loans to Kia, said it will call for bids
on July 15.
	   The successful bidder will be chosen by the end of August, it
said.
	   Daewoo Motors Co., South Korea's second largest auto company,
said it will form a consortium with industry leader Hyundai Motors
Co. to bid for Kia. Another possible bidder is Ford Motors Co. of
the United States, which already owns l6.9 percent of Kia.
	   Kia is under court receivership after going bankrupt almost a
year ago. It produced 780,000 cars in 1997.
	   Local media, quoting unidentified sources, said the government
will offer various financial incentives to bidders, including a 20
percent reduction in Kia's debts.
	   The move to sell Kia is the latest in the government's efforts
to restructure the nation's economy under the terms of a dlrs 58
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Prosecutors charged Monday that Park Jae-hyuk, a former Kia
president, and his deputy, Han Seung-joon, altered documents to
show that the auto company was making profits while it actually had
kept losing money since 1991.
	   Using the forged documents, the two obtained dlrs 1.29 billion
in loans from several commercial banks between 1995 and 1997,
prosecutors said.
	   The arrests were the latest development in a government probe of
what led to South Korea's financial crisis late last year, forcing
the country to accept the IMF's bailout package.
	   Critics have said South Korea's troubles spun out of control
when the government failed to unload Kia and other heavily indebted
companies and banks quickly.
	   Former Kia chairman Kim Sun-hong was arrested in May on charges
of embezzling dlrs 37 million. Kim was charged with using some of
the money to bribe politicians so he could take out bank loans and
keep the company afloat.

World Cup: France desperately seeking goals against Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Why can't France score anymore?
The question was on everybody's lips Monday as the host nation
geared up for its World Cup semifinal clash with Croatia for the
berth in the trophy match.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet even made a special video to show the way to
the net, and top scorer Youri Djorkaeff is already psyching himself
up and promising a hopeful nation he will score in Wednesday's
match at the Stade de France.
	   ``I know I will score. I feel I will score against Croatia,'' he
said Monday. Djorkaeff has scored 18 goals so far for France in
internationals, but has only one penalty goal in five World Cup
games so far.
	   After slotting nine goals in its first 236 minutes of World Cup
action, France was limited to just one in the last 268 minutes as
it struggled to a Golden Goal injury time 1-0 win against Paraguay
and a 0-0 penalty shootout victory over Italy in the quarterfinals.
	   ``It certainly weighs on us. It could even have been fatal,''
said French coach Aime Jacquet, remembering how close France was to
elimination in the penalty shootout against Italy.
	   So to lift the morale of the troops, Jacquet prepared a special
video with all the great opportunities the French created during
the quarterfinal. ``It is to reassure the players,'' Jacquet said.
The lack of the final stab to finish off the work just depended on
``coolbloodedness,'' he said.
	   France is already preparing the nation that its offensive
impotence might last through the last two games. But with an
iron-fisted defense that allowed only one penalty goal in five
matches, it might be enough to win the Cup.
	   ``It doesn't matter if I don't score. The most important is the
defense and the title,'' said Stephane Guivarc'h, the French league
top scorer for the past two seasons, who hasn't scored a single
goal here.
	   Fortunately, France is getting over the injury worries that have
hit its strike force. Three-goal winger Thierry Henry, who came on
only as a late substitute against Italy because of an ankle sprain,
is fully fit again.
	   And even Christophe Dugarry, who scored France's World Cup
opener before he was sidelined with a torn hamstring, has resumed
full training sessions and will be ready as a substitute on
Wednesday.
	   France's goal drought is not because of lack of intention.
	   Over the wings and through the center when playmaker Zinedine
Zidane was playing, Les Bleus have created wave upon wave of
attack.
	   But when the final shot had to come, players stalled, miscued
their shot, hit the post or failed to show that bit of poise that
marks the true World Cup striker.
	   ``It's an area you really cannot work on,'' said captain Didier
Deschamps.
	   A coach either has a Dennis Bergkamp or Ronaldo to work with or
a Guivarc'h or Dugarry.
	   ``We won't win the semifinal 5-0, that's for sure,'' said
Deschamps.
	   Djorkaeff said that perhaps the players were looking too much
for a work of art to finish off great preparation.
	   ``Maybe we are looking too much for perfection,'' he said.
	   And whatever, goals are beside the point. Just look at France's
Just Fontaine, still the World Cup top scorer of all time with 13
goals when Les Bleus reached the semifinals in 1958.
	   ``Maybe we should ask Just Fontaine if he would have preferred
to have played the final instead,'' said Djorkaeff.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will import goods worth dlrs 50
million from Lebanon under the current phase of its oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations, Baghdad newspapers reported Monday.
	   They said the trade deal was signed late Sunday following a
visit to Baghdad by Lebanon's Agriculture Minister Shawqi Fakhouri.
	   The papers quoted Fakhouri as saying that Lebanon will export
foodstuffs to Iraq, as well as medicines and industrial appliances.
He said Lebanon also planned to hold a trade fair in Baghdad later
this year.
	   There are no diplomatic ties between the two countries. They
were severed in 1994 over the killing of an Iraqi dissident in
Beirut.
	   U.N. figures show that Lebanon has shipped dlrs 5 million of
goods to Iraq since the start of the oil deal in December 1996.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lower government spending and increased
revenues due to better tax collection have slashed the budget
deficit in the first half of the year, State Minister for Finance
Fuad Saniora said in remarks published Monday.
	   He said the budget deficit, which the government forecast at 42
percent, had dropped to 35 percent in the first six months of the
year, compared to 59.5 percent last year.
	   ``This improvement has resulted from two things: a reduction in
(government) spending and a better tax collection,'' An-Nahar and
other dailies quoted Saniora as saying.
	   The government has launched a multibillion dollar program to
rebuild the country from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil
war. The program is mostly being financed by foreign loans and
grants.
 &UR; ___
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar National Hotels Company on Monday
signed a dlrs 100 million loan agreement with several banks to
finance a new hotel, the company's director said.
	   The loan agreement to construct the Ritz Carlton Hotel was
signed with Qatar National Bank, British Bank, Emirates
International Bank, Dubai National Bank and Arab Investment
Company.
	   The five-star hotel in the capital Doha will have 350 rooms in
addition to five restaurants, a business center, an entertainment
complex and outside catering services.
	   Construction of the hotel, which will cost a total of dlrs 123
million, will be completed by the end of 2000.
	   Energy-rich Qatar has four five-star hotels with a total of
1,300 rooms.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi dinar declined by 1.5 per cent
Monday following a government decision to scrap controls on the
import of foreign goods into the country.
	   The currency slid to 1,600 to the dollar. It was trading at
1,575 last weekend.
	   Baghdad traders said the latest fall is partly attributed to a
decree by the Revolutionary Command Council, the country's highest
legislative and executive body, to abolish restrictions on the
circulation and import of a long list of foreign commodities.
	   The volatile currency has been under pressure since late last
month owing to tension over U.N. inspections and the government's
huge bailout for farmers.
	   The decline in the dinar's value is bound to boost prices of
most commodities in the market, which are linked to the
dinar-dollar ratio.
	   Before the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, the dinar was officially
worth more than 3 dollars. On the open market one dinar fetched one
dollar.

Swiss racing car driver and maker Peter Monteverdi dies at 64
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BINNINGEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Former racing car driver and
luxury sports car maker Peter Monteverdi, who built and drove
Switzerland's only Formula One car, has died, his business partner
said Monday. He was 64.
	   He achieved 10th place in the Grand Prix at Solitude in Germany
in 1961 with the car, powered by a Porsche engine and had a top
speed of 260 kilometers per hour (162 mph).
	   Monteverdi gave up motor racing after he and the car were
involved in a serious accident at the Hockenheim circuit in Germany
the same year.
	   He went on to design and build a range of exclusive high-speed
cars driven by celebrities including the Shah of Iran.
	   Monteverdi died of cancer at his home in Binningen on Saturday,
his long-time friend and business partner Paul Berger said.
	   Born in Binningen, where his father owned a small car repair
shop, in 1934, Monteverdi developed an enthusiasm for cars at an
early age, according to a biography produced by his company.
	   At the age of 17, Monteverdi built his first car, the Monteverdi
Special, using the wreck of a Fiat vehicle.
	   In 1956, after his father died, Monteverdi took over the family
car repair shop and began designing and building racing cars.
	   His first models, Formula Junior cars, were sold in many
countries, the biography said.
	   After quitting Formula One, Monteverdi developed the business in
exclusive luxury cars, producing a range of high-speed coupes,
convertibles and limousines.
	   The Monteverdi High Speed was displayed at the Frankfurt car
show in the fall of 1967.
	   Following the energy crisis of 1973, he decided to switch to
developing luxury four-wheel drive machines, among them the Sahara
and Safari.
	   Monteverdi was involved in designing a version of British
Leyland's Range Rover.
	   In 1982, Monteverdi's firm stopped production and the Binningen
factory was converted into a museum to hold his collection of 70-80
cars, claimed to be Switzerland's largest.
	   Monteverdi was unmarried, without children. Funeral arrangements
have not yet been finalized.

Ukraine's mines claim 219 lives in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Mining accidents claimed the lives of 219
workers in Ukraine during the first half of the year, an official
said Monday.
	   Viktor Kyrylenko of the State Committee for Work Safety blamed
the high number of deaths on a neglect of safety rules and outdated
equipment.
	   During the same period last year, 152 miners lost their lives,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   In the worst single coal mine accident since Ukraine gained
independence in 1991, 63 workers were killed in April in a methane
gas explosion at a mine in the eastern region of Donetsk.

Netanyahu's credibility questioned over Gaza decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Hebron and BC-Israel-Settlements

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed
reports Monday that he misled Cabinet ministers about the
government's decision to back down in a recent standoff with the
Palestinians over the use of a Gaza Strip road.
	   Netanyahu's credibility has been questioned repeatedly by
political foes and allies alike, most recently by the Israeli
president and the armed forces chief of staff.
	   At issue in the latest dispute was a 12-hour standoff last week
in which armed Israeli and Palestinian troops faced each other in a
dispute over the use of a coastal road Israel says it controls.
	   In the end, Israeli troops allowed a Palestinian convoy to drive
along the road after initially having refused to let it through.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet in Sunday's meeting that he was glad
the showdown had ended peacefully.
	   However, Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon told the
ministers that Netanyahu had complained to him in an earlier phone
conversation that he had not been informed about the decision to
let the vehicles pass and that he was displeased with the terms of
the deal, the Haaretz newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu was evasive Monday when asked about who was involved
in the decision to let the Palestinian convoy pass. He said his two
main objectives were to avoid bloodshed and to make sure the road
would not be opened to Palestinians on a permanent basis.
	   ``The important thing is not the details of how it was achieved,
but that my two goals were realized,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   In other developments Monday:
	   _ Parliament's Law Committee adopted a draft bill to annex the
Jewish settlements of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However,
Netanyahu said he opposed the legislation, and coalition chairman
Meir Shetreet said there was no chance the bill would pass once it
is presented to parliament for a vote.
	   Under the interim peace agreements with the Palestinians, the
future of the West Bank and Gaza is to be determined in
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   _ A 16 year-old Jewish settler was arrested on suspicion that he
and two others smashed the windows of Arab-owned cars in the tense,
divided West Bank city of Hebron over the weekend.

President tells U.S. envoy: No need to negotiate with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui told Washington's
top liaison official Tuesday that the United States should not
consult Beijing when discussing Taiwan's future.
	   In talks with envoy Richard Bush, Lee insisted on the sovereign
status of the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name.
	   ``In the future, your country should negotiate directly with us
about any matters involving Taiwan,'' Lee said. ``You don't have to
and should not hold bilateral talks with the Chinese communists''
about Taiwan.
	   ``I am determined to push for resumption of talks across the
Taiwan Strait, and the determination has never wavered or
changed,'' a Presidential Office statement quoted Lee as saying.
	   Bush is the U.S.-based chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which handles relations in the absence of diplomatic ties.
He arrived Saturday to meet officials and ease their concerns about
President Bill Clinton's recent summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
	   Bush reassured Lee the Clinton-Jiang summit had not altered U.S.
commitments to Taiwan, including U.S. sales of defensive military
weapons to the island, the presidential statement said.
	   Clinton reiterated in China that the United States will not
support Taiwan's independence or its entry into international
organizations, the first public pledge by a U.S. president of
Washington's longstanding one-China policy.
	   Although Clinton also urged China to resolve its differences
with Taiwan by peaceful means, Taiwan feared Clinton's public
pledges could limit Taiwan's moves to raise its international
profile.
	   Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949,
when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost a civil war to Communist
forces on the mainland and fled to this island.
	   The two sides recently have moved slowly toward resuming the
dialogue that was frozen three years ago.
	   In a separate meeting, Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling
alerted Bush to the potential danger of military imbalance across
the Taiwan Strait because Beijing is acquiring more advanced
weapons, a government statement said.
	   Chiang said Taiwan must upgrade its defensive weaponry to cope
with the situation and hopes to bolster military cooperation with
the United States, it added.
	   As Taiwan's main weapons supplier, the United States has sold
Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters. But Taiwan fears China's acquisition
of several Kilo submarines from Russia has given it sea
superiority, and it has requested U.S. sales of anti-submarine
warfare planes.
	   Washington, which recognizes Beijing, maintains close unofficial
ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to give Taiwan a credible
defense against China. But Taiwanese academics say that as
Washington nudges closer toward Beijing, it may stop selling
large-scale advanced weapons to Taiwan.

French lawmakers meet to discuss future of New Caledonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Lawmakers were meeting Monday to give
final ratification to an agreement that could lead to complete
independence for the French territory of New Caledonia.
	   Deputies and senators meeting in Versailles, south of Paris,
were expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the so-called
Noumea agreement, reached April 21.
	   The agreement, named after the territory's capital, provides for
a 20-year transition period toward independence. It already has won
almost unanimous backing in both the French National Assembly and
Senate.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, a referendum will be held in
December on a transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the
archipelago, to be followed in 2018 by a second referendum on
self-determination.
	   The result of Monday's vote was expected by about 6:00 p.m.
(1600GMT).
	   France views New Caledonia as a strategic political and economic
asset in the Pacific. Controlled by France for 150 years, the
territory has about 30 percent of the world's nickel reserves.
	   It periodically has erupted in violence between pro-independence
natives and anti-independence settlers originally from France.
	   The agreement was signed in Noumea by French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, officials from the main pro-independence party, and
French settlers who have opposed self-rule.

French holders of czarist bonds could be compensated next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French holders of czarist bonds that lost all value
after the 1917 Russian revolution could be compensated as early as
next year, the French Finance Ministry said Monday.
	   The ministry announced that French citizens could submit
applications immediately to receive an indemnity for the bonds that
became worthless when the Bolsheviks seized power.
	   Before the revolution, the czarist government regularly issued
bonds on stock markets across Europe as a way of financing the
country's economic development.
	   Hundreds of thousands of small French investors bought the
Russian government bonds, and many were driven to ruin or even
suicide when their value collapsed.
	   The Soviet Union refused to pay up on the bonds.
	   Seeking to win good will in the West, the post-Soviet Russian
government agreed in 1996 to pay dlrs 400 million on the debt,
which now has an estimated value of some dlrs 200 billion.
	   Some 200,000 to 400,000 French citizens still hold the aging
bonds, Michel Gonnet, director of the public accounts office at the
Minstry of Finance, told a news conference.
	   They have until Jan. 6, 1999 to submit their claims, Gonnet
said. The French Treasury will count and check the validity of the
bonds, after which compensation will be paid out.
	   Verifying the claims could take years, and payment depends on
when the Russian government completes transfer of the dlrs 400
million promised to the French government.
	   So far, Russia has come up with dlrs 150 million. The Finance
Ministry expressed confidence all of the money, which is being paid
in dlrs 50 million biannual installments, would arrive on time.
	   Associations representing French holders of czarist debt have
complained the amount of money they will receive is far too little,
but Russia has made it clear no more will be forthcoming.

U.S. delegation urged to meet with Nigerian opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's main opposition organization on
Monday urged a visiting American delegation to meet with a wide
spectrum of Nigerian society.
	   The State Department's third-ranking official, Thomas Pickering
``must avoid being closeted in Abuja like the United Nations
Secretary-General and his Commonwealth counterpart who failed to
meet credible opposition groups,'' National Democratic Coalition
Secretary-General Ayo Okpadokun said in a statement.
	   Pickering's delegation, which was expected to arrive in Nigeria
Monday, plans to meet on Tuesday with Nigeria's new military ruler,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The group will hold a small meeting with various members of
civil society, including some opposition figures, said Charles
Patterson, the principal officer at the U.S. Embassy office in
Abuja, the capital.
	   The delegation will leave Nigeria late Tuesday and will not
visit Lagos, which is where much of Nigeria's opposition movement
is centered.
	   The visit to Nigeria by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
infuriated many of the country's dissidents, who have accused him
of putting pressure on imprisoned opposition leader Moshood Abiola
to renounce his claim to the presidency.
	   Abiola, who was the apparent winner of presidential elections in
1993, told Annan that he would give up his presidential claims.
	   Annan, who met with a number of opposition leaders during his
visit, announced that Nigeria would free all its prisoners ``at the
appropriate time,'' including Abiola.
	   However, the uproar from Nigeria's opposition since Annan's
announcement may mean that Abiola will end up spending more time in
his guest house-prison. Some Nigerian officials have said that he
will be held longer, apparently because the government fears
opposition anger spilling over into political violence.
	   However, other reports have said Abiola will be freed this week,
after the 30-day mourning period for Nigeria's former dictator ends
Tuesday.
	   Abubakar came to power last month after the death of Gen. Sani
Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship left Nigeria an international
pariah because of its abysmal human rights record.

San Fermin's raucous festival begins in earnest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Showered with sparkling wine, splattered
with eggs and caked in flour, crowds crammed into Pamplona's city
center on Monday for the so-called `Chupinazo' rocket blast to kick
off the San Fermin festival best known for its dangerous early
morning bull runs.
	   Among the crowds were tens of thousands of foreigners, many of
them annual visitors to this northern city for nine days of
reveling that inspired Ernest Hemingway's 1927 novel ``Fiesta, The
Sun Also Rises.''
	   When Hemingway first came to San Fermin in the early 1920s, the
afternoon bullfights were the main attraction, along with non-stop
drinking. But over the years the limelight has been snatched by the
bull runs.
	   Every morning the daring and the foolhardy scamper before the
stampeding animals as they are herded through the town and into the
bullring where they will be killed by matadors later in the day.
	   ``There is no thrill like it. You hear the bull snorting as he
comes up behind you. He is 1,600 pounds (915 kg) of muscle and he
knows it,'' said Bob Lombardo, a 45-year-old computer programmer
from Philadelphia who was preparing, with copious amounts of beer,
for his 11th year running with the bulls.
	   Dressed in the traditional white San Fermin outfit with a red
kerchief and sash, Pamplona's mayor Javier Chourrant, 62, recalled
a ``more intimate and family-based fiesta'' before the
international hoards arrived.
	   ``But you can't you can't avoid it and everybody is welcome'' he
said, just before the Chupinazo rocket was shot from the balcony on
the Baroque town hall, sending the crowds below into a frenzy of
singing and jumping as corks popped on bottles of sparkling wine.
	   Political tension has also become a traditional part of San
Fermin, with supporters of the armed Basque separatist organization
ETA making their presence felt.
	   Up on the balcony, a scuffle broke out between youths draping a
pro-ETA banner over the facade and an angry middle-aged man
snatching it from them.
	   This year 10 councilors stayed away from the opening day's
revelry to mourn Tomas Caballero, a Pamplona councilor shot dead by
ETA exactly two months ago.
	   Pamplona is the capital of Navarra province, which ETA wants to
incorporate into the independent Basque nation it has been fighting
to create since the 1960s.
	   Historians say dare-devils flaunting authority began running
with the bulls four centuries ago. Nowadays a firework rocket at 8
a.m. sharp sets off the 850-meter (yard) charge uphill from the
corral where the bulls are kept overnight into the heart of the
city's old town, over the cobbled streets and into the bull ring.
	   Injuries are common and death is always a possibility.
	   A nervous novice on the eve of his first run, 33-year-old
American Airlines flight attendant Shawn Wilson said: ``The best
piece of advice that I've heard is that when the rocket goes off on
Tuesday morning you are on your own.''
	   The tourist literature distributed around Pamplona prints
warnings in all major languages.
	   ``If you fall during the running, protect your head with your
hands and lie still until all the bulls have passed'' and ``Do not
challenge, touch or otherwise distract the bulls. This can be
fatal.''
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American gored to death in
1995, the 13th runner to die since records began in 1924, and the
first since 1980.

Reputed gang leader gets suspended sentence for breaching casino
</HEADLINE>
ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A court sentenced a reputed crime boss Monday to a
suspended nine-month prison term for defying a government order
that bars him from entering casinos.
	   Wan Kuok-koi, also known as ``Broken Tooth'' Koi, was also fined
50,000 patacas (U.S. dlrs 6,250) for visiting casinos several times
in 1996.
	   The ban was imposed after this Portuguese territory's gambling
inspectorate accused Wan, allegedly one of Macau's top gang
leaders, of causing ``disturbances'' in casinos.
	   Wan now is in jail awaiting trial on a separate charge of being
a triad or gang member.
	   He was arrested in May after a bomb exploded beneath the car of
Dr. Antonio Marques Baptista, director of Macau's Judicial Police.
	   The bombing of Baptista's car was the latest attack on members
of the Portuguese-appointed government. Three government employees,
including the No. 3 official in the gambling inspectorate, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, a popular gambling enclave at the tip of south China,
returns to Chinese rule next year.
	   The Macau government receives half its revenue from the gambling
business. Gangs are believed to be fighting over profits as
revenues suffer from Asia's economic downturn.

Tax plans, expansion costs, divide EU ministers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in
Monday for what threatens to be a long, hard battle over how to
share the costs of expanding the EU into eastern Europe.
	   Austria launched it's six-month presidency of the EU, aiming for
progress on deciding who should finance the expected entry into the
EU of five former-communist nations, plus Cyprus, around the middle
of next decade.
	   But positions appeared rigid. Richer members led by Germany,
insisted their contributions to EU coffers should be cut. Poorer
nations stressed EU aid money that now boosts their economies,
should not be diverted to the new eastern members.
	   ``This is not going to be easy,'' acknowledged Swedish Finance
Minister Erik Asbrink.
	   Monday's one-day finance ministers' meeting was the first since
Austria took over the EU presidency from Britain on July 1.
	   As well as the enlargement financing battle, Austrian Finance
Minister Rudolf Edlinger also faces tough negotiations on a
proposal to introduce an EU-wide tax on savings, to prevent
cross-border tax-dodging.
	   Most EU nations support a proposal from the EU's executive
Commission for a 20-percent tax on interest gained on savings
accounts. But Britain and Luxembourg, whose banking sectors thrive
on low taxes, are reluctant.
	   ``The UK will be as constructive as possible, but .... we
suspect that making progress will be hard work,'' said Helen
Liddell, economic secretary at the British Treasury. EU decisions
on taxation need unanimous approval from all 15 member nations.
	   The EU has set a March, 1999, deadline to overhaul the Union's
budget in preparation for the planned enlargement to the East.
	   Germany _ the biggest contributor to the EU budget _ insists the
entry of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus must not lead to current member states paying more into EU
funds.
	   ``We must make savings and cuts,'' German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel told the meeting. ``There can be no doubt about the German
position.''
	   In fact Germany, which provides almost one-third of the EU's
dlrs 86 billion annual budget, wants to reduce its net
contribution. The Netherlands and Austria also say they should pay
less.
	   Poorer EU members fear that without an increase in EU funds, the
money that currently helps their less-developed regions will flow
instead into to the even poorer eastern nations.
	   ``There's obviously a difference of view,'' Greek Economy
Minister Yannos Papantoniou told the meeting. ``Greece feels that
the cost of enlargement could be much greater than thought.''
	   Austria's Edlinger appealed to his colleagues to ``face up to
our responsibilities'' to ensure progress on the question by the
time Austria wraps up its presidency with a December summit in
Vienna.

Van Goghs, Cezanne stolen in Rome recovered

theft on commission; no pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police burst into apartments in Rome and Turin
before dawn Monday and recovered two paintings by van Gogh and one
by Cezanne, resolving an art theft that had become a major
embarrassment for Italy.
	   They arrested eight Italians, including a security guard at
Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art, where armed thieves walked
away with the masterpieces on May 19.
	   Government and museum officials exulted in the cracking of the
case in a country with a vast artistic patrimony, where thefts and
vandalism are all too common. The crime had provoked a storm of
criticism over museum security.
	   ``This was a bleeding wound that Italy didn't deserve,'' Deputy
Premier Walter Veltroni told reporters. ``Today the wound is
closed.''
	   A well-organized group of thieves carried out the brazen heist,
authorities said.
	   The suspects included several people involved in holdups in
Belgium, said Gen. Roberto Conforti, commander of the Carabinieri
art theft squad. Police seized rifles, revolvers, a machine-pistol,
masks, ammunition and wigs during the arrests, he said.
	   Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of
Jourdan,'' an unfinished painting done the year he died, were
recovered in an apartment in a lower-middle class neighborhood on
the northern outskirts of Rome, police said. They were wrapped in
blankets and cardboard. One was under a bed, the other on top of a
wardrobe, according to Carabinieri Maj. Ferdinando Musella
	   The other van Gogh, ``A Woman from Arles,'' was found in Turin.
	   The van Goghs are the only two by the artist hanging in Italian
museums.
	   The canvasses were undamaged. Police put them on display for
reporters in the offices of Veltroni, who also is culture minister.
The frames were missing.
	   Police said the gang apparently had sought to sell the works
secretly to a private collector. ``Fortunately, (the paintings)
were found before this could happen,'' Veltroni said.
	   Officials discounted earlier reports that the theft was
committed on commission.
	   The works _ worth at least dlrs 30 million _ were too famous to
sell openly.
	   Three armed men apparently hid in the gallery until it closed
for the night. They turned off the alarm system, locked up the
guards and walked away with the paintings.
	   The museum's closed-circuit surveillance system was broken at
the time.
	   After the theft, police checked the backgrounds of the museum's
160 employees, Conforti said. One, the security guard, had contacts
with several of the arrested suspects who had criminal records,
police said.
	   Police used phone taps and surveillance to zero in on the other
members of the gang. The locations of the paintings were determined
Sunday, said Musella.
	   Veltroni said the paintings would go back on display on Tuesday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ismail Mohamed Ali, the first
Malaysian governor of Bank Negara, the nation's central bank, died
Monday of complications from flu, the national news agency

	   Ismail, a lawyer, was an executive director in the World Bank
and its affiliates before serving 18 years as Bank Negara governor,
from 1962 to 1980.
	   Before him, the bank's governors were British civil servants.
Malaysia was established in 1963, after the Malay states gained

	   His sister, Dr. Siti Hasmah, is the wife of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   One brother was a former chief minister of the central state of
Selangor and another brother, Hashim Mohamed Ali, a former Defense

Bernama news agency said.
	   Ismail is survived by his two sons, one a merchant banker and
the other an architect. His wife died in 1996.
	   The funeral was held Monday evening.

Parliament president wants German-Polish talks on exiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth on Monday
called for Polish-German talks to resolve questions about the
status of German exiles driven out of western Poland after World
War II.
	   While Suessmuss told Inforadio Berlin-Brandenburg that a
parliament resolution on the issue passed May 29 would not be
amended, she said that clarifications were needed.
	   The Bundestag called for east European candidates seeking
membership in the European Union to admit the right of German
exiles to settle in areas they inhabited before the war.
	   Poland, which opened EU membership negotiations March 30, was
quick to condemn the resolution. Its parliament voted unanimously
on Friday to reject it, saying: ``Our membership in the European
Union must mean the inviolability of the Polish borders ... and
Polish ownership rights to property.''
	   In response, the leader of the Association of Exiles in Germany
questioned Poland's readiness to join the European Union.
``Poland's path into Europe cannot go this way,'' said Erika
Steinbach, a conservative Christian Democrat who is a member of
parliament.
	   Suessmuth played down Steinbach's remarks.
	   ``We want that Poland joins the EU. We aren't deciding now that
they aren't ripe for it. I think that is a false tone,'' Suessmuth
said Monday.

Protestants go on rampage after Orangemen blocked at Portadown

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant hard-liners attacked
police, hijacked cars and blocked roads in many parts of Northern
Ireland overnight after British authorities blocked the province's
most controversial Orange Order march.
	   ``This is a battle that has to be won _ no ifs, no buts,'' the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the leading opponent of Northern Ireland's new
peace agreement, declared early Monday morning in a visit to
Orangemen camped out near a church where their parade was stopped
on Sunday.
	   Rioters confronted police and British soldiers in several parts
of Belfast overnight, and a policeman was hospitalized with a
fractured skull in Londonderry.
	   David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
party and newly elected First Minister of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, said he had been in touch with Prime Minister Tony Blair
and other officials seeking a way out of the impasse.
	   ``This situation has the capacity to destabilize, and if the
situation is not resolved satisfactorily, it could put at risk all
the political progress we have achieved,'' Trimble said.
	   Hotels reported a significant number of cancellations, which
they blamed on violence surrounding the march impasse, and tourist
officials said the damage could be long-lasting.
	   ``We have lost the potential for 20,000 jobs and we've lost the
potential for at least four or five years of at least 500 million
pounds (dlrs 800 million) per annum,'' said Roy Bailie, chairman of
the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.

Joint Polish-Jewish declaration on Auschwitz seen delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A controversy over a large cross outside
the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz may keep Jewish groups from
signing a declaration supporting the government's efforts to
renovate the camp and surrounding area, officials said Monday.
	   Polish authorities and representatives of Jewish organizations
were supposed to sign the declaration in mid-July. But an aide to
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek told Monday's issue of the
Rzeczpospolita newspaper that the declaration will not be signed
then as planned.
	   Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska said leaders of the World Jewish
Congress have hinted they cannot sign the declaration, which
received preliminary approval in March 1997 from representatives of
about 20 Jewish organizations, because they object to the presence
of the cross near the camp.
	   Jewish organizations argue the seven-meter (26-foot) cross
disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million Jews who died there,
and want it removed.
	   For other Poles, the cross, located where 152 Nazi resisters
were murdered in 1941, remains a symbol of the nation's martyrdom
under German occupation.
	   Ambassador Krzysztof Sliwinski, a Foreign Ministry official in
charge of Polish-Jewish relations, said in a telephone interview
that the talks were continuing.
	   He said the issue may be discussed when the prime minister meets
with Jewish leaders during his visit to the United States, which
begins Thursday.
	   Work on the 10-year, dlrs 93.5 million redevelopment at
Auschwitz began last year. Poland has earmarked 60 million zlotys
(dlrs 20 million) over five years for the project.
	   Among the major additions will be a link between Auschwitz and
Birkenau, the former camp's two integral parts, which are some 3
kilometers (1.8 miles) apart. Officials hope it will encourage more
people to visit both parts.
	   The program also ensures the preservation of a 500-meter
(1,650-foot) protection zone established around the museum by
UNESCO in 1979 and will offer economic incentives for the
surrounding city of Oswiecim, with a population of 50,000.

More leopards, elephants _ more attacks on man

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh
has more wild animals and more people, and it's bad news for both.
	   ``More and more animals are coming in contact with humans,
resulting in bloody skirmishes in which, most of the time, the
animals lose their lives,'' Uttar Pradesh wildlife officer R.L.
Singh said in an interview last week.
	   Uttar Pradesh has huge swathes of protected land, including the
62-year-old Corbett Tiger Reserve, India's first national park and
one of its most popular. Singh said government efforts to protect
animals from disease and poachers had succeeded within the
reserves.
	   But just outside the reserves_in land that was previously
empty_villagers are carving out small farms to increase their low
income.
	   ``The animals, which used to stray unhindered into these buffer
zones in the past, cannot do so now,'' Singh said. ``But the
straying habit is strong in animals, and so they come in contact
with humans.''
	   In 1994, 27 leopards were killed by humans in the hills of Uttar
Pradesh, most of them poisoned by farmers. The toll rose to 31 last
year.
	   More and more leopards are attacking humans, a consequence of
their increased contacts with people, Singh said. Of the 27
leopards killed in 1994, three were hunted down by wildlife
authorities because they had attacked villagers. Some of the
animals become man-eaters when they are injured or sick and cannot
hunt effectively.
	   The last wildlife census in 1997 put the number of leopards in
Uttar Pradesh state at 1,412, up from the 958 in 1995. The number
of elephants rose by some 400 to 1,984 over those two years.
	   The elephants are moving out of the reserves to feed in
villagers' sugarcane and paddy fields. Farmers have responded by
erecting electric wire fencing with charges powerful enough to kill
an elephant. Five Uttar Pradesh elephants have been killed in the
last six months.

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seeded Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
routed fellow-countryman Fredrik Johnsson 6-3, 6-1 in opening play
of the Swedish Open ATP tennis tournament Monday.
	   Gustafsson, chasing his fourth Swedish Open title, will play
Markus Hipfl, a qualifier from Austria, in the second round. Hopfl
beat Andreas Vinciguerra, a promising youngster from Sweden, who
earlier this year advanced to the semifinal of the Australian Open
junior tournament, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, became the
top seed after Karol Kucera, twelfth in the ATP ranking, withdrew
last week with a sprained ankle.
	   In other action, Juan Antonio Marin of Spain defeated Arnaud di
Pasquale of France 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   Other seeds to see action later Monday include fifth-seed
Richard Fromberg, who plays Javier Sanchez of Spain, seventh-seed
Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, who faces Jordi Burillo of Spain and
sixth-seeded Thomas Johansson of Sweden, who plays Arnaud Clement
of France.

South Korean accused of spying must leave, Russian contact charged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A South Korean diplomat accused of spying will
leave Russia before Tuesday evening, while his alleged Russian
Foreign Ministry contact will be charged with treason, the Interfax
news agency reported Monday.
	   The South Korean diplomat, identified as Cho Seong-ho, was
detained by Federal Security officials as he met with an alleged
Russian contact on July 3. He was released after questioning, and
did not explain where he had gotten Russian Foreign Ministry
documents found in his briefcase.
	   The Foreign Ministry declared Cho persona non grata and ordered
him to leave Russia within three days for ``illegal activities
incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
	   South Korea is reviewing the incident, and has not yet decided
whether to take retaliatory measures. However, a South Korean
Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed dismay that Seoul was not
consulted before Russia decided to expel Cho.
	   Cho's alleged Russian contact faces up to 20 years in prison if
found guilty of treason.
	   Boris Neuchev, deputy head of Russia's Federal Security
Service's public relations center, said Russia has ``ample proof of
the suspect's criminal activity,'' Interfax reported.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, is responsible for
counterintelligence.

Japanese official warns economic crisis could harm Asian security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A senior Japanese defense official warned
Monday that the economic turmoil sweeping through Asia could
adversely affect regional security.
	   In a speech, Japanese Vice Minister for Defense Masahiro Akiyama
said high inflation and rising unemployment could disrupt the
political situation in some countries, leading to wider
destabilization across borders.
	   Akiyama added that the economic slowdown is already causing
reductions in military spending, which could upset the regional
balance of power.
	   He also warned that countries badly hurt in the crisis might
become increasingly insular, hampering regional cooperation and
confidence building.
	   Asian countries should ``work hard for earlier reconstruction of
their economies as well as pay enough attention to the future
development of the situation so that the economic difficulties will
not lead to the destabilization of the region,'' he said.
	   He noted that Indonesia, where a government has already fallen
because of the regional turmoil, faces major obstacles. President
B.J. Habibie's most pressing challenge is how well his
administration can respond to popular demand for reform ``through
concrete policies and programs,'' he added.
	   Akiyama added that the nuclear proliferation on the Asian
subcontinent could lead to significant deterioration of regional
and global security.
	   He argued for a concerted international effort to encourage
dialogue between Indian and Pakistan to ``fundamentally remove
tensions ... that underlie their development of nuclear weapons.''
	   Expressing a view often espoused by Singapore's leadership,
Akiyama stressed that the United States must stay involved in the
region.
	   ``In the Asia-Pacific's present security environment, in which
unpredictability and uncertainty remain in spite of some recent
positive developments, the engagement and military presence of the
United States continues to play an important role for regional
peace and stability,'' he said.
	   In addition to Monday's lecture, Akiyama has met a number of
Singapore leaders to discuss bilateral and regional issues, and
will visit several military facilities Tuesday before ending his
four-day visit to Singapore.

World Cup: France not as strong as it seems, Croatian says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Monday developments. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's coach said Monday he sees
weaknesses in France's game that his fired-up surprise team can
exploit to get a shot at winning the World Cup.
	   Miroslav Blazevic delighted in proving doubters wrong when
Croatia humiliated Germany 3-0 in the quarterfinals and set off
national euphoria in the small, young country.
	   Now he says that semifinal opponent France, considered a
stronger team and backed by home fans, is beatable, too. The two
teams meet Wednesday at Saint-Denis.
	   Blazevic stunned French reporters at a news conference when he
declared France's defense ``not that strong'' even though it has
conceded only one goal in the tournament.
	   The reason, he said, is that back defenders Bixente Lizarazu and
Lilian Thuram leave France exposed on their frequent forays up the
field.
	   And having watched the French struggle to down Italy on penalty
kicks in their quarterfinal, the wily 63-year-old coach contended
that their attack lacks punch.
	   ``Luckily for us, they haven't had much success in finishing,''
Blazevic said. ``And when Thuram and Lizarazu leave the flanks
open, the defense is vulnerable.''
	   ``I am too ambitious to say we have achieved everything we
can,'' he said Sunday after his triumphant squad returned to its
training camp in this idyllic spa town.
	   Team captain Zvonimir Boban, who is adding World Cup glory to
his club achievements at AC Milan, was more circumspect.
	   ``We feel very proud, but we don't want to start dreaming,'' he
said Monday. ``We have great confidence. Our people are in a
trance, and this is great also for us.''
	   Croatia's dream throughout its World Cup debut has been to snare
the world's respect for the Adriatic nation of 4 million people,
which won independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in a 1991 war
driven by fierce Balkan nationalism.
	   The Croats have already made World Cup history as the only team
in the modern area to reach the semifinals on its first try.
	   But now that the sky's the limit, some Croatian fans are running
out of money in France because they hadn't budgeted for such a
stunning success.
	   The players, most of whom earn money with clubs in Western
Europe, are chipping in out of their own pockets to help the
supporters stay on, team spokesman Darko Tironi said.
	   It's all part of a national mission for men like Boban, who was
a world champion already in 1987 with Yugoslavia's youth team.
	   ``I felt respect for the Yugoslav jersey, but I feel love for
the Croatian one,'' he said.

Thirteen killed in three separate rebel attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -Thirteen people, including four high
school students, were killed in three separate attacks in southern
Burundi, state-run Radio Burundi said Monday.
	   In Rumonge, a coastal town about 55 kilometers (35 miles) south
of the capital Bujumbura, four students were killed when a grenade
authorities say was planted at the school exploded while students
were preparing to take final-year exams, the report said.
	   No information was given on who planted the grenade, but Hutu
rebels are known to attack soft targets like school.
	   Another nine people were killed in over the weekend in two
separate attacks, the report said.
	   In Makamba province, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of
Bujumbura, five people died when heavily armed assailants attacked
a village, burning 15 homes, the report said.
	   Another four were killed in another attack in southern Burundi
on a bus, the radio said.
	   No other details were given and military officials contacted by
telephone declined comment Monday.
	   The Tutsi-run army has been battling Hutu rebels since late
1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye, Burundi's
first democratically elected president and a Hutu.
	   Maj. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, declared himself president in a
bloodless coup in July 1996, claiming he was the only one who could
stop the bloodshed.
	   But the killings have continued and at least 200,000 people,
mostly civilians, have died in the fighting.

Grenade explodes at amusement park in Cambodian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded at a popular
children's amusement park in downtown Phnom Penh Monday night,
injuring at least five people, police said.
	   It was not clear whether the explosion was deliberate or an
accident. The blast occurred during the tense run-up to a general
election scheduled for July 26, but there was no obvious political
target at the site, which is near the luxury Cambodiana hotel.
	   The explosion occurred shortly after 8 p.m. while hundreds of
people were in the area. Security personnel were on the scene
within a few minutes, and fired rifle shots into the air to keep
bystanders away.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. There are strict laws controlling
unauthorized possession of guns and grenades, but they are rarely
enforced.

French lawmakers meet to discuss future of New Caledonia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from French prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Lawmakers were meeting Monday to give
final ratification to an agreement that could lead to complete
independence for the French territory of New Caledonia.
	   Deputies and senators meeting in Versailles, south of Paris,
were expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the so-called
Noumea agreement, reached April 21.
	   The agreement, named after the territory's capital, provides for
a 20-year transition period toward independence. It already has won
almost unanimous backing in both the French National Assembly and
Senate.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, a referendum will be held in
December on a transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the
archipelago, to be followed in 2018 by a second referendum on
self-determination.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday called the
agreement ``a success for New Caledonia and France.''
	   ``It brings in a new period of peace for the territory which for
so long has had a troubled history,'' he said in an opening address
to the lawmakers.
	   Jospin said the agreement would pave the way for ``social
progress'' and ``economic development'' in New Caledonia.

Grenade explodes at amusement park in Cambodian capital

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded at a popular
children's amusement park in downtown Phnom Penh Monday night,
injuring at least five people, police said.
	   It was not clear whether the explosion was deliberate or an
accident. The injured, one woman and four men, appeared to be badly
hurt.
	   The blast occurred during the tense run-up to a general election
scheduled for July 26, but there was no obvious political target at
the site, which is near the luxury Cambodiana hotel and Hun Sen
Park.
	   The explosion occurred shortly after 8 p.m. while hundreds of
people were in the area. Security personnel were on the scene
within a few minutes, and fired rifle shots into the air to keep
bystanders away.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. There are strict laws controlling
unauthorized possession of guns and grenades, but they are rarely
enforced.

Hendrie steps in as Barnsley boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Veteran striker John Hendrie stepped in as
Barnsley manager on Monday when Danny Wilson, the man who steered
the team through its maiden Premier League season, quit the club.
	   Wilson, manager of the South Yorkshire Club for four years up to
its promotion to the top-flight competition, was preparing to
accept a contract at Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Barnsley was relegated to division one after one season in the
Premier League but Wilson had said he would stay with the South
Yorkshire club.
	   However, the lure to manage a Premier League team led to a
change of attitude _ his departure making way for 34-year-old
Hendrie to move into a manager's position for the first time.
	   ``You cannot dwell on the past,'' Hendrie said Monday.
	   ``We are looking forward to next season and we have to be
positive. There is no reason why we cannot have another good
season.''
	   Hendrie, who started his professional career at Coventry in
1981, played with Bradford, Newcastle, Leeds and Middlesbrough
before signing with Barnsley in 1996.
	   He was an integral part of the Barnsley team which earned
promotion into the Premier League for the first time in the club's
history in 1997.
	   Although, his participation in 1998 was limited by injuries and
new signings.

Miners close Trans-Siberian railroad for a fourth day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 1-3 with government demand that blockade
be lifted before talks begin. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will not negotiate with
striking Siberian coal miners until they lift a four-day-old
blockade of the Trans-Siberian railway, a deputy prime minister
said Monday.
	   ``The government cannot put up with the unlawful actions to
block the railway line, which causes substantial damage to the
Russian economy,'' Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev said.
	   ``The government is ready to immediately resume the economic
talks with the strikers if the blockade is lifted,'' he said in a
letter to the governor of the Kemerovo mining region, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Several hundred striking miners in the central Siberian mining
town of Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government
plans to close their mines and reduce subsidies to local
coal-related industries.
	   Labor Unions from other sectors also asked the miners to lift
their blockade to keep their own industries going.
	   At least 29 freight trains with as much as 250 tons of cargo
were halted Monday, the Railway Ministry said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Metallurgy and chemical workers' unions appealed to the miners
to lift the blockade to avoid shutting down their industries, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Agricultural workers who are experiencing shortages of fuel and
grease at a time when animal food is being stored for the winter
also asked the miners to allow trains to go through, Interfax said.
	   The miners are demanding that the government make good on
promises made in May to pay up to six months of back wages. They
are also demanding the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Because of the blockade, trains have also been stopped on
approaches to the Trans-Siberian line, with up to 40 trains
standing idle in the Kemerovo region of Siberia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In Moscow, several hundred coal miners continued a sit-in near
the Russian White House, the government's headquarters. Their
permit to demonstrate expired Saturday, but authorities so far have
made no move to oust them.
	   The miners have asked authorities to let them demonstrate
outside the Kremlin, news agencies said Sunday.
	   The protests came about six weeks after a wave of protests by
coal miners around the country, who blocked the Trans-Siberian and
other railways in May to demand support from the federal
government.
	   Those strikes ended when the government pledged to pay a portion
of the back wages. The Kremlin insists that the money has been paid
out, but miners' union officials say only a portion has reached the
mines.

EU takes six countries to court over workers' rights, safety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
take six countries to court for failing to integrate EU laws on
workers' rights and safety in the workplace into national
legislation.
	   The EU Commission said in a statement it will take France,
Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, Greece and Portugal before the European
Court of Justice.
	   ``The Commission will spare no effort to ensure that every
single social policy directive is properly transposed'' in the 15
EU countries, said Padraig Flynn, commissioner for social affairs.
	   He congratulated Spain for having ``the best record (100
percent) after a very great effort in the past 18 months.'' But
Italy and Luxembourg are lagging far behind and need to turn the
situation around urgently, he said.
	   The Commission will sue Italy for failing to implement EU norms
on working hours and protection of workers exposed to biological
agents.
	   Italy , Luxembourg, Germany and France will also will be taken
to court for failure to pass appropriate laws on the equal
treatment of men and women in social security schemes.
	   Luxembourg and Portugal will be sued for failing to adopt EU
norms on the rights of workers in multinationals to be informed and
consulted.
	   The Commission will take Greece to court over its laws on safety
in the workplace, specifically regarding ``electrical equipment for
use in potentially explosive atmosphere in mines susceptible to
firedamp.''

Sleaze controversy hits Blair's government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Labor Party official who boasted of his
access to government officials was suspended from his job with a
lobbying company Monday, and he was fired from his job as a
newspaper columnist.
	   The controversy embroiled Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party government in charges of sleaziness_ an issue which helped
topple the Conservative government in national elections 14 months
ago.
	   The Express newspaper dismissed Derek Draper because he
reportedly said his columns were reviewed by a government minister
before publication.
	   The Observer newspaper, which had reporters pose as
representatives of U.S. energy companies, reported Sunday that
Draper was among three former aides to government ministers who are
now selling their contacts.
	   The newspaper said that a former lobbyist, Roger Liddle, now a
member of Blair's Policy Unit, told the undercover reporters:
``Just tell me what you want, who you want to meet and Derek
(Draper) and I will make the call for you.''
	   Liddle said he was just being friendly and never offered to fix
up meetings on behalf Draper's company.
	   The Observer said the lobbyists claimed to be able to get
privileged access to government ministers and policies, including
advanced information about market-sensitive speeches by the
treasury chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.
	   Ann Taylor, Labor floor manager in the House of Commons
acknowledged the allegations were serious, but said The Observer
must produce proof.
	   ``The prime minister has made clear that if anybody has breached
these rules, action will be taken,'' said Ms. Taylor.
	   Draper's company, GPC Marketing Access, suspended him. Draper
made no comment.
	   As part of advertising his credentials, Draper said in taped
conversations that his columns were vetted by Peter Mandelson, a
deputy minister and a key former of policy and image in Blair's
centrist ``New Labor'' administration, The Observer reported.
	   Under the Conservatives, half-a-dozen Tory legislators were
found to have accepted cash or favors via lobbyists for raising
issues in Parliament or facilitating introductions. Harrods owner
Mohamed Al Fayed said he paid Tory legislators to raise issues
about ownership of the store in the 1980s.
	   On Monday, the Conservatives clamored for an investigation.
	   ``It's about cronyism. It's about special favors to friends,''
said Francis Maude, Tory spokesman on finance.
	   Recent activities of another Laborite former political aide
turned lobbyist, Karl Milner, included faxing a parliamentary
committee report on energy to Union Associates in New York 24 hours
before publication.
	   Observer reporter Gregory Palast said Milner thought Union
Associates was a prospective client but it actually specializes in
investigating corporate corruption.
	   Milner's employers, GJW Government Relations, on Monday
apologized for his action.
	   Leaking select committee reports in advance is considered a
breach of parliamentary privilege.

Singapore dollar sinks as Brunei's largest company reported in
</HEADLINE>
trouble &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sultan's speech, last three grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore dollar declined against the U.S.
dollar Monday, weighed down by reports that an investment company
owned by the Sultan of Brunei's brother faces losses of about dlrs
16 billion.
	   Heavy losses at Amedeo, the investment and construction group
run by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, could put pressure on the Brunei
dollar, which is pegged to the Singapore dollar through a currency
board, currency traders in Singapore said.
	   Late in Asian trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.7128
Singapore dollars, down from its earlier high of 1.7170 but still
well above 1.6966 late Friday.
	   The Sunday Telegraph of London reported that Amedeo had
collapsed under the weight of the losses and its managers were
being sought for questioning. It said the government had hired
financial experts to examine the books of Amedeo, Brunei's largest
private company.
	   Government offices in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of
Brunei, were closed Monday for a public holiday, and no one could
be reached for confirmation.
	   Last week, the Borneo Bulletin, the only English-language
newspaper in Brunei, reported that Amedeo was ``troubled'' and
quoted Development Minister Haji Ismail as saying: ``I wish I knew
what was going wrong. I do not know what went wrong.''
	   Ismail said he wanted the company's managers to come forward to
help the government find out.
	   Among Amedeo projects are the six-star Jerudong Park House hotel
and power-generation projects in partnership with Germany's Siemens
AG, the Bulletin said.
	   Brunei, a tiny oil-rich sultanate on the northwestern coast of
Borneo, has one of the world's highest per-capita incomes.
	   A potential loss on the scale suggested by the Daily Telegraph
article wouldn't affect the oil and gas companies already operating
in Brunei, such as Shell, New Zealand's Fletcher Energy and Elf
Aquitaine of France, said Duncan Clarke, Sydney-based chairman of
the consulting company Global Pacific and Partners.
	   But the combination of a potential squeeze on the country's
offshore revenues and this year's weakness in oil and natural gas
prices would put a squeeze on Brunei's finances, Clarke said.
	   Meanwhile, a report from Bandar Seri Begawan said the sultan, in
a Radio Television Brunei broadcast Sunday night, stated that the
survival of the nation was foremost on his agenda.
	   ``We do not have much time to correct the mistakes that have
been made deliberately. But what is important and more beneficial
now is to prevent the recurrence of such mistakes,'' he said.
	   The sultan did not directly refer to the Amedeo case, however.

Chechen Prime Minister's resignation still unaccepted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president still has not accepted the
resignation of his prime minister, Shamil Basayev, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   A spokesman for President Aslan Maskhadov said instability in
the breakaway republic has swept the issue aside, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   ``All problems linked with the resignation of state officials
are secondary,'' said Maskhadov spokesman Mayerbek Vachagayev.
	   Maskhadov recently declared a state of emergency in the
republic, which is going through a crime wave of oil and fuel
thefts, killings, and kidnappings of foreigners for ransom.
	   Basayev, Chechnya's acting prime minister, submitted his
resignation on July 3, saying his six-month term has come to an
end.
	   But government spokesmen have said Maskhadov would probably not
accept the resignation. He wants Basayev to remain in his
administration, and is trying to persuade him to stay, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Maskhadov formally holds the title of prime minister of
Chechnya, but in January asked Basayev _ a popular leader with a
large following _ to serve as acting prime minister.
	   Chechnya has mostly ignored Moscow's authority since Russian
troops pulled out in the fall of 1996 and both sides agreed to
settle the republic's status after tensions eased. But the Kremlin
insists Chechnya remains a part of Russia, and no country has
recognized the Muslim republic as independent.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Ethiopian Jews scuffled with police
Monday outside the prime minister's office in a protest against the
government's immigration policy.
	   Demonstrators demanded that thousands of Jews still living in
Ethiopia be brought to Israel. Some carried photographs of
relatives and shouted ``mother'' and ``father.''
	   The government recently closed a special transit camp for
immigrants in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and held a
festive reception for the last few dozen camp residents who arrived
in Israel last week.
	   Leaders of the Ethiopian community fear this is a sign that the
government considers the chapter of Ethiopian immigration closed.
They say about 5,000 Jews still live in remote areas of Ethiopia.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel. Most were brought to
the Jewish state in two airlifts in 1985 and 1991.

Roche signs licensing agreement for new cancer treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche and
U.S. firm Genentech Inc. said Monday they have signed an agreement
giving Roche exclusive marketing rights outside the United States
for the breast cancer drug Herceptin.
	   Herceptin, discovered and developed by Genentech, is a
monoclonal antibody, one of a group of drugs designed to attack
specific cancer cells.
	   A recent study suggested it can benefit patients with breast
cancer that has spread beyond the breast area. Researchers found
that, when added to standard treatment, Herceptin lengthened lives
an average of three months.
	   Roche said in a statement it will pay a ``substantial'' upfront
fee and will make further cash payments tied to product development
activity. The size of the amount paid wasn't disclosed.
	   Roche also will contribute equally with Genentech to global
development costs and will make royalty payments on product sales.
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has designated Herceptin a
``fast track'' product and granted it priority review.
	   The FDA is expected to make a decision by November 1998, Roche
said. The company will file for approval with other regulatory
authorities worldwide in the coming months.

were preparing to take final-year exams, the report said.
	   No information was given on who planted the grenade, but Hutu
rebels are known to attack soft targets like schools.
	   Another nine people were killed in over the weekend in two
separate attacks, the report said.
	   In Makamba province, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of
Bujumbura, five people died when heavily armed assailants attacked
a village, burning 15 homes, the report said.
	   Another four were killed in another attack in southern Burundi
on a bus, the radio said.
	   No other details were given and military officials contacted by
telephone declined comment Monday.
	   The Tutsi-run army has been battling Hutu rebels since late
1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye, Burundi's
first democratically elected president and a Hutu.
	   Maj. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, declared himself president in a
bloodless coup in July 1996, claiming he was the only one who could
stop the bloodshed.
	   But the killings have continued and at least 200,000 people,
mostly civilians, have died in the fighting.

South Korea seeks to increase investment in Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The foreign ministers of El Salvador
and South Korea signed a mutual investment protection and promotion
agreement Monday.
	   South Korean Foreign Minister Park Chung-soo also initialed
similar accords with his counterparts from Guatemala and Nicaragua,
both in Seoul to strengthen economic ties.
	   The three Central American foreign ministers, along with their
counterparts from Honduras and Costa Rica, came to Seoul Saturday
for a four-day visit on a leg of their Asian trip.
	   The agreements signed or initialed Monday call for each country
to give equal treatment to domestic and foreign companies investing
in the other. The initialed agreements are to lead to formal
agreements later.
	   ``Central America is in a stage of building infrastructure such
as roads and ports. It would be a good chance for Korean builders
to enter the fast-growing market,'' El Salvador Foreign Minister
Ramon Gonzalez Giner said after signing the accord.
	   The South Korean foreign minister, Park, also said Central
America can be a new market for South Korean builders, whose
business is shrinking in their major market in Asia.
	   South Korea's trade with the five Central American nations
reached dlrs 532 million in 1997, up 92 percent from dlrs 227
million in 1993.
	   South Korea exported dlrs 466 million worth of textiles, cars
and electronic goods to the five Central American countries last
year. It imported dlrs 66 million worth of sugar, coffee and other
agricultural products from them.
	   Some 180 small South Korean companies, mostly textile and
garment makers, have invested dlrs 130 million in the five nations.
The five nations have no significant investment in South Korea.

Abkhazian separatists defy Georgia in bid to control sea border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Georgian government's reaction in new grafs 7-8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia
has sent naval boats to patrol its Black Sea coast in defiance of
the government's plan to take over control of the shoreline.
	   Russia has been patrolling Georgia's coast since 1994, the same
year Moscow deployed peacekeepers to separate Georgian government
troops and Abkhazian separatist forces following a 13-month war.
	   Russia and Georgia agreed last month that Georgian border guards
would take over coastal patrols starting July 16.
	   But Abkhazia has opposed the move, which would strengthen the
Georgian government's control over the region, tighten an embargo
on arms deliveries to separatists, and possibly hurt trade.
	   A spokesman for the Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav
Ardzinba said Monday that Abkhazian boats began patrolling the
coast last Wednesday and would fully take charge once Russian
border guards withdraw.
	   ``If Georgian border guards try to assume control over the
Abkhazian sea border, hostilities will erupt,'' Ardzinba's
spokesman Astamur Taniya said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Georgian Border Guards chief Maj. Gen. Valery Chkheidze told The
Associated Press that he had no confirmation that Abkhazians had
actually started patrolling.
	   Chkheidze said that his forces would take over sea patrols as
scheduled, but added that he was planning to meet with Ardzinba,
the separatist chief, to settle the dispute.
	   Despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers there have been
sporadic clashes since the end of the 1992-93 war. Dozens of people
were killed during fighting in May between Abkhazian separatists
and militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   Efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict have
remained stalled.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Police said four people died
in weekend attacks on white-owned farms and farmers' leaders Monday
sought a meeting with President Nelson Mandela on a continuing farm
murders.
	   Three elderly whites were shot dead on a farm near Middleburg,
north of Johannesburg, and a fourth died from multiple wounds after
being bound with wire in the central Free State province.
	   Ampie Fourie, 58, had been repairing fences when he was attacked
by unknown assailants, police said.
	   South African Agricultural Union chief Chris du Toit said the
organization was demanding assurances from Mandela that more
emphasis will be given to combating crime in commercial farming
areas.
	   ``We have not much hope that it will achieve anything, but we
have to make another attempt,'' he said.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said his Crime
Information Management Center recorded 389 attacks on farms from
November to May in which 81 people died.
	   ------
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ The ruling Botswana Democratic Party
swept to overwhelming victory in two by-elections prompted by the
retirement of former President Quett Masire.
	   Boyce Sebetlela, contesting the Palapye seat left vacant by
Masire's successor, President Festus Mogae, won over 1,600 votes to
the opposition Botswana National Front's 167 votes.
	   The main opposition party won just 86 votes in Serowe, where
Gen. Ian Khama, Mogae's deputy, won more than 2,900 votes,
according to results announced at the weekend.
	   Ruling party lawmaker Roy Blackbeard resigned his Serowe seat to
allow Khama, the son of Botswana's first President Seretse Khama,
to run for election to parliament.
	   Officials said the vote was a signal of confidence in Mogae and
Khama, a career soldier who resigned from the military to take on a
political role.
	   The Botswana National Front split into factions earlier this
year after the party caucus expelled its leader, Kenneth Koma.
	   He then expelled 11 party rebels who joined a new opposition
group, the Botswana Congress Party, formed to contest general
elections 15 months away.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government released a second draft
of a controversial Prevention of Discrimination Bill, aimed at
outlawing victimization on grounds of ``race, tribe, place of
origin, national or ethnic origin, political opinions, colour,
creed or gender.''
	   The earlier draft raised an outcry with proposals to give the
Government power to ban any organization and seize its assets if
any of its activities were considered discriminatory, a provision
critics said could be used against opposition political parties.
	   The redrafted bill, like the old version, omits any reference to
freedom of sexual orientation in a nation where President Robert
Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against homosexuality.
	   The bill, which could become law within a month, makes it
illegal to ``knowingly communicate a statement based on racial
superiority or hatred,'' risking fines up to 20,000 Zimbabwe
dollars (dlrs 1,100) and six months imprisonment.
	   Mugabe in the past has criticized ``hard hearted Jews,'' vice
president Joshua Nkomo accused traders of Asian descent of turning
city centers into ``Little Delhis'' and militant affirmative action
campaigners have threatened ``Rwandan-style ethnic cleansing''
against whites.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Components of two helicopter gunships
were found on a Russian-built cargo plane on its way to an
undisclosed central African country, a newspaper reported.
	   The Swazi News said the military components were impounded by
customs officials during the weekend and the plane was grounded
pending investigations.
	   The identity and status of the crew was not known.
	   Swazi authorities, worried the landlocked kingdom was
increasingly being used as a transit point for smuggling of weapons
and drugs, have grounded 46 mainly foreign-owned aircraft in recent
months after flight documentation was issued illegally by corrupt
Swazi officials.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa donated non-lethal
military equipment worth 230,000 rand (dlrs 36,000) to the
Organization of African Unity for its military observer mission in
the troubled Comoros islands, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   The equipment consists mainly of military radios, collapsible
rubber boats, water bottles and emergency medical kits.
	   The OAU sent an observer mission to the Comoros last November
after the islands of Anjouan and Moheli of announced their
intention to secede from the archipelago's government.
	   The OAU opposes seccession.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The Finance Ministry said it suspended
24 customs officers suspected of involvement in smuggling.
	   Pedro Bule, head of a unit in charge of customs reform, said the
officers were being investigated after 10 trucks from neighboring
countries were seized on their way to Maputo last week.
	   The trucks were loaded with foodstuffs, luxury goods and other
contraband with no proof that import duty was paid.
	   The trucks had entered Mozambique from Swaziland.
	   Bule said the Finance Ministry was stepping up a program to send
better trained customs officers to border posts.

Mahathir tells Muslims to pray less, work harder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir TV interview, last three grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Urging Muslims to evolve their
brand of Islam to suit modern times, Malaysia's prime minister said
Monday a more secular, less ritualistic faith was the key to
greater success and power.
	   ``Is it sufficient for Muslims to only pray and spend all their
time on certain rituals?'' Mahathir Mohamad told an assembly of
12,000 worshipers gathered to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet
Muhammad, the religion's ancient founder.
	   ``Not all ambitions and dreams can be achieved in the wink of an
eye.''
	   In his speech, Mahathir chided Muslims, many of whom, he said,
limited their practice to prayer and ritual and believed the
Islamic way of life should be a preparation for the afterlife.
	   Muslims should strive to achieve greater worldly success,
Mahathir said. He exhorted them to work harder at a time when the
country was facing its worst economic crisis in more than a decade.
Malaysia's economy shrank in the first quarter of 1998 and the
nation could slip into a recession if it doesn't grow this year.
	   ``Don't Muslims have to command and develop medical and health
knowledge? Don't Muslims have to command all knowledge that can
help save and defend the Muslims and Islamic nations?'' Mahathir
asked.
	   ``Where is our place in the hereafter if we only practice part
of the Islamic teachings? Are we not at fault if we ignore, even
reject the role demanded of us in the world?'' he added.
	   About 60 percent of the 21 million Malaysians are Muslims. The
others are Buddhists, Christians and Hindus.
	   In an interview aired over a government television station
Monday, Mahathir said Muslim countries cannot isolate themselves.
He said they must integrate with the rest of the world or they will
be sidelined.
	   ``It is no longer possible to be isolationist in any way. We
have to integrate, we have to bring ourselves up to the same level
in terms of science, technology and industry,'' he said.
	   The TV interview was conducted several months ago and aired in
the United States in February.

West African Airline faces loss of four jets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The debt-ridden West African airline
Air Afrique will have to turn over one-quarter of its fleet of jets
Tuesday to pay off its creditors, the company has announced.
	   Air Afrique, which is co-owned by 11 countries across West
Africa, will have to turn over the four Airbus jets to help pay
debts totalling $300 million, the Abidjan-based company said in a
statement dated Saturday.
	   Air Afrique will be left with 11 remaining aircraft, the company
said.
	   The statement said the airline would keep its routes going
between member states.
	   The company's financial plight worsened considerably after the
1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc, the currency shared by the
copmany's member states. The currency was devalued by 50 percent.
	   Burdened with a crippling debt, the company had announced nearly
two years ago that it would set up a separate company that would
buy the airline's fleet and then lease the jets back, but the plan
has yet to go into affect.
	   Air Afrique wsa set up 36 years ago and is jointly owned by
eleven French-speaking African countries: Ivory Coast, Senegal,
AMauritania, Chad, Niger, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Congo, Mali
and the Central African Republic.

Ukrainian women susceptible to illegal sex trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 1 million women seeking work
abroad are vulnerable to being ensnared by the illegal sex trade,
and the economic situation in Ukraine could increase their number,
officials said Monday.
	   ``Ukraine has become a major source of supplying women to the
international sex market,'' said Stephen Cook, a representative of
the International Organization for Migration in Ukraine.
	   According to IOM estimates, at least 100,000 of 500,000 young
women who have left Ukraine for jobs abroad in the past seven years
ended up in the illegal sex industry.
	   In an attempt to prevent the trafficking in women from Ukraine
and other Eastern European countries, the IOM has opened
information campaigns in Ukraine and Poland to warn potential
victims.
	   The idea of the U.S.-funded campaigns followed Hillary Clinton's
visit to Ukraine last November, in which she announced a joint
White House-United Nations drive against prostitution.
	   Representatives of the United States, the European Union, Poland
and Ukraine will consider similar projects at a seminar in the
western city of Lviv this week.
	   A nationwide survey by the IOM and the Ukrainian Ministry for
Family and Youth showed that many women often do not know that
foreign jobs might end up in prostitution.
	   ``Women use the freedom to travel abroad, but they often do not
know what is awaiting them,'' First Deputy Minister for Family and
Youth Iryna Holubeva told a news conference.
	   Most are lured by newspaper ads offering apparently innocent
work at restaurants, night clubs or modeling agencies, most of them
in Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey.
	   But after arriving, the women have their passports taken from
them and are forced to work as prostitutes.
	   Foreign Ministry officials say many victims usually do not turn
to Ukrainian embassies for help due to a lack of knowledge or
shame.

Fifth-century mall found under present-day Israeli mall site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a
5th century Byzantine shopping mall at a site in northern Israel
where a new shopping mall will be built.
	   The Byzantine remains were discovered during a ``rescue dig''
before the new mall is built in the northern town of Bet Shean,
renowned for its Roman ruins.
	   About 100 meters of road were uncovered, including basalt paving
stones, mosaic sidewalks, and the remains of colonnades and six
shop fronts, Danny Syon, an archaeologist with Israel's Antiquities
Authority and director of the dig, said Monday.
	   At the entrance to one shop, the sidewalk is decorated with a
colored mosaic showing a red foliage pattern and inscribed in
Greek, ``For the Victory of the Blues,'' Syon said.
	   Syon said there were two factions _ the Blues and the Greens _
in the Byzantine period that grew out of competing allegiances at
horse races and spilled over into violence and social controversy.
	   ``Apparently the shop owner was a fan of the Blues,'' he said.
	   Most of the street will be covered up when the new mall is built
later this year, Syon said, but the inscription and some of the
mosaic sidewalk will be preserved _ either beneath the modern shops
or in spaces between them.
	   ``The architect in charge of the new building is very much in
favor of preserving and displaying as much as possible,'' he said.
	   Syon said the roads and shops were the first significant
evidence of the southern section of the large Byzantine city of Bet
Shean.
	   Nothing was found inside the shops that gave an indication of
what kind of merchandise they sold, he said.

Aide: Lebanon PM wants to donate organs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's prime minister wants to donate
all his organs after death, one of his top aides said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri ``is ready to give away all his
organs to needy people after his death,'' the aide, Dr. Hosni
Majzoub, said.
	   Majzoub, an eye surgeon, was representing Hariri at the opening
session of a conference on ways to encourage the donation of
kidneys to needy children. Organ donation is rare in Lebanon.
	   The conference is being held at a France-chartered hotel in
Beirut by ``Help the Children Affected with Kidney Disease
Institution.''
	   During a debate after the opening session, Marwan Qabani, a high
ranking Sunni Muslim cleric, said the premier's offer would not
contradict Islamic teachings.
	   Many Muslims including scholars oppose the idea, saying that
human bodies are sacred and should not be violated after death.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and Kazakstan's leader
signed a key agreement Monday aimed at settling a long-running
dispute over control of the oil riches in the Caspian Sea.
	   The five nations on the Caspian have been divided for years over
the question of who owns the oil in the seabed. The three nations
with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into national sectors so
they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   But Russia and Iran, two nations with little or no oil near
their Caspian coasts, wanted the sea's resources to be shared by
all.
	   However, Russia has eased its position, and Yeltsin and
Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed an agreement
Monday that divides the northern part of the Caspian seabed into
separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
	   It's seen as a victory for Kazakstan, because it recognizes its
claim to the oil near its coast and sets a precedent for future
agreements. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Nazarbayev said
the agreement helped settle nagging political and legal questions.
	   ``This agreement will serve not Yeltsin or Nazarbayev, but
future generations,'' Nazarbayev said, according to Russian news
reports. ``Oil can bring either wealth or blood.''
	   ``It makes no sense to speak about the oil without ensuring
political stability,'' he added.
	   The Caspian oil reserves are vast, but developing the fields has
been a protracted process due to numerous legal disputes and the
lack of an adequate pipeline system needed to export the oil to
world markets.
	   Kazakstan also offered a compromise to help seal the deal. It
agreed to a sharing of the Caspian's waters, which means both
nations will have equal access to the sea's fishing grounds.
	   The other three Caspian nations were not part of Monday's
settlement, but the deal could set the tone for additional
agreements.
	   Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov visited Iran on Monday
for talks with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami expected to focus
on the Caspian.
	   The Turkmen Foreign Ministry was giving conflicting signals
Monday concerning the ex-Soviet republic's stance on the subject.
On one hand it said that Turkmenistan objects to division of the
Caspian into ``five seas,'' but added that every country should
have full sovereignty over its own sector, the Interfax news agency
reported. The middle of the sea could be a common zone, the report
said.

Gelbard praises Bosnian Serb leadership, pledges support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The special U.S. envoy to
the Balkans on Monday praised economic achievements of the
reformist Bosnian Serb government and pledged further Western
support.
	   ``The United States is a very pragmatic country,'' Robert
Gelbard said after meeting the Bosnian Serb premier, Milorad Dodik.
``What we are interested in is results.''
	   Gelbard cited the Bosnian Serb privatization law and ``other
clear measures of significant progress in terms of economic
development and movement to market economy.''
	   ``We will continue to support this government and the people of
Republika Srpska as they continue to move ahead in developing
market economy and move ahead to make the lives of citizens
better,'' said Gelbard referring to the Serb-run half of Bosnia.
	   The reformist Bosnian Serb government was elected last January
replacing the hardline followers of Radovan Karadzic, who has been
indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague.
	   President Biljana Plavsic and Premier Dodik won international
support after pledging to honor the 1995 Dayton peace accords for
Bosnia which ended almost four years of war.
	   Since January Bosnian Serb leadership have received millions of
dollars of reconstruction aid which had been denied to their
hardline predecessors.
	   ``Previous government was not interested in serious development,
it was interested in corruption,'' said Gelbard. ``This government
is interested in serious development.''
	   Plavsic and Dodik will run in the upcoming September elections
in Bosnia hoping to strengthen their rule and further sideline the
influence of the Karadzic supporters.
	   After meeting Plavsic in Banja Luka, Gelbard will travel to the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo later Monday.

Spain reaches agreement with Britain over Gibraltar in NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Foreign Minister Abel Matutes confirmed
news reports Monday that Spain had reached an agreement with
Britain to facilitate the use of Gibraltar in NATO maneuvers, but
stressed the accord did not change Spain's sovereignty claims on
the Rock.
	   As part of its push to recover Gibraltar, Spain has frequently
vetoed the Rock's inclusion in international agreements such as
those with the European Union and NATO.
	   Matutes said an accord reached between diplomats in recent
months would facilitate the use of Gibraltar for NATO maneuvers.
	   But he denied reports in the leading daily El Pais that the deal
included the lifting of restrictions which prohibit military planes
flying to the Rock from entering Spanish air space and vessels from
the British colony docking in Spain.
	   ``Spain has kept its stance, no restriction has been lifted,''
said Matutes. He also vehemently denied the NATO discussions would
alter Spain's sovereignty claim on Gibraltar, which it ceded to
England in 1713.
	   Under the NATO deal, military planes flying out of Gibraltar
which need to make emergency landings will be allowed to use
Spanish bases. Naval vessels from the Rock will also be able to
take part in NATO maneuvers in Spain but must return to Gibraltar
to dock, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   Spain agreed to discuss the Gibraltar issue and its uses for
NATO in February as part of a deal whereby London lifted its
objections to the establishment of a NATO regional command center
in Madrid.
	   Spain refuses to let planes from any European country fly over
its territory to get to Gibraltar, so air travel with the Rock is
mainly carried out via London.
	   Ferry transport to the rock is also restricted, leaving only the
land crossing between Spain and the Rock as the most common way to
reach the colony.
	   Gibraltarians overwhelmingly oppose becoming a part of Spain,
and Britain argues that it cannot hand over sovereignty without the
consent of the colony's residents.

European Bank abandons Russia's ailing Tokobank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with EBRD pulling its stake out of
Tokobank, increasing possibility it will collapse, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A troubled Russian bank was abandoned by a key
international investor, touching off fears Monday that one of the
country's largest banks could fail.
	   Russia is already suffering from a financial crisis and Monday's
developments raised new concerns about the stability of the banking
sector.
	   The ailing Russian bank, Tokobank, was the country's 12th
largest bank at the beginning of the year. But it has been
struggling recently and Russia's Central Bank took control of the
institution last month.
	   There was more bad news Monday when the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, which has sought to assist
struggling economies in Eastern Europe, said it had exercised its
option to sell its 9.6 percent stake in Tokobank.
	   ``This is dreadful news for foreign investors,'' said Nick Page,
a banking analyst at Paribas in London. ``This means the end of
Tokobank.''
	   The sell-off was certain to heighten fears of collapse in the
wobbly banking sector. Russia has more than 1,500 banks and the
sector has been regarded as fragile in the face of recent market
turmoil.
	   Margot Jacobs, an analyst at the United Financial Group in
Moscow said it appeared the Central Bank would not try to
intervene, and would thereby send a signal to other banks that they
must handle their own problems.
	   ``I think it's a good sign that the Central Bank is not forcing
anyone to bail out'' Tokobank, she said.
	   Russia's financial markets have been rocked by a falling stock
market, low prices for oil exports and the government's inability
to collect taxes.
	   So far the turmoil has been limited to the financial markets and
has not affected ordinary Russians.
	   But there are fears that the currency could be devalued, and
that would force up prices and deal another painful blow to the
millions of impoverished Russians.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin expressed optimism that the
government could weather its current financial troubles with the
cooperation of parliament.
	   The president said he was pleased that some bills in the
government's economic stabilization package have already won
tentative approval in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, and
there was progress on others.
	   The entire financial package was threatened last week when Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko vowed to come down hard on tax debtors
such as gas giant Gazprom.
	   Many opposition lawmakers denounced the move as an effort to
destroy one of the country's remaining economic treasures. The
government later eased its stance and agreed to negotiate a payment
plan with Gazprom.
	   Kiriyenko, in a televised interview Sunday night, repeated his
stance that tax collectors will clamp down on companies that
haven't paid taxes, including Gazprom. ``The state cannot live
without taxes, so we will be ruthless in connecting them,''
Kiriyenko said.

Ben Kingsley in Budapest for ``Crime and Punishment''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Oscar-winning actor Ben Kingsley is
starring in an NBC-TV production of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's classic,
``Crime and Punishment,'' which began filming two weeks ago in the
Hungarian capital.
	   The Russian author's psychological masterpiece, published in
1866, was set in St. Petersburg. But director Joseph Sargent said
Budapest was chosen for exterior shots because ``architecturally,
it is as close as you get to the St. Petersburg of the last
century.''
	   Crime and Punishment tells the story of Rodyn Ramonovich
Raskolnikov, a disaffected student who murders two women in order
to test his theories on self-determination and morality.
	   Kingsley, who won an Oscar in 1982 as best actor for his
portrayal of the Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, plays
the magistrate Porfiry, the detective, who torments Raskolnikov
with his investigative tactics.
	   Patrick Dempsey is appearing as the student Raskolnikov. Dempsey
was a teen idol in the 1980s ``Loverboy,'' and also appeared in
``JFK: Reckless Youth,'' and ``Jeremiah.''
	   French actress Julie Delpy plays Sonia, the prostitute, to whom
Raskolnikov confesses his crime.
	   Shooting began here June 22 and will move on to St. Petersburg
later in the month.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Iran have reached an agreement
that will allow Iranian pilgrims to visit Shiite Muslim shrines in
Iraq for the first time in 18 years, the Iranian Embassy said
Monday.
	   The pact was concluded after four days of talks between an
Iranian envoy and senior Iraqi officials including Vice-President
Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iranian diplomats said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq every year
until 1980 when the two countries went to war and Iraq stopped
giving them visas. The war ended in 1988 but not the visa
restrictions.
	   The diplomats, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity,
said the two sides have agreed that 3,000 Iranians will be allowed
make the trip to the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in southern
Iraq every week starting in August.
	   Baghdad newspapers said the Iranian envoy, Ali Asghar Haji,
delivered a message from the Iranian Vice-President Hassan Habibi
to Ramdan on Sunday in which ``the Islamic Republic of Iran
stressed its keenness ... to develop cooperation in various
fields.''
	   The official press has said Iraq has completed refurbishing of
Mundhariya, the border post through which Iranian pilgrims are
expected to pass.
	   Iraq's Al-Huda Tourism company and Iran's Morning Breeze company
will coordinate transportation and assist Iranian visitors to the
Iraqi shrines, most sacred in the Muslim world after those in Saudi
Arabia, the diplomats said.
	   The move will open a new chapter in stormy relations worsened
recently over the killing of two senior Iranian clerics in southern
Iraq.
	   Iraq's state-run media have highlighted Haji's visit and Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, in newspaper remarks on Sunday,
said the two countries are determined to settle the issue of
prisoners of war and missing soldiers next month.
	   Iraq and Iran signed another deal in June to resolve their
longstanding POW dispute.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees.
	   It was the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since
1990. The POW issue has long stood in the way of better ties.
	   Another Iranian delegation also visited Baghdad in June to
explore expanding ties in economic fields.

Clones' mother dies one day after giving birth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One day after giving birth to two calves described
as the first clones from cells from an adult cow, the mother died
suddenly Monday, Japanese scientists said.
	   An autopsy was being performed to determine the cause of death,
they said.
	   The so far unnamed twin clones were reported in good health. One
was taking milk and the other a nutrient medicine, said Toyokazu
Morita, an official of the the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock
Research Center.
	   He said the 6-year-old mother cow had given birth 38 days
earlier than expected. One clone weighed 16 kilograms (35 pounds)
and the other 17 kilograms (37 pounds), compared with an average
baby cow of 25 kilograms (55 pounds), Morita added.
	   Another four adult cows, impregnated with embryos from the same
cloning process, are in good condition and expected to give birth
on Aug. 13, he said.
	   He said the mother cow, whose birth Sunday was her fourth, had
no appetite Monday and a veterinarian injected nutrients. About 40
minutes later, workers reported that the cow was lashing out. The
veterinarian rushed back, and found the cow dead, Morita said.
	   The clones were born exactly two years after Dolly, the British
sheep that made history by becoming the first clone of an adult
animal.
	   The two calves are the second adult-animal clones _ after Dolly
_ and were produced by a similar technique, Morita said Sunday.
	   ``We have succeeded in producing calves from adult-animal
clones, meaning that we can produce calves exactly similar to adult
cows,'' said Morita.
	   He said the new technique would be used to breed better cattle
strains with higher-quality beef or greater milk capacity.
	   ``I think it's a very important step in the scientific
process,'' said Caird Rexroad, assistant deputy administrator for
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research service. ``There have
been a few questions about Dolly ... and confirmation would be
good.''
	   He said the Japanese success is important primarily because it
cloned another species. ``It suggests the technique may be
generally usable,'' Rexroad said.
	   Another cloning expert, Robert H. Foote, added that ``from a
scientific standpoint, it is very important to have done it with
another species.''
	   That's because it discounts the possibility that Dolly's success
was the result of some unknown characteristic of sheep. Cloning a
cow is also important from a practical standpoint because cows
produce more milk than sheep, said Foote, a professor of animal
physiology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

Protestants go on rampage after Orangemen blocked at Portadown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Parades Commission permitting contested Belfast
march, edits and trims &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant hard-liners attacked
police, hijacked cars and blocked roads in many parts of Northern
Ireland overnight after British authorities blocked the province's
most controversial Orange Order march.
	   ``This is a battle that has to be won _ no ifs, no buts,'' the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the leading opponent of Northern Ireland's new
peace agreement, declared early Monday morning in a visit to
Orangemen camped outside Portadown near a church where their parade
was stopped on Sunday.
	   The Orange Order did win a round Monday with the Parades
Commission, which had blocked the Portadown march. It gave the
order permission to march through a Catholic neighborhood in the
Lower Ormeau section of Belfast. That parade had been blocked last
year, and the Orangemen had accepted the ruling peacefully.
	   ``I sincerely hope that everybody in Northern Ireland will see
that the Parades Commission is anxious to take a balanced
approach,'' said Alastair Graham, chairman of the commission. One
factor in their decision, was the recognition of ``the very deep
sense of hurt'' among Protestants over parades which had been
banned.
	   Rioters confronted police and British soldiers in several parts
of Belfast overnight, and a policeman was hospitalized with a
fractured skull in Londonderry. Police said no serious injuries
were reported in Belfast.
	   They also arrested four Catholic men and four teen-agers on the
roof of an Orange hall in Newry, 30 miles (50 kms) south of
Belfast, on suspicion of trying to burn it down.
	   David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
party and newly elected First Minister of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, said he had been in touch with Prime Minister Tony Blair
and other officials seeking a way out of the impasse.
	   ``This situation has the capacity to destabilize, and if the
situation is not resolved satisfactorily, it could put at risk all
the political progress we have achieved,'' Trimble said.
	   Hotels reported a significant number of cancellations, which
they blamed on violence surrounding the march impasse, and tourist
officials said the damage could be long-lasting.
	   ``We have lost the potential for 20,000 jobs and we've lost the
potential for at least four or five years of at least 500 million
pounds (dlrs 800 million) per annum,'' said Roy Bailie, chairman of
the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
	   Disorder threatens to continue unless Orangemen are allowed to
parade down their usual route through the main Catholic section of
Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast. But Catholic
areas rioted in 1996 and 1997 when police and British soldiers
forced the same parade through.
	   Several hundred Protestants were camped outside Drumcree
Anglican church on the outskirts of Portadown.
	   ``It's impossible to make decisions that please everybody,''
said Mo Mowlam, the British minister responsible for governing
Northern Ireland, noting that the government-appointed Parades
Commission.
	   ``Mo Mowlam thinks she can break the backbone of the Protestant
people by facing down the Orangemen of Portadown,'' said Mark
``Swinger'' Fulton, reputed commander of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, who visited the encampment on Sunday. The outlawed group
resorted to murder in previous years in support of the Orange
marchers.
	   ``Portadown brethren have said they'll stay there for the year
if need be. It's up to us on the outside to do what we can to get
them out,'' said Robert Saulters, grand master of the Orange Order,
which has 80,000 members in Northern Ireland.
	   Orangemen and supporters pitched their tents in pastures around
the church, erected barbecues and played traditional Protestant
tunes on fife and drum near the ``no man's land'' designed by army
engineers.
	   A broad, deep trench and four lines of barbed-wire coils made it
impossible for them to breach police and army lines and reach
nearby Garvaghy Road, where local Catholics have organized
anti-Orange protests since 1995.
	   While Protestants insist their tradition of marching across
Northern Ireland each summer is unfairly under attack, many
Catholics say Orange parades are inherently anti-Catholic.
	   The confrontation inflames Northern Ireland's simmering
sectarianism and directly challenges the compromise spirit of
April's peace agreement. Among the backers for the deal
establishing a new government for Northern Ireland are the Ulster
Unionists, which is formally linked to the Orange Order, and the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, the catalyst for anti-Orange protests
in Portadown and elsewhere.
	   In 1996, police tried to block the Orangemen at Drumcree but
relented after four nights of disruption and bloodshed, including
the murder of a Catholic by the Loyalist Volunteer Froce.
	   In 1997, the police commander cited the prospect of random LVF
killings of Catholics as one reason why he forced the march through
Catholic protesters.

Croatia putting itself on the world sport map
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ After years in the headlines for war and
bloodshed, this tiny nation with a population smaller than New York
City is basking in the spotlight as Europe's new sport powerhouse.
	   One day after Croatia upset Germany 3-0 in the World Cup
quarterfinals, Croatian tennis star Goran Ivanisevic battled Pete
Sampras in a three-hour slugfest Sunday before losing the men's
title to the world's No. 1.
	   Not bad for a country which declared its independence from
Yugoslavia only seven years ago. That triggered a bitter war with
the Serb minority which was not finally resolved until the 1995
Dayton peace accord which ended the conflict in neighboring Bosnia.
	   ``Croatia is a Cinderella - a little servant girl turned into a
glamorous princess,'' former Boston Celtics star Dino Rada said
after Saturday's World Cup victory over the three-time world
champion Germans.
	   It was Germany's worst World Cup thrashing since an 8-3 loss to
Hungary in 1954. Croatia faces France on Wednesday in the World Cup
semifinals.
	   For the understandably proud Croats, the World Cup success is no
fluke. This nation of 4.8 million has turned out a surprising
number of world class athletes.
	   They include Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls, six-time European
heavyweight boxing champion Zeljko Mavrovic, and Iva Majoli, who
upset World No. 1 Martina Hingis last year to claim the women's
tennis title in the French Open.
	   In 1992, Croatia's national basketball team won the silver medal
in Barcelona in its first outing, losing out only to the American
``Dream Team'' led by Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.
	   The country's athletic success has given the population a
welcome respite from Croatia's political troubles _ the legacy of
the protracted conflict with the Serb minority.
	   President Franjo Tudjman runs the country with a firm hand. His
ruling Croatian Democratic Union holds a monopoly on power,
enabling it to control virtually all aspects of Croatian life
including media, politics and the economy.
	   Last month Croatia narrowly averted trade sanctions from the
European Union for its treatment of minority Serbs. Up to 180,000
of them fled Croatian army offensives in 1995.
	   Only about 30,000 have returned. The United Nations has
complained that many returnees face discrimination and in some
cases reprisals for injustices suffered by Croats during the war.

Prosecutors demand death sentence for cult member in murder of
</HEADLINE>
lawyer &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped first name of lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto, 4th
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday demanded the death sentence
for a former senior member of a Japanese doomsday cult for his
alleged role in the 1989 murders of an anti-cult lawyer and his
family.
	   Kazuaki Okazaki, 37, was the first member of the Aum Shinri Kyo,
or Supreme Truth cult, to face the death sentence.
	   In Monday's trial, a prosecution lawyer told the Tokyo District
Court that Okazaki's criminal responsibility was ``extremely
grave,'' Kyodo News service said.
	   Public broadcaster NHK quoted the prosecution as telling the
court that Okazaki strangled Tsutsumi Sakamoto while the lawyer
slept at his home in Tokyo.
	   Sakamoto, his wife and their infant son were murdered on Nov. 4,
1989, and buried in remote central Japan Mountains by cult members.
Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult at the time he
was murdered.
	   A total of six cult members, including Okazaki and former cult
leader Shoko Asahara, were charged with the murders. Prosecutors
have said Asahara masterminded those killings as well as the March
1995 gas attack on Tokyo subways in which 12 people died.
	   The cult has been disbanded and more than 100 of its members
have been convicted on various charges.
	   The severest penalty a cult member has received so far was life
in prison. That verdict was handed down May 26 to Ikuo Hayashi, 51,
a heart surgeon found guilty of murder for the Tokyo subway
gassing.
	   Okazaki, who left the cult in 1990, initially denied his
involvement in the murders of the lawyer and his family. But he
confessed details of his role in the murder in April 1995, when
police launched a full-scale investigation into the cult.
	   The ruling in Okazaki's case is expected sometime in the fall.
	   Okazaki was also charged with murdering a cult member who had
tried to quit the religious group in February 1989.
	   Asahara is still on trial separately for the Sakamoto murder and
nearly 20 other criminal charges, including another nerve gas
attack in the central Japan town of Matsumoto in 1994 that killed
seven people.
	   In a related development, the parents of a man allegedly killed
by cult members with VX gas in 1994 filed a lawsuit with the Osaka
District Court in western Japan Monday, seeking compensation from a
public system for people killed or injured while working.
	   The man, Tadahito Hamaguchi, then 28, died at a hospital 10 days
after the VX gas attack by several cult members. He had been on his
way to work.

Two Albanian arms smugglers wounded on border with Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Two Albanians trying to smuggle arms
into Macedonia were wounded in two separate incidents, the
Macedonian Defense Ministry reported Monday.
	   The first incident happened at noon Sunday when a Macedonian
border patrol intercepted four men with three horses, apparently
loaded with weapons. The patrol opened fire after the four refused
to stop.
	   One Albanian was wounded but all four managed to return to
Albania, the ministry said.
	   Late that same day, Macedonian guards opened fire on three
Albanians, wounding one, who was captured and taken to hospital.
The other two were also detained and more than 2,000 rounds of
small arms ammunition seized, the ministry said.
	   Officials of the former Yugoslav republic have reported several
such incidents in the past two weeks. The weapons are believed to
be aimed for neighboring Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians are battling Serb security forces for independence
for the region.
	   There are fears that Kosovo violence could spill over to
Macedonia which has its own restive ethnic Albanian minority.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ No longer content with the local
product, rats are crunching through the foreign-made cables of
satellite relay stations and some South Korean cars.
	   Two stations relaying satellite signals for cell phones were
temporarily shut down after rats munched away at their cables. The
damage was estimated at dlrs 20,000, the A.M. Press agency reported
Monday.
	   Many foreign cars also have had their electric cables destroyed
by rats.
	   Biologists say the foreign cables are ``more tasty for the rats
than Romanian ones and are therefore preferred,'' the press agency
said, without elaborating on what makes the imported product more
delectable.

Grenade kills two at amusement park in Cambodian capital

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded at a popular
children's amusement park in downtown Phnom Penh Monday night,
killing at least one person and badly injuring six others.
	   Police said the grenade appeared to have been tossed into the
park from a passing motorbike carrying one or two men. They did not
suggest a motive for the attack, but said they have initially ruled
out a political connection.
	   The blast occurred during the tense run-up to a general election
scheduled for July 26, but there was no obvious political target at
the site, which is near the luxury Cambodiana hotel and Hun Sen
Park.
	   A 19-year-old woman identified as Chan Pich Reasey was killed.
At least one other victim was critically wounded and near death,
and the other five were in serious condition, said an official at
Calmette Hospital, where the victims were taken.
	   The explosion occurred shortly after 8 p.m. while hundreds of
people were in the park area. Security personnel were on the scene
within a few minutes, and fired rifle shots into the air to keep
bystanders away.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. There are strict laws controlling
unauthorized possession of guns and grenades, but they are rarely
enforced.

Chinese director, first blocked by China, arrives in Spoleto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPOLETO, Italy (AP) _ After Beijing relented, Chinese film
director Zhang Yuan has made it to the summer arts festival here
hosting his play which was forbidden in China.
	   ``I don't even know why (I got my passport back),'' Zhang was
quoted as saying in Monday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily.
	   Zhang missed the opening here last week of his ``East Palace,
West Palace,'' which deals with homosexual life in Beijing, after
he was initially barred from leaving China to travel to the
``Festival of the Two Worlds'' in this medieval Umbrian town.
	   The title of the play refers to restrooms that are meeting sites
for gays.
	   When Zhang directed a movie by the same title which was
presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, he was not allowed
to leave China.
	   The festival, founded by composer Giancarlo Menotti, runs
through Sunday.

U.N.: Russia uncertainty threatens East Europe upturn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Tuesday, July 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Uncertainty in Russia poses the greatest potential
risk to improving economies in East Europe, a U.N. report said
Tuesday.
	   Japan's recession also could affect growth prospects unless
quickly reversed, according to the Economic Survey of Europe, which
also includes North America.
	   ``On balance developments have remained positive in the first
half of the year,'' said the survey, a 24-page update to the U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe's report for 1997.
	   The report saw a positive short-term outlook for most of East
Europe over the second half of this year. Hungary, Slovenia and
Estonia are likely to exceed expectations, it said. Prospects were
less bright in Bulgaria and Romania.
	   Although ``the outlook is not at all clear,'' the survey said
Russian economic growth could slip ``if instability and policy
austerity continue.''
	   ``In the second half of the year there could even be a fall in
aggregate output,'' the report said.
	   Russia's priority must be to fully reform its tax system,
addressing the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, the
report said. Devaluing the Russian ruble might ``provide some
temporary relief for the economy,'' it added.
	   Falling world commodity prices this year also have affected
Russia's export earnings, it concluded.
	   The commission's report for 1997, released in April, said the
apparent halt to Russia's economic slide had helped former Soviet
bloc countries to their first overall year of growth since the end
of communism. It cautiously predicted continued growth for Russia
this year.

Volkswagen AG returns to Balkans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo showing last preparations in the factory
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VOGOSCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The freshly painted walls of
the once war-ravaged factory echoed with new life Monday as
employees in crisp blue overcoats made the final preparations to
welcome one of the world's largest carmakers back to the Balkans.
	   The signing of the contract between Volkswagen AG and
UNIS-Holding in Volksburg, Germany Tuesday will mark the birth of a
new joint venture, Volkswagen Sarajevo, and the rebirth of an old
partnership.
	   Volkswagen will hold a 58 percent stake in the new company, and
the Sarajevo-based UNIS the remaining 42 percent. The company is
expected to assemble some 4,000 cars by the end of 1998, with
production steadily growing towards the year 2000, according to
Faruk Smailbegovic, the general director of UNIS-Holding.
	   The company will initially assemble cars from another
Volkswagen-owned company, Skoda, from parts shipped in from
elsewhere in Europe. The Skoda Felicias will be sold across former
Yugoslavia, with the bulk of them, 90 percent, exported to other
countries in southeastern Europe.
	   The first phase of production will be worth some 48 million
German Marks (dlrs 26.6 million).
	   By 2001, Smailbegovic hopes the factory Sarajevo's northern
suburb of Vogosca, along with other factories across the country
will enter full and independent production of Skoda vehicles and
parts and move into a second phase, worth up to 200 million German
Marks (dlrs 111.11 million).
	   The deal, expected to produce first vehicles by the end of
August, is one of the biggest steps forward in regenerating the
war-torn Bosnia economy, by providing thousands of jobs, helping
reunify companies across the former front-line and help the return
of 250,000 refugees from Germany.
	   Before war ripped across Bosnia in 1992-95, pitting the
countries Croats, Muslims and Serbs against each other, another
Volkswagen - UNIS joint company, TAS, opened the Vogosca factory in
1972.
	   The factory produced VW's Golfs and Golf pickup trucks up until
vicious fighting along the front-lines meters from the factory
forced them to shutdown and UNIS and VW put their business
relations on hold.
	   During the grim months of the siege, when spare parts virtually
impossible to find, the cars from Vogosca earned a reputation as
the most reliable vehicles for withstanding the tough conditions.
	   When the war ended in 1995, a group of TAS enthusiasts moved to
fix the damage at Vogosca. Redjo Djurdjevac, a technical director,
said more than 500 kilos of explosives were removed from the halls
and the surrounding area.
	   ``We were working here without salaries, without help, just
trying to bring the Volkswagen back,'' he said.
	   When it returns, it will mark turning point in cooperation
between the two Bosnian substates. Officials in both the Serb
republic and the Muslim-Croat federation and leaders of the joint
institutions, have pledged support to the project, allowing tax and
customs deductions for the new company.
	   ``After the Dayton peace accord, this seems to be the first
project in which all sides have found a mutual interest,''
Smailbegovic said.

U.N. prosecutors launch first genocide trial
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes prosecutors launched
their first genocide trial Monday by accusing a Bosnian Serb
official of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes,
torture and slayings of Muslims and Croats.
	   Prosecutors accused Milan Kovacevic of being a member of the
ruling Serb elite that initiated a string of atrocities committed
in the Prijedor municipality of northwest Bosnia in 1992.
	   The alleged crimes also included countless murders and tortures
in three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps: Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Kovacevic, 57, faces a total of 15 charges, including genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges. If convicted, he faces a
maximum life sentence.
	   His trial, the U.N. court's seventh, is expected to last for
months.
	   In her opening arguments, prosecutor Brenda Hollis briefed the
three-judge panel on the political background of Prijedor and said
the defendant ``acted with intent to commit genocide.''
	   According to Hollis, Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was among a
group of municipal officials who engineered a violent campaign to
expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and
December 1992.
	   ``Entire villages and hamlets were cleansed of non-Serbs,'' she
added.
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which directed attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   Hollis said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and
rape,'' while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to
stop them.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, Hollis added.
	   During the hearing, the graying Kovacevic sat in the dock and
took notes occasionally.
	   Hollis she would call witnesses, including a rape victim, who
would testify to the brutal conditions of the camps, as well as
introduce documents that would establish Kovacevic's leadership
during the alleged crimes. The prosecution's first witness was a
Norwegian judge who detailed the political background of the
region.
	   Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, contended there were no
concerted genocidal plans to expel non-Serbs from Prijedor.
	   ``For each and every one of the allegations, there is a
reasonable explanation,'' he said.
	   He stressed his client was appointed to political office by a
pro-democracy coalition and did not harbor ill feelings toward
other ethnic groups.
	   ``The charge of genocide (against Kovacevic) is improper and it
can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Vucicevic said.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
	   He was arrested at the hospital without a fight, but another
genocide suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police
chief, was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.
	   Kovacevic is the first to stand trial on genocide charges, but
he is not the only suspect facing that charge.
	   The tribunal also has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic,
for genocide and war crimes. The pair, the top two suspects, remain
at large.
	   The tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia. Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

Suspects arrested in slaying of two Ukrainian policemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police arrested two young men
suspected of slaying two police officers in an apartment building
elevator in the eastern city of Kharkiv, officials said Monday.
	   The regional police headquarters said the two suspects, aged 20
and 22, possessed the slain policemen's handguns and other personal
items.
	   The report, carried by the Interfax news agency, did not
identify the suspects, who were arrested on Sunday. It said they
were unemployed and had no previous criminal records.
	   The policemen, Volodymyr Obodovsky, 38, and Serhiy Krasylo, 28,
were shot dead last week on the sixth floor of an apartment
building in Kharkiv. They were going to check one of the apartments
after receiving a telephone call about a family quarrel that
allegedly started there.
	   Police in Kharkiv speculated that the call was staged in order
to lure the policemen into the building and obtain their weapons.

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Gabriel Amato become Rangers' second
major off-season acquisition Monday when he signed a 4.2 million
pound (dlrs 6.97 million) four-year contract to move to Ibrox.
	   The Argentine-born midfielder joined the former Scottish League
champions from Spanish club Real Mallorca.
	   Amato follows Dutch defender Arthur Numan to Rangers as new
coach Dick Advocaat continues his plans to build a team to
recapture the domestic League title.
	   Rangers won the Scottish League for nine years before losing

attraction for any player, and I have the same ambition as anyone
else,'' Amato said.

Norway's state bank raises interest rates to protect currency

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The state central Bank of Norway raised its
interest rates by 0.5 percentage points Monday, the second rate
hike in 10 days in a bid to shore up to value of Norway's currency,
the krone.
	   The state bank's new overnight lending rate to other banks is 7
percent, and the interest it pays on deposits is now 5 percent.
	   Jarle Bergo, the central bank's deputy government, said the
increase was made in keeping with Norwegian policy of maintaining a
krone compared to other European currencies. The bank last
increased interest rates on June 26 by 0.25 percentage points.
	   Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter, and a global
slump oil prices combined with fears that the country's economy is
on the brink of overheating has caused a decline in the value of
the krone.

China agrees to open skies to British carriers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese minister calling for British help with
trade in graf 6, Prescott quotes grafs 8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has agreed to give British airlines direct
access to Shanghai for the first time and allow more flights
between London and Beijing, British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott said Monday.
	   Although some details of the air passenger service agreement
were still being worked out, Prescott pointed to the deal as a
substantive achievement of what he called his ``successful and
productive'' weeklong China visit.
	   Relations between London and Beijing, poisoned for much of the
1990s by disputes over Hong Kong's handover to China, have greatly
improved in the year since Britain smoothly relinquished control of
the colony. Prescott was the fifth Cabinet member of the
15-month-old Labor government to visit China. The quickening
exchanges are scheduled to culminate with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair's trip to Beijing in October.
	   During a three-hour meeting Friday, Prescott said Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji conveyed his hopes for the Blair visit. The
British deputy prime minister said arrangements for the trip were
being made by other officials.
	   His agenda focused on a range of environmental and business
issues. The latter included shipping, finance, insurance, aviation
and water treatment. He brought along representatives from water
and aerospace companies.
	   Prescott also met China's foreign trade minister, Shi
Guangsheng, who called for British help in getting Europe to lift
trade restrictions on Chinese goods, including bans on frozen
chicken and seafood, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Under the air services agreement Prescott sealed with Vice
Premier Wu Bangguo, British carriers will begin two flights a week
to Shanghai this year with two more added in 2000. Weekly flights
between London and Beijing will rise to five next summer and six a
year later, the British Embassy said in a statement. Prescott said
it had not been decided which British carriers would get the
access.
	   Prescott hailed the agreement as ``a significant step forward''
in aviation relations between the two countries, according to the
embassy statement.
	   ``I have no doubt that increased trade, business and tourism
will justify further increases in air services soon,'' Prescott
said.
	   During a weekend visit to central Xi'an city, Prescott also
discussed a troubled project to build a 100-seat commercial
passenger jet involving a consortium of European aerospace
companies led by Airbus Industrie.
	   Prescott had high praise for Premier Zhu but he did relay one
complaint. He found the Peking duck he was served here not as meaty
as the kind he frequently enjoys in Britain.

Alleged kidnapper's wife turns herself in to Mexican police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The wife of a leader of Mexico's most feared
kidnapping ring has turned herself into police and helped them
recover dlrs 1.1 million, the attorney general's office said.
	   Adriana Suarez Arista is the wife of Aurelio Arizmendi Lopez,
who with his brother Daniel is accused of running a high-ransom
kidnapping gang known for cutting off the ears of its victims.
	   She turned herself into police on Sunday, the attorney general's
office said in a statement.
	   The agency says it has seized most of the gang's profits from
the last three years _ over dlrs 4.5 million in cash and nearly
dlrs 2 million more in property.
	   Police captured Aurelio Arizmendi on June 30 after a shootout
that wounded him in both legs. His brother, allegedly the head of
the gang, remains at large.

Clashes between troops and tribesmen kill 11
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen protesting gasoline price hikes
attacked an army vehicle with a rocket-propelled grenade, killing
eight soldiers, security officials said Monday.
	   In a separate incident, three tribesmen were killed in clashes
with security forces, the officials said. They said 16 people were
injured in the two clashes in which both sides used automatic guns
and heavy artillery.
	   The violence occurred Sunday in the district of Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital San`a, said the
officials, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Tribesmen and security forces have been fighting since June 19
when the government raised prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking
gas by 40 percent to meet demands by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The price hikes are among IMF requirements to remove subsidies
on petroleum products and other commodities by the end of 1998 in
Yemen. In its drive for financial reforms, the government has
already cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.
	   The government has not released a death toll from the clashes
but the Yemen Times daily newspaper said last week that 52 people
had been killed and 214 injured.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontentment against the government.

South Korean accused of spying must leave, Russian contact charged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS unconfirmed report of Russian diplomat's identification
in graf 6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A South Korean diplomat accused of spying will
leave Russia before Tuesday evening and his alleged Russian Foreign
Ministry contact will be charged with treason, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   The South Korean diplomat, identified as Cho Seong-ho, was
detained by Federal Security officials as he met with an alleged
Russian contact on July 3. He was released after questioning, and
did not explain where he had gotten Russian Foreign Ministry
documents found in his briefcase.
	   The Foreign Ministry declared Cho persona non grata and ordered
him to leave Russia within three days for ``illegal activities
incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
	   South Korea is reviewing the incident, and has not yet decided
whether to take retaliatory measures. However, a South Korean
Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed dismay that Seoul was not
consulted before Russia decided to expel Cho.
	   Cho's alleged Russian contact faces up to 20 years in prison if
found guilty of treason.
	   Interfax, citing unidentified sources, said the contact was
high-ranking diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, deputy director of the
Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department. Neither Russia's Foreign
Ministry nor the Federal Security Service would confirm the report.
	   Boris Neuchev, deputy head of Russia's Federal Security
Service's public relations center, said Russia has ``ample proof of
the suspect's criminal activity,'' Interfax reported.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, is responsible for
counterintelligence.

10 Thai former executives banned from posts with listed firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Thailand
announced Monday that it has barred 10 executives of companies
charged with financial wrongdoing from joining the management or
executive board of any company listed on the exchange.
	   Eight of the blacklisted executives were associated with the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce, which government regulators seized in May
1996 in the country's worst banking scandal in a decade.
	   An official investigation concluded that the bank had racked up
as much as 78 billion baht (then worth dlrs 3.1 billion) in bad and
doubtful debt and had falsified profit statements for two years.
	   The press statement from the exchange said the eight bank
executives have been charged by the Thai central bank with
embezzling the company's assets.
	   Two of those blacklisted were former bank president Kirkkiat
Jalichandra and Rakesh Saxena, an adviser to the bank who fled
abroad and is now fighting extradition from Canada.
	   Exchange officials said they issued Monday's press statement in
response to queries from local reporters about the names of
executives of listed companies who had been blacklisted.
	   Others on the blacklist are Prasong Panichpakdee, former
chairman of Somprasong Land Development, and Charn Uswachoke,
former chief executive of Alphatec Electronics. The two had been
charged by authorities with falsifying financial statements of
their companies.
	   Police charged Prasong in October 1996 with doctoring financial
statements, falsifying his company's reports and destroying
evidence. The move followed complaints from some company
shareholders that Prasong had falsified earnings from several
property projects in reports to the exchange, misleading investors
into thinking the company was performing well.
	   In the middle of last year Alphatec, the flagship of Thailand's
hopes to create a high-tech manufacturing sector, was rocked by the
discovery that at least 4.1 billion baht (then worth dlrs 128
million) in profits were falsified over the preceding three years.
	   Charn, the company's founder and president, resigned after the
figures were made public.

Report: Lower economic targets proposed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese government has proposed
scaling back its economic targets for this year, the
English-language Saigon Times reported Monday.
	   It quoted Cabinet minister Lai Van Cu, head of the Government
Office, as telling a news conference for domestic media last week
that the unspecified new targets have been submitted to the
Standing Committee of the National Assembly for approval.
	   ``We cannot disclose the new targets before the committee has
made its own decision,'' Cu said.
	   The newspaper cited sources as saying the annual growth target
would be about the same as the 6.64 percent that the government
recently reported was reached in the first six months of 1998. The
original target approved by the National Assembly was 9 percent.
	   In addition to the fallout from the Asian economic crisis,
Vietnam has suffered an estimated dlrs 1 billion in damage in
recent months from Typhoon Linda and the worst drought in a
century.

In sharp personal attack, opposition calls Netanyahu a liar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with special debate on peace process in parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp personal attack, Israel's opposition
on Monday portrayed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a liar
whose claims about Mideast peacemaking are no longer believed at
home and abroad.
	   Netanyahu's credibility has been questioned repeatedly in his
two-year rule by political friends and foes alike, most recently by
the Israeli president and the armed forces chief of staff.
	   In a special parliament debate on the negotiations with the
Palestinians, opposition leader Ehud Barak said Netanyahu had
squandered the prestige Israel enjoyed in the world following the
peace agreements forged by Netanyahu's dovish predecessors.
	   Netanyahu sat in the plenum impassively, scribbling notes, as
Barak turned to him and recited the names of foreign leaders who he
said no longer believed the Israeli prime minister.
	   ``Arafat is not willing to talk to you,'' Barak said, referring
to the Palestinian leader.
	   ``Bill Clinton doesn't listen to you. Madeleine Albright is
tired of your words. King Hussein refuses to talk to you. President
Mubarak is not willing to respond to you. Our president refuses to
help you ... Whom will you call, who will answer you?'' Barak said.
	   Barak then read out the phone number of Netanyahu's reclusive
American adviser, Arthur Finkelstein, who lives in New York and
reportedly has helped the prime minister extract himself from a
number of political jams.
	   ``Many times I've asked myself ... how the man behind the number
who never lived in Israel ... knows what to sell,'' Barak said.
``Here is the answer. Selling lies, bluffing, this is universal.''
	   Coalition chairman Meir Shetreet accused the opposition of
waging a campaign of incitement against Netanyahu, and drew
parallels to the personal attacks against Yitzhak Rabin that
preceded the assassination of the prime minister in 1995.
	   Just hours before the parliament debate, the issue of
Netanyahu's credibility was raised amid reports that he misled
Cabinet ministers about the decision to back down in a standoff
last week with the Palestinians over the use of a Gaza road.
	   In the standoff, armed Israeli and Palestinian troops faced each
other for 12 hours over a road Israel says it controls.
	   In the end, Israeli troops allowed a Palestinian convoy to drive
along the road after initially having refused to let it through.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet in Sunday's meeting that he was glad
the showdown had ended peacefully, the Haaretz newspaper said.
	   However, Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon told the
ministers that Netanyahu had complained to him in an earlier phone
conversation that he had not been informed about the decision to
let the vehicles pass and that he was displeased with the terms of
the deal, Haaretz said.
	   Netanyahu was evasive Monday when asked about who was involved
in the decision to let the Palestinian convoy pass. He said his two
main objectives were to avoid bloodshed and make sure the road
would not be opened to the Palestinians on a permanent basis.
	   ``The important thing is not the details of how it was achieved,
but that my two goals were realized,'' Netanyahu told reporters.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police fired rubber bullets
and injured 24 people Monday when separatist protesters flew a
rebel flag on an island off the western half of New Guinea,
witnesses said.
	   The island's military commander denied unconfirmed reports that
some protesters had been killed.
	   Residents said shots were fired on Biak Island, 3,200 kilometers
(2,000 miles) east of Jakarta, when security personnel broke up a
rally around a flagpole just after dawn.
	   For three days, the crowd of up to 700 had refused repeated
demands by the Indonesian officials to lower the flag of the small
Free West Papua Movement, which wants the province of Irian Jaya to
break away from Indonesia.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that 180 people were
arrested.
	   Biak military commander Col. F.X. Ediyono told The Associated
Press that police officers fired several warning shots. Later
rubber bullets were used on the crowd after four gasoline bombs
burned three street stalls and a house.
	   The injured were being treated in the Biak Public Hospital, he
said. There were no deaths.
	   All but 40 of those arrested had been released without charges
being filed, he added.
	   Three old hand grenades, thought to be left over from World War
II, were found among those being held for questioning.
	   Ediyono said police had tried persuade the protesters to lower
the flag and to disperse. Local Christian clergymen also asked the
crowd to go home peacefully, but were jeered by protesters, he
said.
	   The protest in Biak was the latest in a string of
anti-Indonesian rallies in the last few days in Irian Jaya.
	   Demonstrators have clashed with security forces in Jayapura, the
provincial capital, and in other towns. Officers have shot and
killed a student. One police officer in Jayapura died in a hospital
during the weekend after being beaten by protesters, Antara
reported.
	   Biak Island is part of Irian Jaya province, which covers the
western part of New Guinea.
	   Indonesia sent troops into Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony, in
1963. Six years later, in a U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the
territory formally chose integration with Indonesia.
	   The independence movement in Irian Jaya is not as widespread as
in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, where Indonesian
soldiers shot two protesters last week.
	   However, seizing on a new climate of political reform in the
wake of the May resignation of former President Suharto, activists
in remote, mineral-rich Irian Jaya are becoming more vocal.
	   Antara quoted the provincial police commander, Brig. Gen. Hotman
Siagian, as saying protests for political reform would be
tolerated, but demonstrations for independence from Indonesia would
not be allowed.

German dike reconstruction on Oder continues and on schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ One year after massive floods inundated
Germany's eastern border with Poland, reconstruction of weakened
dikes along the Oder River continues daily, officials said Monday.
	   Using gravel and dirt, workers have been strengthening the
100-kilometer- (60 mile-) long earthen barrier in eight places. The
breaks in the dike has been repaired by November, as soon as the
summer floods were brought under control.
	   ``We are right on schedule,'' Environment Minister Matthias
Platzeck said of the reconstruction work, which officials consider
a longterm project.
	   By 2020, Germany is expected to spend about 500 million marks
(dlrs 278 million) on the dike. About 29 million marks (dlrs 16
million) are earmarked for this year, Platzeck said.
	   Last summer's flooding along the Oder River killed more than 100
people in Poland and the Czech Republic. There were no fatalities
in Germany, where soldiers and volunteers succeeded in fortifying
the 250-year-old earthen dike.
	   The deluge caused more than 500 million marks (dlrs 276 million)
in damages in Germany alone, and thousands of people were evacuated
from their homes.

Observer mission cuts through tense southwest Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats gave negotiations a rest
and toured a Kosovo battle ground on Monday. After visiting a
devastated village that sparked the present violence, they pledged
many more observer missions.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, covered about 200
kilometers (120 miles) and traveled through the towns of Klina,
Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to Pristina.
	   Richard Miles, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade who
participated in the monitoring mission, said the diplomats were
trying to find out ``who can control the guys with the guns _ the
KLA.''
	   He was referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which refuses to
take orders from Kosovo Albanian political leaders in its quest win
independence for the province through force. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of the Serbian province.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, said both sides
had to show some give.
	   ``There is no way Kosovo can shoot its way out of Serbia, but
Belgrade cannot maintain a status quo,'' said Hill, urging Serbian
authorities to ``respond with a serious offer'' that would end
repressive rule of the province.
	   In a symbolic gesture, the group visited Donji Prekaz, site of
the Serb police crackdown in March that has resulted in the upswing
in violence and almost daily battles between Serb forces and
separatist ethnic Albanians.
	   At the village, in the Drenica region 30 kilometers (20 miles)
southwest of Pristina, the diplomats toured the ruins of houses
left in ruins by the Serb hunt for guerrillas that killed 80 ethnic
Albanians, among them women and children.
	   The nine-car convoy moved unimpeded through three heavily
fortified Serb police checkpoints on its journey. It departed amid
reports of fighting west of their planned route, near Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides, sending smoke
billowing into the air. Serb sources said the attack was started by
armed Albanians opening fire on Serb families, forcing Serb
villagers, aided by police, to repel the assault.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.

Japanese leaders send contradictory signals about tax cuts
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese leaders appeared to backtrack Monday from
weekend comments that suggested new tax cuts might be in the works,
roiling financial markets and signaling a possible rift in
governing party ranks.
	   Government spokesman and Deputy Chief Cabinet Minister Teijiro
Furukawa said Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi had misspoken when he
said Saturday that permanent tax cuts were a ``promise'' that Japan
intended to keep.
	   Furukawa said Obuchi, who was speaking after meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeline Albright in Tokyo, had simply used the
wrong word.
	   ``He was influenced a little by newspaper reports. He didn't
make a public promise,'' Furukawa told reporters.
	   This came a day after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto appeared
to step back from earlier indications he might be considering a
permanent income tax cut.
	   While on Friday Hashimoto said he ``hoped'' Japan would have
``so-called permanent tax reforms,'' he said on national television
Sunday that these reforms wouldn't necessarily mean a net reduction
in taxes.
	   ``I don't think the result of the debate will be a tax rise ...
but it's possible the result will be neutral'' in terms of the tax
burden, Hashimoto said.
	   Currencies and stock markets in Tokyo and around Asia dropped as
traders shook their heads at the apparent confusion within Japan's
government over tax policy.
	   ``It's just too confusing,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign
exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo had rallied Friday on Hashimoto's
comments.
	   Media reports over the weekend said the government was
considering up to 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in income tax
cuts for next year to boost consumer spending and help spur growth.
	   Japan is under increasing pressure from its trading partners to
boost its recession-bound economy and create a market for goods
from troubled Asian neighbors.
	   A growing number of voices both at home and abroad are saying
that Japan can only achieve this by slashing income and corporate
taxes and trimming the size of its powerful bureaucracy.
	   The need for additional measures to revive the economy took on
increased urgency Monday after Japan's central bank head warned a
recent government stimulus package may not be enough to offset
worsening unemployment and low income growth.
	   With upper house elections set for this Saturday, the
contradictory signals from the governing party suggested the tax
issue has become hostage to political rhetoric.
	   Traders said it may also be a sign of bickering within the party
between pro-business lawmakers, who favor tax cuts, and fiscal
hawks, who want to balance Japan's enormous budget deficit.
	   But even if Hashimoto's party takes a beating at the polls July
12, it is in little danger of losing effective control of the
government. That's because it still controls the more powerful
lower house, holding 262 of the 500 seats.
	   The Japanese currency fell 1.29 yen against the U.S. dollar,
hitting 140.53 yen in late trading. The benchmark stock indexes in
Tokyo and Hong Kong fell about 1 and 1.8 percent respectively.

Government OKs new contracts for 600,000 tons of rice exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has ended a drought-inspired
moratorium by allowing exporters to sign contracts to ship 600,000
tons of rice in the third quarter, the newspaper Dau Tu
(Investment) reported Monday.
	   In April, the government banned new export contracts and allowed
exporters to ship only 300,000 tons in June. Overall, the country
exported 2.7 million tons in the first six months of 1998, with a
target of 4 million tons for the year.
	   At the time, the worst drought in a century was at full
strength, and the government expressed concerns over ensuring there
was enough food for domestic consumption.
	   Delayed seasonal rains have since eased the drought, although
there now are worries about the possibility of serious flooding.

Tax plans, expansion costs, divide EU ministers

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in
Monday for what threatens to be a long, hard battle over how to
share the costs of expanding the EU into eastern Europe.
	   Austria launched it's six-month presidency of the EU, aiming for
progress on deciding who should finance the expected entry into the
EU of five former communist nations, plus Cyprus, around the middle
of next decade.
	   But positions appeared rigid. Richer members led by Germany,
insisted their contributions to EU coffers should be cut. Poorer
nations stressed EU aid money that now boosts their economies,
should not be diverted to the new eastern members.
	   ``This is not going to be easy,'' acknowledged Swedish Finance
Minister Erik Asbrink.
	   Monday's one-day finance ministers' meeting was the first since
Austria took over the EU presidency from Britain on July 1.
	   As well as the enlargement financing battle, Austrian Finance
Minister Rudolf Edlinger also faces tough negotiations on a
proposal to introduce an EU-wide tax on savings, to prevent
cross-border tax dodging.
	   Most EU nations support a proposal from the EU's executive
Commission for a 20-percent tax on interest gained on savings
accounts. But Britain and Luxembourg, whose banking sectors thrive
on low taxes, are reluctant.
	   ``The UK will be as constructive as possible, but .... we
suspect that making progress will be hard work,'' said Helen
Liddell, economic secretary at the British Treasury. EU decisions
on taxation need unanimous approval from all 15 member nations.
	   The EU has set a March, 1999, deadline to overhaul the Union's
budget in preparation for the planned enlargement to the East.
	   Germany _ the biggest contributor to the EU budget _ insists the
entry of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus must not lead to current member states paying more into EU
funds.
	   ``We must make savings and cuts,'' German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel told the meeting. ``There can be no doubt about the German
position.''
	   In fact Germany, which provides almost one-third of the EU's
dlrs 86 billion annual budget, wants to reduce its net
contribution. The Netherlands and Austria also say they should pay
less.
	   Poorer EU members fear that without an increase in EU funds, the
money that currently helps their less-developed regions will flow
instead into to the even poorer eastern nations.
	   ``There's obviously a difference of view,'' Greek Economy
Minister Yannos Papantoniou told the meeting. ``Greece feels that
the cost of enlargement could be much greater than thought.''
	   Austria's Edlinger appealed to his colleagues to ``face up to
our responsibilities'' to ensure progress on the question by the
time Austria wraps up its presidency with a December summit in
Vienna.

Donald inspires South Africa close to victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Fast bowler Allan Donald grabbed two
quick wickets as South Africa closed-in on a victory over England
in the third cricket test at Old Trafford on Monday.
	   After a fighting 226-run stand between skipper Alec Stewart and
Mike Atherton, England collapsed after lunch to be left teetering
on 323 for six at tea on the final day.
	   In an eventful hour after lunch, Donald removed Stewart and
Graham Thorpe in the space of four balls while left arm spinner
Paul Adams claimed Dominic Cork's wicket.
	   England was well poised to avoid defeat until Donald struck, the
score falling from 278 for three to 296 for six.
	   Mark Ramprakash and Robert Croft (eight not out) defied the
Proteas for just over an hour to recover England's position going
into tea.
	   England will have to survive another 31 overs or two hours after
the break to salvage a draw out of a hopeless situation.
	   The home side was following-on after being bowled in its first
innings for 183, and was still 46 runs behind South Africa's 552
for five declared.
	   Resuming on 211 for two, England's determined battle to salvage
a draw started to tumble when Atherton fell 56 minutes into the
final morning.
	   Repeatedly tested by Donald and Jacques Kallis with the second
new ball, Atherton's six-hour innings came to an abrupt end when he
top-edged a hook.
	   The former captain was caught at long leg when Makhaya Ntini
made a spectacular dive to get to the ball.
	   Stewart subsequently found a willing partner in Ramprakash (34
not out) as they added 52, but more importantly occupied the crease
for an hour and a half.
	   However, a sudden rush of blood undid Stewart's near seven-hour
innings as he hooked Donald to a square leg trap. Having hit 24
boundaries off 317 balls, Stewart hit the ball straight to Lance
Klusener at backward square leg.
	   Donald, in his sixth unchanged over after lunch, hit Thorpe's
off stump with a yorker.
	   Thorpe has been troubled by a recurrence of a back injury and
lasted just nine balls in the match to complete a ``pair'' of
zeros.
	   South African skipper Hansie Cronje's persistence with Adams
finally paid off. In his 32nd over Adams forced Cork to play on.
	   Ramprakash has batted for more than three hours and has added
just 18 runs in the post lunch session.
	   Donald has been South Africa's most successful bowler with 3-72
while Kallis and Adams have two and one wicket respectively.

First confession in doping trial of East German sports figures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German sports doctor admitted Monday
to handing out steroids, the first confession in a trial of six
communist-era sports figures charged with hurting swimmers with
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Dieter Binus, 59, insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill side
effects.
	   Binus, another doctor and four East German coaches are charged
with causing bodily harm to 19 young swimmers _ teen-agers at the
time _ by giving them anabolic steroids without informing them or
their parents.
	   According to the charges, the women suffer from such problems as
unnatural body hair, excessive muscle growth, voice changes or
severe acne.
	   Prosecutors say they have evidence that the coaches and doctors
knew the health risks of steroids but nevertheless administered
them under a communist state-sponsored push to create world
champions.
	   All the defendants _ including Binus _ had denied the charges.
But Binus reversed his stance this month and told the court he
wanted to make a statement.
	   Binus said he distributed the pills to the coaches, who were
supposed to give them to the athletes. The dosage ranged from five
to 10 milligrams over three to four weeks, he said.
	   Because the dosage never exceeded 1,000 milligrams per year,
damaging side-effects were not possible, he testified.
	   Binus also denied ever giving testosterone injections or other
drugs.
	   He said as doctor for the Dynamo Berlin team since 1979, he did
not make his own decisions, but was answerable to the doctors'
commission in the swimming association.
	   He said his co-defendant, association doctor Bernd Pansold,
decided which Olympic candidates were to receive the so-called
``supporting means.'' Binus said he wanted to quit in 1980 because
he opposed the drug policy and other ``political decisions,'' but
was unable to leave the club until 1986.
	   The other defendants are coaches Rolf Glaeser, 58, Volker
Frischke, 53, Dieter Lindemann, 46, and Dieter Krause, 50.
	   Binus' statement opens the way for the court to separate his
case from the other five, who have denied all charges. Binus could
be sentenced next month; the maximum he faces is a fine.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One day after handing over 182
kilograms (400 pounds) of gold, a popular Thai Buddhist monk on
Monday donated at least dlrs 1.2 million in U.S. currency to the
country's central bank, proceeds from a campaign to help the
government cope with an economic downturn.
	   The 87-year-old monk, Phra Maha Bua Yanasampanno from the
northeastern province of Udorn Thani, collected the donations from
overseas Thais as well as his devotees throughout the country.
	   His campaign, begun in April this year, was one of several
launched with the general theme of ``Thai help Thai.''
	   The other campaigns had limited success, but the respected monk
may have been helped in accumulating such a vast sum by the
widespread belief among Thai Buddhists that making donations to a
monk or temple is a meritorious act that will bring them rewards in
another life.
	   Hundreds of the monk's followers traveled from all parts of the
country to witness Monday's handover ceremony and make more
donations.
	   Sumalee Sertpannuk, 47, the owner of a gold shop in the monk's
home province, said she was optimistic that the money would help
Thailand survive the crisis if the momentum for the campaign can be
kept up.
	   ``But that means every Thai must help,'' said Sumalee, who
donated more than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of gold and more than
100,000 baht (dlrs 2,400).
	   Central bank Governor Chatu Mongkol Sonakul said that the dlrs
1.2 million cash would be held in Thailand's foreign exchange
reserve account in New York, while the gold, estimated to be worth
well more than dlrs 1 million, will be held directly by the Bank of
Thailand as part of its reserves.

Governor general backs multiculturalism in veiled attack on
</HEADLINE>
populist Hanson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The queen's representative in
Australia launched a veiled attack on right-wing populist Pauline
Hanson's One Nation party Monday, saying the importance of
immigration and multiculturalism to the nation could never be
overemphasized.
	   Without naming Hanson or her party, Governor General Sir William
Deane said all Australian citizens were entitled to expect and
demand mutual tolerance and respect.
	   One Nation has called for immigration to be drastically cut,
multiculturalism to be abolished and the funding saved to go to a
task force aimed at rounding up and deporting illegal immigrants.
	   In a speech at Sydney University and distributed in Canberra,
Sir William said Australia's strength was the unity of its people.
	   ``Apart from the Aborigines, we Australians are all immigrants
or, even in the perspective of modern history, descended from
immigrants,'' Sir William said.
	   ``Our real strength is that, while we immediately or more
distantly came from all the regions and races of the world, we are
united as one people.
	   ``The approach, the ethos and the conviction which make that
possible, and which have long enjoyed bilateral support in the
Australian parliament, are those of multiculturalism.''
	   Multiculturalism essentially meant mutual respect for, and
tolerance of, the different national, racial, ethnic and religious
backgrounds and cultures of all Australians, he said.
	   ``Our multiculturalism is not only decent, just and right. It is
not only our Australian way. It is what we are,'' Sir William said.
	   Meanwhile, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone warned Hanson on
Monday she may be stripped of her 24-hour police guard after she
ordered government-supplied bodyguards to evict a reporter and
photographer from a news conference, without giving a reason.
	   Hanson has had round-the-clock security guards since she
received death threats shortly after being elected to the federal
parliament in 1996.
	   Vanstone said Hanson was warned last week about using Australian
Protective Services staff to eject a former staff member from the
party's office.
	   ``If Ms. Hanson doesn't accept the arrangements by which some of
her security is provided then we may have to look at that
security,'' Vanstone said.

Pacific Dunlop sells U.S. battery unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Shares in Australian diversified
manufacturing company Pacific Dunlop Ltd. rose Monday after the
company surprised the market with a larger than expected sale price
for its troubled U.S.-based battery unit, GNB Technologies.
	   While Pacific Dunlop will now use at least some of the sale
proceeds to retire debt, Managing Director Rod Chadwick was coy on
exactly how the money will be spent, raising speculation that new
acquisitions may be in the cards.
	   Some analysts think a large chunk of the funds will be returned
to shareholders, possibly through a share buyback.
	   Pacific Dunlop sealed the deal Monday morning, agreeing to sell
GNB to U.S. lead-recycling company Quexco Inc. for U.S. dlrs 550
million (900 million Australian dollars), well above an anticipated
price tag of U.S. dlrs 427 million (700 million Australian
dollars).
	   GNB produces automotive and industrial lead batteries at 18
plants in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and
operates four lead smelters. But the operation had been troubled by
intense competition and margin pressure in the U.S. automotive
battery market, and operating difficulties at one of the lead
smelters.
	   Pacific Dunlop shares closed about 5.4 U.S. cents (9 Australian)
higher at about U.S. dlrs 1.72 (2.82 Australian dollars), having
hit an intraday high of U.S. dlrs 1.80 (2.96 Australian dollars)
after the sale announcement.
	   Chadwick was relieved to have sold GNB, which he said was ``an
under-performing business that had limited growth potential.''
	   The sale leaves the company free to focus on turning around what
analysts described as its weak growth profile and recent poor
returns.
	   In particular, Chadwick has identified the company's rubber and
latex unit, Ansell, as its main growth vehicle, and Ansell is
expected to be the focus for the company going forward.
	   ``It allows us, with the proceeds that we get from the sale of
this business, to invest in our growth businesses, such as Ansell,
and our remaining businesses in Australia, particularly our
distribution and our brand business, which we also see having quite
strong growth opportunities,'' Chadwick said.

but continuing professional soccer, ADDS quotes, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Three days after the Danes were
ousted by Brazil in the World Cup quarterfinal, Denmark's top
player Brian Laudrup said Monday he would stop playing on the
national team but would continue his professional soccer career.
	   ``It has nothing to do with the defeat. On the contrary, I'm
proud of that game,'' Laudrup was quoted as saying by Danish radio.
	   The striker, who signed a contract to play for Chelsea as of
next season, said ``it now is time to concentrate on my last three
years playing for clubs and (concentrate) on my family.''
	   Laudrup is leaving the turf at the same time as his older
brother, Michael, who ended his 17-year career after the tournament
in France.
	   ``I'm satiated with soccer and I happily leave the place to
younger forces,'' Laudrup said, stressing his decision was not
linked to his brother's departure or any problems on the team.
	   ``I'm stopping after one of the biggest matches which the Danish
team ever has played. One is satiated after reaching a World Cup
quarterfinal and (grabbing) the European champion title,'' Laudrup
said.
	   In 1992, Denmark stunned soccer world by defeating Germany 2-0
in the final of the European Championship in Sweden.
	   Laudrup, who informed Denmark's coach Bo Johansson of his
decision after the Brazil game, joined the Danish side in 1987 and
scored 21 goals in 82 matches.
	   ``I started at age 18 so I'm probably satiated before others,''
said Laudrup who turns 30 in February.
	   He began his professional career with Danish club Broendby and
moved on to Germany where he played for Bayer 05 Uerdingen and FC
Bayern Munchen. He later played for Italian powerhouses Fiorentina
and Milan before joining the former Scottish champions of Glasgow
Rangers.

Euro Disney strikers dig in; performers say no new talks planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After failed weekend talks, striking Euro Disney
parade performers warned on Monday their walkout over a pay dispute
will go on indefinitely unless management meets their demands.
	   More than 200 workers at the vast theme park east of Paris have
been on strike for two weeks, including parade performers,
technicians, restaurant workers and maintenance staff.
	   The parade performers _ who play the famous Disney characters
marching down Main Street, U.S.A. _ are asking to be classified as
amusement park artists, which would give them a pay increase of
between 10 and 40 percent. Currently they make about 7,000 francs
(dlrs 1170) a month.
	   The other workers are demanding a 7 percent pay raise. They were
continuing negotiations with management on Monday, but the parade
performers said their talks had broken down over the weekend.
	   ``There are no further talks on the horizon,'' said Giovanni
Savoia, a spokeswoman for the striking performers. ``Our strike
will continue indefinitely. The management knows where to find
us.''
	   He said that on Sunday, management had only offered a bonus of
400 francs (dlrs 66) for performers who successfully audition for
extra shows.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co., opened the park in April
1992.
	   It has reported profits for the past three years, in part by
cutting costs that occasionally have set off labor protests.

Russia to sign atomic cooperation agreement with Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Syria will soon sign agreements to
cooperate on the peaceful use of atomic energy, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   Russia will help build a nuclear research center in Syria, which
will be provided with a light-water 25 megawatt reactor, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia also plans to train Syrian specialists in a two year
program at the Moscow Physical Engineering Institute, the report
said. Syria may also purchase radioactive material from Russia for
industrial and medical use.
	   The agreements were drawn up when delegates of Syria's Atomic
Energy Commission visited Moscow last week.
	   Damascus does not presently have nuclear capability, and was
previously stalled in its efforts when Israel and the United States
pressured Argentina to abandon negotiations with Syria on building
a research reactor in 1994.

EU ministers see limited impact of Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU finance chiefs were upbeat Monday
that the Asian financial crisis won't stifle Europe's economic
recovery.
	   ``Despite the uncertainties of the world economy, the prospects
for Europe are good,'' European Commission President Jacques Santer
told a meeting of EU finance ministers.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy estimated the
turmoil in Asia would slice a ``modest'' 0.4 percent off growth
over this year and next in the 11 EU nations that are set to adopt
the euro as their common currency on Jan. 1.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said ministers
agreed the 11 euro-bloc nations would enjoy average economic growth
of around 3 percent this year. Although he added nobody could say
for sure what the impact of the Asian crisis would be.
	   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt expressed concern
about the dangers of the financial instability spreading to China
and eastern Europe, but he told reporters, ``despite the Asian
crisis, Germany is still on a stable path of growth.''
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission, repeated its
call for nations to take advantage of the upturn in growth to
strive for a balanced budget. Santer expressed concern that some
were not doing so.
	   However, Strauss-Kahn and others criticized the Commission's
insistence that extra income stemming from the recovery be used
exclusively to cut deficits. He said the growth dividend could also
be used for tax cuts.
	   ``We have to find a balance between reducing the deficit and
reducing obligatory contributions,'' the French minister told
reporters.

Bulgarian police arrest criminal wanted by Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian police arrested a man wanted by
Greek authorities for a murder allegedly committed in neighboring
Greece, the Interior Ministry announced Monday.
	   The man, identified as Todorel Tsiornovalits, has been detained
by officers of the Bulgarian national bureau of Interpol upon
entering the country.
	   According to the Interior Ministry press center, the 20-year-old
Romanian citizen was arrested Friday at the Kulata checkpoint on a
train en route from Greece to Bulgaria.
	   Tsiornovalits, described in the press release as a ``dangerous
criminal,'' together with his compatriot Konstantin Stoika, 21, and
Moldovian citizen Andrey Kaprari, 23, have been on the Greece's
most-wanted list since March 26, 1997.
	   Police claim that on Nov. 24, 1996, the three attacked a
shopkeeper in the Greek village of Velestino. The owner of the
shop, Christos Paparitos, was tied and beaten to death with a metal
object.
	   Stoika was arrested by Bulgarian police four months after the
Interpol bureau in Athens had put him on its list of wanted
persons. Kaprari is still at large.
	   Police announced that Tsiornovalitis will be handed down to the
Greek authorities.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's National Bank announced Monday
that it was raising key interest rates from 51 percent to 82
percent.
	   The new hike followed two interest rate increases in May, which
came in response to economic turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   The measure was widely seen as aimed at supporting the national
currency, the hryvna, which fell on Monday to 2.078 to the U.S.
dollar from about 2.06 last week.
	   The hryvna is facing pressures now because of foreign investors'
mistrust of Ukrainian financial markets. The government is
releasing substantial sums in redemption payments for domestic
bonds, and investors are believed to use the money to buy foreign
currency rather than re-invest in bonds.
	   Ukraine's National Bank and the government have vowed to keep
the hryvna within the exchange corridor of 1.8 to 2.25 to the U.S.
dollar until the end of the year.

Norsk Hydro hopes to merge petrochemicals unit with Dutch EVC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state-controlled Norsk Hydro ASA
concern Monday announced that talks were underway on merging its
petrochemicals division with EVC International of the Netherlands.
	   Norsk Hydro said the two companies had signed a non-binding
letter of intent to pursue a merger to create a major player in the
world vinyl industry.
	   Egil Myklebost, president of Norsk Hydro, said the merger would
create ``a strong entity with a good platform for future growth.''
	   EVC would have a 55-percent interest in the new company and
Norsk Hydro the rest.
	   Oslo-based Norsk Hydro, which is 51-percent state-owned, has
divisions for petroleum, light metals, fertilizers and
petrochemicals. It employs 38,000 people worldwide. About 3,000
people work in the petrochemicals division, which reported a 1997
operating revenue of dlrs about 815 million.
	   EVC International NV is the largest PVC manufacturer in Europe
and the fourth largest in the world, according to the news release.
It employs 4,000 people, with production in Britain, Italy,
Germany, Switzerland, and India and a turnover of about dlrs 1.2
million last year.

Russia, Kazakstan agree to divide Caspian Sea resources

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The presidents of Russia and Kazakstan sealed an
agreement Monday that could open the way for the five nations on
the Caspian Sea to finally determine who controls the seabed's rich
oil fields.
	   The accord signed by President Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan
Nazarbayev in a Kremlin ceremony divides the northern part of the
Caspian seabed into separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
	   It also allows for a sharing of the Caspian's waters, which
means both nations will have equal access to the sea's fishing
grounds.
	   The five Caspian nations have been divided for years over the
question of who owns the oil in the seabed.
	   The three nations with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into
national sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves. But
Russia and Iran, two nations with little or no oil near their
Caspian coasts, wanted the sea's resources to be shared by all.
	   Monday's agreement is seen as a victory for Kazakstan, because
it recognizes its claim to the oil near its coast and sets a
precedent for future agreements.
	   Nazarbayev said after the signing, ``it is said that oil brings
either wealth or blood, but we have avoided both.''
	   The Kazak leader said the agreement helped settle nagging
political and legal questions. ``It makes no sense to speak about
the oil without ensuring political stability,'' he said, according
to Russian news agencies.
	   Yeltsin said the two countries shared a long border and ``any
issues, even power supplies, have to be resolved together.
Otherwise, we will have enmity, hostilities and so on.''
	   The agreement was supposed to have been signed during a visit by
Yeltsin to Kazakstan last week, but the president's trip was
canceled because of economic problems in Russia. Eager to sign the
agreement, Nazarbayev came to Moscow for the meeting.
	   The two leaders also signed a document giving their cabinets two
months to settle financial disputes, including Russia's leasing of
the Baikonur Cosmodrome, before Yeltsin makes a visit to Kazakstan,
now scheduled for September.
	   The Caspian oil reserves are vast, but developing the fields has
been a protracted process due to legal disputes and the lack of an
adequate pipeline system needed to export the oil to world markets.
	   The other three Caspian nations were not part of Monday's
settlement, but the deal could set the tone for additional
agreements.
	   Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Khalaf Khalofov told the Interfax
news agency that Monday's accord was ``a significant step forward''
because his country had always welcomed the idea of dividing the
Caspian into national sectors.

Symphonist George Lloyd dead at 85
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Iernin cq in graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Lloyd, who wrote 12 symphonies in a late
Romantic style and had a fruitful association with the Albany
Symphony Orchestra in the United States, has died at age 85.
	   Lloyd died Friday at University College Hospital in London,
according to Albany U.K., the company which recorded most of his
work. The cause of death was not announced.
	   Lloyd had completed a Requiem, scored for chorus and organ,
shortly before his death, said Alison Lloyd, company secretary at
Albany U.K.
	   He had no interest in the avant garde, but proclaimed his belief
in the primacy of melody. ``Composers cannot go on despising and
ignoring their audiences,'' he once said. ``I like the same sort of
thing the average person likes. I write what pleases me.''
	   Born in St. lves, Cornwall, Lloyd began playing the violin at 5
and did his first composition at age 10. His First Symphony was
completed in 1932, and two years later his opera, ``Iernin,'' with
a libretto by his father, was produced at Penzance in Cornwall.
	   After the opera was staged in London, The Times' reviewer
commented: ``George Lloyd showed that rarest of all qualities in a
British composer, an almost unerring perception of what the stage
requires.''
	   His second opera, ``The Serf,'' was also well received in 1938.
	   Joining the Royal Marines during World War II, Lloyd suffered
severe post-traumatic stress after his ship was sunk on Arctic
convoy duty. He was discharged from the service in 1942 and was
unable to work for three years.
	   He began to recover during a long stay in Switzerland, the
native country of his wife Nancy. His Fourth Symphony was completed
in 1946, but years passed before his health _ and his career _
recovered.
	   ``If I sent the BBC a score in the '50s, they sent it back
unread,'' he once said.
	   Despite setbacks, he stuck to a style which many considered
old-fashioned.
	   ``So many people have no religion, no spiritual outlet. So they
go for music,'' he said. ``You can see it in their eyes when they
listen: they are searching desperately for something to feed their
souls. Twelve-tone music gave them nothing. Whereas I often get
letters from people who tell me that they have had trouble, even
tragedy, in their lives _ and that when they play my music they
feel better.''
	   Later in life, his career blossomed with the help of pianist
John Ogdon, who commissioned a concerto; conductor Edward Downes;
and the Albany Symphony Orchestra in the United States, which
commissioned his last two symphonies. The Albany orchestra also
recorded those symphonies and two others.
	   ``All of a sudden, buckets of dollars! I couldn't believe it,''
Lloyd said in an interview with the BBC Music Magazine in 1993.
	   He is survived by his wife. Funeral arrangements were not
announced.

EU ministers see limited impact of Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU finance chiefs were upbeat Monday
that the Asian financial crisis won't stifle Europe's economic
recovery.
	   ``Despite the uncertainties of the world economy, the prospects
for Europe are good,'' European Commission President Jacques Santer
told a meeting of EU finance ministers.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy estimated the
turmoil in Asia would slice a ``modest'' 0.4 percent off growth
over this year and next in the 11 EU nations that are set to adopt
the euro as their common currency on Jan. 1.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said ministers
agreed the 11 euro-bloc nations would enjoy average economic growth
of around 3 percent this year. Although he added nobody could say
for sure what the impact of the Asian crisis would be.
	   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt expressed concern
about the dangers of the financial instability spreading to China
and eastern Europe, but he told reporters, ``despite the Asian
crisis, Germany is still on a stable path of growth.''
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission, repeated its
call for nations to take advantage of the upturn in growth to
strive for a balanced budget. Santer expressed concern that some
were not doing so.
	   However, Strauss-Kahn and others criticized the Commission's
insistence that extra income stemming from the recovery be used
exclusively to cut deficits. He said the growth dividend could also
be used for tax cuts.
	   ``We have to find a balance between reducing the deficit and
reducing obligatory contributions,'' the French minister told
reporters.

Jewish group prepares possible suit against Swiss central bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Lawyers for the World Jewish Restitution
Organization are preparing a possible class action suit against
Switzerland's central bank for allegedly profiting from Nazi
looting of Holocaust victims, a spokesman for the group said
Monday.
	   Avraham Burg, co-chairman of the WJRO, has asked the group's
legal adviser to prepare a class action suit against the Swiss
National Bank, as well as against private Swiss banks and other
companies believed to have profited from dealings with the Nazis,
spokesman Yoram Dori said.
	   Dori said, however, that the WJRO had made no official decision
on whether to file the suit.
	   Dori said he had no details of the possible suit, and Burg and
co-chairman Israel Singer did not immediately return telephone
calls from The Associated Press on Monday.
	   Unlike previous class action suits filed against the Swiss banks
on behalf of Holocaust survivors, Dori said the WJRO suit would be
filed ``in the name of the Jewish people.''
	   Switzerland's three biggest banks _ Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank
Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland, the latter two which have
since merged _ last month offered dlrs 600 million to settle claims
that they stole the assets of Holocaust victims. The offer was
immediately rejected by attorneys for the claimants and Jewish
leaders. Burg called the offer ``very humiliating'' and said the
banks had brought up figuress in informal negotiations that were
``five or six times higher.''

Observer mission to cut through tense southwest Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to update with observers visiting destroyed
village, comments from Russian, U.S. diplomats, ADDS two policemen
reported wounded at Lodja.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After inconclusive negotiations,
diplomats on Monday tried a different tack to ease Kosovo's
violence, visiting the province's volatile southwest, the scene of
recent fighting.
	   The group of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States,
Russia, Poland and the European Union planned to travel through the
towns of Klina, Mitrovica, Srbica, Poljance before returning to
Pristina.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of the province,
which Serbs regard as their heartland.
	   The nine-car convoy departed amid reports of fighting west of
their planned route, near Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were shelling Lodja village from all sides. Serb sources
said the attack was started by armed Albanians opening fire on Serb
families, forcing Serb villagers, aided by police, to repel the
assault.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said two Serb
policemen were wounded by ``Albanian terrorists'' at Lodja.
	   Some of the route of the observer mission touches on territory
held by the Kosovo Liberation Army. A participant, Richard Miles,
the U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade, said the observers hoped to
contact the militant separatist organization on the road from
Srbica to Klina.
	   ``This is an inaugural trip, we have chosen the route carefully
to minimize the risk,'' he told reporters on departure. ``But
towards the end of the week, we will be pushing the envelope.''
	   He said the mission was meant to provide humanitarian
organizations and foreign governments an ``objective evaluation of
what is happening in Kosovo.''
	   Russian Ambassador Yuri Kotov said the observer mission would be
a ``stabilizing factor'' in Kosovo.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke spent the weekend shuttling between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
trying to lay the ground work for talks between the Yugoslav
government and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   In Pristina on Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks. The group is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.

Firefighters control blazes around Greece, fire continues in
</HEADLINE>
Cyprus &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Greece-Fires, ADDS details of blazes in
Cyprus, Italy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters managed Monday to put out
most of the more than 180 brush and forest fires that raged around
Greece, leaving two people dead and dozens of houses destroyed.
	   In Cyprus, hundreds of firefighters, forestry workers, troops
and helicopters from British bases on the island fought a brushfire
in western Cyprus.
	   Scattered blazes also continued to burn across the southern
Italian regions of Calabria and Puglia and in Sicily despite cooler
temperatures in the region.
	   Greek investigators, meanwhile, expanded probes into whether
some of the blazes around the country were deliberately set.
	   More than two-thirds of the fires began within an hour of each
other Saturday.
	   Hot, dry winds and a regional heat wave with temperatures above
38 degrees Celsius helped spread the flames that consumed thousands
of acres (hectares) of woods and grasslands.
	   In the past, fires in Greece have been set by people hoping to
dodge legislation that forbids building in forest areas. But
authorities have also raised speculation that organized arsonists
could have contributed to the rash of weekend fires.
	   Authorities have so far detained four people in connection with
the fires.
	   One man was arrested near the town of Volos, 160 kilometers (100
miles) northwest of Athens, on charges of arson after he was seen
setting fire to dried grass with a lighter, police said.
	   The other three have been charged with negligence.
	   Authorities were also examining part of a clock found in one of
the areas burnt to determine whether it could have been used in a
firebomb, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   One woman died on Saturday while trying to escape from a burning
house on the island of Salamina west of Athens. An 80-year-old man
also died when he became trapped in his home on the island of Evia,
just north of the capital.
	   More than 70 homes around the country were completely destroyed
or suffered serious damage in the fires. Officials on Monday were
still evaluating the extent of damage caused by the blazes.
	   Summer brush fires are common during the dry and hot Greek
summers, but the weekend blazes far surpassed the usual number and
were fanned by unusual strong winds.
	   In Cyprus, a fire in the Tilliria area which had been put out on
Sunday restarted Monday despite a drop in temperatures.
	   No other details were available.
	   The fire had left four forestry workers slightly injured over
the weekend and destroyed a total of 20 square kilometers (8 square
miles) of woods and wild vegetation.
	   The weekend fire also affected the Turkish-occupied areas where
11 people were injured, according to Greek Cypriot press reports.
One uninhabited village was completely destroyed, while two other
villages were evacuated as the fire approached, the reports said.

French lawmakers ratify agreement on New Caledonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with vote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ French lawmakers on Monday ratified an
agreement that could lead to complete independence for the French
territory of New Caledonia.
	   Deputies and senators meeting in Versailles, south of Paris,
voted 827-31 in favor of the so-called Noumea agreement, signed in
May.
	   The agreement, named after the territory's capital, provides for
a 20-year transition period toward independence.
	   A referendum will be held in December on a transition period of
``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago, to be followed in 2018
by a second referendum on self-determination.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called the agreement ``a
success for New Caledonia and France.''
	   ``It brings in a new period of peace for the territory which for
so long has had a troubled history,'' he said Monday, in an opening
address to the lawmakers.
	   Jospin said the agreement would pave the way for social progress
and economic development in New Caledonia.
	   France views New Caledonia as a strategic political and economic
asset in the Pacific. Controlled by France for 150 years, the
territory has about 30 percent of the world's nickel reserves.
	   It periodically has erupted in violence between pro-independence
natives and anti-independence settlers, originally from France.
	   The agreement was signed in Noumea by French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, officials from the main pro-independence party, and
French settlers who have opposed self-rule.

Guidant opens plant in Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLONMEL, Ireland (AP) _ The U.S. health products maker Guidant
Corp. will build cardiovascular devices at a new Irish plant that
will create 500 jobs, officials announced Monday
	   Guidant is taking over a factory abandoned last year by Seagate,
a computer equipment maker that had employed 1,400 people.
	   The 15.7 million pound (dlrs 21.9 million) project in Clonmel,
south-central Ireland, will be the first in Europe for
Indianapolis-based Guidant.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney said the existing facility,
plus a strong workforce in Clonmel, will let Guidant ``get a highly
sophisticated, world-class operation up and running within the
shortest period of time.''

President Clinton agrees to September summit with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton has agreed to visit
Moscow for a summit with Boris Yeltsin in early September, the
Kremlin announced Monday.
	   Clinton had previously said he would not take part in such a
summit before the Russian parliament ratifies START II. The lower
house, the State Duma, has delayed consideration of the arms
control treaty until autumn.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the visit from
Washington.
	   The Senate ratified the START II arms reduction treaty in 1996,
but the Duma has balked, saying it would weaken Russia's defenses
and be too expensive for the cash-strapped country.
	   Under pressure from Communists and nationalists, the Duma
reversed its previous decision to hold parliamentary hearings on
START II this month and postponed them until the fall.

EU agrees to peg African franc to euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers agreed
Monday that the euro can replace the French franc as the anchor for
the common currency used by 15 nations in central and west Africa.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the decision
should calm the fears among the African nations that replacement of
the French franc by the EU's single currency on Jan. 1, would
undermine their monetary stability.
	   Under the agreement, the French Treasury will defend a fixed
parity between the euro and the African nations' CFA franc in the
same way as it now backs the rate of 100 CFA francs to the French
franc.
	   ``This should definitely reassure our African partners,''
Strauss-Kahn told reporters. ``There was an accord accepted by
everyone.''
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired Monday's
day-long meeting of EU ministers, said the decision would probably
be formally adopted in September following consultations with the
European Central Bank.
	   The exchange rate between the euro and the CFA franc will be
fixed on Jan. 1, based on the rate at which the French franc is
absorbed into the euro.
	   The agreement calls on France to inform its EU partners of of
any plans to change the exchange rate between the euro and the CFA
franc. Entry of other nations into the African currency union or
other major changes to the system will need EU approval.
	   Despite assurances from France, the impending demise of the
franc provoked fears in CFA nations that they could fall victim to
the kind of wild financial instability that often plagues African
countries without a peg to a strong Western currency.
	   The CFA franc is used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Chad.

Poland and Bosnia sign reconstruction agreeement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The foreign ministers of
Bosnia and Poland signed an agreement Monday under which Warsaw
will provide dlrs 3 million in reconstruction aid to this country
recovering from more than three years of ethnic conflict.
	   After meeting with members of the collective Bosnian presidency,
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek signed the accord with
his Bosnian counterpart, Jadranko Prlic, the ONASA news agency
reported.
	   Prlic said the two also discussed bilateral relations, Poland's
role in the Bosnia's reconstruction and the work of Polish officers
in the International Police Task Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   The two agreed to begin negotiations on taxation and investment
agreements.
	   Prlic said that the Polish government is to open a consulate in
Bosnia next year, which is to become an full-fledged embassy one
year later.

Madonna expected to make London theater debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Madonna is poised to make her London theater debut
next summer in a revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Cat On A Hot Tin
Roof,'' West End producer Bill Kenwright said Monday.
	   Although contracts have yet to be signed, Sir Peter Hall's
production, with Madonna as the sexually voracious Maggie the cat,
is expected to begin rehearsals after the performer completes her
co-starring role in the film of the musical ``Chicago.''
	   The Williams play will mark Madonna's first stage run since she
premiered David Mamet's ``Speed the Plow'' on Broadway a decade
ago. The last actress to play Maggie on Broadway was Kathleen
Turner in 1990.
	   Kenwright praised Madonna as ``a feet-on-the-ground working
actress who knew her stuff and talked to me in a language I totally
related to.''
	   ``I'm very, very anxious it should work for her as much as for
me,'' added Kenwright, who, with Hall, will also be bringing Judi
Dench and Jessica Lange to the West End in revivals within the next
nine months.
	   Madonna is expected to commit to the role for 20 weeks.
Kenwright said he hoped a feature film of the production would
follow.

Norsk Hydro hopes to merge petrochemicals unit with Dutch EVC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state-controlled Norsk Hydro ASA
concern Monday announced that talks were underway on merging its
petrochemicals division with EVC International of the Netherlands.
	   Norsk Hydro said the two companies had signed a non-binding
letter of intent to pursue a merger to create a major player in the
world vinyl industry.
	   Egil Myklebost, president of Norsk Hydro, said the merger would
create ``a strong entity with a good platform for future growth.''
	   EVC would have a 55 percent interest in the new company and
Norsk Hydro the rest.
	   Oslo-based Norsk Hydro, which is 51 percent state-owned, has
divisions for petroleum, light metals, fertilizers and
petrochemicals. It employs 38,000 people worldwide. About 3,000
people work in the petrochemicals division, which reported a 1997
operating revenue of dlrs 815 million.
	   EVC International NV is the largest PVC manufacturer in Europe
and the fourth-largest in the world, according to the news release.
It employs 4,000 people, with production in Britain, Italy,
Germany, Switzerland and India.

World economic institutions say international community must stand

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Leaders of the world's economic
institutions urged Japan on Monday to shore up its banking system
and enact reforms so that the recent fall of the yen doesn't
jeopardize recovery efforts from the Asian economic crisis.
	   Wealthier countries also must support Japan and other nations by
granting new loans, restructuring existing loans and giving more
humanitarian aid, said Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Camdessus and James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank,
were among a host of speakers opening the U.N. Economic and Social
Council's annual session, which began Monday.
	   Japan ``is not just another economy, it is of crucial
importance,'' Wolfensohn told the gathering.
	   Camdessus said the recent fall of the yen was ``a crisis within
a crisis'' that reflected a serious lack of confidence in Japan's
financial institutions.
	   The yen's continued weakness ``could seriously jeopardize the
ongoing recovering of the economies that were hit first,'' he said.
	   ``A lot depends now on the aggressive and quick moves Japan
intends and starts adopting to rehabilitate its banking sector, to
adopt reforms that will provide significant tax relief to ensure
that fiscal stimulus is not withdrawn too quickly.'' Camdessus also
called for Japan to open up and deregulate its economy.
	   In addition to urging wealthier countries to help in the
bailout, Camdessus called on the affected countries themselves to
improve their own financial management and preserve the stability
of exchange rates.
	   The session was to begin considering the findings of the U.N.
World Economic and Social Survey 1998, which found that growth in
the dollar value of world exports was projected to fall about 2.5
percent in 1998, from 4.3 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1997.
	   The Asian crisis plunged several of the fastest-growing
economies into a severe recession and slowed growth of world output
and trade, the report says.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the session by noting
that the financial turmoil hasn't only affected South Asia, but
countries as far away as Africa, in the form of reduced commodity
prices.
	   ``The crisis has had its most devastating impact on society's
margins: on the poor and vulnerable who are least able to withstand
the sudden loss of jobs,'' said Annan.
	   He called for the abolishment of non-tarriff barriers, relief
from debt for poor countries and more humanitarian aid. He said
exports by the least-developed countries should be duty-free.

Netanyahu, opposition accuse each other of lying on Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes, EDITS to TRIM;
ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In stinging personal attacks, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition legislators accused each other
Monday of deceiving the Israeli people and foreign leaders about
Mideast peacemaking.
	   In a special parliament debate accompanied by non-stop heckling,
opposition legislators called Netanyahu a liar who has routinely
misled not only political foes but also his allies.
	   Netanyahu countered that the opposition Labor Party, which
governed from 1992-1996, secretly made far-reaching territorial
concessions to the Palestinians and Syria.
	   ``Don't talk to us about credibility,'' Netanyahu said, wagging
his finger at the benches of the opposition. ``What you should do
is sit quietly and with your heads bowed in shame.''
	   Netanyahu had not delivered a speech on the peace talks with the
Palestinians to parliament in seven months, and Labor forced his
hand Monday by collecting the signatures of one-third of the 120
legislators demanding a debate on the subject.
	   The negotiations have been stalled since March 1997 over the
scope of Israel's troop pullback in the West Bank, and there were
no signs that the United States has made progress in getting
Netanyahu to accept a withdrawal from 13 percent of the land.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak launched an unprecedented personal
attack against Netanyahu, saying the prime minister had squandered
the prestige Israel enjoyed in the world following the peace
agreements forged by Netanyahu's dovish predecessors.
	   Netanyahu sat in the plenum impassively, scribbling notes, as
Barak turned to him and recited the names of foreign leaders who he
said no longer believed the Israeli prime minister.
	   ``Arafat is not willing to talk to you,'' Barak said, referring
to the Palestinian leader.
	   ``Bill Clinton doesn't listen to you. Madeleine Albright is
tired of your words. King Hussein refuses to talk to you. President
Mubarak is not willing to respond to you. Our president refuses to
help you ... Whom will you call, who will answer you?'' Barak said.
	   Barak then read out the phone number of Netanyahu's reclusive
American adviser, Arthur Finkelstein, who lives in New York and
reportedly has helped the prime minister extract himself from a
number of political jams.
	   ``Many times I've asked myself ... how the man behind the number
who never lived in Israel ... knows what to sell,'' Barak said.
``Here is the answer. Selling lies, bluffing, this is universal.''
	   Other Labor legislators and Yossi Sarid, head of the dovish
Meretz Party, called Netanyahu a liar and quoted political allies
of the prime minister who have complained he has deceived them.
	   Netanyahu's credibility has been questioned repeatedly in his
two-year rule, most recently by the Israeli president and the armed
forces chief of staff.
	   In his speech, Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for the
deadlock, saying they kept refusing to carry out their security
promises, such as rounding up illegal weapons and reducing the size
of their police force.
	   Netanyahu accused Barak of hypocrisy, saying the opposition
leader himself had hired a Washington image adviser to help him get
elected prime minister.
	   He also accused the former Labor government of having ``bought''
a slim parliamentary majority for the 1995 interim peace agreement
with the Palestinians by promising a job of deputy minister, with
the accompanying perks such an office car, to one legislator.
	   ``You got the country into trouble with a very dangerous
agreement we were forced to repair,'' Netanyahu said. ``You did it
with the voice of one man, bought it with a Mitsubishi, more lies,
more theft.''
	   Coalition chairman Meir Shetreet accused the opposition of
waging a campaign of incitement against Netanyahu, and drew
parallels to the personal attacks against Yitzhak Rabin that
preceded the assassination of the prime minister in 1995.

Boxer accused of punching two police officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Former welterweight champion Charles
Murray was arrested Sunday and accused of punching two police
officers after a street brawl involving more than 150 people.
	   Murray, 29, was charged with second-degree assault of a police
officer, a felony. It was his fourth arrest in four years.
	   He won the IBF welterweight title in 1993, but hasn't had a
professional bout since 1997. His career record was 40-5 with 23
knockouts.
	   Police originally arrived on the scene to break up a fight
involving adults and children. The first officers tried to disperse
the fight using pepper spray, Lt. Mark Case said.
	   Witnesses said Murray was trying to break up the fight, too, and
was struck on the head with a nightstick by an officer.
	   Police said Murray punched two officers during the fighting.
	   Murray reportedly punched each police officer more than once.
One was treated for facial injuries at Rochester General Hospital
and released. The other officer didn't need hospital care.
	   Murray was treated for a cut on his head. He was held without
bail Sunday night until his arraignment. Case said police were
investigating the cause of Murray's injury but insisted any use of
force was warranted.
	   In April 1994, Murray was arrested and later convicted of
third-degree assault after a fight with another man in a pickup
basketball game. His other two arrests involved domestic disputes.
Both times, he was cleared of charges.

Wilson opts for Premier League survival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Danny Wilson went back on his promise to stay with
Barnsley but said a Premier League manager's job at Sheffield
Wednesday was a lure he could not refuse.
	   Wilson, who was manager at Barnsley for four years and played a
key role in the club's promotion to the Premier League last season,
quit the Oakwell club Monday to join Sheffield Wednesday.
	   The former Northern Ireland international had pledged to stay at
Barnsley after the club was relegated from the Premier Division
following one season.
	   But Wilson said he had to fulfill a ``once-in-a-lifetime''
chance to manage the club he served as a player for three years
between 1990 and 1993.
	   ``I'm delighted to come to such a big club,'' Wilson said.
``These opportunities very rarely come around.
	   ``The decision to come to Sheffield Wednesday was easy _ the
difficulty was leaving Barnsley.
	   ``Obviously there were a lot of sleepless nights. It was a very
tough footballing decision I had to make but I feel I've made the
right one.''
	   Veteran striker John Hendrie replaced Wilson as manager at
Barnsley for the upcoming division one season.

	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party appeared Monday
to have won its most dramatic state election in a decade, snatching
a governorship away from an opposition party for the first time.
	   As of 5 a.m. (1100 GMT ), the Chihuahua State Electoral
Institute gave the Institutional Revolutionary Party 48 percent to
National Action's 43 percent, TV Azteca reported. It didn't give
vote totals or say how much of the vote was counted.
	   ``Mission completed. We have triumphed in Chihuahua,'' said
Patricio Martinez, candidate of the ruling party, known as the PRI.
	   Even as Martinez led party members on a giddy horn-honking
celebration through the streets early Monday, the conservative
National Action Party insisted that its own figures showed the race
too close to call.
	   ``The coin is still in the air,'' PAN state chairman Guillermo
Lujan told supporters gathered before the party headquarters, the
sound of PRI celebrations echoing in the background. He called PRI
claims of victory ``irresponsible.''
	   The PRI itself apparently suffered a damaging loss in another
northern state, Zacatecas, where a man party leaders had snubbed
for the gubernatorial nomination jumped to a rival party _ and was
beating his old comrades.
	   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party claimed Ricardo Monreal
had beaten the PRI's Jose Olvera Acevedo for the party's first
governorship _ and in the north, where Democratic Revolution has
been historically weak.
	   The party's greatest victory came last year in the Mexico City
mayor's race as part of a national election that stripped the PRI
of its majority in the lower house of Congress for the first time.
	   Election officials said a quick count of 25 percent of precincts
showed Monreal with 74,298 votes to 62,559 for Olvera. No
percentages were given.
	   However, the PRI was leading in most state legislative districts
and cities _ indicting that many PRI voters crossed over to vote
for Monreal but stayed loyal to other candidates.
	   Early returns indicated that the PRI had easily held the
governorship in Durango, a third northern state.
	   But the most closely watched race was in Chihuahua. A PRI
victory in that state would deflate the widespread idea that the
party is steadily unraveling after a series of electoral setbacks.
	   It also would be a successful test of the PRI's experiment with
an open primary in the state, open to voters of any party. It was
an unprecedented break with the usual policy of having party
leaders choose candidates.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has said he favors a similar system to
chose the party's presidential candidate in 2000, though some party
leaders are wary of the idea.
	   Chihuahua would be an especially bitter loss for National
Action, whose founder and many leading officials came from the
state.
	   The PRI, founded in 1929, did not accept defeat in any state
until 1989. Since then it has lost Baja California (twice),
Chihuahua, Jalisco, Nuevo Leon, Guanajuato and Queretaro, all to
National Action.

Turkmenistan, Iran call for equitable share of Caspian Sea riches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Khatami, Niyazov meeting, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The presidents of Turkmenistan and Iran on
Monday said the riches of the Caspian Sea, one of the world's most
promising sources of oil and gas, should be divided equally between
the countries bordering it.
	   During their talks, Presidents Mohammad Khatami and Separmurat
Niyazov of Turkmenistan also called for the implementation of a law
protecting the interests of the Caspian Sea states, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Russia, Kazakstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran are at odds
over control of the sea and how to split its vast natural
resources.
	   Iran has close economic ties with Turkmenistan, its northern
neighbor. A gas pipeline inaugurated earlier this year pumps 3.8
billion cubic meters (133 billion cubic feet) of natural gas a year
from Turkmenistan to Iran.
	   IRNA said Khatami and Niyazov agreed to form six specialized
committees on oil and gas, commerce, health, transport and
telecommunications, finance and banking, and energy.
	   Niyazov is accompanied by his oil minister and several other
senior officials.

Michels in hospital after heart attack; Dutch injury problems;
</HEADLINE>
semifinal referees announced &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ His country headed for a World Cup semifinal
showdown with defending titlist Brazil, former Dutch national team
coach Rinus Michels was in hospital Monday after suffering a heart
attack.
	   The 70-year-old, who guided the Dutch to a 1988 European
Championship after taking the team to World Cup finals in '74 and
'78, was stricken after the Netherlands-Argentina quarterfinal
Saturday and was treated at the game in Marseille by Argentine team
physician Dr. Raul Madero.
	   Michels, who had a heart-bypass operation 15 years ago, was
taken to hospital in Paris.
	   ``His condition has improved to stable and he is expected to
stay in the hospital for a couple days yet,'' said FIFA spokesman
Keith Cooper.
	   The Dutch team, meanwhile, was hoping to come through another
day's preparation without losing another player.
	   Defender Winston Bogarde broke a bone in his lower right leg in
practice on Sunday and forward Marc Overmars was struggling to
recover from a hamstring problem. Aron Winter and Michael Reiziger
also were receiving treatment for injuries following the 2-1
triumph over Argentina.
	   ``We cannot be very optimistic,'' coach Guus Hiddink said of
Overmars, who aggravated the injury when he appeared as a
substitute against Argentina.
	   ``It was the third time he had made the injury worse during the
tournament and we do not anticipate too much luck for him in this
case. It is very doubtful that he will play.''
	   The winner of the Brazil-Netherlands semifinal in Marseille on
Tuesday will face either host France or World Cup rookie Croatia,
which meet at the Stade de France on Wednesday.
	   FIFA on Monday announced the names of the referees and linesman
for the two semifinals.
	   Ali Mohamed Bujsaim of the United Arab Emirates was chosen to
referee Tuesday's Brazil-Netherlands match, with linesmen Hussein
Ghadanfari of Kuwait and Mohamed Ahmed Al Musawi of Oman.
	   For the France-Croatia match in Saint-Denis, the referee will be
Jose-Manuel Garcia of Spain, who was in charge of the opening game
between Brazil and Scotland back on June 10. Running the lines will
be another Spaniard, Fernando Tresaco, along with Jorge Alberto
Diaz of Chile.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic stunned French reporters at a
news conference Monday when he declared that the host's defense was
``not that strong'' even though it has conceded only one goal in
the tournament.
	   His logic was that defenders Bixente Lizarazu and Lilian Thuram
often left France exposed on their frequent forays up the field.
	   ``Luckily for us, they haven't had much success in finishing,''
Blazevic said. ``And when Thuram and Lizarazu leave the flanks
open, the defense is vulnerable.''
	   Team captain Zvonimir Boban, who is adding World Cup glory to
his club achievements at AC Milan, was more circumspect.
	   ``We feel very proud, but we don't want to start dreaming,'' he
said Monday. ``We have great confidence. Our people are in a
trance, and this is great also for us.''

Indian police capture suspected militants, seize weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Police raided the hide-outs of separatist
guerrillas in Kashmir over the weekend, arresting five top ranking
militants and seizing a large amount of arms, ammunition and
explosives, a commander said Monday.
	   Police Inspector General P.S. Gill said the operation in
Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, was based on
information from an informer.
	   Gill identified one suspect as Nazir Ahmad Sheikh, in charge of
publicity and arms supplies for the powerful Hizbul Mujahideen
group. Two other militants from the same organization were
captured, he said. Tariq Ahmad, commander of operations of the
smaller Al-Jihad organization, also was captured, Gill said. The
fifth suspect was not identified.
	   A cache of rifles, pistols, silencers, rocket launchers,
grenades, wireless sets, detonators and the RDX explosives was
recovered, Gill said.
	   Dozens of separatist groups are fighting Indian security forces
in Kashmir, seeking either independence or a merger with
neighboring Pakistan, which claims Kashmir. Kashmir is the only
Muslim majority state in predominantly Hindu India.

San Fermin's raucous festival kicks off with risky bull running
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Showered with sparkling wine, splattered
with eggs and caked in flour, crowds crammed into Pamplona's city
center on Monday for the so-called `Chupinazo' rocket blast to kick
off the San Fermin festival best known for its dangerous early
morning bull runs.
	   Among the crowds were tens of thousands of foreigners, many of
them annual visitors to this northern city for nine days of
reveling that inspired Ernest Hemingway's 1927 novel ``Fiesta, The
Sun Also Rises.''
	   When Hemingway first came to San Fermin in the early 1920s, the
afternoon bullfights were the main attraction, along with non-stop
drinking. But over the years the limelight has been snatched by the
bull runs.
	   Every morning the daring and the foolhardy scramble before the
stampeding animals as they are herded through the town and into the
bullring where they will be killed by matadors later in the day.
	   ``There is no thrill like it. You hear the bull snorting as he
comes up behind you. He is 1,600 pounds (915 kg) of muscle and he
knows it,'' said Bob Lombardo, a 45-year-old computer programmer
from Philadelphia who was preparing, with copious amounts of beer,
for his 11th year running with the bulls.
	   Dressed in the traditional white San Fermin outfit with a red
kerchief and sash, Pamplona's mayor Javier Chourrant, 62, recalled
a ``more intimate and family-based fiesta'' before the
international hoards arrived.
	   ``But you can't avoid it and everybody is welcome'' he said,
just before the Chupinazo rocket was shot from the balcony on the
Baroque town hall, sending the crowds below into a frenzy of
singing and jumping as corks popped on bottles of sparkling wine.
	   Political tension has also become a traditional part of San
Fermin, with supporters of the armed Basque separatist organization
ETA making their presence felt.
	   Up on the balcony, a scuffle broke out between youths draping a
pro-ETA banner over the facade and an angry middle-aged man
snatching it from them.
	   This year 10 councilors stayed away from the opening day's
revelry to mourn Tomas Caballero, a Pamplona councilor shot dead by
ETA exactly two months ago.
	   Pamplona is the capital of Navarra province, which ETA wants to
incorporate into the independent Basque nation it has been fighting
to create since the 1960s.
	   Historians say dare-devils flaunting authority began running
with the bulls four centuries ago. Nowadays a firework rocket at 8
a.m. sharp sets off the 850-meter (yard) charge uphill from the
corral where the bulls are kept overnight into the heart of the
city's old town, over the cobbled streets and into the bull ring.
	   Injuries are common and death is always a possibility.
	   A nervous novice on the eve of his first run, 33-year-old
American Airlines flight attendant Shawn Wilson said: ``The best
piece of advice that I've heard is that when the rocket goes off on
Tuesday morning you are on your own.''
	   The tourist literature distributed around Pamplona prints
warnings in all major languages.
	   ``If you fall during the running, protect your head with your
hands and lie still until all the bulls have passed'' and ``Do not
challenge, touch or otherwise distract the bulls. This can be
fatal.''
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American gored to death in
1995, the 13th runner to die since records began in 1924, and the
first since 1980.

Uzbek court sentences eight Wahhabites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Supreme Court in Uzbekistan sentenced seven
members of an Islamic sect on Monday to jail terms ranging from
three to 10 years and ordered the death penalty for an eighth, a
news agency reported.
	   The eight Wahhabites were convicted of attempting to undermine
the constitutional system, terrorism, inflaming ethnic animosity
and illegal possession of weapons and drugs, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   One of the eight, Talib Mamadzhanov, was sentenced to death
after he was convicted of killing five people, including a
policeman.
	   The other seven were sentenced to prison terms of three to 10
years, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Monday's sentencing culminates a series of public hearings over
events in the town of Namangan last December when several armed
people broke into the house of a traffic policeman. The officer had
been beheaded.
	   Uzbek authorities blamed his death on Wahhabites, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect, who they accuse of trying to undermine
the country's political system.

U.N. prosecutors launch first genocide trial

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes prosecutors launched
their first genocide trial Monday by accusing a Bosnian Serb
official of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes,
torture and slayings of Muslims and Croats.
	   Prosecutors accused Milan Kovacevic of being a member of the
ruling Serb elite that initiated a string of atrocities committed
in the Prijedor municipality of northwest Bosnia in 1992.
	   The alleged crimes also included murders and tortures in three
of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps: Omarska, Keraterm
and Trnopolje.
	   Kovacevic, 57, faces 15 charges, including genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges. If convicted, he faces a
maximum life sentence.
	   His trial, the U.N. court's seventh, is expected to last for
months.
	   In her opening arguments, prosecutor Brenda Hollis briefed the
three-judge panel on the political background of Prijedor and said
the defendant ``acted with intent to commit genocide.''
	   According to Hollis, Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was among a
group of municipal officials who engineered a violent campaign to
expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and
December 1992.
	   ``Entire villages and hamlets were cleansed of non-Serbs,'' she
added.
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which directed attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   Hollis said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and
rape,'' while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to
stop them.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, Hollis added.
	   During the hearing, the graying Kovacevic sat in the dock and
took notes occasionally.
	   Hollis she would call witnesses, including a rape victim, who
would testify to the brutal conditions of the camps, as well as
introduce documents that would establish Kovacevic's leadership
during the alleged crimes. The prosecution's first witness was a
Norwegian judge who detailed the political background of the
region.
	   Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, contended there were no
concerted genocidal plans to expel non-Serbs from Prijedor.
	   ``For each and every one of the allegations, there is a
reasonable explanation,'' he said.
	   He stressed his client was appointed to political office by a
pro-democracy coalition and did not harbor ill feelings toward
other ethnic groups.
	   ``The charge of genocide (against Kovacevic) is improper and it
can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Vucicevic said.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
	   He was arrested at the hospital without a fight, but another
genocide suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police
chief, was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.
	   Kovacevic is the first to stand trial on genocide charges, but
he is not the only suspect facing that charge.
	   The tribunal also has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic,
for genocide and war crimes. The pair, the top two suspects, remain
at large.
	   The tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia. Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

German munitions experts defuse uncovered World War II bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ About 5,000 people were evacuated
for four hours Monday as munitions experts defused an old World War
II bomb uncovered in Oranienburg, about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
north of Berlin, city officials said.
	   The 500 kilogram (1,100 pound) bomb, the 58th uncovered and
defused in Oranienburg in the past seven years, was found by
workmen constructing a new canal last week, a city statement said.
	   Police cleared out residents and blocked off an area some 800
meters (875 yards) from the bomb, with some streetcars and other
traffic delayed until it was defused.
	   Oranienburg was the site of a German munitions factory during
the war, and a prime target of western allied bombers.
	   Most old bombs uncovered since unification in 1990 have been
found while excavating at new construction sites during rebuilding
in former communist east Germany.

World Cup: Lacking superstars, refs hold the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ In a World Cup marked by some brilliant
goals, dramatic penalty kick shootouts and the sudden emergence of
Croatia, too often the focus has been the officiating.
	   And, too often for the liking of coaches and players, the refs
have reached into their pockets for yellow and red cards.
	   ``Sometimes, FIFA puts referees on the field who have only
officiated second-rate matches,'' said Germany's Lothar Matthaeus,
who has appeared in more World Cup games than anyone.
	   All during this Cup, which has reached the semifinal stage, the
refs have been center stage.
	   Already, a record 20 red cards ejecting players have been handed
out. There have been 238 yellow-card warnings, including three
cases where a player drew two in a game and was expelled.
	   The ejection leader in the homestretch is Mexico's Arturo
Brizio, who threw out three players in one game in the first round,
two more in the Netherlands-Argentina quarterfinals (Dutch defender
Arthur Numan drew two yellows) and, with seven reds in six matches,
already has set a record.
	   He is not scheduled to work either semifinal.
	   ``He has put himself ahead of the pack,'' FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said.
	   While he said the statistic was released ``reluctantly,'' Cooper
said it did not reflect poorly on Brizio or the state of
refereeing.
	   ``I don't think it has anything to do with the referee. He was
in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the right place at the
right time,'' Cooper said. ``He was in a game that developed to the
point where he had to take that kind of action.''
	   Such a drastic action usually changes the landscape of the game.
England outplayed Argentina for nearly the entire first half of a
second-round game. But when David Beckham was ejected at the start
of the second half for a retaliatory kick at an opponent, the
English had to pull back into a defensive shell, rarely moving
upfield and hoping to get to a shootout.
	   They did, but they lost that, too.
	   ``It is extremely difficult to play 11-on-10,'' England goalie
David Seaman said. ``It changes the game entirely.''
	   The Germans were incensed about a red card given to their best
defender, Christian Woerns, by Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen in
the 40th minute for a foul on Croatian striker Davor Suker.
	   Until then, Germany, the European champion, had controlled the
quarterfinal match, but it wound up losing 3-0.
	   ``The red card was a joke,'' Woerns said. ``I am aware of no
guilt. It was the decisive moment of the game. The team still
fought well. In your career, you have the chance to play perhaps
only one World Cup, therefore it's especially disappointing.''
	   FIFA apparently now is satisfied with the officiating. Twenty
games into the tournament, that wasn't the case, and president Sepp
Blatter called on the refs to be less tolerant of fouls from behind
_ in keeping with the governing body's pre-tournament edict that
red cards be given for such hard fouls.
	   That brought a sea of red cards, including Brizio's hat trick in
the South Africa-Denmark game.
	   FIFA then met with the referees and things toned down a bit, but
strict attention still was made to the tackles from behind.
	   ``I am sure the referees were confused by what FIFA said,''
American Cobi Jones said. ``The players and the coaches didn't know
what they wanted.''
	   What they want, simply, is clean, wide-open soccer.
	   ``We can tell them, `Pay attention to this. This will not be
tolerated,''' Cooper said of a typical pre-game meeting between
referees and the teams. ``Are we worried (at so many red cards)?
No. That's the decision and we'll stand by that.''

U.N. tribunal opens its first genocide trial

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Trying a genocide case for the
first time, U.N. prosecutors Monday accused a Bosnian Serb official
of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes, torture and
slayings of non-Serbs.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's seventh trial _ its first
dealing specifically with the crime of genocide _ will decide
whether Milan Kovacevic orchestrated atrocities against Muslims and
Croats while a member of the ruling Serb elite.
	   The crimes were committed in the Prijedor municipality of
northwest Bosnia in 1992. They allegedly also included murders and
tortures in three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps:
Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Kovacevic, 57, faces a total of 15 charges, including genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges. If convicted, he faces a
maximum life sentence.
	   Although Kovacevic is the first to stand trial on genocide
charges, he is not the only suspect facing that charge. Among
others indicted for genocide are the tribunal's top two suspects,
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military commander, Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.
	   In her opening arguments, prosecutor Brenda Hollis briefed the
three-judge panel on the political background of Prijedor and said
Kovacevic ``acted with intent to commit genocide.''
	   According to Hollis, Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was among a
group of municipal officials who engineered a violent campaign to
expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and
December 1992.
	   ``Entire villages and hamlets were cleansed of non-Serbs,'' she
added.
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which directed attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   Hollis said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and
rape,'' while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to
stop them.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, Hollis added.
	   During the hearing, the graying Kovacevic sat in the dock and
took notes occasionally.
	   Hollis she would call witnesses, including a rape victim, who
would testify to the brutal conditions of the camps, as well as
introduce documents that would establish Kovacevic's leadership
during the alleged crimes. The prosecution's first witness was a
Norwegian judge who detailed the political background of the
region.
	   Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, contended there were no
concerted genocidal plans to expel non-Serbs from Prijedor.
	   ``For each and every one of the allegations, there is a
reasonable explanation,'' he said.
	   He stressed his client was appointed to political office by a
pro-democracy coalition and did not harbor ill feelings toward
other ethnic groups.
	   ``The charge of genocide (against Kovacevic) is improper and it
can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Vucicevic said.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
	   He was arrested at the hospital without a fight, but another
genocide suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police
chief, was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.

Russian reactor switched off in false fire alarm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials at the Kalinin nuclear power plant north
of Moscow shut down a reactor Monday when a fire alarm went off.
The alarm turned out to be false.
	   Reactor No. 2 was shut down as a precaution when the alarm went
off, a duty engineer at the power station said. He said the reactor
would be reactivated later Monday.
	   The Kalinin plant, located about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
north of Moscow, has two upgraded water-pressurized VVER-1000
reactors.

Flood displaces thousands in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) _ Floods caused by monsoon rains
displaced at least 50,000 villagers in southern Bangladesh, an
official said Monday.
	   No deaths have been reported from the flooding in Cox's Bazar
district, 185 miles (296 kilometers) south of Dhaka, the area's
administrator Ali Imam Majumder said.
	   He said many people have been evacuated to government cyclone
shelters.
	   The flooding has inundated roads and halted traffic.
	   At least 285 millimeters (11 inches) of rain has been recorded
in the district since Saturday morning, flooding more than 100
villages, the Meteorological Department said.

U.N.: Russia uncertainty threatens East Europe upturn
</HEADLINE>

July 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Uncertainty in Russia poses the greatest potential
risk to improving economies in East Europe, a U.N. report said
Tuesday.
	   Japan's recession also could affect growth prospects unless
quickly reversed, according to the Economic Survey of Europe, which
also includes North America.
	   ``On balance developments have remained positive in the first
half of the year,'' said the survey, a 24-page update to the U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe's report for 1997.
	   The report saw a positive short-term outlook for most of East
Europe over the second half of this year. Hungary, Slovenia and
Estonia are likely to exceed expectations, it said. Prospects were
less bright in Bulgaria and Romania.
	   Although ``the outlook is not at all clear,'' the survey said
Russian economic growth could slip ``if instability and policy
austerity continue.''
	   ``In the second half of the year there could even be a fall in
aggregate output,'' the report said.
	   Russia's poor outlook is rooted in its high degree of dependence
on commodity exports and its tendency to finance its deficit with
foreign funds, commission chairwoman Eveline Herfkens said.
	   ``As long as Russia will continue to finance its deficits with
foreign capital, you will have this type of vulnerability and this
type of problem,'' Herfkens told reporters at U.N. headquarters in
New York.
	   Russia's priority must be to fully reform its tax system,
addressing the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, the
report said. Devaluing the Russian ruble might ``provide some
temporary relief for the economy,'' it added.
	   Falling world commodity prices this year have had a very
negative impact on Russia's outlook, Herfkens said.
	   The commission's report for 1997, released in April, said the
apparent halt to Russia's economic slide had helped former Soviet
bloc countries to their first overall year of growth since the end
of communism. It cautiously predicted continued growth for Russia
this year.

Hungary's new premier sworn into office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Viktor Orban, the 35-year-old leader of
the Young Democrats-Civic Party, was sworn in Monday as Hungary's
prime minister -- the second youngest in the country's 150-year
parliamentary history.
	   Orban's party emerged on top in May's general elections, winning
148 seats in the 386-seat parliament during balloting in which
voters repudiated their Socialist-led government in favor of a
center-right coalition in the former Communist country.
	   Following the May vote, Orban forged a coalition with the
Hungarian Democratic Forum and with the Independent Smallholders'
Party, for a combined total of 213 seats.
	   The extreme rightist Hungarian Truth and Life Party, which won
14 seats, also pledged to support the Orban government as long as
it pursues policies it favors.
	   Orban has promised to reorganize the government along German
lines, under which departments in the prime minister's office will
oversee the ministries.
	   He has also pledged to establish a ``mega-ministry'' for
economic affairs, combining economic development, industry and
trade, tourism, labor and European integration.
	   Orban has also promised a war on organized crime to include
bolstering the police, increasing penalties for major crimes and
tightening immigration laws.
	   Police are investigating about 140 bombings that have taken
place since 1991, but cannot stop a turf war among mostly Russian,
Ukrainian, Romanian, Turkish and Arab gangs.
	   On Thursday. a car bomb exploded in a crowded downtown street of
Hungary's capital, killing four people and injuring more than 25.
	   Orban is Hungary's youngest prime minister since Andras Hegedues
assumed the post in 1955 at age 33.
	   Orban's first trip abroad will be to France next Sunday, when he
will attend the finals of World Cup finals as a guest of French
President Jacques Chirac.

Blind complaints spells doom for first euro coins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Complaints by blind people and vending
machine operators spelt doom Monday for millions of freshly minted
euro coins.
	   Some 9 million coins minted in France ahead of the launch of the
European Union's single currency must be melted down following a
decision by EU finance ministers to alter their design, EU
officials said.
	   The changes were ordered after organizations representing
Europe's blind people complained the 10 and 50 cent coins were not
made according to previously-agreed specifications that called for
raised ridges along the edges.
	   ``Edge milling is unfortunately the only way that many blind and
elderly people will be able to distinguish between coins, and now
even this seems to be in jeopardy,'' Stephen King, of the European
Blind Union, wrote to the EU finance ministers.
	   Further complaints came from vending machine operators who said
the 50 cent coin was too light, making it impossible for machines
to tell it apart from the 20 cent coin.
	   The EU ministers agreed to draw up fresh specifications for the
two coins.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said cost of
melting down and re-minting the coins was about 2 million French
francs (dlrs 330,000).
	   ``It will chance the production schedule, but it's not
serious,'' Strauss-Kahn told reporters.
	   The EU has to mint some 70 billion coins by 2002 when the euro
bills and coins come into circulation in 2002 in 11 nations. Two
years before then, on Jan. 1, 1999, those nations introduce the
euro as their common currency for non-cash transactions.
	   The euro, which is expected to worth about dlrs 1.1, will be
divided into 100 cents.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Ethiopian Jews scuffled with police
Monday outside the prime minister's office in a protest against the
government's immigration policy.
	   Demonstrators demanded that thousands of Jews still living in
Ethiopia be brought to Israel. Some carried photographs of
relatives and shouted ``mother'' and ``father.''
	   The government recently closed a special transit camp for
immigrants in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and held a
festive reception for the last few dozen camp residents who arrived
in Israel last week.
	   Leaders of the Ethiopian community said about 5,000 Jews still
live in danger in remote areas of Ethiopia. Leaders fears that the
closing of the transit camp is a sign that the government has no
plans for further Ethiopian immigration.
	   Avram Negosa, Director of the Ethiopian Immigration and
Absorption Association, said that many Jews have recently been
forced to flee their remote villages to Addis Ababa and the city of
Gondar for safety but are not receiving assistance from Jewish
relief agencies still stationed there.
	   ``In Addis Ababa they are not willing to take all those in who
are asking for help because they claim they have completed their
work there,'' Negosa told Channel Two.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel. Most were brought to
the Jewish state in two airlifts in 1985 and 1991.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ A 24-year-old man was arrested in
Germany Monday as a suspect in the brutal beating of a French
policeman after a World Cup soccer game between Germany and
Yugoslavia last month.
	   The prosecutor's office in Hanover said the suspect was arrested
by police in Hamburg early Monday at his home and taken to Hanover
before a magistrate who ordered him jailed in investigative
custody.
	   According to a prosecutor's statement, the suspect admits being
in Lens, in northern France where the attack took place, but has
denied he beat or kicked the policeman.
	   The name of the suspect was not released.
	   Daniel Nivel, 44, was hit on the head with an iron bar minutes
after a World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia June 17,
when groups of soccer thugs rampaged through Lens, a town in
northern France. Nivel remained in a coma Monday.
	   French police arrested and placed two other Germans under formal
investigation for attempted murder.

Sleaze controversy hits Blair's government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Labor Party official who boasted he could
arrange access to government officials and documents was suspended
by a Canadian-based lobbying company Monday, and he was fired from
his job as a newspaper columnist.
	   The controversy embroiled Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party government in charges of sleaziness_ an issue which helped
topple the Conservative government in national elections 14 months
ago.
	   The Express newspaper dismissed Derek Draper because he
reportedly said his columns were reviewed by a government minister
before publication.
	   The Observer newspaper, which had reporters pose as
representatives of U.S. energy companies, reported Sunday that
Draper was among three former aides to government ministers who are
now selling their contacts.
	   Draper works for GPC Marketing Access, part of GPC Canada of
Toronto.
	   The newspaper also said that a former lobbyist, Roger Liddle,
now a member of Blair's Policy Unit, told the undercover reporters:
``Just tell me what you want, who you want to meet and Derek
(Draper) and I will make the call for you.''
	   Liddle said he was just being friendly and never offered to fix
up meetings on behalf of GPC.
	   The Observer said the lobbyists claimed to be able to get
privileged access to government ministers and policies, including
advanced information about market-sensitive speeches by treasury
officials.
	   Ann Taylor, Labor floor manager in the House of Commons,
acknowledged the allegations were serious, but said The Observer
must produce proof.
	   ``The prime minister has made clear that if anybody has breached
these rules, action will be taken,'' said Ms. Taylor.
	   GPC Marketing Access suspended Draper. He made no comment.
	   As part of advertizing government contacts, Draper said in taped
conversations that his columns were vetted by Peter Mandelson, a
deputy minister and a key former of policy and image in Blair's
centrist ``New Labor'' administration, The Observer reported.
	   Under the Conservatives, half-a-dozen Tory legislators were
found to have accepted cash or favors via lobbyists for raising
issues in Parliament or facilitating introductions. Harrods owner
Mohamed Al Fayed said he paid Tory legislators to raise issues
about ownership of the store in the 1980s.
	   On Monday, the Conservatives clamored for an investigation.
	   ``It's about cronyism. It's about special favors to friends,''
said Francis Maude, Tory spokesman on finance.
	   Recent activities of another Laborite former political aide
turned lobbyist, Karl Milner, included faxing a parliamentary
committee report on energy to Union Associates in New York 24 hours
before publication.
	   Observer reporter Gregory Palast said Milner thought Union
Associates was a prospective client but it actually specializes in
investigating corporate corruption.
	   Milner's employers, GJW Government Relations, on Monday
apologized for his action.
	   Leaking select committee reports is breach of parliamentary
privilege.

UN chief concerned that Kosovo could destabilize all Balkans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Monday
that violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo could destabilize
the entire region and urged both sides to resume negotiations.
	   In a report to the Security Council, Annan said he supported
sending in a diplomatic monitoring mission to Kosovo to try to find
``impartial and substantive information,'' on the situation.
	   His report came as diplomats from Russia, the United States,
Poland and the European Union worked to break the deadlock by
traveling to Kosovo hot spots after a weekend of inconclusive
negotiations with the Albanian leadership.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in the southern Serb
province since a Serb police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants
in February. Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of the
province, which Serbs regard as their heartland.
	   Annan said he was ``increasingly concerned that, unless
hostilities in Kosovo are stopped, tensions could spill across
borders and destabilize the entire region.
	   ``Kosovo therefore becomes a key issue for the overall stability
of the Balkan region,'' Annan wrote.
	   In his report, Annan said the number of registered refugees in
Albania had risen to 6,900 by the end of June, and estimated that
the number may be as high as 13,000. The increase was due to an
outbreak of violence early in June that also lead to an increase of
displaced people in Kosovo and Montenegro.
	   As of June 19, Montenegro reported 10,177 displaced people from
Kosovo, Annan wrote. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
estimates 45,000 people were displaced in Kosovo itself.
	   ``The international community is appalled by the continued
violence in Kosovo,'' Annan wrote. ``The parties concerned must
demonstrate restraint and resume negotiations to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict.''

Kafelnikov and Berasategui toppled in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Second-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov was
toppled in the opening round of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open on
Monday by unheralded Brazilian Fernando Meligeni.
	   Crashing out in the first round of Wimbledon, the Russian failed
to redeem himself, immediately losing 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the ritzy
alpine resort where he became champion in 1995.
	   It marks the second time the Brazilian defeated the Russian,
having beaten Kafelnikov in Prague earlier this year.
	   The world number seven was not alone in his disappointment, with
clay-court specialist Alberto Berasategui, seeded seventh, upset
6-4, 6-4 by compatriot Francisco Clavet.
	   Defending champion Felix Mantilla of Spain began his bid at
preserving his crown with an easy 6-2, 6-2 win over French
qualifier Thierry Guardiola.
	   Action continues Tuesday with top-seed and world number two
Marcelo Rios of Chile facing home favorite Marc Rosset.
	   Semi-retired Boris Becker will take on wildcard George Basti of
Switzerland. Wildcard and Wimbledon junior champion Roger Federer
of Switzerland will meet Germany's Tommy Haas.

World Cup: The grudge match: L'Equipe vs. coach Jacquet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Even in these days of French glory
at the World Cup, Gallic grudges are not easily forgotten.
	   Despite five victories so far in the tournament, coach Aime
Jacquet and the sports daily L'Equipe are in the midst of a war of
words, well over a year after the paper started questioning whether
Jacquet was up to task of leading France to the World Cup.
	   ``I feel shame for this press,'' Jacquet said over the weekend.
Then the usually mild-mannered and soft-spoken Jacquet started
lacing his sentences with invective. ``It's rabble. They're
dishonest and incompetent.''
	   L'Equipe, widely read in France, was taken aback by his strong
words. ``We don't recognize ourselves in this,'' assistant general
editor Gerard Ejnes said.
	   On Monday, Jacquet was unrepentent. ``It was not the first time
nor will it be the last,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We will
have time to talk about this again.''
	   The Paris paper published an editorial Monday headlined, ``To
each his own truth,'' posing a rhetorical question suggesting
France needed a more attacking strategy. It quoted another coach
who has been critical of the Jacquet system.
	   ``It's not because of the French team and the Coupe du Monde is
being played here that we will stop being critical,'' Ejnes, the
editor, said in an interview.
	   Mutual respect _ or the lack thereof _ seemed to be at the core
of the dispute.
	   ``My team deserves respect and attention,'' said Jacquet.
	   But L'Equipe countered that Jacquet was just asking for blind
love. ``A critical mind is the only thing left to us when many have
lost it,'' said Ejnes.
	   Les Bleus, as the French team is known, reached the
quarterfinals after beating Italy in a thrilling penalty shootout
following a scoreless draw. As a result, a population usually less
fervent than other Europeans about soccer is steadily moving toward
a state of euphoria about the national squad.
	   Jacquet can point to impressive achievements as coach, chiefly
just three losses in 51 matches. France goes into Wednesday's
semifinal against Croatia as the favorite. A victory would propel
it into the ultimate match, the final on Sunday against the winner
of Brazil-Netherlands.
	   France's political establishment is certainly behind Jacquet.
	   ``Jacquet knew all along. I've always been convinced of that,''
said President Jacques Chirac after the victory over Italy.
	   Jacques Delors, the former European Commission president who
would start his political day by reading L'Equipe, said, ``Don't
shoot on the pianist. Jacquet has done good work and let him
continue.''
	   What L'Equipe has long complained about are Jacquet's defensive
tactics, his introverted style and his sometimes clumsy way of
communicating with the public.
	   Jacquet has long seen it as a full frontal attack, painting him
as a loser lacking any charisma.
	   Even some L'Equipe journalists, who asked not to be named, said
they had been surprised at the intensity and nature of the
editorial criticism.
	   ``We have been hard on him,'' admitted Ejnes, ``but it has
always stayed within the realm of soccer,'' denying something
personal was at stake.
	   For Jacquet, the criticism is personal. When L'Equipe sent him a
New Year's card and a dedicated book, the coach sent it right back.
	   L'Equipe, which has some 60 journalists on the World Cup,
certainly is not against the French team. Success sells.
	   On a normal day, newspaper's sales approach 400,000. During the
initial days of the World Cup sales reached some 630,000. The paper
is also producing a Sunday edition during the tournament
	   If France reaches the final, over 1 million copies are expected
to be printed.
	   Should France win the World Cup, a lot of words might have to be
eaten.
	   ``Sometimes we can be wrong. The difference between hero and
zero is almost nothing,'' said Ejnes.

India may sign nuclear treaty in exchange for concession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India is negotiating with the five
declared nuclear powers on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and is
hoping to extract concessions on the transfer of dual-use nuclear
technology in return for a commitment to sign the treaty,
newspapers reported Monday.
	   A government spokesman denied the reports, saying they were
``premature.''
	   ``India's basic position remains unaltered,'' said Foreign
Office spokesman K.C. Singh. India has so far refused to sign the
CTBT, saying it is discriminatory and allows existing nuclear
powers to retain their arsenal. But Singh admitted India was
talking to ``key interlocutors'' on the nuclear issue.
	   The Indian Express in a front page article said bargaining on
the CTBT had gained momentum and the government was hoping for a
breakthrough before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to India in
November.
	   New Delhi's signature on the treaty would greatly help Clinton,
who wants the U.S. senate to ratify the CTBT by the end of the
year, the newspaper said.
	   For decades before India conducted its five controversial
nuclear tests in May, New Delhi maintained its nuclear plants were
only for peaceful purposes. India has several nuclear power plants
for which it would like to import technology that could also be
used for its weapons program_ the so-called dual use technology.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee special envoy Jaswant Singh
met U.S. deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott last month in
Washington and is scheduled to meet with him again on July 9 in
Frankfurt, and then again later this month. The talks are aimed at
explaining New Delhi's reasons for the tests and at easing U.S.
sanctions against India.
	   As part of the government's diplomatic endeavor after the
controversial nuclear tests, the prime minister's principal
secretary Brajesh Mishra visited Paris last month and had talks
with senior officials explaining India's position. The government
believes France understands its point of view and is hoping it will
influence Washington, the report said.
	   One of the concession that India is trying to extract is removal
of full safeguards for nuclear power plants built with western
technological assistance. New Delhi would like such safeguards to
be facility specific so that indigenously built nuclear plants are
not open to international scrutiny, the Indian Express said.
	   India's recent agreement with Russia for setting up a nuclear
power plant in Kudankulam in southern India is an example of such a
concession. Russia has agreed to limit international safeguard
inspections to this plant.

Canadian businessman jailed for life for murdering man whose
</HEADLINE>
identity he stole &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge jailed a fugitive Canadian financier for
life on Monday for the murder of a Briton whose identity he stole
in an bid to create a new life.
	   After just two hours of deliberations, a jury of jury of eight
women and four men at Exeter Crown Court unanimously found Albert
Walker, 52, guilty of the murder of Ronald Platt, 51, in July 1996.
	   During the 11-week trial, the prosecution produced evidence that
Walker, worried that Platt could unmask him, knocked the quiet
electrical engineer unconscious, tucked a 10-pound (4.5-kilogram)
anchor into his belt, then threw him into the sea from his yacht.
	   Passing sentence, judge Sir Neil Butterfield called the murder
``a callous premeditated killing designed to eliminate a man you
had used for your own selfish ends and found to be firstly
inconvenient then increasingly a threat to your continued
freedom.''
	   Walker, from Woodham Walter near London, showed no emotion as
sentence was passed.
	   The court heard that Walker fled Ontario in December 1990, to
escape a bitter divorce battle and shortly before police began
investigating the alleged theft of millions of dollars from his
financial services company. He was accompanied by his daughter
Sheena, then 15, who later posed as his wife.
	   He was using the alias David Davis _ the identity of one of his
Canadian clients _ in 1991 when he met the mild-mannered Platt and
his girlfriend Elaine Boyes in the northern English city of
Harrogate.
	   The three became friends and Walker used Platt and Ms. Boyes to
front a bogus company he set up to launder money, the prosecution
said.
	   Later, he paid for them to start a new life in Canada, a dream
of Platt's. He then assumed Platt's identity.
	   But in the middle of 1995, Platt returned from Canada, because
his business had failed. That created an identity crisis for
Walker, the court heard.
	   Worried that he would be discovered, Walker threw Platt into the
sea six miles (10 kms) off the Devon coast from his 24-foot
(7.3-meter) yacht Lady Jane on July 20, 1996, the prosecution said.
	   Platt's body was found in a the nets of a fishing trawler eight
days later, still wearing his prized Rolex wrist watch. That
enabled police to identify him and when they investigated his army
service records, they discovered links to Walker, the prosecution
said.

Two Polish consortia want to buy bankrupt Gdansk Shipyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two consortia of Polish shipyards have
offered to buy the bankrupt Gdansk Shipyard, the birthplace of the
Solidarity democracy movement, the shipyard's receiver said Monday.
	   Andrzej Wiercinski said a complete offer was made by the
consortium of the state-owned Gdynia Shipyard, which itself
overcame a financial crisis, and Evip Progress company.
	   The other offer, by the Shipping Industry Consortium of the
Szczecin Shipyard and the Gdynia Repair Shipyard, is to be
completed in a few days, but was also accepted, he said.
	   In August 1996, the leftist government announced the yard
bankrupt. It blamed the problem on unprofitable contracts,
overemployment and high social benefits. Some 3,600 workers were
laid off. Gdansk Shipyard was where Poland's labor movement was
born in 1980.
	   Currently, the shipyard employs about 2,000 workers. Wiercinski
estimates its debt at about 200 million zloty (dlrs 57 million).

Real Madrid, Chelsea, Juventus fined by UEFA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ This year's Champions League and Cup
Winners' Cup winners, Real Madrid and Chelsea, have been fined over
incidents during their European campaigns, UEFA announced Monday.
	   Real Madrid was fined a total of 8,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 5,500)
for ``improper conduct'' of its team and officials during its
Champions League final against Italian club Juventus by UEFA's
disciplinary body, a UEFA statement said. It gave no further
details.
	   Real and Juventus were fined 5,000 francs (dlrs 3,400) and 7,000
francs (dlrs 4,800) respectively for ``setting off fireworks or
throwing of other objects'' in the same match.
	   Juventus also received a 20,000 franc (dlrs 13,800) fine for a

Netanyahu, opposition accuse each other of lying on Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes, EDITS to TRIM;
ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In stinging personal attacks, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition legislators accused each other
Monday of deceiving the Israeli people and foreign leaders about
Mideast peacemaking.
	   In a special parliament debate accompanied by non-stop heckling,
opposition legislators called Netanyahu a liar who has routinely
misled not only political foes but also his allies.
	   Netanyahu countered that the opposition Labor Party, which
governed from 1992-1996, secretly made far-reaching territorial
concessions to the Palestinians and Syria.
	   ``Don't talk to us about credibility,'' Netanyahu said, wagging
his finger at the benches of the opposition. ``What you should do
is sit quietly and with your heads bowed in shame.''
	   Netanyahu had not delivered a speech on the peace talks with the
Palestinians to parliament in seven months, and Labor forced his
hand Monday by collecting the signatures of one-third of the 120
legislators demanding a debate on the subject.
	   The negotiations have been stalled since March 1997 over the
scope of Israel's troop pullback in the West Bank, and there were
no signs that the United States has made progress in getting
Netanyahu to accept a withdrawal from 13 percent of the land.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak launched an unprecedented personal
attack against Netanyahu, saying the prime minister had squandered
the prestige Israel enjoyed in the world following the peace
agreements forged by Netanyahu's dovish predecessors.
	   Netanyahu sat in the plenum impassively, scribbling notes, as
Barak turned to him and recited the names of foreign leaders who he
said no longer believed the Israeli prime minister.
	   ``Arafat is not willing to talk to you,'' Barak said, referring
to the Palestinian leader.
	   ``Bill Clinton doesn't listen to you. Madeleine Albright is
tired of your words. King Hussein refuses to talk to you. President
Mubarak is not willing to respond to you. Our president refuses to
help you ... Whom will you call, who will answer you?'' Barak said.
	   Barak then read out the phone number of Netanyahu's reclusive
American adviser, Arthur Finkelstein, who lives in New York and
reportedly has helped the prime minister extract himself from a
number of political jams.
	   ``Many times I've asked myself ... how the man behind the number
who never lived in Israel ... knows what to sell,'' Barak said.
``Here is the answer. Selling lies, bluffing, this is universal.''
	   Other Labor legislators and Yossi Sarid, head of the dovish
Meretz Party, called Netanyahu a liar and quoted political allies
of the prime minister who have complained he has deceived them.
	   Netanyahu's credibility has been questioned repeatedly in his
two-year rule, most recently by the Israeli president and the armed
forces chief of staff.
	   In his speech, Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for the
deadlock, saying they kept refusing to carry out their security
promises, such as rounding up illegal weapons and reducing the size
of their police force.
	   Netanyahu accused Barak of hypocrisy, saying the opposition
leader himself had hired a Washington image adviser to help him get
elected prime minister.
	   He also accused the former Labor government of having ``bought''
a slim parliamentary majority for the 1995 interim peace agreement
with the Palestinians by promising a job of deputy minister, with
the accompanying perks such an office car, to one legislator.
	   ``You got the country into trouble with a very dangerous
agreement we were forced to repair,'' Netanyahu said. ``You did it
with the voice of one man, bought it with a Mitsubishi, more lies,
more theft.''
	   Coalition chairman Meir Shetreet accused the opposition of
waging a campaign of incitement against Netanyahu, and drew
parallels to the personal attacks against Yitzhak Rabin that
preceded the assassination of the prime minister in 1995.

Euro Disney says accord reached with technicians; performers still

on strike &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Euro Disney spokesman saying accord
reached with 15 of 55 strikers; denying strikers' figures; quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Euro Disney reached an accord Monday with striking
technicians, the company said, but parade performers remained
locked in a pay dispute.
	   The accord was reached with 15 technicians for shows at the vast
theme park outside Paris, said company spokeswoman Isabelle Clap.
She said that leaves only 40 people on strike _ all performers in
the parade of Disney characters.
	   But striking performers claim that more than 200 workers have
been on strike for two weeks, including themselves, some restaurant
workers and some maintenance staff.
	   ``I deny formally that there are any restaurant workers or
maintenance workers on strike,'' said Clap. ``Only 40 people out of
13,000 employees are not working, and the park is functioning
perfectly.''
	   The parade performers _ who play the famous Disney characters
marching down Main Street U.S.A. _ are asking to be classified as
amusement park artists, which would give them a pay increase of
between 10 and 40 percent. Currently they make about 7,000 francs
(dlrs 1170) a month.
	   The company is asking them to audition for that status. Weekend
talks broke down.
	   ``There are no further talks on the horizon,'' said Giovanni
Savoia, a spokesman for the striking performers. ``Our strike will
continue indefinitely. The management knows where to find us.''
	   Clap said the accord reached with the 15 technicians involves
setting up a working group to deal with their demands, and also
agreeing to treat those demands on a case-by-case basis. Some
already have received salary adjustments, she said.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co., opened the park in April
1992.
	   It has reported profits for the past three years, in part by
cutting costs that occasionally have set off labor protests.

Yeltsin orders increase in navy nuclear arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Half of Russia's nuclear warheads and delivery
systems are to be concentrated in the navy in the next century, the
naval chief of staff said Monday.
	   Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov told the Interfax news agency that
President Boris Yeltsin had ordered the upgrade at a meeting of the
Security Council on Sunday.
	   Kuroyedov said the navy, with 30 percent of the nuclear arsenal,
was in third place behind the strategic missile forces and the air
force in terms of nuclear might.
	   ``Our task is to bring the navy into first place'' over the next
15-20 years, Kuroyedov said, according to Interfax.
	   Kuroyedov said that Russia's strategic naval forces included 26
ICBM-equipped nuclear submarines and that the number would remain
unchanged. He said the navy would upgrade its power by modernizing
its submarine fleet and missiles.
	   During the late 1980s, the Soviet navy had more than 60 nuclear
submarines carrying ballistic missiles.
	   Kuroyedov admitted in May that steep budget cuts in recent years
have forced the navy to reduce the number of its ships and sharply
curtail new orders.

U.N. envoy briefs council on Cyprus mission; hopeful of movement in
</HEADLINE>
September &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. envoy to Cyprus told the Security
Council on Monday that he hoped there might be movement in the next
round of negotiations.
	   Diego Cordovez told the council he planned to return to Cyprus
in September for more talks with Greek Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, council
president Sergey Lavrov told reporters.
	   ``He discussed some substance of what these talks might
concentrate on,'' Lavrov said, adding that Cordovez was hoping
``there might be some movement at that time.''
	   Cordovez, a former Ecuadoran foreign minister, arrived last
Thursday in Cyprus and held two rounds of separate talks with
Clerides and Denktash before leaving Saturday.
	   He was trying to restart talks on uniting the Mediterranean
island which broke down last year. Repeated efforts to solve the
Cyprus problem, including visits by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
have failed.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided into a Turkish Cypriot
north and a Greek Cypriot south since Turkey invaded the island in
1974 following an abortive coup in Nicosia by supporters of union
with Greece. The island's Greek and Turkish communities have since
lived apart, separated by a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.
	   Tensions rose dangerously two weeks ago when Greece and Turkey,
NATO partners and traditional rivals, sent warplanes to Cyprus in a
show of force that threatened to erupt in hostilities.
	   Denktash insists he will not resume talks until his breakaway
state, declared in 1983 in the Turkish-held north, is recognized.
He also wants the Clerides government, the island's internationally
recognized administration, to abandon its bid to join the European
Union.
	   Both conditions have been rejected by the Greek Cypriots.

Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber announces marriage split

 &UR; Eds: Lloyd-Webber in graf 2 is cq, hyphen is the composer's chosen
style &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and his wife Zohra
said Monday they have separated after nine years of marriage.
	   In a brief joint statement, the brother of composer Andrew
Lloyd-Webber and his second wife said they have been living apart
``for some months.''
	   ``The separation is amicable and no other parties are
involved,'' the statement said. The Lloyd Webbers have a 6-year-old
son, David.
	   In an interview two months ago, Lloyd Webber, 47, said his work
on unrecorded compositions by his father William had put strain on
his marriage.
	   ``Zohra has found my working so obsessively on my father's music
very difficult,'' he said.
	   A leading soloist who plays all over the world, his has long
been known for his dedication to his art. He once said his
relationship with his valuable Stradivarius cello was ``like a
marriage.''
	   Mrs. Lloyd Webber, 35, is an Afghan princess who came to Britain
at the age of 12 after her family fled the communist takeover in
her country.
	   She married Lloyd Webber in 1989, months after his divorce from
his first wife Celia was finalized.

Mexican prosecutors investigate link between drug cartel,
</HEADLINE>
president's brother &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican attorney general's office is
investigating whether the brother of a former president and a
former top prosecutor had ties to the Juarez drug cartel.
	   A former federal police director who has admitted taking bribes
from the cartel has implicated ex-prosecutor Mario Ruiz Massieu and
other officials, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar told
reporters Sunday.
	   He said his office is investigating whether there is evidence to
back up the accusations.
	   Asked if Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of former President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, also was named, Madrazo Cuellar said
``not directly,'' but that investigators wanted to see if he was
involved.
	   Raul Salinas has been jailed on illegal enrichment charges and
on charges that he masterminded the murder of Ruiz Massieu's
brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a governing-party official.
	   Mario Ruiz Massieu is under house arrest in New Jersey while
Mexican authorities try to extradite him on charges that he covered
up Raul Salinas' role in his brother's killing.
	   Last year, the U.S. government won a jury verdict allowing it to
seize dlrs 7.9 million from dlrs 9 million Ruiz Massieu had in bank
accounts in Texas, claiming the money came from drug traffickers.
	   Both Salinas and Ruiz Massieu have maintained their innocence.
	   The former police director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, was
sentenced Wednesday to four years in prison on charges that he
tortured a suspect in the Ruiz Massieu killing. He still faces
money-laundering charges related to the bribes he accepted from the
cartel.
	   The Juarez drug cartel was considered the most powerful in
Mexico but has declined since its leader, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
died after plastic surgery last year.

Indian court orders arrest of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian court has issued arrest
warrants against media tycoon Rupert Murdoch for refusing to appear
in court on charges that his STAR TV network was showing allegedly
obscene movies in India, domestic news agencies reported Monday.
	   Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumar said that three summons
had been sent to Murdoch at his addresses in the United States and
Australia. But they had returned unserved because he refused to
accept them, the United News of India reported.
	   The Judge has ordered India's Foreign Ministry to serve the
summons through diplomatic channels, but there is little the courts
can do if Murdoch refuses to accept it.
	   Ratikant Basu, head of STAR TV in India is also an accused in
the case but Delhi High Court has exempted him from appearing in
court.

New U.N. representative takes up post in divided island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Ann Hercus of New Zealand, the new U.N.
resident envoy in Cyprus, vowed Monday to do her best to help
settle the dispute between the war-divided island's Greek and
Turkish peoples.
	   ``I would be really disappointed if you did not find me full a
fresh ideas ... I come with very clear views,'' Hercus told a news
conference.
	   Hercus, whose title is deputy U.N. special representative and
chief of mission in Cyprus, was appointed in May to replace the
retired career U.N. diplomat, Gustav Feissel. She took her post
Monday.
	   Hercus, 56, was New Zealand's ambassador to the United Nations
from 1988 to 1990 and was previously a member of her country's
Parliament and a minister.
	   She said U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan was committed to
intensifying efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
	   ``I shall make my best efforts to help the two sides to arrive
at a settlement, which will give Greek and Turkish Cypriots a
peaceful prosperous future to which they have been yearning,''
Hercus said.
	   Her news conference was held at the Ledra Palace hotel in the
U.N. patrolled buffer zone dividing the capital into Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot sectors. The hotel is now used as housing
headquarters for British U.N. peacekeepers.
	   Cyprus' ethnic Greek and Turkish communities have lived apart
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after a short-lived coup in Nicosia by supporters of
union with Greece.
	   Repeated international efforts have so far failed to reunite the
island, a flashpoint in the long-running disputes between NATO
allies and traditional rivals, Greek and Turkey.
	   She later held her first meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides, whose Greek Cypriot government is the island's only
internationally recognized administration.
	   She is scheduled on Tuesday to to call on the Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, whose 15-year-old self-styled Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Ankara.
	   ``I am here to listen to the two leaders, to offer a new U.N.
perspective from time to time and follow through on initiatives,''
said Hercus.

Israeli troops scuffle with Palestinians, Jewish settlers

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops scuffled with
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in this tense divided city Monday
after each side blamed the other for carrying out violent attacks.
	   Some 30 Jewish settlers who blocked a main thoroughfare to
protest a firebomb they said was thrown at one of their compounds,
pushed and shoved with Israeli soldiers who tried to force them
back off the road.
	   Moments later, a Palestinian-owned carpet and housewares shop
along the street caught fire. Palestinian shopkeepers managed to
extinguish it quickly and then accused the settlers of setting the
blaze. The ruckus brought dozens of angry Palestinians out of their
shops and into the street, but troops managed to calm the area and
by dusk, both sides headed home.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, a city of 130,000
Palestinians. The center of town is patrolled by Israeli troops
deployed there to protect the settlers, while 80 percent of the
city is under Palestinian control.
	   Also Monday, a 16 year-old Jewish settler was arrested on
suspicion that he and two others smashed the windows of Arab-owned
cars in Hebron last week.
	   On Friday, three Israelis on horseback shattered windshields and
dented the bodies of cars belonging to Palestinians in Hebron. The
attackers were armed with chains and wore checkered Arab head
dresses.
	   One suspect, 19-year-old Nathaniel Nir from Jerusalem, was
arrested during the rampage. A second suspect, a 16-year-old
resident of Hebron, was arrested Monday, police said. His name was
not released because he is a minor.

Summer menswear: Gaultier thinks tourism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Tourism is a big thing in France this year, what
with the World Cup, so Jean-Paul Gaultier jumped on the bandwagon
with his weekend menswear show for next summer.
	   ``German tourists, American tourists, what have you,'' said
Donald Potard, president of Gaultier, describing the theme in the
crowded Gaultier showroom near the Paris stock exchange.
	   There they were in widened-bottomed and turned-up jeans, denim
hot pants, sequined shirts, sandals, tight T-shirts with mesh tank
tops. The hats looked like German beer-parlor gear.
	   ``These are not such expensive clothes,'' said Potard,
emphasizing the dlrs 200 limit for the outfits _ just on the
cutting edge of bad taste _ from the big creator.
	   The widened jeans with faded bands at the bottom did look
distinctive. Nobody else is showing anything like that.
	   Gaultier also paraded some striking striated suits in gold and
browns with cigarette pants _ models smoking cigarettes as they
quaffed beer _ jogging pants tucked into boots, and, lo and behold,
some good suits.
	   Kenzo's collection was a cool drink of water by comparison, but
still a trip to the beach: there were many windbreakers, desert
jackets, tunics, blousons, and wide pants for those sandy spaces.
It all looked terribly comfortable.
	   While Gaultier restrained himself from showing his usual skirts,
Kenzo liked the idea of Indonesian cotton wraparounds over floppy
pants.
	   There were great Kenzo outfits here in wrinkled gauzes and
linens. Tricolored knit T-shirts took in a range of peacock, plum,
prune, jungle green and turquoise.
	   Safari jackets were very well made here, a great practical look
for next summer.
	   Suits in soft fabrics with narrow lapels or Mao collars gave a
casual, uniquely Kenzo touch to this collection.
	   Sonia Rykiel hit the right notes, if not very high notes, in her
collection in the outdoor gallery around the Left Bank Odeon
Theater. It recalled 30 years ago, when Rykiel sat in at some of
the student demonstrations as she inaugurated her own upstart
boutique.
	   ``A very different world, the rebellion days were actually
fun,'' she said, strolling the galleries. ``Now I work so much
harder.''
	   But Rykiel's menswear looked easy, if sober, from the beige or
deep blue suits in cotton-linen-wool mixes (great for travel, with
careful details, medium-soft shoulders, good tailoring, and flat
pants) to parkas, shorts and striped knits par excellence.
	   Remarkable were the soft ivory leather T-shirts for casual
trousers. There was nothing pushy here _ the light summer wear fit
in fine with what spectators were wearing, and are intended to go
from day into evening in a casual vein.
	   Meanwhile, Paul Smith _ the most celebrated English designer
showing here _ pulled off a little tour de force by mixing torn
jeans and hippie looks with some excellent tailoring in jackets.
	   Dark trousers and light linen printed flowered shirt-jackets
carried the casual wear into a colorful vein.
	   The show veered between what a careful man would wear to the
office _ like a pinstriped shirt with a well-tailored light-fabric
suit _ and what his sloppy son would wear in from a day out with
his buddies.
	   Color was welcome on jackets embroidered with little flowers on
glen plaid backgrounds, or fancy pants with prints of modern
paintings in turquoise, brown and pink.
	   The mood of these collections was generally light and airy _
clothes worn from day to evening, city or holiday, and not much to
rock the boat, even with Gaultier's bad-taste ``tourists.''

Greens anger German auto drivers with proposal for autobahn speed
</HEADLINE>
limit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDs new grafs 3, 6, and 7 with additional comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder swerved Monday to avoid another anti-car proposal from
his prospective coalition partner, the Greens, this time for a
speed limit on the autobahn.
	   ``This is a grab for an old hat out of an even older closet of
traffic policy and won't be done with me,'' Schroeder, a Social
Democrat, insisted in Monday's Bild newspaper. ``Demands like this
show more and more that apparently a big desire to go down has
broken out among the Greens.''
	   Schroeder later told ARD television that the Greens were just
using the theme to get attention during a little-news summer
period.
	   The environmental Greens party's traffic expert in parliament,
Gild Altmann, told Bild over the weekend that her party would seek
a 100 kph (62.5 mph) autobahn speed limit as part of their price
for joining a coalition with the Social Democrats, should they win
the Sept. 27 elections.
	   Polls show such a ``red-green'' coalition ahead of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's center-right grouping.
	   But the Greens have seen their support decline since they called
in March for a tripling of gasoline prices to discourage auto use _
a proposal Schroeder immediately rejected.
	   Still, Joschka Fischer, the Greens party faction chief in
parliament, said Monday during an election campaign speech in
Nuremberg, that the party endorses imposing a speed limit in
Germany.
	   Within the European Union, Germany was the only country without
a speed limit, and therefore it will come anyway in the course of
further European integration, Fischer said.
	   The speed limit idea has met with criticism in car-happy
Germany, where cruising down the autobahn at speeds of 200 kph (125
mph) or more is considered by many to be a birthright.
	   Free Democrats general secretary Guido Westerwelle called it a
``typical reflex of an anti-progress and anti-technology party.''
	   Even fellow Greens, like Bavarian lawmaker Elisabeth Altmann,
called the 100 kph limit ``illusionary and harmful.'' She
recommended Germany adopt a top limit of 130 kph (81 mph), which is
standard across most of Europe.

Moscow synagogue rededicated after bomb attack

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Jews gathered Monday evening for a ceremony
to celebrate the rebuilding of a synagogue that had been damaged in
a bomb attack in May.
	   The ceremony was attended by about 1,000 people, including
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
	   It was highlighted by the completion of a hand-written Torah
dedicated to the synagogue near central Moscow that has been the
scene of several attacks in recent years.
	   In the latest incident, Jewish graves were desecrated on June 28
at a cemetery maintained by the Marina Roshcha synagogue, which is
run by Lubavitch Jews.
	   Rabbi Berel Lazar, chief Lubavitch emissary to Russia, said in a
statement released before the ceremony that Jews in Russia would
not be intimidated.
	   ``The Jewish community in Russia today is proud of its
accomplishments and full of determination to grow even more,'' he
said. ``We will not cower to cowardly acts of terror.''
	   A bomb exploded near the synagogue on May 13 just minutes after
congregants left a holiday celebration, badly damaging the building
and injuring two people.
	   In 1996, another bomb exploded at the center. And an arson fire
nearly destroyed the synagogue in 1993.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

German drug company may seek injunction against sales suspension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiary of German
pharmaceutical giant Schering AG, said Monday said it may seek a
court injunction against a government order suspending the sale of
all its products.
	   At least 13 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking fake Microvlar contraceptives
manufactured by Schering.
	   The placebo pills were made of lactose and sugar and used to
test new packaging equipment. After the tests they were to have
been incinerated, but some of the 650,000 packets were instead
stolen and sold.
	   Last week the government fined Schering 2.9 million real (dlrs
2.5 million) and said the company could produce its products -
except for Microvlar - but not sell them.
	   Production of Microvlar has been stopped and will resume only
after Schering recalls all its packages from drug stores and
changes its packaging format.
	   ``Several of our products are becoming scarce on the market,''
said Theodorus van der Loo , Schering's marketing director. ``We
are especially worried with the growing scarcity of Fludara, used
to treat leukemia, Betaferon for multiple sclerosis, and Androcur
for prostate cancer.
	   Schering's Brazilian subsidiary also exports these products to
other Latin American countries, van der Loo said.
	   ``If the scarcity of these products becomes critical, we may ask
for a court injunction against the suspension,'' he added.
	   The sales suspension will remain in effect until authorities
have finished an inspection of Schering's factories.
	   The new inspection will determine if Schering has corrected
several irregularities that health officials detected earlier at
the company's Sao Paulo facilities.
	   According to the Health Ministry, the equipment used to package
bogus contraceptives was in the same room as equipment used for the
genuine product.
	   Van der Loo said the company took the necessary precautions by
separating the two areas with a large canvas.''
	   Health inspectors also said fake pills were not clearly
identified and there was a ``lack of rigorous control over the
placebos that left the plant to be incinerated.''
	   Van der Loo admitted said that each individual package was not
identified as containing fake pills, but said that the cardboard
boxes containing 50 such packages had the word placebo stamped on
them.
	   Sergio Abdalla, the police chief in charge of the Schering case
told reporters he believed the placebos were stolen by professional
thieves.

England tailenders force a draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England tail-ender Angus Fraser is
not usually noted for his batting but he was a hero with the bat
Monday after holding out to salvage a draw in the third cricket
test against South Africa.
	   Fraser and Robert Croft saved England from an almost certain
defeat by surviving seven offers against a South African bowling
attack which only needed one wicket to win at Old Trafford.
	   South Africa posted a first innings total of 552 for five
declared, then bowled England out for 183 and sent the home side
back in _ England was one wicket from defeat at 369 for nine in its
second innings.
	   Fraser and Croft survived for long enough to ensure the Proteas
did not get to bat again or take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five
test series.
	   Fraser, No.11 batsman, survived 13 balls from a rampant Allan
Donald and proved to be South Africa's stumbling block.
	   Donald, carrying the burden of a depleted attack, bounced out
Darren Gough after the No.10 had helped Croft stem a lower order
collapse.
	   Gough and Croft had batted for 78 minutes until Donald,
returning for a final burst with the third new ball, dismissed
Gough.
	   The last pair joined forces with England still needing two runs
to avoid an innings defeat and Croft deftly pushed Ntini to point
and scampered for two to level the scores.
	   But South African captain Hanse Cronje said it was the
partnership between his English counterpart Alec Stewart and Mike
Atherton on Sunday which saved England.
	   ``We're disappointed we couldn't force a win _ particularly
after two and three-quarter days in the field _ but we gave it our
best shot,'' Cronje said after the match Monday.
	   Stewart hit a brilliant 164 to top score in England's second
innings and shared a 226-run partnership with Mike Atherton which
gave his side a fighting chance.
	   The third wicket pair came together with England reeling at 11
for two, and batted for more than five hours and 83 overs before
being separated.
	   Atherton had stonewalled for more than six hours for 89, but
gave South Africa a hard-earned breakthrough with an
uncharacteristic hook off Jacques Kallis in the first session on
Monday.
	   But Stewart's dismissal was more critical after he had batted
magnificently and boldly for 418 minutes.
	   Stewart's unblemished 317-ball innings ended with another
unnecessary hook. It sparked a middle-order collapse which
threatened to give South Africa the win it deserved.
	   Regardless of his impetuosity, it was a heroic knock _ the
highest in Test history by a captain-wicketkeeper. He hit 24
boundaries, three of them in one over from Ntini, who was
celebrating his 21st birthday.
	   Donald, pumped up by Stewart's wicket, knocked back Graham
Thorpe's off stump with a yorker as he took 2-0 in four balls.
	   After Atherton's fall, Stewart and Mark Ramprakash, 34 runs in
over three hours continued to frustrate the Proteas.
	   England was 323 for six at tea and a long way from making South
Africa bat a second time.
	   Donald, struck twice from the Warwick Road end, trapping
Ramprakash lbw with the second ball after the break and in the next
over had Ashley Giles caught by substitute Brian McMillan at second
slip.
	   It was an outstanding display of fast bowling by Donald, who
took a career 50 wickets against England with his 13th five-wicket
haul.
	   Donald, with 6-88, took his series tally to 19 wickets in three
tests and 51 for the 1998 calender year in nine tests.
	   Only Sri Lankan off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has taken more
wickets _ 52 in seven matches at 19.96.
	   South Africa's innings was highlighted by a career-best 210 by
veteran opener Gary Kirsten and an equally fine 132 by
man-of-the-match Jacques Kallis.
	   Kallis, also chipped in with four wickets in the two England
innings.

French lawmakers ratify agreement on New Caledonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ French lawmakers on Monday ratified an
agreement that could lead to complete independence for the French
territory of New Caledonia.
	   Deputies and senators meeting in Versailles, south of Paris,
voted 827-31 in favor of the so-called Noumea agreement, signed in
May.
	   The agreement, named after the territory's capital, provides for
a 20-year transition period toward independence.
	   It follows a decade of violence in the Pacific island nation.
Fierce riots and political killings in the 1980s stunned the French
and galvanized the search for a peaceful solution.
	   ``A major political act,'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called
the accord.
	   ``It brings in a new period of peace for the territory which for
so long has had a troubled history,'' he said in an address to the
lawmakers.
	   A referendum will be held in December on a transition period of
``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago, to be followed in 2018
by a second referendum on self-determination.
	   France views New Caledonia as a strategic political and economic
asset in the Pacific. Controlled by France for 150 years, the
territory has about 30 percent of the world's nickel reserves.
	   About 150,000 people live in New Caledonia. Nearly half are
native to the islands, while about one-third are of European
origin. The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.
	   The agreement was signed in Noumea by French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, officials from the main pro-independence party, and
French settlers who have opposed self-rule.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A bridge under construction
collapsed in South Africa on Monday, killing 15 construction
workers and injuring 14 others, state television reported.
	   Rescuers feared that the number of fatalities could rise as the
search for survivors trapped in the rubble continued late Monday,
the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   Five of the 14 injured were taken by helicopter to hospital in
serious condition.
	   The bridge was being built across a river near Bushbuckridge,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Johannesburg.
	   Investigators were flown to the scene to probe the cause of the
collapse, said John Laverty, a spokesman for the firm building the
bridge.

Complaints from blind people spells doom for first euro coins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Complaints by blind people and vending
machine operators spelt doom Monday for millions of freshly minted
euro coins.
	   Some 9 million coins minted in France ahead of the launch of the
European Union's single currency must be melted down following a
decision by EU finance ministers to alter their design, EU
officials said.
	   The changes were ordered after organizations representing
Europe's blind people complained the 10 and 50 cent coins were not
made according to previously-agreed specifications that called for
raised ridges along the edges.
	   ``Edge milling is unfortunately the only way that many blind and
elderly people will be able to distinguish between coins, and now
even this seems to be in jeopardy,'' Stephen King, of the European
Blind Union, said in a letter to EU finance ministers.
	   Further complaints came from vending machine operators who said
the 50 cent coin was too light, making it impossible for machines
to tell it apart from the 20 cent coin.
	   The EU ministers agreed to draw up fresh specifications for the
two coins.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the cost of
melting down and re-minting the coins was about 2 million French
francs (dlrs 330,000).
	   The EU has to mint some 70 billion coins by 2002 when the euro
bills and coins come into circulation in 2002 in 11 nations. Two
years before then, on Jan. 1, 1999, those nations introduce the
euro as their common currency for non-cash transactions.
	   The euro, which is expected to worth about dlrs 1.1, will be
divided into 100 cents.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia - After U.S. and Russian envoys failed to
rally Albanian factions behind a single leader, a senior U.S.
official blamed the Yugoslav government Monday for driving ethnic
Albanians into the extremist camp.
	   The growing profile of the militant Kosovo Liberation Army among
ethnic Albanians has hindered negotiations for peace in the
rebellious Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Afanasyevsky tried Sunday to persuade all Albanian factions
_ including the KLA _ to accept moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova. But
the militants have no political leadership and have so far refused.
	   Speaking in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, U.S. envoy Robert
Gelbard slammed the Yugoslav government, saying they ``mishandled''
the Kosovo problem enormously, ``particularly in the first three
months of this terrible crisis which has produced a dramatic
radicalization and polarization of the situation.''
	   While Gelbard said all options are still open for finding a
solution in the province and noted that NATO has accelerated
planning, he stressed that Yugoslavia's international borders
should remain intact.
	   ``The United States is not supporting either side. We have made
it absolutely clear we oppose independence for Kosovo,'' he said.
``I occasionally feel that the government is the best ally that the
Kosovo Liberation Army has in radicalizing the situation.''
	   Gelbard said the police actions in Drenica in early March, which
killed 80 ethnic Albanians, including women and children ``probably
did more to send people over to support the KLA than any efforts
they have ever put together.''
	   On Monday a group of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, got a first-hand
look at Drenica and other regions in Kosovo that have seen heavy
fighting since a Serb police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants
began in February, killing hundreds of people.
	   Monday's trip covered covered about 200 kilometers (120 miles)
and was the first in a series of monitoring missions aimed at
giving foreign diplomats a closer look at the situation on the
ground scheduled to begin Thursday.
	   Richard Miles, U.S. charge d'affaires in Belgrade who
participated in the monitoring mission, said the diplomats were
trying to find out ``who can control the guys with the guns _ the
KLA.''
	   Milosevic approved the diplomats' visits Monday under an
agreement last month with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Since the meeting, Milosevic has expressed willingness to
restore autonomy he revoked in 1989.
	   Speaking in Belgrade Monday said Milosevic is preparing draft
proposals aimed at providing Kosovo with the ``broadest possible
autonomy.''
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.
	   Afanasyevsky also said he didn't agree that with U.S. and
European leaders that military actions could help return of Kosovo
Albanian leaders to dialogue.
	   ``Various threats of military actions have only worsened the
situation and created an illusion among ethnic Albanians that their
aim can be achieved through a path other than a peaceful one,'' he
said.
	   Amid the discussions, violence continued in the province. The
ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center reported heavy
shelling of Lodja village in western Kosovo, that killed one and
injured three people.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing them to repel the assault.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.
	   Also Monday, the bodies of three men _ ethnic Albanians last
seen going into their cornfields Sunday _ were discovered near the
southwest border with Albania. The men had been shot in the head
and their wrists bore burn marks from having been bound.

Fifth-century shopping center found under Israeli mall site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a
5th-century Byzantine shopping mall at a site in northern Israel
where a new mall is to be built.
	   The Byzantine remains were discovered during a ``rescue dig''
preceding construction of the new mall in the northern town of Bet
Shean, renowned for its Roman ruins.
	   About 100 meters (109 yards) of road were uncovered, including
basalt paving stones, mosaic sidewalks, and the remains of
colonnades and six shop fronts, Danny Syon, an archaeologist with
Israel's Antiquities Authority and director of the dig, said
Monday.
	   At the entrance to one shop, the sidewalk is decorated with a
colored mosaic showing a red foliage pattern and the phrase ``For
the Victory of the Blues'' inscribed in Greek, Syon said.
	   The inscription is a reference to two competing factions, the
Blues and the Greens, which sprang from competing allegiances at
horse races during the Byzantine period, Syon said.
	   ``Apparently the shop owner was a fan of the Blues,'' he said.
	   Most of the street will be covered up when the new mall is built
later this year, but the inscription and some of the mosaic
sidewalk will be preserved _ either beneath the modern shops or in
spaces between them, Syon said.
	   The roads and shops were the first significant evidence of the
southern section of the large Byzantine city of Bet Shean, Syon
said.
	   Nothing was found inside the shops to give any indication of
what kind of merchandise was sold there, he said.

Netanyahu, opposition accuse each other of lying on Mideast peace

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ What was intended to be Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's first address to parliament on Mideast peacemaking in
seven months quickly descended into a shouting match Monday of
personal slurs and accusations of blame.
	   In a special Knesset debate Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud
Barak traded blows over who was more politically out of touch and
dependent on American spin doctors for direction.
	   Barak repeated the phone number of Netanyahu's low profile
American advisor Arthur Finkelstein in New York several times and
said he was the only person Netanyahu had left to call, charging
that the world's political leaders no longer had patience for the
premier.
	   ``Arafat is not willing to talk to you,'' Barak said, referring
to the Palestinian leader.
	   ``Bill Clinton doesn't listen to you. Madeleine Albright is
tired of your words. King Hussein refuses to talk to you. President
Mubarak is not willing to respond to you. Our president refuses to
help you ... Whom will you call, who will answer you?'' Barak said.
	   ``Rather than calling Finkelstein, we should think for ourselves
and take the path of peace and security,'' Barak said, `Instead of
peace you are bringing us closer to war.''
	   Netanyahu took the podium and swiftly dug into Barak, accusing
him of turning to a prominent Washington-based political image
maker and alluding to complaints within Barak's own Labor party
that he was not up to the job.
	   ``I think Barak is suitable,'' Netanyahu said sarcastically,
``to be the head of opposition for many years to come.''
	   In between the personal jabs, Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians
for the stalled peace talks and asked the opposition to join in a
unified call to Arafat to fulfill his side of the peace accords.
	   Netanyahu said the Palestinians have refused to carry out their
security promises, such as rounding up illegal weapons and reducing
the size of their police force.
	   Netanyahu had not delivered a speech on the peace talks with the
Palestinians to parliament in seven months, and Labor forced his
hand Monday by collecting the signatures of one-third of the 120
legislators demanding a debate on the subject.
	   The negotiations have been stalled since March 1997 and are now
deadlocked over the scope of a promised Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank. The United States has been trying to get Netanyahu
to accept a plan for a withdrawal from 13 percent of the land, but
there's been no signs that he will accept it and Arab leaders have
been warning that a lack of progress could lead to violence.
	   In the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinians threw firebombs
towards Israeli soldiers who scuffled earlier with both
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the tense town.
	   Netanyahu challenged Labor's claims that before he took the
premiership two years ago, Israel enjoyed greater standing in the
world and there was a feeling that a genuine peace was in reach.
	   Citing the wave of bus bombings by the radical Palestinian
Islamic movement Hamas in 1996 that preceded his election,
Netanyahu said he preferred his hard line approach in governing.
	   ``There was faith, joy, and hope but I prefer less faith, less
joy, less hope, and more security,'' Netanyahu said.
	   He also accused the Labor Party which governed from 1992-1996,
of secretly making far-reaching territorial concessions to the
Palestinians and Syria.
	   ``Don't talk to us about credibility,'' Netanyahu said, wagging
his finger at the benches of the opposition. ``What you should do
is sit quietly and with your heads bowed in shame.''
	   Netanyahu's own credibility has been questioned repeatedly by
political foes and allies alike, most recently by the Israeli
president and the armed forces chief of staff.
	   Monday he dismissed reports that he misled Cabinet ministers
about the government's decision to back down in a recent standoff
with the Palestinians over the use of a Gaza Strip road.

Diana's bodyguard denies giving interview blaming Dodi Fayed for
</HEADLINE>
fatal crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's former bodyguard Trevor Rees
Jones on Monday denied giving an interview to a French magazine
which quoted him as blaming Diana's boyfriend Dodi Fayed for the
Paris car crash that killed her.
	   In a statement, Rees Jones said he was ``extremely angry'' over
a so-called interview published over three pages in Voici magazine
Monday. It was labeled an exclusive.
	   ``Mr. Trevor Rees Jones wishes to make it clear that he has
never met a journalist from the French magazine `Voici' and,
therefore, strenuously denies having consented to or approved the
so-called 'exclusive' interview in that publication,'' Rees Jones
said in the statement, issued to the British news agency Press
Association by his lawyer Ian Lucus.
	   ``The entire invented content interview is therefore
attributable to `Voici' magazine and is not anything that Mr. Rees
Jones has said.''
	   Lucus said Rees Jones is consulting his French lawyers about
whether to take legal action against the magazine.
	   Lucus said the former bodyguard, who is now working in a sports
shop in Oswestry, central England, is finding the constant media
attention ``extremely hard to cope with.''
	   As a bodyguard employed by Fayed's father Mohamed Al Fayed, Rees
Jones was responsible for Diana's safety on the night she died. He
was the only survivor of the crash that also killed Fayed and
driver Henri Paul.
	   Rees Jones resigned from Al Fayed's employ in April.

New report on fate of missing French nuns draws skepticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A lawyer for the families of two
French nuns missing in Argentina since 1977 responded skeptically
to a news report Monday that the bodies were sealed in a drum and
dumped in a river.
	   An unidentified man who claimed to be a police officer during
Argentina's so-called ``Dirty War'' told the newspaper Perfil that
the bodies of Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet were thrown into the
Parana River near here. He said he could pinpoint the location.
	   ``We are very cautious in analyzing this,'' attorney Horacio
Mendez Carreras responded in a telephone interview. ``We should
corroborate this with other information that we have.''
	   The two nuns were active in human rights work during Argentina's
former military dictatorship. Their disappearance was one of many
involving foreigners and caused friction between Argentina and
France.
	   Perfil's account quoted the man as saying the bodies of the nuns
``were placed in a drum'' that was dumped in Tigre, near the Parana
River delta, about 15 miles (28 kilometers) northwest of Buenos
Aires.
	   The man told the Buenos Aires daily that a secret police group,
formed in 1971, called ``Los Plumas'', was responsible for
``capturing the enemy and exterminating it.''
	   ``The work was initiated by an order and the method didn't
matter much,'' he told Perfil.
	   Carreras said he had different reports on what had happened to
the nuns after they were kidnapped from a church here. A third nun,
Yvonne Pierron, who was friends with the other two nuns, also
questioned the report.
	   ``This person did not identify themselves, this person doesn't
have the face of the truth,'' she said.
	   An Argentine government report says more than 9,000 people
disappeared when the military cracked down on leftists and
political dissidents between 1976-83. Human rights groups put the
figure closer to 30,000.
	   In 1990, a former Argentine navy captain, Alfredo Astiz, was
tried in absentia in France and sentenced to life in prison in
connection with the disappearance of the two nuns.

	   ROME (AP) _ Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' was in a cardboard box
under a bed. Cezanne's ``The Cabin of Jourdan'' was wrapped in a
blanket atop an armoire. ``The Woman from Arles,'' another van
Gogh, was hidden in a Turin apartment.
	   By Monday afternoon, the three paintings, stolen May 19, were
back in Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art, and eight people,
including the museum's No. 2 in charge of security, were under
arrest for suspected theft.
	   Museum officials said the undamaged works, which include Italy's
only two publicly displayed van Goghs, would go quickly back on
exhibit, likely sometime Tuesday, assuming new frames were ready.
	   The heist by three armed men who tied up museum guards on a
night when the closed-circuit surveillance system was broken
embarrassed a country whose vast artistic patrimony is frequently a
victim of theft or vandalism.
	   ``This was a bleeding wound that Italy didn't deserve,'' Deputy
Premier Walter Veltroni, who is also culture minister, told
reporters. ``Today the wound is closed.''
	   Judging by the arrests before dawn Monday by police officers
barging into apartments in Rome and in Turin, the theft was a
family affair.
	   Arrested in a lower-class Rome neighborhood where ``The
Gardener'' and the Cezanne were found were a 44-year-old Roman and
his 25-year-old daughter, who was suspected of having driven the
getaway car. Police said the daughter rushed to a balcony to toss
away a .357-caliber Magnum when the agents burst in.
	   The security guard, arrested along with her husband in another
apartment, was a 32-year-old Roman who worked in the gallery's
security control room. Arrested in the same apartment was a
40-year-old Turin man.
	   Also arrested in Rome was a 45-year-old man with previous
arrests for robbery, theft and a murder, authorities said.
	   The two other arrests came in Turin.
	   Investigators theorized that all three paintings were not kept
in the same place because the members of the gang didn't trust each
other.
	   Police, discounting earlier reports that the theft was carried
out on commission, said the gang apparently had hoped to find a
private collector willing to pay big money to possess the works
clandestinely.
	   The art, together worth at least dlrs 30 million, was too famous
to sell openly.
	   Police said they seized rifles, revolvers, a machine-pistol,
masks, ammunition and wigs during the arrests.
	   The suspects included several people involved in holdups in
Belgium, said Gen. Roberto Conforti, commander of the Carabinieri
art theft squad.
	   After the theft, background checks had turned up contacts by the
security guard with some of the other suspects with criminal
records, Conforti said.
	   Despite the euphoria that the paintings were back, there was
caution that much of Italy's precious art is still poorly guarded.
	   ``The success cannot make us forget that the problem of the
safety of Italian artworks is still open,'' said a member of the
parliamentary culture commission, Giuseppe Rossetto.

Funeral held for actor stabbed by English fan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ About 200 people attended funeral
services Monday for a French actor stabbed to death by an
apparently deranged English soccer fan last week after the
England-Argentina game.
	   Well-known French songs and poems punctuated the simple ceremony
for Eric Frachet at the church in Allevard, in the Isere region.
	   ``Eric, with your big generous heart, you alone had the courage
to follow your dreams: to become an actor,'' said one of the
eulogies. His friends spoke of his improving luck in recent years
in getting TV and film work.
	   Frachet, 33, was returning to his village near Grenoble by train
when he was stabbed by an English soccer fan, who reportedly
thought the smiling Frachet was an Argentinian mocking him after
England's loss to Argentina.
	   The suspect, Paul Birch, is a 43-year-old engineer and father of
two from London. He was jailed after admitting the crime, and has
been placed under investigation _ one step of being formally
charged _ for murder.

Protestants, Catholics share anger after British offer Orange

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Seeking to contain Protestant
fury, a government-appointed commission ruled Monday that Belfast's
most disputed Orange Order march should be permitted to pass a
hostile Catholic neighborhood next week.
	   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission admitted its verdict
took into account widespread Protestant anger _ including gangs of
rioters _ over the ongoing blockade of a bigger march in the Orange
Order's rural heartland.
	   ``This isn't justice. This is obviously just giving in to Orange
pressure and trying to buy off the mob in Portadown,'' said the
Lower Ormeau protest leader, former IRA prisoner Gerard Rice, who
pledged to challenge the decision in a Belfast court.
	   The July 13 march by several hundred Orangemen would be the
first Protestant parade allowed past Lower Ormeau's eight hard-line
Catholic side streets in more than a year. Rice refused to say
whether protesters would try to block Ormeau Road, as they have
done since 1995, in defiance of the commission's ruling.
	   And despite the decision, riot police, British soldiers and
civilians alike braced themselves for a possible second night of
violence in working-class Protestant parts of Northern Ireland
because of the standoff outside Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of Belfast.
	   Police said they arrested about 30 people during riots late
Sunday or early Monday in Belfast, Londonderry and smaller towns,
during which more than 40 vehicles were hijacked and burned as road
barricades. A police inspector's skull was fractured by a mob
burning a car near Londonderry.
	   On Monday, bus services closed down early in Belfast, and few
motorists were prepared to brave the Protestant mobs menacing some
streets after dark. And in the Protestant Parkhead section of
Craigavon, Portadown's neighbor, thugs hijacked and torched a bus
and two cars.
	   Police said they found a body Monday afternoon on rail tracks
beside the predominantly Protestant Whiteabbey district of north
Belfast. The victim had been shot through the head, but authorities
said they did not immediately know if the motive was sectarian.
	   Outside Portadown's rural Drumcree Anglican church, where their
march has been blocked since midday Sunday, Orangemen and their
supporters pitched tents and had picnics behind the army's
barricades of barbed wire and trenches.
	   The crowd, which fluctuated from a few hundred to more than
1,000, cheered as Orangemen thumped massive drums and blasted
traditional Protestant tunes over a public address system _
christened ``Radio Orange'' _ in the direction of nearby Garvaghy
Road.
	   Catholic residents along that road have tried to block the
annual march since 1995, setting the scene for a confrontation that
has triggered violence across Northern Ireland for three years
straight.
	   David Trimble, the embattled Protestant head of Northern
Ireland's new cross-community government established under the
April agreement, warned that the crisis ``could put at risk all the
political progress we have achieved.''
	   Trimble, an Orangeman, is finding himself having to toe a more
conciliatory line in public _ and is being lambasted by Orangemen
as a traitor because of it.
	   He met Denis Watson, the senior Orangeman in Portadown's
surrounding county of Armagh, who was elected last month to
Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly on an anti-Trimble
ticket. Like most Orangemen, Watson opposes moves towards sharing
power with Catholics as likely to lead to a united Ireland.
	   Afterward, Watson said his meeting had changed nothing.
Orangemen, he said, were determined to stay at Drumcree ``for a
month or a year _ whatever it takes to allow us to hold our
dignified, disciplined parade as usual.''
	   The Parades Commission's gesture to Orangemen in south Belfast
met with only grudging acknowledgement from the order, which has
refused to talk with the seven-member body empowered this year to
rule on disputed parades.
	   The Parades Commission said more than 554 parades and
demonstrations, the vast bulk of them Orange, would be permitted
from July 11 to July 13.
	   Commission chairman Alistair Graham said none would be banned
outright, but announced restrictions on the routes that 14 Orange
processions could take so that they avoided predominantly Catholic
areas.
	   He also announced strict boundaries on three Catholic
counter-protests, ordering that they not try to block or interfere
with Orange parades in the vicinity.
	   July 12 is a national holiday in Northern Ireland, when
Orangemen commemorate an important Protestant military victory over
Catholics in 1690. Most parades are being postponed until the 13th
because the 12th this year falls on a Sunday, when Orangemen march
only to churches.

Small parties say coalition with Klaus impossible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two small center-right parties
said Monday that coalition with former Premier Vaclav Klaus seems
impossible, but they would support him in forming a minority
goverment.
	   ``The Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats are ready to
discuss support to Klaus' (minority) government,'' Freedom Union
leader Jan Ruml told Czech radio.
	   Leaders of the two parties met in reaction to Klaus' own meeting
with the winner of the June early elections, Social Democrat Milos
Zeman.
	   Zeman, whose party won only 74 seats in the 200-seat parliament
and lacks any center-left allies, said the Social Democrats might
seek support from Klaus if their negotiations with the small
center-right parties fail to produce a government.
	   The Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats also seemed
angered by a number of conditions Klaus' party says other parties
must agree to before it will join any center-right coalition.
	   The conditions include a demand that Klaus's party, the election
runner-up with 63 parliamentary seats, be given the post of Prime
Minister and a majority of seats in a future government and that
future state budget be balanced.
	   ``Conditions given by the Civic Democratic Party ... mean in
fact rejection of a (center-right) coalition and an alibi for an
agreement with the Social Democrats,'' Ruml said.
	   Klaus said his party still is willing to negotiate with the
Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats who hold 19 and 20 seats
respectively.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
President Vaclav Havel is expected to ask Klaus to attempt the
same. But it seems unlikely he would try and form a minority
government.
	   Czech parliamentary elections were held two years early, in
hopes of creating a stable government after Klaus' minority
government collapsed late last year following a financing scandal.

U.N. tribunal opens its first genocide trial
</HEADLINE>

suspects. No pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Trying a genocide case for the
first time, U.N. prosecutors on Monday accused a Bosnian Serb
official of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes,
torture and slayings of non-Serbs during the Bosnian war.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's seventh trial will decide
whether Milan Kovacevic orchestrated atrocities against Muslims and
Croats while he was a member of the ruling Serb elite.
	   The crimes were committed in 1992 in the Prijedor municipality
of northwest Bosnia, where non-Serbs were murdered and tortured in
three infamous prison camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Kovacevic, 57, faces a total of 15 charges, including genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity. He has pleaded innocent to
all charges. If convicted, he faces a maximum life sentence.
	   Kovacevic is not the only suspect facing genocide charges.
Others indicted for the same crime include the tribunal's top two
suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his
wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.
	   In her opening arguments, prosecutor Brenda Hollis told the
three-judge panel that Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was among a
group of municipal officials who engineered a violent campaign to
expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and
December 1992.
	   Kovacevic ``acted with intent to commit genocide,'' she said.
``Entire villages and hamlets were cleansed of non-Serbs.''
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which directed attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   Hollis said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and
rape,'' while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to
stop them.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, Hollis said.
	   During the hearing, the graying Kovacevic sat in the dock and
took notes occasionally.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
He was arrested at the hospital without a fight. Another genocide
suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police chief,
was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.
	   Hollis said she would call witnesses, including a rape victim,
who would testify to the brutal conditions in a camp, as well as
introduce documents that would establish Kovacevic's leadership
during the alleged crimes. The prosecution's first witness was a
Norwegian judge who detailed the political background of the
region.
	   Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, contended there were no
concerted genocidal plans to expel non-Serbs from Prijedor.
	   ``For each and every one of the allegations, there is a
reasonable explanation,'' he said.
	   He stressed his client was appointed to political office by a
pro-democracy coalition and did not harbor ill feelings toward
other ethnic groups.
	   ``The charge of genocide (against Kovacevic) is improper and it
can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Vucicevic said.

The Pope is invited to visit Romania by Orthodox Church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ For the first time Monday the Romanian
Orthodox Church agreed to invite Pope John Paul II to predominately
Orthodox Romania.
	   During his three-day visit to Italy beginning Tuesday, Prime
Minister Radu Vasile is to meet the pontiff at the Vatican and
extend the invitation to visit Romania in the coming year, Mediafax
news agency reported Monday.
	   Vasile has an official invitation from president Emil
Constantinescu but only a verbal confirmation from Romanian
Orthodox leader Patriarch Teoctist.
	   More details about this visit will be discussed during a
ecumenical meeting of Catholic and Orthodox bishops in Bucharest
this fall, said Romanian church spokesman Costel Stoica.
	   Catholics who make up 5 percent of the population and the
majority Orthodox, who account for 87 percent, have some patrimony
conflicts in Romania.
	   The Pope has refused previous invitations, because the Orthodox
Patriarchy had opposed such a visit.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Associated Press erroneously reported in its

difficulties in getting approval for TV commercials advocating the
use of condoms.
	   He did not specifically advocate such commercials.

Officials: Gadhafi suffers hip bone fracture; to undergo surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AL-BAYDA, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fractured a
bone in the hip area Monday after he tripped and fell while
exercising, his doctor said.
	   The announcement was made during a live television broadcast in
which Gadhafi, draped in a white sheet, lay on a hospital bed and
welcomed visiting African dignitaries.
	   Gadhafi will undergo surgery later Monday, said a doctor at the
unusual news conference held in a large conference hall.
	   Speaking with his hands propping up his head, Gadhafi's voice
appeared strong but he occasionally grimaced.
	   His left foot, peeking out from under the sheet, rested against
a traction bar attached to the bed.
	   The doctor, who did not identify himself, described the injury
as a ``straightforward fracture'' but said Gadhafi is comfortable.
	   He also displayed x-rays showing the top of the femur, the leg
bone that extends from the knee to the hip. It was not clear if
Gadhafi suffered a broken leg bone or a broken hip.
	   The doctor said Gadhafi was ``training and tripped'' when the
fracture occurred.
	   A surgery was scheduled to be held after the news conference, he
said.
	   Gadhafi said that during the last few weeks news organizations
``fabricated'' reports that he survived an assassination attempt.
``Now it is true there is a break but last time there was
nothing.''
	   ``And whenever something happens you either get injured or
die,'' he added.

Fighting subsides in Guinea-Bissau capital, mediation stalls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government forces and rebels exchanged
sporadic mortar fire Monday in the capital of Guinea-Bissau,
Portuguese media reported, as attempts to mediate an end to the
month-old conflict in the former Portuguese colony appeared to have
stalled.
	   Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported low-intensity fighting, a
marked contrast to Sunday's 11-hour battle in the capital Bissau,
where Senegalese troops supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira
used rocket-launchers in a bid to dislodge the rebels from the
city's airport and nearby military garrison.
	   The heavily-armed rebels _ a breakaway army faction that has
called on Vieira to step down _ have been dug into the positions on
the edge of the city since they mutinied June 7.
	   It was unclear what effect Sunday's fighting had in the small
West African nation of 1 million people.
	   The foreign ministers of Portugal and Angola held talks in
Bissau with representatives from the two factions last week, when
Bissau fighting overflowed into inland regions _ further
complicating attempts to provide aid to the tens of thousands of
people displaced by the fighting.
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry on Monday urged the
Guinea-Bissau government to ``take steps towards (establishing) a
cease-fire.''
	   The measures should seek to ``prevent a continuation of the war
and pave the way for a negotiated solution'' to the conflict, it
said in a statement.
	   In Lisbon, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said
Monday that ``at the moment there is a civil war'' in
Guinea-Bissau. Stressing Portugal's commitment to finding a
peaceful solution, he said ``there is one requisite for peace:
those who are at war must want peace.''
	   The rebels claim the allegiance of almost all the country's
6,000-strong army. Neighboring Senegal has deployed at least 1,300
troops across its southern border with Guinea-Bissau.

Opposition groups warns Nigerian junta to give up power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Warning that opposition groups ``will not
give in,'' a prominent umbrella group of Nigerian dissidents said
Monday that they will make life unbearable for the military junta
if it delays handing over power to a civilian government.
	   Their vow comes amid reports that Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, will extend the country's transition
program to civilian rule, which was to culminate in an Oct. 1
handover.
	   Such an extension would infuriate many members of Nigeria's
opposition, who worry it would simply be the first of many
extensions _ and perhaps mean that the military would never give up
power.
	   The Lagos-based Daily Times newspaper, quoting unidentified
sources, reported Monday that Abubakar might extend the transition
program by up to a year. That report could not be immediately be
confirmed. Other newspapers have, in recent days, given different
dates for when the junta will hand over power.
	   Abubakar is expected to give a speech later this week _ after
the end of the 30-day mourning period for former dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha _ announcing his plans for the future.
	   Abubakar came to power last month after Abacha's death.
	   But any extension would be worrying to Nigeria's opposition,
said Gani Fawehinmi, a leader of the Joint Action Committee for
Nigeria.
	   ``If Abubakar does not keep the Oct. 1 exit date for the
military, there should be resistance from JACON and millions of
Nigerians,'' Fawehinmi said at a Monday press conference. ``We are
not prepared to give in and we will not give in.'
	   He said resistance would include protests and demonstrations _
which have turned violent in previous years.
	   Shortly after coming to power, Abubakar vowed to continue with
Abacha's flawed transition program. Abacha's manipulation of the
program made it clear that he intended to use it to transform
himself into a nominally civilian president.
	   The program was to have included Aug. 1 presidential elections
before the Oct. 1 transition.

15 die as bridge collapses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A bridge under construction
collapsed Monday in northeastern South Africa, killing 15
construction workers and injuring 14 others, state television
reported.
	   Rescuers feared the number of fatalities could rise as the
search for survivors trapped in the rubble continued late Monday,
the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   Five of the 14 injured were in serious condition.
	   The bridge was being built across a river near Bushbuckridge,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Johannesburg.
	   Investigators were flown to the scene, said John Laverty, a
spokesman for the firm building the bridge.

Ousted Luyt to sue former rugby colleagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's rugby boss, who
was ousted in a dispute over alleged white domination of the game,
has filed suit against two provincial rugby administrators who
criticized him, the officials said Monday.
	   Natal Rugby Union chief Keith Parkinson said he and fellow
administrator Brian van Zyl received legal documents demanding
500,000 rand (dlrs 80,000) in damages for statements attacking
Luyt's handling of a ``Super 12'' rugby tournament last year.
	   ``We will meet our legal team shortly and we will vigorously
defend the action,'' Parkinson said after a meeting in the port
city of Durban.
	   Luyt resigned in May as head of the South African Rugby Football
Union after a bitter dispute over white domination of the game.
President Nelson Mandela ordered a probe ordered into alleged white
control of rugby, a move that angered many black leaders and some
white rugby officials who estimate that about a third of the
300,000 adults who play rugby in South Africa are not white.
	   During apartheid, blacks saw rugby as a symbol of white rule,
and the sport has been slow to encourage and develop black players.
	   The national Springbok team is all white and only a handful of
non-whites play with the provincial Super 12 sides.
	   The independent South African Press Association reported Monday
Luyt was also suing several other leader figures in South African
rugby, including former aide Brian van Rooyen, former Springbok
player Wilf Rosenberg, a financial journalist and two television
producers, one of them at the state South African Broadcasting
Corp.
	   Luyt's secretary, Susan Kruger, said Luyt refused to comment on
the cases but ``did confirm that he was taking action against
various people and SABC,'' SAPA reported.

Libyan leader suffers broken bone; to undergo surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Libya-Gadhafi; New throughout to UPDATE with
Gadhafi's fracture &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AL-BAYDA, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fractured a
bone in the hip area Monday after he tripped and fell while
exercising, his doctor said.
	   The announcement was made in a dramatic manner in a live
broadcast from a conference hall, where a conscious Gadhafi was
wheeled in on a hospital bed, partly covered in a white sheet.
	   Before the circumstances were explained, Gadhafi spoke in a
strong voice for about 20 minutes to welcome visiting African
dignitaries: six presidents and representatives of other countries
who had gathered in this northern coastal town to attend special
Islamic prayers marking the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammed.
	   Gadhafi's guests were present in the hall, seated on chairs a
little distance away from his bed, which was flanked by two female
bodyguards. Also present in the room was U.S. Muslim activist Louis
Farrakhan.
	   After Gadhafi's speech, a doctor wearing a light green surgical
gown and cap stepped forward and announced that Gadhafi was
``training and tripped'' when he fractured the bone on the left
side.
	   Gadhafi's left foot, peeking out from under the sheet, rested
against a traction bar attached to the bed.
	   The doctor, who did not identify himself, said it was a
``straightforward fracture'' and added that Gadhafi will undergo a
surgery later Monday.
	   He also displayed x-ray prints showing the top of the femur, the
leg bone that extends from the knee to the hip. It was not clear if
Gadhafi broke a leg bone or the hip bone.
	   Before leaving the room, Gadhafi said that during the last few
weeks news organizations ``fabricated'' reports of an assassination
attempt on him. ``Now it is true there is a break but last time
there was nothing,'' he said.
	   ``And whenever something happens you either get injured or
die,'' he added. He linked his hands behind his head to prop it up
so that he could see his audience while lying down.
	   Gadhafi was supposed to have led the special prayers for which
he invited the African leaders, including two who arrived Monday in
a plane in defiance of a U.N. air embargo. Libya has occasionally
broken the embargo but faced no retaliation from the United
Nations.
	   Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad and Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of
Niger flew into Libya aboard a Libyan Boeing 707 that Gadhafi sent
to the Chadian capital of N'djamena to fetch them.
	   Earlier, the chief of staff of the Chad's army also arrived in a
Chadian jet, only the second non-Libyan aircraft to break the
embargo this year, state television said.
	   It said presidents Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Farrakhan arrived earlier Monday.
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh came on Sunday. Senegal's President
Abdou Diouf also is here. All, however, came by road.
	   The gathering is another one of Gadhafi's high-profile efforts
to show that he has the support of other Muslim nations in his
dispute with the West.
	   The United Nations imposed an air and arms embargo on Libya in
1992 after it refused to extradite two Libyan men accused in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people. The embargo forbids flights to and out of Libya.
	   Earlier this month, the Organization of African Unity requested
that member states ignore sanctions with humanitarian or religious
implications and those relating to official OAU business.

Two 20-year-olds force Monday playoff at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Monday playoff after 12 holes; EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Jenny Chuasiriporn, trying to become
the first amateur to win a U.S. Women's Open since 1967, was tied
Monday with Se Ri Pak two-thirds through the 18-hole playoff.
	   The U.S. college student took a two-stroke lead at the turn
before Pak, South Korea's most famous athlete, finally found her
putting touch and birdied Nos. 11 and 12, her first birdies of the
day.
	   Chuasiriporn, who sank a riveting 40-foot (12-meters) putt on
the final hole Sunday to force a playoff, birdied three of the
first five holes. She took a four-stroke lead before a triple-bogey
on No. 6 prevented a runaway.
	   On a cloudy, muggy day, Chuasiriporn shot a 1-over 36 on the
front nine. Pak, a South Korean rookie bidding for her second
straight major, missed several makeable putts, including one at No.
9 that would have cut the deficit in half. She was at 2-over 38 at
the turn.
	   Chuasiriporn lost her ball when her tee shot on the 159-yard
(145-meter) sixth hole fell short in the hazard. She re-teed with a
one-stroke penalty and made matters worse with a three-putt.
	   Pak missed a short putt for birdie on the same hole, leaving her
one shot back, and the deficit became two shots when Pak bogeyed
No. 8 as her 6-foot (2-meter) putt for par lipped out. Both bogeyed
No. 9.
	   Chuasiriporn's birdies included a chip-in from 20 on No. 1, a
10-foot (3-meter) putt on No. 2 and a 15-footer (4.5-meter putt) on
No. 5.
	   If both players are still tied after the playoff, they go to
sudden death.
	   Catherine LaCoste is the only amateur to win the biggest event
in women's golf.
	   The last playoff in the Open was in 1992, when American Patty
Sheehan defeated Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.
	   This showdown between two 20-year-olds was set when Chuasiriporn
made her startling putt Sunday and Pak missed an 8-foot(a
2.4-meter) birdie putt on the same green.
	   ``The last 15 feet my eyes probably popped out,'' Chuasiriporn
said of her shot on No. 18.
	   She then had to sit in the scoring tent and watch as Pak missed
a birdie putt that would have given her a second straight major
victory.
	   Instead, both finished at 6-over 290, one stroke ahead of
Swedish-born Liselotte Neumann, who won the 1988 Open.
	   On the unforgiving Blackwolf Run Golf Course only one player has
broken par since Friday.
	   Because Chuasiriporn is an amateur, Pak was awarded the
first-place check of dlrs 267,500 Sunday night.
	   Pak's share of the dlrs 1.5 million purse didn't seem to make a
difference as she left the clubhouse to check back into her hotel.
	   ``I don't want money,'' said Pak, who already won dlrs 257,670
this year. ``I want the trophy.''
	   Chuasiriporn insisted she doesn't mind playing for pride and not
pay.
	   ``I don't care,'' she said. ``The money is not ... it was
nothing, ever.''
	   Chuasiriporn, who finished fifth in the U.S. college
championships at Madison two months ago, had the lowest 72-hole
total ever for an amateur at an Open.
	   Pak won the LPGA Championship in May and is seeking to become
the first rookie to win two majors since American Juli Inkster
captured the Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in
1984. The last woman to win consecutive majors was fellow American
Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   The drama at 18 capped an astonishing round in which Pak,
Chuasiriporn and several others, including Neumann, Mhairi McKay of
Scotland, and Americans Chris Johnson and Pat Hurst all had a shot
at winning.
	   Neumann finished at 76, one shot out of the playoff. But,
because Chuasiriporn will leave without any money, Neumann got dlrs
157,500 in second-place money instead of dlrs 77,351 third-place
money.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, of the United States, shot a 71 to finish
in a three-way tie for fourth at 292, along with Hurst (73) and
Johnson (74).

Prodi: meetings must yield strong Italian coalition or else
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday that consultations
this week to test the health of his center-left government must
result in a strong coalition or he won't lead another one.
	   ``You can't ask everyday if the marriage is working,'' Prodi
told reporters asking him about Thursday's meeting of coalition
leaders.
	   Prodi's Communist allies, who are outside the coalition but who
give him a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, have made clear
they expect stronger strategies to combat unemployment as the price
for continued support.
	   The temperature-taking of the coalition was prompted by last
month's refusal by the Communists to back the government in
Parliament on support for NATO's eastward expansion. Italian
approval of NATO enlargement was assured by help from the centrist
opposition.
	   However, Communist leaders have said they would back Prodi in
any confidence vote, making any imminent government collapse or the
calling soon of early elections, unlikely.

Five deny murder of Scottish surgeon in trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MTUNZINI, South Africa (AP) _ Five people were tried Monday on
charges that they killed a Scottish surgeon while stealing his car.
	   Xolani Mcunu, 18, Penwell Mazibuko, 22, Siphamandla Mthembu, 25,
and two juveniles have pleaded innocent to charges that they
murdering Spencer Alexander who died from a gun shot wound in the
back when carjackers stole his minibus.
	   The date of the slaying was not immediately clear.
	   Alexander worked in the provincial center of Empangeni.
	   In Mtunzini Circuit Court in KwaZulu-Natal province, Deputy
Provincial Attorney-General C.R. de Klerk said although there was
no witness account of the murder, state evidence would identify one
of the juveniles as the person found driving the hijacked vehicle.
	   De Klerk said fingerprints, hair samples and a bullet removed
from Alexander's back linked the five to the slaying.
	   He said the bullet was fired from a gun registered to Mthembu
and found in his possession.
	   Alexander's receptionist, Elizabeth Lightly, and a colleague, Dr
Frans Roodt, on Monday identified some of the surgeon's personal
belongings stolen in the hijacking and recovered by the police.
	   The trial continues Tuesday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After U.S. and Russian envoys failed
to rally Albanian factions behind a single leader, a senior U.S.
official blamed the Yugoslav government Monday for driving ethnic
Albanians into the extremist camp.
	   The growing influence of the Kosovo Liberation Army among ethnic
Albanians has hindered negotiations for peace in the rebellious
Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Afanasyevsky tried Sunday to persuade all Albanian factions
to accept moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova. The militants have no
political leadership and have so far refused.
	   In the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard
sharply criticized the Yugoslav government, saying they
``mishandled'' the Kosovo problem, ``particularly in the first
three months of this terrible crisis which has produced a dramatic
radicalization and polarization of the situation.''
	   Gelbard said the police actions in early March _ when 80 ethnic
Albanians died in Kosovo _ ``probably did more to send people over
to support the KLA than any efforts they have ever put together.''
	   ``I occasionally feel that the government is the best ally that
the Kosovo Liberation Army has in radicalizing the situation,'' he
said.
	   While Gelbard noted that NATO has accelerated planning for
military intervention, he stressed that there should be no changes
in the borders of Yugoslavia, which is dominated by the republic of
Serbia.
	   A group of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States,
Russia, Poland and the European Union, got a firsthand look Monday
at parts of Kosovo that have seen heavy fighting since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants began in February,
killing hundreds of people.
	   Monday's trip was the trial-run for a series of diplomatic
missions that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic approved after
a meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Since those talks
last month, Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy
to Kosovo that he revoked in 1989.
	   Rugova and others are demanding full independence, but he is
considered a more acceptable negotiating partner because he opposes
violence.
	   Violence, meanwhile, flared in the province. The ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center reported heavy shelling of
Lodja village in western Kosovo, that killed one and injured three
people.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing them to repel the assault.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.
	   The bodies of three men _ ethnic Albanians last seen going into
their cornfields Sunday _ were discovered Monday near the southwest
border with Albania. The men had been shot in the head and their
wrists bore burn marks from having been bound.

Border policemen suspended for shooting at Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two members of Israel's paramilitary police
unit have been suspended for three weeks after a report found they
fired against orders on crowds of rioting Palestinians, a police
official said.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the military report accused the two
border policemen of firing with ``intent to kill,'' after
interviewing several of its soldiers in the vicinity at the time of
the shooting. The Israeli army spokesman's office said it had no
official comment on the report.
	   The report was a review of the military's performance during
rioting which broke out across Palestinian territories in May
during a Palestinian protest marking Israel's founding 50 years
ago.
	   During the rioting, both Israeli troops and Palestinians
exchanged fire, leaving five Palestinians dead. The army report
concluded that during the rioting two border policemen continued to
fire despite orders to stop. Israeli police spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin said that the report noted however that no one had died as
a result of the continued fire.
	   According to Channel 2, the army issued orders to act with
restraint and only shoot protesters in the legs but the border
police claimed they never received such an order.
	   The border police unit is attached to the national police
department, is heavily armed and trained for combat and often works
side-by-side with the Israeli military. Menuhin said the police are
not willing to accept the findings of the army report although they
did suspend the two border policemen to three weeks.
	   The border police have been involved in several cases of abuse
on the job in recent years. Last year, several men were caught on
videotape beating Palestinians.

Maradona says Argentine soccer should return to its roots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's national soccer team
needs to return to its traditional attacking style, one-time
captain Diego Maradona said Monday.
	   ``It has to return to the roots,'' Maradona told a local radio
station. ``The team didn't know how to finish off the game against
Holland and they didn't do what the Argentines asked of them _
which was to maintain the ball and go out playing.''
	   The 37-year-old retired star said the Argentine team only came
to life offensively when Claudio Lopez, Gabriel Batistuta and
Sebastion Veron were able to work together.
	   He said Argentina's best offensive oppurtunity came in the
second half when Veron hit a streaking Batistuta whose shot then
hit the post.
	   ``I believe that, first and foremost, you have to give them
(members of the team) a yank on the ear for lying to the people,
for not knowing how to work'' on the national team, the veteran of
four World Cups said.
	   Maradona said his criticism of the team had nothing to do with
his rocky relationship with Daniel Passarella, Argentina's coach
during the competition.
	   When asked his thoughts on a tournament champion, Maradona said,
``I believe this championship is made for France, but it's not
going to be easy.''

needs to return to its traditional attacking style, one-time

	   ``It has to return to the roots,'' Maradona told a local radio

Stolen Van Goghs, Cezanne recovered; museum guard among arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with QUOTES by gallery director about arrested guard;
EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; With ROM112-113
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' was in a cardboard box
under a bed. Cezanne's ``The Cabin of Jourdan'' was wrapped in a
blanket atop an armoire. ``The Woman from Arles,'' another van
Gogh, was hidden in a Turin apartment.
	   By Monday afternoon, the three paintings, stolen May 19, were
back in Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art, and eight people,
including the museum's No. 2 in charge of security, were under
arrest for suspected theft.
	   Museum officials said the undamaged works, which include Italy's
only two publicly displayed van Goghs, would go quickly back on
exhibit, likely sometime Tuesday, assuming new frames were ready.
	   The heist by three armed men who tied up museum guards on a
night when the closed-circuit surveillance system was broken
embarrassed a country whose vast artistic patrimony is frequently a
victim of theft or vandalism.
	   ``This was a bleeding wound that Italy didn't deserve,'' Deputy
Premier Walter Veltroni, who is also culture minister, told
reporters. ``Today the wound is closed.''
	   Judging by the arrests before dawn Monday by police officers
barging into apartments in Rome and in Turin, the theft was a
family affair.
	   Arrested in a lower-class Rome neighborhood where ``The
Gardener'' and the Cezanne were found were a 44-year-old Roman and
his 25-year-old daughter, who was suspected of having driven the
getaway car.
	   The security guard, arrested along with her husband in another
apartment, was a 32-year-old Roman who worked for 12 years at the
gallery. Arrested in the same apartment was a 40-year-old Turin
man.
	   Also arrested in Rome was a 45-year-old man with previous
arrests for robbery, theft and a murder, authorities said.
	   The two other arrests came in Turin.
	   Investigators theorized that all three paintings were not kept
in the same place because the members of the gang didn't trust each
other.
	   Police said the gang apparently had hoped to find a private
collector willing to pay big money to possess the works
clandestinely.
	   The art, together worth at least dlrs 30 million, was too famous
to sell openly.
	   Police said they seized rifles, revolvers, a machine-pistol,
masks, ammunition and wigs.
	   The suspects included several people involved in holdups in
Belgium, said Gen. Roberto Conforti, commander of the Carabinieri
art theft squad.
	   After the theft, background checks had turned up contacts by the
security guard with some of the other suspects with criminal
records, Conforti said.
	   Gallery director Gianna Piantoni said Monday's joy was tempered
by news that the heist was an inside job, adding: ``Sure, this
episode underlines the necessity of better training and choosing
our personnel.''
	   Satisfaction was also mixed with caution.
	   ``The success cannot make us forget that the problem of the
safety of Italian artworks is still open,'' said a member of the
parliamentary culture commission, Giuseppe Rossetto.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One German captain serving
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia was killed and three
others injured in a road accident, the German Army in Bosnia said
Monday.
	   According the statement, the accident occurred Monday south of
the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, when an armored transport vehicle
ran off the road and rolled over.
	   The injured servicemen are being treated in the Rajlovac field
hospital, where the German peacekeepers have their headquarters.
	   The accident is being investigated. No names were released
pending notification of the soldier's family.
	   Since the international peacekeepers were deployed in December

Mexico ruling party rebounds with victory in Chihuahua

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Written off by some as a dying relic,
Mexico's ruling party rebounded Monday with a dramatic election
victory, reclaiming the governor's office in this northern border
state.
	   ``We transformed the PRI and the people responded,'' Chihuahua's
Gov.-elect, Patricio Martinez, said Monday, referring to the
Institutional Revolutionary Party by its Spanish initials.
	   It was the first time the PRI, which until a decade ago
controlled every state in Mexico, has recaptured a state lost to an
opposition party. And it was a major boost after a string of
defeats _ including the loss of the PRI's majority in Congress last
year.
	   The PRI also won the governor's race in north-central Durango
state in Sunday's elections, but a leftist opposition candidate was
the apparent victor in Zacatecas, another northern state.
	   Chihuahua state election officials said that with 75 percent of
the vote counted, Martinez led Ramon Galindo of the conservative
National Action Party by 341,247 votes to 276,048 _ 51 percent to
42 percent. Three other candidates split the rest.
	   The victory belies claims that the PRI would wither once out of
power, at least on a state level. Created in 1929 to govern Mexico,
the party historically has depended on handing out patronage to a
network of labor, farm and social groups.
	   The Chihuahua state PRI was devastated when Francisco Barrio of
National Action was elected governor in 1992 _ a victory fed by
widespread belief that fraud had robbed him of the post six years
earlier.
	   The PRI was forced to lay off hundreds of its workers, and new
officials campaigned against corruption. They scoured state
payrolls, firing hundreds of PRI activists who worked for the party
rather than at their state jobs.
	   Deeply in debt, the PRI had so much trouble paying bills that
power and phones were cut off to its state headquarters for a time.
	   Asked when the party began to rebound, spokesman Victor Alvidres
joked: ``About two months ago.'' In fact, the party recaptured a
majority in the state legislature in 1995.
	   The PRI maintained power nationally and had a strong statewide
network of activists. National Action never managed to create a
rival grassroots base. After decades of crusading against
corruption, it also was tarnished by a few scandals gleefully
publicized by the PRI.
	   For the first time, the PRI experimented with a primary open to
voters of any party. Martinez, once mayor of the Chihuahua state
capital, defeated Artemio Iglesias, whose years in Mexico City had
made him popular with party leaders but little known locally.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has said he would like to see a
similar primary nationwide to choose the presidential candidate in
2000.
	   ``I think the PRI won because of the popularity of its
candidate,'' said Alberto Montoya, who voted for National Action in
1992 but displayed a Martinez poster in his shoe store window this
year.
	   He said Galindo ``did not know how to solve problems'' as mayor
of Ciudad Juarez.
	   In Zacatecas, the PRI's gubernatorial candidate suffered a
stinging loss to the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
	   Ricardo Monreal, once a federal congressman for the PRI, jumped
to Democratic Revolution after PRI party leaders chose Jose Olvera
Acevedo as their candidate for governor.
	   With 78 percent of the ballots counted, Monreal had 188,878
votes to Olvera's 158,724, state election officials said.
	   It was the leftist party's first gubernatorial victory, and it
came in the north, where the party has been weak. Democratic
Revolution received only about 5 percent of the votes in Chihuahua.
	   In Durango state, partial returns indicated the PRI's candidate,
Angel Sergio Guerrero Mier, had easily won the governor's race.
	   The PRI did not accept defeat in any state until 1989. Since
then it has lost Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Nuevo Leon,
Guanajuato and Queretaro, all to National Action.

Israeli troops scuffle with Palestinians, Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with throwing of stones and fire bombs by Palestinian
youth, graf 4.
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops scuffled with
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in this tense divided city Monday
after each side blamed the other for carrying out violent attacks.
	   Some 30 Jewish settlers who blocked a main thoroughfare to
protest a firebomb they said was thrown at one of their compounds,
pushed and shoved with Israeli soldiers who tried to force them
back off the road.
	   Moments later, a Palestinian-owned carpet and housewares shop
along the street caught fire. Palestinian shopkeepers managed to
extinguish it quickly and then accused the settlers of setting the
blaze. The ruckus brought dozens of angry Palestinians out of their
shops and into the street, but troops managed to calm the area and
by dusk, both sides headed home.
	   Later Monday night, another outbreak of violence erupted when
some 20 Palestinian youths took to the streets and rooftops of the
city's center and threw stones and fire bombs towards Israeli
soldiers. Palestinian police broke up the protesters and there were
no injuries.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, a city of 130,000
Palestinians. The center of town is patrolled by Israeli troops
deployed there to protect the settlers, while 80 percent of the
city is under Palestinian control.
	   Also Monday, a 16 year-old Jewish settler was arrested on
suspicion that he and two others smashed the windows of Arab-owned
cars in Hebron last week.
	   On Friday, three Israelis on horseback shattered windshields and
dented the bodies of cars belonging to Palestinians in Hebron. The
attackers were armed with chains and wore checkered Arab head
dresses.
	   One suspect, 19-year-old Nathaniel Nir from Jerusalem, was
arrested during the rampage. A second suspect, a 16-year-old
resident of Hebron, was arrested Monday, police said. His name was
not released because he is a minor.
	   Hebron is one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and the
Palestinian residents have long complained that Israeli police do
little to protect them against vigilante attacks by settlers.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In stinging personal attacks, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition legislators accused each other
Monday of deceiving the Israeli people and foreign leaders about
Mideast peacemaking.
	   A special Knesset debate turned into a shouting match as
Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak traded insults over who
was more politically out of touch and dependent on U.S.-based
political advisors or image makers for direction.
	   Barak said Netanyahu hurt Israel's credibility and could no
longer get world leaders on the phone.
	   ``(Yasser) Arafat is not willing to talk to you,'' Barak said,
referring to the Palestinian leader. He then reeled off a list,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton and Arab leaders whom he said
would no longer take calls from Netanyahu. ``Instead of peace, you
are bringing us closer to war.''
	   Netanyahu responded that Barak was not capable of being prime
minister.
	   ``I think Barak is suitable to be the head of opposition for
many years to come,'' he said.
	   At the same time, Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for the
stalled peace talks and asked the opposition to join in a unified
call to Arafat to fulfill his side of the peace accords.
	   Netanyahu said the Palestinians have refused to carry out their
security promises, such as rounding up illegal weapons and reducing
the size of their police force.
	   Netanyahu had not spoken to parliament about the peace talks in
seven months. Barak's Labor Party forced his hand by collecting
signatures from one-third of the 120 legislators demanding a
debate.
	   The negotiations have been stalled since March 1997 and are now
deadlocked over the scope of a promised Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank.
	   The United States wants Netanyahu to agree to a plan for a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the land, but he has given no
indication he will accept it. Arab leaders have warned that a lack
of progress could lead to violence.
	   In the West Bank city of Hebron on Monday, Palestinians threw
firebombs toward Israeli soldiers who scuffled earlier with
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the tense town.
	   The settlers accused Palestinians of a firebomb attack on their
compound, and the Palestinians blamed the settlers for a fire at a
Palestinian-owned shop.
	   In the Knesset debate, Netanyahu challenged Labor's claims that
before he took power two years ago, Israel enjoyed greater standing
in the world and there was a feeling that a genuine peace was in
reach.
	   Citing the wave of bus bombings by the radical Palestinian
Islamic movement Hamas in 1996 that preceded his election,
Netanyahu said he preferred his hard-line approach.
	   ``There was faith, joy, and hope, but I prefer less faith, less
joy, less hope, and more security,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu also accused the Labor Party that governed from 1992
to 1996 of secretly making far-reaching territorial concessions to
the Palestinians and Syria.
	   ``Don't talk to us about credibility,'' Netanyahu said, wagging
his finger at the benches of the opposition. ``What you should do
is sit quietly and with your heads bowed in shame.''
	   Netanyahu's own credibility has been questioned repeatedly by
political foes and allies alike, most recently by the Israeli
president and the armed forces chief of staff.
	   On Monday, he dismissed reports that he misled Cabinet ministers
about the government's decision to back down in a recent standoff
with the Palestinians over the use of a Gaza Strip road.

West African Airline faces loss of four jets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 2nd graf that company is dlrs 50 million in
arrears, quote on holding company plan, other details. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The debt-ridden West African airline
Air Afrique will have to turn over one-quarter of its fleet of jets
Tuesday to pay off its creditors, the company has announced.
	   Air Afrique, which is co-owned by 11 countries across West
Africa, will have to turn over the four Airbus jets to help pay
debts totaling dlrs 300 million _ of which dlrs 50 million is in
arrears, the Abidjan-based company said in a statement dated
Saturday.
	   The company, seen by its member countries as an important symbol
of the business and financial opportunities available in West
Africa, has recently improved its profitability, but not enough to
offset its debts.
	   Air Afrique will be left with 11 remaining aircraft, the company
said.
	   The statement said the airline would keep its routes going
between member states but that long-haul flights would be
curtailed. Air Afrique has long-haul flights to to the United
States, France and South Africa.
	   The company's financial plight worsened considerably after the
1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc, the currency shared by the
company's member states. The currency was devalued by 50 percent.
	   Burdened with a crippling debt, the company had announced nearly
two years ago that it would set up a separate company that would
buy the airline's fleet and then lease the jets back, but the plan
has yet to go into affect.
	   ``Difficulties encountered in setting up this holding company
led creditors to decide to repossess the four A310-300,'' a later
Air Afrique statement said.
	   Company officials were not immediately available for further
comment Monday.
	   Air Afrique USA set up 36 years ago and is jointly owned by
eleven French-speaking African countries: Ivory Coast, Senegal,
Mauritania, Chad, Niger, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Congo, Mali and
the Central African Republic.

Aurelio Arizmendi over for trial. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The wife of a leader of Mexico's most feared
kidnapping ring has turned herself into police and helped them
recover dlrs 1.1 million, the attorney general's office said.
	   Adriana Suarez Arista is the wife of Aurelio Arizmendi Lopez,
who along with his brother Daniel is accused of running a
high-ransom kidnapping gang known for cutting off the ears of its
victims.
	   She turned herself into police on Sunday, the attorney general's
office said in a statement.
	   The agency says it now has seized most of the profits that the
kidnapping gang has earned over the last three years _ more than
dlrs 4.5 million in cash and nearly dlrs 2 million more in
property.
	   Police captured Aurelio Arizmendi on June 30 after a shootout
that wounded him in both legs. On Monday, a judge ordered him held
over for trial on weapons charges. He also faces organized crime
and other charges.
	   His brother, allegedly the head of the gang, remains at large.

Berlusconi's Italian soccer team to be quoted on market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ AC Milan, the Italian soccer club controlled
by Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, will be quoted on the stock
exchange by the end of 2000, a club official said Monday.
	   Chief executive officer Adriano Galliani said that the club
expects to see a significant boost in profit from the sale of
television rights starting with the 1999-2000 fiscal year.
	   Earlier Monday, Galliani stepped down as one of the managing
directors of television and advertising company Mediaset to
concentrate on the development plans of the soccer club.
	   Both Mediaset and Milan are controlled by Fininvest, the holding
company controlled by center-right opposition leader and former
premier Berlusconi.
	   In other developments Monday, Mediaset said that it has named
Maurizio Carlotti as managing director for media and content.
	   Carlotti, who has been a Mediaset board member since April 1997
and who heads Mediaset's Spanish unit Telecinco, suggested that he
would work more on expanding Mediaset's presence on international
markets, and in particular in Europe.
	   ``The playing field can longer be Italy,'' Carlotti said. ``We
must look towards Europe.''
	   Thus far, only one Italian soccer club, Lazio, has been quoted
on the stock market.
	   The Bologna soccer club plans to go to the market in the autumn
of 1998.

First confession in doping trial of East German sports figures

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German sports doctor admitted Monday
to handing out steroids, the first confession in a trial of six
communist-era sports figures charged with hurting swimmers with
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Dieter Binus, 59, insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill side
effects.
	   Binus, another doctor and four East German coaches are charged
with causing bodily harm to 19 young swimmers _ teen-agers at the
time _ by giving them anabolic steroids without informing them or
their parents.
	   According to the charges, the women suffer from such problems as
unnatural body hair, excessive muscle growth, voice changes or
severe acne.
	   Prosecutors say they have evidence that the coaches and doctors
knew the health risks of steroids but nevertheless administered
them under a communist state-sponsored push to create world
champions.
	   All the defendants _ including Binus _ had denied the charges.
But Binus reversed his stance this month and told the court he
wanted to make a statement.
	   Binus said he distributed the pills to the coaches, who were
supposed to give them to the athletes. The dosage ranged from five
to 10 milligrams over three to four weeks, he said.
	   Because the dosage never exceeded 1,000 milligrams per year,
damaging side-effects were not possible, he testified.
	   Binus also denied ever giving testosterone injections or other
drugs.
	   He said as doctor for the Dynamo Berlin team since 1979, he did
not make his own decisions, but was answerable to the doctors'
commission in the swimming association.
	   He said his co-defendant, association doctor Bernd Pansold,
decided which Olympic candidates were to receive the so-called
``supporting means.'' Binus said he wanted to quit in 1980 because
he opposed the drug policy and other ``political decisions,'' but
was unable to leave the club until 1986.
	   The other defendants are coaches Rolf Glaeser, 58, Volker
Frischke, 53, Dieter Lindemann, 46, and Dieter Krause, 50.
	   Binus' statement opens the way for the court to separate his
case from the other five, who have denied all charges. Binus could
be sentenced next month; the maximum he faces is a fine.

Doctor: Libyan leader suffers bone fracture, to undergo surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Islamic prayer gathering, details, officials
gathered. flight embargo background. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AL-BAYDA, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fractured a
bone near his hip after tripping and falling while exercising, his
doctor said.
	   The announcement was made during a live television broadcast in
which Gadhafi, draped in a white sheet, lay on a hospital bed and
welcomed visiting African dignitaries: six presidents and
representatives of other countries who had gathered in this
northern coastal town to attend special Islamic prayers marking the
birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammed.
	   Also present in the room was U.S. Muslim activist Louis
Farrakhan.
	   Gadhafi was to undergo surgery later Monday, the doctor said at
a news conference in a large conference hall.
	   Gadhafi was shown speaking with his hands propping up his head.
His voice sounded strong but he occasionally grimaced.
	   His left foot, peeking out from under the sheet, rested against
a traction bar attached to the bed.
	   The doctor, who did not identify himself, described the injury
as a ``straightforward fracture.'' He displayed X-rays showing the
top of the femur, the leg bone that extends from the knee to the
hip. It was unclear if Gadhafi suffered a broken leg bone or a
broken hip.
	   In his comments, Gadhafi said that during the past few weeks
news organizations ``fabricated'' reports that he survived an
assassination attempt. ``Now it is true there is a break, but last
time there was nothing,'' he said.
	   A Libyan Islamic opposition group claimed it killed four
bodyguards and wounded Gadhafi in a June 1 attack. Libyan officials
immediately denied the claim.
	   Gadhafi was supposed to have led the special prayers for which
he invited the African leaders, including two who arrived Monday in
a plane in defiance of a U.N. air embargo.
	   Libya has occasionally broken the embargo but faced no
retaliation from the United Nations.
	   Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad and Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of
Niger flew into Libya aboard a Libyan Boeing 707 that Gadhafi sent
to the Chadian capital of N'djamena to fetch them.
	   Earlier, the chief of staff of the Chad's army also arrived in a
Chadian jet, only the second non-Libyan aircraft to break the
embargo this year, state television said.
	   It said presidents Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Farrakhan arrived earlier Monday.
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh came on Sunday. Senegal's President
Abdou Diouf was also here. All, however, came by road.
	   The gathering is another one of Gadhafi's high-profile efforts
to show that he has the support of other Muslim nations in his
dispute with the West.
	   The United Nations imposed an air and arms embargo on Libya in
1992 after it refused to extradite two Libyan men accused in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people. The embargo forbids flights to and out of Libya.
	   Earlier this month, the Organization of African Unity requested
that member states ignore sanctions with humanitarian or religious
implications and those relating to official OAU business.

Israeli troops scuffle with Palestinians, Jewish settlers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pushing match between Arafat advisor and Hebron
settlers, graf 6 &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops scuffled with
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in this tense divided city Monday
after each side blamed the other for carrying out violent attacks.
	   Some 30 Jewish settlers who blocked a main thoroughfare to
protest a firebomb they said was thrown at one of their compounds,
pushed and shoved with Israeli soldiers who tried to force them
back off the road.
	   Moments later, a Palestinian-owned carpet and housewares shop
along the street caught fire. Palestinian shopkeepers managed to
extinguish it quickly and then accused the settlers of setting the
blaze. The ruckus brought dozens of angry Palestinians out of their
shops and into the street, but troops managed to calm the area and
by dusk, both sides headed home.
	   Later Monday night, another outbreak of violence erupted when
some 20 Palestinian youths took to the streets and rooftops of the
city's center and threw stones and fire bombs towards Israeli
soldiers. Palestinian police broke up the protesters and there were
no injuries.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, a city of 130,000
Palestinians. The center of town is patrolled by Israeli troops
deployed there to protect the settlers, while 80 percent of the
city is under Palestinian control.
	   Meanwhile in Jerusalem, senior aide to Yasser Arafat, Ahmed
Tibi, scuffled with two Hebron settlers after the broadcast of a
popular Israeli political talk show. Both sides gave different
versions of how the confrontation began, but there were no
injuries, Israeli Radio reported.
	   Also Monday, a 16 year-old Jewish settler was arrested on
suspicion that he and two others smashed the windows of Arab-owned
cars in Hebron last week.
	   On Friday, three Israelis on horseback shattered windshields and
dented the bodies of cars belonging to Palestinians in Hebron. The
attackers were armed with chains and wore checkered Arab head
dresses.
	   One suspect, 19-year-old Nathaniel Nir from Jerusalem, was
arrested during the rampage. A second suspect, a 16-year-old
resident of Hebron, was arrested Monday, police said. His name was
not released because he is a minor.
	   Hebron is one of the tensest areas in the West Bank, and the
Palestinian residents have long complained that Israeli police do
little to protect them against vigilante attacks by settlers.

Basilica's ceiling during September's quakes might not be back in
place by the time the upper church reopens for Christmas Eve 1999
services, restorers said Monday.
	   Antonio Paolucci, in charge of the restoration, said 70 experts
have been working for months to try to piece together some 50,000
painting fragments, the Italian news agency ANSA reported from
Assisi, a hilltown in central Italy.
	   The vaulted ceiling of the upper level of the two-tier basilica
collapsed in the quakes.
	   The ceiling was decorated with frescoes from the school of
Giotto and by Cimabue, the two artists considered ``fathers'' of
Italian painting.
	   A computer is helping the experts to put together the pieces.

	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, a 20-year-old rookie from
South Korea, became the youngest U.S. Women's Open champion Monday
when she outlasted amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in the first sudden
death in the history of this tournament.
	   Pak birdied the second extra hole with an 18-foot (5.5-meter)
birdie putt.
	   The twosome was tied at 2-over 73 after an 18-hole playoff at

	   Pak, who won the LPGA Championship in May, became the first
rookie to win two majors since Juli Inkster captured the Nabisco
Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984. Inkster was 22
when she won two.
	   Pak, who is South Korea's most famous athlete, overcame a
four-stroke deficit after five holes of the 18-hole playoff, thanks
to a triple-bogey by Chuasiriporn on No. 6. Pak didn't take the
lead until the 14th hole.
	   The last woman to win consecutive majors was American Meg Mallon
in 1991.
	   Chuasiriporn was trying to become only the second amateur to win
in 53 editions of the Women's Open. Catherine LaCoste is the only
amateur to win the biggest event in women's golf, as a 22-year-old
in 1967.
	   The last playoff in the Open was in 1992, when Patty Sheehan
defeated fellow American Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont, Pa.

Maradona says Argentine soccer should return to its roots

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's national soccer team
needs to return to its traditional attacking style, one-time
captain Diego Maradona said Monday.
	   ``It has to return to the roots,'' Maradona told a local radio
station.''The team never played with the style of Argentine
football but disguised itself in European style.''
	   The 37-year-old retired star said ``the team didn't know how to
finish off the game against Holland and they didn't do what the
Argentines asked of them _ which was to maintain the ball and go
out playing.''
	   He said the Argentine team only came to life offensively when
Claudio Lopez, Gabriel Batistuta and Sebastion Veron were able to
work together.
	   He said Argentina's best offensive oppurtunity came in the
second half when Veron hit a streaking Batistuta whose shot then
hit the post.
	   ``I believe that, first and foremost, you have to give them
(members of the team) a yank on the ear for lying to the people,
for not knowing how to work'' on the national team, the veteran of
four World Cups said.
	   Maradona said his criticism of the team had nothing to do with
his rocky relationship with Daniel Passarella, Argentina's coach
during the competition.
	   When asked his thoughts on a tournament champion, Maradona said,
``I believe this championship is made for France, but it's not
going to be easy.''

Exile group sends raft with aid to Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a protest aimed at the United States and
Fidel Castro's government, a Cuban exile group sent a self-guided
blimp and raft loaded with food and humanitarian aid into Cuban
territory Monday.
	   The Miami-based Democracy Movement said it was the first action
by an exile group in Cuban territory since Cuba shot down two
unarmed planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue in 1996, killing
four exiles.
	   The raft, containing food, soap and other supplies, was launched
late Sunday from Cuban waters, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from
the Cuban coast, said Luis Felipe Rojas, a Democracy Movement
spokesman. Attached to the raft was a 6-meter-long (20-foot) blimp
with the word ``Democracy.''
	   A month ago, the United States resumed direct humanitarian aid
to Cuba, which had been suspended after the planes were shot down.
President Bill Clinton lifted the ban after Pope John Paul II
visited Cuba in January.
	   Democracy Movement said in a statement that it ``needs neither a
foreign law, nor the arrogant denial of the Cuban government, to
take assistance to its own people.''
	   It described the operation as ``a new tactic within its
nonviolent strategy to claim the right to return to help the Cuban
people.''
	   The balloon could be seen from a coastal highway outside Havana,
the Mexican government news agency, Notimex, reported from Havana.
Later, some foreign journalists could see the deflated balloon and
raft on El Chivo beach, west of Havana, Notimex said. Security
agents kept reporters from getting close to the scene.
	   Many people were in the area at the time because a movie was
being filmed, Notimex said.
	   Luis Diaz, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami, said
the agency had no knowledge of the group's action.
	   In April, the Coast Guard seized a Democracy Movement boat that
tried to sail into Cuban waters. The boat was later returned.

	   The playoff came after high drama on No. 18, where both golfers
bogeyed the par-4.
	   Pak's tee shots were true all day until she hooked it toward the
lake on 18, the ball landing in the rough on a steep slope. Her
caddie, Jeff Cable, had to help her so that she didn't slip into
the water as she took a look.
	   Taking off her spikes and socks, Pak stepped into the calf-deep
water, took an A-wedge and pitched the ball into the rough on the
other side of the fairway.
	   After offering her wedge to her caddie to help pull her back
ashore, Pak hit a 148-yard (135-meters) shot onto the green, about
15 feet (4.5 meters) from the hole and finally cracked a smile as
she acknowledged the gallery's cheers.
	   Chuasiriporn's chip for a birdie from the rough was way too hard
and ended up 10 feet (3 meters) past the hole.
	   Pak's putt for par was short, leaving Chuasiriporn with a chance
to win it all with a 10-foot (3-meter) putt. But the ball went past
by less than an inch (2 1/2 centimeters), and her tap-in sent the
twosome back to the 564-yard (516-meter), par-5 10th hole for
sudden death.
	   There, they each parred with tap-in putts.
	   And it was off to the 374-yard (342-meter) par-4 No. 11, where
Chuasiriporn missed a 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt, then watched
Pak sink an 18-footer (5.5- meter shot) for the win on the
tournament's 92nd hole.
	   Pak overcame an early four-stroke deficit.
	   Chuasiriporn, who sank a riveting 40-foot (12 meter) putt on the
final hole Sunday to force a playoff, birdied three of the first
five holes. She took a four-stroke lead before a triple-bogey on
No. 6 prevented a runaway.
	   Pak, whose drives were steady but short game off through the
front nine, didn't lead until her birdie on 14, but she bogeyed the
next hole and the playoff was tied going into the water-lined final
three holes.
	   Chuasiriporn saved par on the par-3 17th after putting her ball
within five feet with a pitching-wedge shot from the rough. Pak's
putt for birdie missed by an inch (about 2 1/2 centimeters).

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Garrison Keillor says he's not much
of a storyteller.
	   ``I don't think I can (tell a story). I don't really,'' Keillor
said. ``I'm not very good at it. I'm good at impersonating it. I
can stand up there and impersonate a storyteller pretty well.''
	   His faithful listeners would disagree.
	   Keillor brought his radio show ``A Prairie Home Companion'' to
Kansas City for the Fourth of July. The program is produced by
Minnesota Public Radio and distributed by Public Radio
International.
	   ``I like the idea of being close to the center of the country on
the Fourth of July,'' Keillor said. ``I'm very fond of the Fourth
of July. It's a holiday that's looking for some kind of revival.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 5-11 with widespread protests, riots

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Seeking to contain Protestant
fury, a government-appointed commission ruled Monday that Belfast's
most disputed Orange Order march should be permitted to pass a
hostile Catholic neighborhood next week.
	   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission admitted its verdict
took into account widespread Protestant anger over the ongoing
blockade of a bigger march in Portadown, the Orange Order's rural
heartland.
	   ``This isn't justice. This is obviously just giving in to Orange
pressure and trying to buy off the mob in Portadown,'' said the
Lower Ormeau protest leader, former IRA prisoner Gerard Rice, who
pledged to challenge the decision in a Belfast court.
	   The July 13 march by several hundred Orangemen would be the
first Protestant parade allowed past Lower Ormeau's eight hard-line
Catholic side streets in more than a year. Rice refused to say
whether protesters would try to block Ormeau Road, as they have
done since 1995, in defiance of the commission's ruling.
	   Despite the Belfast decision, Protestants determined to overturn
the ban on the march in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of
Belfast, protested or rioted for a second straight night across
Northern Ireland.
	   The hijacking and burning of cars as road barricades began in
the afternoon Craigavon, Portadown's neighbor, where thugs hijacked
and torched a bus and two cars.
	   Soon Orangemen and other Protestants formed human blockades on
several main Belfast roads and Shaftesbury Square, where youths
nearby began bombarding riot police with stones and bricks. As
darkness fell, billowing clouds of smoke could be seen several
points on the skyline were cars were burning.
	   In religiously polarized west Belfast, rival mobs of Protestants
and Catholics threw rocks, bricks and bottles at each other over
the high fencing that separates their two neighborhoods.
	   More than 1,000 Protestants poured into Hillsborough, one of
Northern Ireland's prettiest villages and the official home of the
British Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam.
	   Bus and train services were canceled from early evening across
Northern Ireland.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of any casualties or arrests
in connection with Monday night's resumed mayhem. Police said they
arrested about 30 people during the first night's rioting in
Belfast, Londonderry and smaller towns. A police inspector's skull
was fractured by a mob burning a car near Londonderry.

Six months after agreement, Panama-U.S. drug center appears doomed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Six months after agreeing to
transform a U.S. military base into a center to track
drug-smuggling planes across Latin America, the United States and
Panama have all but abandoned the project.
	   Talks between the two countries on setting up the center have
stalled, and the good will that greeted the December accord
establishing the center has given way to irritation.
	   With chances now dim that negotiations can be revived, the
United States is looking at alternative bases for its drug-fighting
efforts in the hemisphere.
	   ``We've run out of time,'' U.S. Ambassador William Hughes said
in an interview last week.
	   When an agreement to establish the center at Howard Air Base was
announced in December after yearlong negotiations, it appeared to
be a victory for both sides.
	   The civilian-run center, using radar and sophisticated aircraft
to catch drug smugglers, would replace a similar U.S. anti-drug
operation now at the base.
	   For the United States, that was good news since Howard, along
with the Panama Canal and other U.S. military facilities, is to be
turned over to Panama in 1999.
	   With U.S. advisers assigned to the center, Washington could play
a leading role in drug-interdiction efforts in the hemisphere.
	   Also, by involving other Latin American nations in the center,
U.S. diplomats could promote international cooperation in the fight
against drugs, rather than unilateral policies that cause regional
resentment.
	   For Panama, the center also would help offset revenue that will
be lost after U.S. troops pull out, while giving the country of 2.4
million people an important regional role.
	   ``There are many factors that make this anti-drug center in the
interests of both governments,'' said Amber Moss, former U.S.
ambassador to Panama and director of the North-South Center at the
University of Miami.
	   But soon after the accord was reached in December, the din of
criticism grew in Panama, tapping an especially raw nerve in
U.S.-Panama relations: the extent of U.S. military control over the
center.
	   President Ernesto Perez Balladares soon weighed in, saying the
agreement was partial to the United States and that much remained
to be worked out. Facing domestic opposition, he demanded changes
that U.S. officials say were never on the table.
	   In Washington, the center has always had less than unanimous
support, U.S. officials said. Pentagon officials were always
lukewarm about spending money on a project they don't consider
strictly military and some State Department officials worried about
a backlash against the U.S. military presence.
	   Today, the two sides are at loggerheads. Panama has a new
proposal that U.S. negotiators say is unacceptable; it was unclear
what that proposal is. Panamanian officials have backpedaled,
saying they can't live with the previous agreement.
	   Foreign Minister Ricardo Arias said the project is dead unless
the United States accepts Panama's position, ``or we're creative
and find an alternative.''
	   ``But we've already analyzed all the alternatives,'' he said.
	   In addition to the issue of what role the U.S. military will
play at the center, there is the question of how long Panama will
play host.
	   The United States also wants to use the center for missions that
have nothing to do with drugs, such as search-and-rescue and
training operations.
	   But for Panama, that amounts to keeping a U.S. military base in
the country after all bases are supposed to close. It's a sensitive
subject in a place that is about to shake a century-long foreign
military presence.
	   U.S. officials also want Panama to authorize the center for 12
years, and accuse Panama of negotiating in bad faith.
	   According to one U.S. official, the United States wanted a
15-year mandate and Panama wanted 10. In the December agreement,
they compromised with 12.
	   But with the political backlash, Panama now wants an ``opt-out''
provision after three years. From the U.S. perspective, that's far
too soon to make building the center pay off.
	   An electorate-splitting battle over U.S. troops on Panamanian
soil is the last thing Perez Balladares wants; a referendum on
changing the Constitution to allow him to run for a second term is
scheduled for Aug. 30.
	   U.S. officials say a decision on the center cannot wait for the
referendum. President Clinton's top foreign policy aides are
expected to convene this month to make a final ruling, a U.S.
official said.
	   ``We've got a time problem,'' Hughes said. ``We're planning to
stay and we're planning to leave. And that's costly.''
	   So are the alternatives.
	   The United States is considering moving the center to the
southern United States or the northern Caribbean. But that could
prove costly and put the center farther away from drug-smuggling
activity.
	   U.S. government estimates say the extra flying time would force
the center to cut back 30 percent to 50 percent of its missions, or
spend 30 to 50 percent more.
	   And if that happens, Arias said, only the drug smugglers would
win.

Sleaze controversy hits Blair's government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs comment from GPC in grafs 11 and 12; pickup graf 12 pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Labor Party official who boasted he could
arrange access to government officials and documents was suspended
by a Canadian-based lobbying company Monday, and he was fired from
his job as a newspaper columnist.
	   The controversy embroiled Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party government in charges of sleaziness_ an issue which helped
topple the Conservative government in national elections 14 months
ago.
	   The Express newspaper dismissed Derek Draper because he
reportedly said his columns were reviewed by a government minister
before publication.
	   The Observer newspaper, which had reporters pose as
representatives of U.S. energy companies, reported Sunday that
Draper was among three former aides to government ministers who are
now selling their contacts.
	   Draper works for GPC Marketing Access, part of GPC Canada of
Toronto.	   
	   The newspaper also said that a former lobbyist, Roger Liddle,
now a member of Blair's Policy Unit, told the undercover reporters:
``Just tell me what you want, who you want to meet and Derek
(Draper) and I will make the call for you.''
	   Liddle said he was just being friendly and never offered to fix
up meetings on behalf of GPC.
	   The Observer said the lobbyists claimed to be able to get
privileged access to government ministers and policies, including
advanced information about market-sensitive speeches by treasury
officials.
	   Ann Taylor, Labor floor manager in the House of Commons,
acknowledged the allegations were serious, but said The Observer
must produce proof.
	   ``The prime minister has made clear that if anybody has breached
these rules, action will be taken,'' said Ms. Taylor.
	   GPC Marketing Access suspended Draper, saying in a statement
that it ``is deeply concerned about several aspects of the Observer
article, and takes very seriously any behavior which brings our
company or our clients into disrepute.''
	   ``The GPC board has met this morning and has suspended Mr.
Draper pending an immediate investigation,'' the statement said.
Draper made no comment.

Pak wins Open in sudden death

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, a 20-year-old rookie from
South Korea, became the youngest U.S. Women's Open champion Monday
when she outlasted amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in the first sudden
death in the history of this tournament.
	   Pak, who had to take off her shoes and hit out of the water on
the 18th hole, birdied the second extra hole with an 18-foot
(5.5-meter) birdie putt.
	   ``I'm really happy,'' Pak said. ``She is a really great player.
I didn't give up, I just kept playing my game.''
	   The twosome was tied at 2-over 73 after an 18-hole playoff at
Blackwolf Run.
	   Pak, who won the LPGA Championship in May, became the first
rookie to win two majors since Juli Inkster captured the Nabisco
Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984. Inkster was 22
when she won two.
	   Pak overcame a four-stroke deficit after five holes of the
18-hole playoff, thanks to a triple-bogey by Chuasiriporn on No. 6.
Pak didn't take the lead until the 14th hole.
	   The last woman to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   Chuasiriporn, entering her senior year at Duke University, was
trying to become only the second amateur to win in 53 editions of
the Women's Open. Catherine LaCoste is the only amateur to win the
biggest event in women's golf, as a 22-year-old in 1967.
	   ``That's how it goes,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``This is a great
experience for me, more than I ever expected going into this.''
	   The last playoff in the Open was in 1992, when Patty Sheehan
defeated fellow American Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont,
Pennsylvania.
	   The playoff came after high drama on No. 18, where both golfers
bogeyed the par-4.
	   Pak's tee shots were true all day until she hooked it toward the
lake on 18, the ball landing in the rough on a steep slope. Her
caddie, Jeff Cable, had to help her so that she didn't slip into
the water as she took a look.
	   Taking off her spikes and socks, Pak stepped into the calf-deep
water, took an A-wedge and pitched the ball into the rough on the
other side of the fairway.
	   ``I didn't know how I was going to get of there,'' Pak said. ``I
just played my game.
	   After offering her wedge to her caddie to help pull her back
ashore, Pak hit a 148-yard (135-meter) shot onto the green, about
15 feet (4.5 meters) from the hole and finally cracked a smile as
she acknowledged the gallery's cheers.
	   Chuasiriporn's chip for a birdie from the rough was way too hard
and ended up 10 feet (3 meters) past the hole.
	   Pak's putt for par was short, leaving Chuasiriporn with a chance
to win it all with a 10-foot (3 meters) putt. But the ball went
past by less than an inch (about 2 centimeters), and her tap-in
sent the twosome back to the 564-yard (515-meter), par-5 10th hole
for sudden death.
	   There, they each parred with tap-in putts.
	   And it was off to the 374-yard (342-meter) par-4 No. 11, where
Chuasiriporn missed a 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt, then watched
Pak sink an 18-footer (5.5-meter shot) for the win on the
tournament's 92nd hole.
	   Pak overcame an early four-stroke deficit.
	   Chuasiriporn, who sank a riveting 40-foot (12-meter) putt on the
final hole Sunday to force a playoff, birdied three of the first
five holes. She took a four-stroke lead before a triple-bogey on
No. 6 prevented a runaway.
	   Pak, whose drives were steady but short game off through the
front nine, didn't lead until her birdie on 14, but she bogeyed the
next hole and the playoff was tied going into the water-lined final
three holes.
	   Chuasiriporn saved par on the par-3 17th after putting her ball
within five feet with a pitching-wedge shot from the rough. Pak's
putt for birdie missed by an inch (2 1.2 centimeters).

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Shopkeepers barred their windows
with steel doors, riot police guarded airports and utilities and
islanders stocked up on water and flashlight batteries Monday as
Puerto Rico braced for its biggest protest in years.
	   Union leaders said they expected up to half a million of the
island's 3.8 million people _ including electricity, water and
airport workers _ to join a 48-hour general strike starting
Tuesday.
	   It was called to protest the privatization of the state
telephone company and show support for the 6,400 telephone workers
who have been on strike since June 18.
	   ``Put your names on the list for picket line or special missions
starting at 3 a.m.,'' strike leaders told employees Monday outside
the the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. headquarters. They refused to say
what the ``special missions'' entailed.
	   Saboteurs have cut and damaged telephone cables, leaving more
than 250,000 people without long-distance service Monday, the
telephone company said.
	   Hundreds of tourists have canceled vacations, hotels reported,
and at least one airline, the Caribbean LIAT, canceled flights.
	   Major shopping malls announced they were closing, including the
190-shop Plaza Las Americas, which employees 5,000 people. The
Plaza said it was being prudent because of a rash of telephone bomb
threats.
	   Last week, a bomb planted at a local bank in a consortium buying
the telephone company exploded in the hands of a policeman, tearing
off a finger.
	   Annie Cruz, president of one of two telephone workers' unions,
said she hoped the strike would persuade the government to hold a
referendum on the sale.
	   Independence-minded union leaders have equated it to ``selling
the patrimony of the people'' at a time when Gov. Pedro Rossello is
campaigning for the U.S. commonwealth to become the 51st state of
the union.
	   Rossello has ignored the strikers. Last Wednesday, he signed a
law completing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale to a consortium led by
U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. It awaits approval by the
Federal Communications Commission.

Mexican stocks slide, peso weakens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Jitters over the Russian ruble and the Asian
crisis combined with profit-taking Monday to push Mexican stocks
lower in slow trading and the peso closed weaker.
	   The market's key IPC index closed down 1.6 percent or 71.87
points to 4411.88 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at
5229.35 points.
	   Volume totaled 658.4 million pesos on 34.2 million shares
traded, compared to Friday's volume of 436.5 million pesos on 23.7
million shares.
	   The peso closed weaker against the U.S. dollar Monday, pressured
in late trading by continued weakness in the Japanese yen.
	   In Mexico City, banking leader Banamex quoted the peso closing
at a midrate of 8.978 per dollar, weaker from its open of 8.967 per
dollar and weaker from its close Friday of 8.936.
	   The yen experienced continued weakness Monday, a day after
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto went back on indications
that the government would implement permanent tax cuts.
	   Also on Monday, a key international investor said it was
abandoning Russia's troubled Tokobank, touching off fears that one
of the country's largest banks could fail.
	   Russia already is suffering from a financial crisis and Monday's
announcement that the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development would sell its 9.6 percent stake in Tokobank raised new
concerns.
	   In peso futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
September contracts ended at 9.3002 pesos to the dollar after
closing Thursday at 9.3218.
	   December deliveries moved to 9.7276 from 9.7585; March 1999
futures moved to 10.1626 from 10.1807; June 1999 futures moved to
10.5820 from 10.5485 and September 1999 contracts moved to 11.0254
from 10.9890.

General Assembly to vote on Palestinian mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly votes Tuesday on an
Arab request to upgrade the status of the Palestinian observer
mission to that of a non-voting member.
	   Resolutions favoring the Palestinians are routinely approved
with huge margins in the General Assembly, where none of the 185
members has a veto, and the resolution was expected to pass.
	   The United States and Israel, which oppose the move, have asked
to address the assembly before the vote. Russia and Austria, on
behalf of the European Union, will speak afterwards.
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives could
raise issues of the peace process in the assembly, co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace and have the right of reply. The
representative could not vote or put forward candidates for U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   But more importantly, a vote in favor of the Palestinians would
affirm international support in the protracted peace process.

Six years later, it's still Bud
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ U.S. baseball's long-term search for a new leader
ended with its old leader. Bud's still the one. The only one.
	   After six years without a commissioner, the sport will finally
elect one Thursday, and the lone candidate is the man who said
early and often that he didn't want the job _ Milwaukee Brewers
owner Bud Selig.
	   ``I really meant that,'' Selig said as he prepared to travel to
Tuesday night's All-Star game. ``I love what I was doing. Many had
said to me they wanted me to stay in some capacity. We argued. The
rest is history.''
	   So Allan Huber Selig won't be acting commissioner for life,
after all.
	   Having watched Bowie Kuhn, Peter Ueberroth and Fay Vincent
enrage owners with controversial actions, and A. Bartlett Giamatti
become bogged down with Pete Rose, Selig decided the best decisions
are often no decisions. He preferred to wait for a consensus to
develop.
	   Baseball, a most conservative sport, has been transformed from
one-man rule to an owner-friendly consensus government during
Selig's reign as chairman of the 10-man executive council. This
group seized power following Vincent's forced resignation on Sept.
7, 1992 and installed Selig two days later.
	   Some of the highlights:
	   _ For the first time since professional major leagues began in
1871, the sport adopted regular-season interleague play, which
began last year.
	   _ After years of contentious debate, large-market teams agreed
to share a higher percentage of their local revenue with the small
markets.
	   Some of the lowlights:
	   _ A catastrophic 230-day strike by players that wiped out the
final 669 games of the 1994 season, led to the first cancellation
of the World Series in 90 years and shortened the '95 season by 252
games.
	   _ A 20 percent drop in attendance from 31,612 per game in 1994
to 25,260 in 1995. The average this year probably will be around
28,750, still 9 percent below its prestrike level.
	   _ An operating loss of more than dlrs 850 million from 1994-96.
	   Given those negatives, why Selig?
	   Because he listens, often spending 12 hours a day talking to
owners on the telephone.
	   And because there are no surprises with him. By the time he
takes action, every owner knows what he's going to do and an
overwhelming majority backs him. If there's more than token
opposition, he waits.
	   Selig, who turns 68 later this month, received most of his
business training in his family's auto leasing service. A minority
owner of the Milwaukee Braves, he led a group that bought the
Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court just before the 1970 season and
moved them to Milwaukee, where they became the Brewers.
	   Just 35, he was the youngest owner in baseball.
	   ``I think that Bud has done an incredibly good job navigating
baseball through tough times,'' said Ueberroth, who has tended to
praise Selig while condemning the owners as a whole.

Mets recall Hundley
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Todd Hundley is on his way back to the New York
Mets, set to report to the team on Saturday.
	   Hundley, who underwent reconstructive surgery on his right elbow
Sept. 26, returns to the team as an outfielder after New York
acquired All-Star catcher Mike Piazza from the Los Angeles Dodgers
in a May 22 trade.
	   ``I'm more comfortable every day,'' said Hundley, who was the
Mets regular catcher and set a record for the position with 41 home
runs in 1996. ``The more I play, the more comfortable I'm getting
out there. The last couple of days, I've been comfortable and
confident out there.''
	   At first, Hundley resisted changing positions following the
acquisition of Piazza. But he said he has made the adjustment,
playing both left and right field for the Port St. Lucie Mets and
that playing the outfield had helped speed his return to the Mets.
	   ``Long-arming it has helped the elbow a great deal,'' he said
Monday. ``There's not as much stress. The shoulder takes most of
the torque. It should be strong enough to handle that. If I was
coming back as a straight catcher, I'd be three or four weeks
away.''
	   In 11 games with the Port St. Lucie Mets, Hundley batted .243
with two doubles, a home run and six runs batted in. He also drew
12 walks.
	   Hundley said the rehabilitation has been a difficult one.
	   The Mets should have no trouble finding a place in the lineup
for Hundley. Left fielder Bernard Gilkey (.229) and right fielder
Butch Huskey (.247) both have struggled offensively and the team is
14th in the NL in runs scored.
	   ``I'm not going to be able to be the savior,'' he said. ``It
takes 25 to win. I'll hit as hard as I can and try to get the
offense going.''

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Prosecutors are considering whether to
file charges against a Roman Catholic priest arrested in connection
with the kidnapping of a 7-year-old boy who suffocated when he was
gagged to stifle his cries.
	   The Rev. David Chavez Valencia was among five people arrested in
connection with the kidnapping and killing of Edwin Vazquez Reyes.
	   One suspect, Sofia Garcia Diaz, told reporters Sunday that she
and her boyfriend were responsible for the kidnapping and the other
suspects were innocent.
	   Authorities say Garcia Diaz lured the boy from school Thursday
in the Pacific Coast city of Acapulco. She left behind a note in
his knapsack demanding a ransom of 120,000 pesos (dlrs 13,500). The
family was instructed to leave the money Saturday under a bench
near the Nino Jesus church, where Chavez Valencia is rector.
	   The kidnappers tied the child's hands and feet and, to stop his
crying, stuffed a bandana in his mouth. The boy suffocated and the
kidnappers left the body in a vat of water.
	   Garcia Diaz and the church secretary, Karina Ortiz Pedroza, were
arrested Saturday when they tried to collect the ransom. Garcia
Diaz led police to her boyfriend, Pedro Gomez Meugniot, a former
policeman. Police also arrested the priest and Gomez Meugniot's
father, Roberto Gomez Vidales.
	   Garcia Diaz told reporters that Ortiz Pedroza thought they were
picking up some secret documents, not a ransom, and that she and
her boyfriend were the only people involved in the plot.
	   On Monday, about 1,500 people, led by the child's parents,
marched with the coffin and the child's body in front of Garcia
Diaz's home, calling for ``death to the killer.''
	   They later marched to the prosecutors' office to demand that the
suspects be punished.
	   About 30 Catholics were also protesting there, demanding Chavez
Valencia's release.
	   Angel Martinez, the church vicar, told Televisa television that
the crime is ``abominable'' but ``our position right now is we
presume that the priest is innocent.''

President says he'll maintain state of emergency, opposes Berber

	   ALGIERS, Algeria _ President Liamine Zeroual told an opposition
group Monday he will not lift his country's 6-year-old state of
emergency, and said he will oppose ``by any means'' an armed
movement of ethnic Berbers.
	   Zeroual's comments came in a statement after his meeting with
the Front of Socialist Forces, a secular opposition group.
	   The group has expressed its opposition to a new law, which went
into effect Sunday, banning any language but Arabic from official
use _ including French, widely used in this former French colony in
North Africa.
	   Berbers, who make up a third of the Algerian population, are
angry about the law, considered by many as an attempt by the
military-backed government to win the support of Islamic movements.
The law went into effect as Algeria marked its 36th year of
independence.
	   The Berbers have demonstrated against the law in their ethnic
capital, Tizi-Ouzou, already shaken by unrest since Muslim
militants assassinated popular Berber singer Lounes Matoub last
month. The pro-government ``Authentic'' newspaper has estimated
damage from the rioting at dlrs 100 million.
	   In Monday's official statement, read on the public TV station
ENTV, Zeroual refused a demand by the opposition delegation to
freeze the Arabic-only law and promote the Berber language _ saying
that the promotion of Arabic didn't mean the exclusion of other
languages.
	   He also said he would oppose the Armed Berber Movement _ a
heretofore unknown group _ by any means necessary.
	   As for the state of emergency, in effect since the army-backed
government canceled 1992 parliamentary elections that an Islamic
party was poised to win, Zeroual declined to lift it despite
complaints by the delegation that it stifles political activity and
civil liberties.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
since 1992 that has left an estimated 75,000 people dead.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Uwe Krupp, the German who scored the overtime
goal that gave the Colorado Avalanche the 1996 Stanley Cup, signed
a four-year contract Monday with the Detroit Red Wings, the current
champions.
	   ``Certainly we know playing against Uwe the last few years with
our friendly rivalry down the road, Colorado, what an important
player he's been to their success the last few years,'' Detroit
general manager Ken Holland said.
	   Krupp, a 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) defenseman, was equally pleased
to have the chance to play for the Red Wings.
	   ``It's interesting to play against Detroit from the other side.
Now, I'm thrilled to be here,'' he said after putting on his new
No. 4 red jersey.
	   Negotiations with Krupp, an unrestricted free-agent defenseman
who was chosen by Nashville in June's expansion draft, were quick
and quiet. Terms of the contract were not released. Holland said
only that Krupp went for the going rate for players of his caliber.
	   ``The important thing is we really feel we've solidified our
defense position,'' Holland said.
	   Krupp, who made dlrs 1.5 million last season, received an offer
to stay with the Avalanche late in the season, but his agent,
Roland Thompson, said it wasn't as much as he was likely to receive
on the open market.
	   Krupp said playing for the Wings was a top choice after he
became a free agent last month.
	   ``It's very hard to pass up,'' he said. ``It's the best team in
the league ... It's tough to say `no' I'd rather go to another
team. A Stanley Cup contender and Stanley Cup champion, it's
certainly a great honor as a player at least to show interest in
you. It was a big factor,'' Krupp said.
	   The 12-year NHL veteran spent the last three seasons with the
Avalanche, and the one before that in Quebec, before the franchise
moved to Colorado.
	   Krupp, 33, led the Avalanche in plus/minus this past season with
a plus-21, which tied him for 14th in the league. He had nine goals
and 22 assists in 78 games.
	   He became an All-Star in 1991 with Buffalo, a season in which he
had career highs of 12 goals and 32 assists. Krupp has played in
695 regular-season games, also with the New York Islanders after
Buffalo.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Three days after the Danes were
ousted by Brazil in the World Cup quarterfinal, Denmark's top
player Brian Laudrup said Monday he would stop playing on the
national team but would continue his professional soccer career.
	   ``I wanted to stop after the peak of my career,'' Laudrup said
in a television interview.
	   The World Cup quarterfinals ``was the greatest experience a
(Danish) player has had so far,'' said Laudrup who added he was
proud of playing against Brazil last Friday.
	   The quadruple South American world champions won a tight game
3-2.
	   It was the second time Denmark qualified for the World Cup. In
1986, the Danes exited the tournament after the first round.
	   The striker, who signed a contract to play for Chelsea as of
next season, said ``it now is time to concentrate on my last three
years playing for clubs and on my family.''
	   Laudrup is leaving the turf at the same time as his older
brother, Michael, who ended his brilliant 17-year career after the
tournament in France.
	   ``I'm satiated with soccer and I happily leave the place to
younger players,'' Briann Laudrup said, stressing his decision was
not linked to his brother's departure or any problems on the team.
	   Laudrup, 29, was on the Danish team that in 1992 stunned the
soccer world by defeating Germany 2-0 in the final of the European
Championship in Sweden.
	   ``I've experienced it all. I cannot achieve more,'' he said in
an exclusive interview with the DR-1 television channel. Monday
evening. ``I'm stopping after one of the biggest matches which a
Danish team has ever played.''
	   Laudrup, who informed Denmark's coach Bo Johansson of his
decision after the Brazil game, joined the Danish side in 1987 and
scored 21 goals in 82 matches.
	   Johansson said was ``very saddened'' by Brian Laudrup's
decision.
	   ``Most of the games we have won with Brian. He is incredibly
important for Denmark,'' Johansson said. ``There will always be a
room for him if he wants to come back.''
	   Jim Stjerne Hansen, the Danish soccer association's secretary
general, hoped that ``Brian would think it over.''
	   ``There are none who can play like Brian and Michael,''
Johansson said after the playmaker brothers departure.
	   Brian Laudrup began his professional career with Danish club
Broendby and moved on to Germany where he played for Bayer 05
Uerdingen and FC Bayern Munchen. He later played for Italian
powerhouses Fiorentina and Milan before joining the former Scottish
champions of Glasgow Rangers
	   Another top player, midfielder Michael Schjoenberg, also
announced after the Brazil game that he would stop playing on the
Danish national side but would continue his professional career.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Seeking to contain Protestant
fury, a government-appointed commission ruled Monday that Belfast's
most disputed Orange Order march should be permitted to pass a
hostile Catholic neighborhood next week.
	   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission admitted its verdict
took into account widespread Protestant anger over the ongoing
blockade of a bigger march in Portadown, the Orange Order's rural
heartland.
	   ``This isn't justice. This is obviously just giving in to Orange
pressure and trying to buy off the mob in Portadown,'' said the
Lower Ormeau protest leader, former IRA prisoner Gerard Rice, who
pledged to challenge the decision in a Belfast court.
	   The July 13 march by several hundred Orangemen would be the
first Protestant parade allowed past Lower Ormeau's eight hard-line
Catholic side streets in more than a year. Rice refused to say
whether protesters would try to block Ormeau Road, as they have
done since 1995, in defiance of the commission's ruling.
	   Despite the Belfast decision, Protestants determined to overturn
the ban on the march in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of
Belfast, protested or rioted for a second straight night across
Northern Ireland.
	   The hijacking and burning of cars as road barricades began in
the afternoon in Craigavon, Portadown's neighbor, where thugs
hijacked and torched a bus and two cars.
	   Soon Orangemen and other Protestants formed human blockades on
several main Belfast roads and Shaftesbury Square, where youths
nearby began bombarding riot police with stones and bricks. As
darkness fell, billowing clouds of smoke could be seen several
points on the skyline were cars were burning.
	   In religiously polarized west Belfast, rival mobs of Protestants
and Catholics threw rocks, bricks and bottles at each other over
the high fencing that separates their two neighborhoods.
	   In north Belfast, about 30 Protestant youths hurled gasoline
bombs at a police station and a makeshift grenade at passing
armored car.

Odd Couple start All-Star game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Professor vs. The Paunch
	   That's the matchup of starting pitchers for the 69th All-Star
game at Coors Field on Tuesday night, when studious-looking Greg
Maddux faces David Wells, who might count pitches but not calories.
	   They are the game's odd couple: Maddux plays Felix Unger to
Wells' Oscar Madison.
	   Maddux, a slight, unassuming man, wears glasses off the mound
and works quickly on it, nibbling at the corners, a master of
location and deception.
	   The only pitcher in major league history to win four consecutive
Cy Young Awards (1992-95), Maddux, 32, is appearing in his seventh
All-Star game. At the break, the Atlanta ace is one of only three
pitchers in the majors with 12 wins at 12-2 with a 1.54 ERA with
four shutouts.
	   The portly and eccentric Wells, listed at 225 pounds (102 kilos)
but weighing closer to 245 (111), has the rumpled look of a common
man who loves to share beers with fans at the local tavern _ and
probably has. He favors heavy-metal music and has tattoos of his
late mother and son on his chest and shoulder, respectively.
	   While hardly a perfect physical specimen, he threw only the 13th
perfect game in modern baseball history, beating Minnesota on May
17 in Yankee Stadium. The 35-year-old left-hander has an 11-2
record and 3.75 ERA for New York at the break.
	   Any game at Coors Field figures to be high-scoring, but at least
one of the participants isn't so sure.
	   ``With these two starting pitchers, I don't know if it's going
to be a high-scoring game,'' Ken Griffey Jr. said. ``Maybe a quick
game.''
	   Maddux, who has made no secret of his dislike for Coors Field,
to the point of telling several Rockies pitchers he would never
sign with Colorado because of the ballpark, took a less harsh line

	   Asked if he was looking forward to pitching there, he said,
``Yes, I am. These games are great to play in. It's almost like
spring training. There is no pressure to win or anything like that.
You just go out and play the game and have fun.
	   ``Obviously, your slider doesn't slide as much and your curve
doesn't curve as much, but you can still pitch here. The biggest
difference is the outfielders have to play a little deeper, and
you're concerned about the extra-base hit. You just have to pitch
smart.''

Australia beats Canada 87-81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Australian veteran Andrew Gaze led his
country to an 87-81 victory over Canada in their basketball world
championship warm-up match Monday night.
	   Gaze scored 26 points in the first match of a four-game series
between two teams who will compete at the world titles in Athens
later this month.
	   Little separated the teams for most of the match. Australia held
a 41-38 advantage at halftime and were unable to dominate.
	   The experience of Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal and Scott Fisher, plus
the aggression of newcomers led by Paul Rogers, Frank Drmic and Sam
Mackinnon, gave Australia the edge.
	   Canada's scoring was led by guard Joey Vickery with 15 points,
including three three-pointers, while forwards Michael Meeks and
Rohan Barrett scored 13 apiece.
	   Canadian center Todd MacCulloch gathered a game-high seven
rebounds to go with his eight points.
	   Australian coach Barry Barnes was pleased with the match despite
his team's struggle.
	   ``Canada pushed us all the way and we lacked a bit of cohesion
but had enough good players to get us through,'' Barnes said.
	   Canada got the early jump on the Boomers and established a 12-4
lead with MacCulloch posing problems.
	   But the introduction of Rogers for Dallas Maverick Chris Anstey
paid immediate dividends with Rogers adding aggression at both ends
of the court.

Defending champ advances in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Defending champion Sargis Sargsian
dropped the first set, but rallied to beat Daniel Nestor in three
sets Monday in the first round of the Miller Lite Hall of Fame
Tennis Championships.
	   The fourth-seeded Sargsian, who became the first Armenian to win
an ATP title when he won this tournament, is hoping the 6-7 (7-5),
6-1, 6-4 victory over Nestor is a good omen. Sargsian defeated the
big-serving Canadian in the opening round last year.
	   ``I'm not very superstitious, but it's good to start like
this,'' said Sargsian, noting Nestor was a tough draw. ``He's a
good player on grass.''
	   Sargsian took control in the second set, but had to survive a
couple of break points in the third game of the third set.
	   ``I hit two second serves,'' Sargsian said. ``That was huge.''
	   He broke Nestor in the seventh game, and held serve from there.
	   With the focus on him as the defending champion, Sargsian said
he's not used to all the attention.
	   ``It's the first time in my life I'm playing a tournament as a
defending champion,'' he said. ``I'm trying not to think about it.
It already feels weird.''
	   In other first-round matches Monday, No. 8 Grant Stafford of
South Africa, a semifinalist last year, beat Steven Randjelovic of
Australia, 6-2, 6-0; No. 6 Scott Draper of the United States
defeated Oscar Burrieza of Spain, 6-3, 7-5; Lleyton Hewitt, a
17-year-old from Australia, beat Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland, 6-1,
7-6 (7-5); Rainier Schuttler of Germany, defeated American Tommy Ho
6-2, 6-3; American David Wheaton, the 1994 champion here, beat Lars
Burgsmuller of Germany, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2; and Lawrence Tieleman of
Belgium, eliminated Kevin Ullyet of South Africa, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Hewitt, who won an ATP tournament earlier this year by beating,
among others, American Andre Agassi and this tournament's top seed,
Jason Stoltenberg, also of the United States, set up a possible
second-round rematch with Stoltenberg with the opening-round win.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Seeking to contain Protestant
fury, a government-appointed commission ruled Monday that Belfast's
most disputed Orange Order march should be permitted to pass a
hostile Catholic neighborhood next week.
	   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission admitted its verdict
took into account widespread Protestant anger over the ongoing
blockade of a bigger march in Portadown, the Orange Order's rural
heartland.
	   ``This isn't justice. This is obviously just giving in to Orange
pressure and trying to buy off the mob in Portadown,'' said the
Lower Ormeau protest leader, former IRA prisoner Gerard Rice, who
pledged to challenge the decision in a Belfast court.
	   The July 13 march by several hundred Orangemen would be the
first Protestant parade allowed past Lower Ormeau's eight hard-line
Catholic side streets in more than a year. Rice refused to say
whether protesters would try to block Ormeau Road, as they have
done since 1995, in defiance of the commission's ruling.
	   Despite the Belfast decision, Protestants determined to overturn
the ban on the march in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of
Belfast, protested or rioted for a second straight night across
Northern Ireland.
	   The hijacking and burning of cars as road barricades began in
the afternoon in Craigavon, Portadown's neighbor, where thugs
hijacked and torched a bus and two cars.
	   Soon Orangemen and other Protestants formed human blockades on
several main Belfast roads and Shaftesbury Square, where youths
nearby began bombarding riot police with stones and bricks. As
darkness fell, billowing clouds of smoke could be seen several
points on the skyline were cars were burning.
	   In religiously polarized west Belfast, rival mobs of Protestants
and Catholics threw rocks, bricks and bottles at each other over
the high fencing that separates their two neighborhoods.
	   In north Belfast, about 30 Protestant youths hurled gasoline
bombs at a police station and a makeshift grenade at passing
armored car.
	   In the most serious violence since the standoff began, police
came under gun attack in Belfast, but no one was injured in the
shooting on Broadway Parade, police said.

Sleaze controversy hits Blair's government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs report that Blair would fire aide if charges are proven;
pickup graf 11 pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Labor Party official who boasted he could
arrange access to government officials and documents was suspended
by a Canadian-based lobbying company Monday, and he was fired from
his job as a newspaper columnist.
	   The controversy embroiled Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party government in charges of sleaziness_ an issue which helped
topple the Conservative government in national elections 14 months
ago.
	   The Express newspaper dismissed Derek Draper because he
reportedly said his columns were reviewed by a government minister
before publication.
	   The Observer newspaper, which had reporters pose as
representatives of U.S. energy companies, reported Sunday that
Draper was among three former aides to government ministers who are
now selling their contacts.
	   Draper works for GPC Marketing Access, part of GPC Canada of
Toronto.
	   The newspaper also said that a former lobbyist, Roger Liddle,
now a member of Blair's Policy Unit, told the undercover reporters:
``Just tell me what you want, who you want to meet and Derek
(Draper) and I will make the call for you.''
	   Liddle said he was just being friendly and never offered to fix
up meetings on behalf of GPC.
	   The Observer said the lobbyists claimed to be able to get
privileged access to government ministers and policies, including
advanced information about market-sensitive speeches by treasury
officials.
	   Ann Taylor, Labor floor manager in the House of Commons,
acknowledged the allegations were serious, but said The Observer
must produce proof.
	   ``The prime minister has made clear that if anybody has breached
these rules, action will be taken,'' said Ms. Taylor.
	   The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Blair's office said
Liddle would be fired if it were proven that he said he would
deliver access to the government.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants attacked police,
hijacked cars and barricaded roads in many parts of Northern
Ireland after British authorities blocked the province's most
controversial Orange Order march. Several hundred Protestants were
camped Monday outside Drumcree Anglican church on the outskirts of
Portadown, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Belfast, where
barbed-wire barricades blocked the Protestant fraternal group's
annual parade Sunday before it reached the nearby Roman Catholic
section, Garvaghy Road. The Orange Order did win a round Monday
with the Parades Commission, which had blocked the Portadown march.
The commission gave the Orange Order permission to march July 13
through a Catholic neighborhood in the Lower Ormeau section of
Belfast. That parade had been blocked last year, and the Orangemen
had accepted the ruling peacefully. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After U.S. and Russian envoys failed
to rally Albanian factions behind a single leader, a senior U.S.
official blamed the Yugoslav government Monday for driving ethnic
Albanians into the extremist camp. The growing influence of the
Kosovo Liberation Army among ethnic Albanians has hindered
negotiations for peace in the rebellious Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. In the
Bosnian town of Banja Luka, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard sharply
criticized the Yugoslav government, saying they ``mishandled'' the
Kosovo problem. Gelbard said the police actions in early March _
when 80 ethnic Albanians died in Kosovo _ ``probably did more to
send people over to support the KLA than any efforts they have ever
put together.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A U.S. State Department official should be
sure to meet with dissidents during his visit to Nigeria and not
``closet'' himself in the capital as the U.N. secretary-general
did, the country's main opposition organization said.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, a former ambassador to
Nigeria, was expected to meet Tuesday with Nigeria's military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power last month after
the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Encouraged by the
military's commitment to free all political prisoners, the State
Department said last week that Pickering will appeal to Abubakar to
go a step further and arrange for a transition to elected civilian
rule. Pickering and his delegation also were to hold a small
meeting with civilians, including opposition figures, the U.S.
Embassy said. (NIGERIA)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Shopkeepers barred their windows
with steel doors, riot police guarded airports and utilities and
islanders stocked up on water and flashlight batteries as Puerto
Rico braced for its biggest protest in years. Union leaders said
they expected up to half a million of the island's 3.8 million
people _ including electricity, water and airport workers _ to join
a 48-hour general strike starting Tuesday. It was called to protest
the privatization of the state telephone company and show support
for the 6,400 telephone workers who have been on strike since June
18. Saboteurs have cut and damaged telephone cables, leaving more
than 250,000 people without long-distance service Monday, the
telephone company said. Hundreds of tourists have canceled
vacations, hotels reported, and at least one airline, the Caribbean
LIAT, canceled flights. (PUERTO RICO-STRIKE)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In stinging personal attacks, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition legislators accused each other of
deceiving the Israeli people and foreign leaders about Mideast
peacemaking. A special Knesset debate Monday turned into a shouting
match as Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak traded insults
over who was more politically out of touch and dependent on
U.S.-based political advisors or image makers for direction. Barak
said Netanyahu hurt Israel's credibility and could no longer get
world leaders on the phone. Also Monday, in the West Bank city of
Hebron, Palestinians threw firebombs toward Israeli soldiers who
scuffled earlier with Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the tense
town. The settlers accused Palestinians of a firebomb attack on
their compound, and the Palestinians blamed the settlers for a fire
at a Palestinian-owned shop. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply Monday, with the Standard
and Poors 500 cruising to another record and the Dow industrials
pushing to the highest level since late May. On Wall Street, the
Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.51 points _ or 0.7 percent _
to 9,091.77, just 120 points below May 13's record close of
9,211.84 and the blue-chip barometer's highest finish since May 22.
Broader stock indexes also posted sizable gains despite some
worrisome signs from Japan, where Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
backed away from recent hints of a sweeping tax cut to help spur
his nation out of recession. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU finance chiefs were upbeat Monday
that the Asian financial crisis won't stifle Europe's economic
recovery. ``Despite the uncertainties of the world economy, the
prospects for Europe are good,'' European Commission President
Jacques Santer told a meeting of EU finance ministers. EU Finance
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy estimated the turmoil in Asia
would slice a ``modest'' 0.4 percent off growth over this year and
next in the 11 EU nations that are set to adopt the euro as their
common currency on Jan. 1. French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said ministers agreed the 11 euro-bloc nations would
enjoy average economic growth of around 3 percent this year.
Although he added nobody could say for sure what the impact of the
Asian crisis would be. (EU-ECONOMY-ASIA)
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state-controlled Norsk Hydro ASA
concern Monday announced that talks were underway on merging its
petrochemicals division with EVC International of the Netherlands.
Norsk Hydro said the two companies had signed a non-binding letter
of intent to pursue a merger to create a major player in the world
vinyl industry. Egil Myklebost, president of Norsk Hydro, said the
merger would create ``a strong entity with a good platform for
future growth.'' EVC would have a 55 percent interest in the new
company and Norsk Hydro the rest. Oslo-based Norsk Hydro, which is
51 percent state-owned, has divisions for petroleum, light metals,
fertilizers and petrochemicals. It employs 38,000 people worldwide.
About 3,000 people work in the petrochemicals division, which
reported a 1997 operating revenue of dlrs 815 million.
(NORWAY-NORSK HYDRO-EVC)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The presidents of Russia and Kazakstan sealed an
agreement Monday that could open the way for the five nations on
the Caspian Sea to finally determine who controls the seabed's rich
oil fields. The accord signed by President Boris Yeltsin and
Nursultan Nazarbayev in a Kremlin ceremony divides the northern
part of the Caspian seabed into separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
It also allows for a sharing of the Caspian's waters, which means
both nations will have equal access to the sea's fishing grounds.
The five Caspian nations have been divided for years over the
question of who owns the oil in the seabed. (RUSSIA-KAZAKSTAN)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A troubled Russian bank has been abandoned by a
key international investor, touching off fears Monday that one of
the country's largest banks could fail. Russia is already suffering
from a financial crisis and Monday's developments raised new
concerns about the stability of the banking sector. The ailing
Russian bank, Tokobank, was the country's 12th largest bank at the
beginning of the year. But it has been struggling recently and
Russia's Central Bank took control of the institution last month.
There was more bad news Monday when the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, which has sought to assist
struggling economies in Eastern Europe, said it had exercised its
option to sell its 9.6 percent stake in Tokobank. The sell-off was
certain to heighten fears of collapse in the wobbly banking sector.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in
Monday for what threatens to be a long, hard battle over how to
share the costs of expanding the EU into eastern Europe. Austria
launched it's six-month presidency of the EU, aiming for progress
on deciding who should finance the expected entry into the EU of
five former communist nations, plus Cyprus, around the middle of
next decade. But positions appeared rigid. Richer members led by
Germany, insisted their contributions to EU coffers should be cut.
Poorer nations stressed EU aid money that now boosts their
economies, should not be diverted to the new eastern members.
``This is not going to be easy,'' acknowledged Swedish Finance
Minister Erik Asbrink. (EU-FINANCE)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Madonna will make her London theater debut next
summer in a revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,'' producer Bill Kenwright said Monday.
	   Although contracts have yet to be signed, Sir Peter Hall's
production, with Madonna as the sexually voracious Maggie the Cat,
is expected to begin rehearsals after Madonna completes her role in
the film version of the musical ``Chicago.''
	   The Williams play will mark Madonna's first stage appearance
since David Mamet's ``Speed the Plow'' on Broadway a decade ago.
	   Madonna is expected to commit herself to the role for 20 weeks.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Dennis Rodman might want to stick with his regular
line of work.
	   The Chicago Bulls star decided to jam with Pearl Jam during a
concert Sunday night. Guzzling wine from a bottle, a shirtless,
shoeless Rodman leaped on stage and tried to sing along during
``Alive'' and ``Spin the Black Circle.''
	   After the stage crew finally cut off Rodman's microphone, lead
singer Eddie Vedder said to Rodman: ``I'm guessing you've been
drinking for about three days straight.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SPOLETO, Italy (AP) _ After Beijing relented, Chinese film
director Zhang Yuan has made it to the summer arts festival here
hosting his play which was forbidden in China.
	   ``I don't even know why (I got my passport back),'' Zhang was
quoted as saying in Monday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily.
	   Zhang missed the opening here last week of his ``East Palace,
West Palace,'' which deals with homosexual life in Beijing, after
he was initially barred from leaving China to travel to the
``Festival of the Two Worlds'' in this medieval Umbrian town.
	   The title of the play refers to restrooms that are meeting sites
for gays.
	   When Zhang directed a movie by the same title which was
presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, he was not allowed
to leave China.
	   The festival, founded by composer Giancarlo Menotti, runs
through Sunday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and his wife Zohra
said Monday they have separated after nine years of marriage.
	   In a brief joint statement, the brother of composer Andrew
Lloyd-Webber and his second wife said they have been living apart
``for some months.''
	   ``The separation is amicable and no other parties are
involved,'' the statement said. The Lloyd Webbers have a 6-year-old
son, David.
	   In an interview two months ago, Lloyd Webber, 47, said his work
on unrecorded compositions by his father William had put strain on
his marriage.
	   ``Zohra has found my working so obsessively on my father's music
very difficult,'' he said.
	   A leading soloist who plays all over the world, his has long
been known for his dedication to his art. He once said his
relationship with his valuable Stradivarius cello was ``like a
marriage.''
	   Mrs. Lloyd Webber, 35, is an Afghan princess who came to Britain
at the age of 12 after her family fled the communist takeover in
her country.
	   She married Lloyd Webber in 1989, months after his divorce from
his first wife Celia was finalized.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Paula Abdul sold her Beverly Hills-area home
to Tom Arnold and his wife.
	   Abdul's five-bedroom, 6,800-square-foot (630 sq. meters)
Spanish-style villa had been on the market since fall 1996, when
she married clothing manufacturer Brad Beckerman. Abdul, a former
Los Angeles Lakers cheerleader who became a star with her ``Forever
Your Girl'' album in 1988, filed for divorce earlier this year.
	   The Arnolds paid close to the dlrs 2.4 million asking price for
the home in a gated community, the Los Angeles Times said Sunday.
	   Abdul has signed a recording deal with Mercury Records.

Two Japanese satellites successfully linkup after rendezvous
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese satellites successfully docked Tuesday
in the first such maneuver ever accomplished via remote control,
Japan's space agency said.
	   The unmanned satellites _ Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi''
(Altair) _ were separated and rejoined by remote control from Earth
after a 15-minute rendezvous, said Yasuyuki Fukumuro, a spokesman
at the National Space Development Agency.
	   Fukumuro said it was the first time that two satellites effected
a successful linkup after first carrying out a rendezvous on their
own.
	   The experiment was conducted at an altitude of 550 kilometers
(341 miles) above the Earth, Fukumoro said.
	   The satellites were launched last November from a space center
in southern Japan to carry out a series of experiments, including
the use of a robot arm attached to the satellites.
	   The success comes after Japan on Saturday launched its first
interplanetary spacecraft on a mission to search for signs of water
under the surface of Mars. The mission could turn up clues about
whether life might once have existed on the Red Planet.

All-Star games serves up attitude with altitude
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ What's going to stop Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey
Jr., Juan Gonzalez and the real sluggers from knocking a ball out
of the field and into Wyoming when they bring a longball attitude
to the All-Star altitude?
	   ``I think I have a vision of a high-scoring game,'' AL starter
David Wells of the New York Yankees said Monday, ``but hopefully
not when I'm in there.''
	   Just in case, he's got a strategy for pitching in Denver _
``Duck!''
	   Clearly, home runs are in the forecast for Tuesday night's game.
	   In the year that Roger Maris' record of 61 is in danger, fans
are no doubt hoping to see a repeat of the 1971 game when future
Hall of Famers Reggie Jackson, Hank Aaron, Johnny Bench, Roberto
Clemente, Frank Robinson and Harmon Killebrew all connected at
Tiger Stadium.
	   ``It's a great hitter's ballpark,'' said McGwire, leading the
big leagues with 37 homers.
	   Even though more home runs were hit at Coors Field than any
other park in 1996 and 1997, there are plenty of other ways to
score.
	   ``You have to realize that Coors Field has a gigantic outfield
where balls will fall in,'' McGwire said. ``Normal singles in most
ballparks will be doubles if you have speed.''
	   No wonder Omar Vizquel, the only non-pitcher on the AL squad
without a homer, volunteered to take Griffey's place in Monday's
home-run derby.
	   ``I hear anyone can hit one here,'' the Cleveland shortstop
said.
	   Griffey, the top vote-getter in fan balloting for All-Star
starters, was booed at the park for backing out of the contest.
McGwire was cheered loudly.
	   Pitching at the stadium, meanwhile, presents all sorts of
problems.
	   ``Slider don't slide as much, curve don't curve as much,'' NL
starter Greg Maddux of Atlanta said.
	   Maddux, a four-time Cy Young winner, knows from first-hand
experience. In three starts at Coors, he's allowed 14 earned runs
in 18 1-3 innings.
	   ``I think probably one of the biggest things is the outfielders
have to play a little bit deeper and you always give up the extra
base on a base hit,'' he said. ``Instead of runners at first and
second, it's always first and third.''
	   Which is fine with NL batting champion Tony Gwynn.
	   ``I think most people expect to see some home runs, some
hitting, some high-powered offense,'' the San Diego outfielder
said. ``But there might not be. This game is really based on
pitching. If the pitchers are throwing the ball good, it could be
2-1, 3-2.
	   ``If they're getting the ball up, that's going to be the key. If
they get the ball up in this ballpark, you don't have to hit it
good to get it out. You don't have to hit it good to get a base
hit,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people will be watching this.''
	   The NL leads the series 40-27-1, and the highest-scoring game
came in 1954 when the AL won 11-9. There have been at least two
homers in each of the last seven games.
	   Remember, though, what happened the last time all the attention
was on offense at the All-Star game. It was 1987, the year of the
lively ball and home runs by the bunch.
	   That season, with Mike Schmidt and Andre Dawson and a rookie
named McGwire playing, the game was scoreless until the 13th
inning.
	   Then again, watching McGwire and his buddies swing Monday _ in a
light rain, no less _ it looks like it might be a busy night for
the scoreboard operator.
	   And a fun night for those who get to watch. Like Chicago Cubs
outfielder Sammy Sosa, who has 33 home runs but is sidelined by a
bad shoulder.
	   ``The way that Griffey swings, that's something that's
natural,'' Sosa said. ``Almost the same with Mark.''
	   ``Myself, I'm crazy. I'm swinging the bat all the way,'' he
said. ``If I'm not swinging the bat hard, I think I've been
cheating myself.''

Brazil and Netherlands show it pays to attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Ask a soccer fan to name the players
for Brazil and the Netherlands, and it's a good bet Ronaldo and
Dennis Bergkamp will head the list.
	   Not surprisingly, the marquee players for both sides are
strikers. Offense is the strong suit of the Brazilians and the
Dutch, strong enough to carry them to the World Cup semifinals on
Tuesday despite their shaky defense.
	   For Brazilian midfielder Cesar Sampaio, the Cup has proved that
taking risks pays off. And the success of the attack-minded teams
may be a blessing for the sport.
	   ``The Cup shows that technical skill has prevailed,'' he said.
``The four that remain in the competition are teams that bet on
offensive soccer, and that's great.''
	   Croatia is a prime example. Playing in its first Cup ever, the
Croats were uncowed by powerful Germany and trounced the three-time
Cup champions 3-0 to reach the semifinals.
	   France, despite a recent scoring drought, was unquestionably the
more attacking side in its battles with defensive fortresses
Paraguay and Italy.
	   The Dutch have a history of free-flowing, offensive soccer. Its
greatest expression was the great ``Clockwork Orange'' team of the
1970s, led by Johan Cruyff.
	   In this Cup, the Netherlands have scored 11 goals, second only
to Brazil's 13. And if five of those came against South Korea, the
Dutch arguably faced a tougher field than Brazil did, with
opponents that included Mexico, Belgium, Yugoslavia and Argentina.
	   Brazil, of course, is a synonym for offensive soccer. In the
Golden Age of Pele and Garrincha, Brazilian teams would readily
give up three goals to score four or five. Defense was something
for those not good enough to play up front.
	   That's why Brazilians weren't completely satisfied with the team
that won the 1994 Cup. It was a disciplined defensive machine that
shut down opponents, with just Bebeto and Romario doing all the
work up front. It was good enough to win the Cup but fell short of
Brazilians' high standards.
	   Today's team is very different, loaded with offensive talent.
Even Sampaio has gotten free rein to attack. Normally a defensive
specialist, he has scored three goals and shares team scoring
honors with Ronaldo, Bebeto and Rivaldo.
	   The risk is exposing your own goal. Brazil also has the Cup's
worst defense, with six goals allowed.
	   In a quarterfinal shootout with Denmark, Brazil survived _
barely. The team gave up two goals and took a shot on the crossbar
before prevailing 3-2.
	   ``We are an offensive team. That is what we do best,'' said team
captain Dunga. ``Sometimes we try to hold back, and it's just
impossible.''
	   That describes the Dutch pretty well, too.

World Cup: Croatia's talented generation seizes its chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ A talented generation of Croatian players
has matured right on time for this year's World Cup.
	   Longtime bonds between the players _ some reaching back into
childhood _ and a master motivator as coach are some of the secrets
behind the unheralded team's advance to Wednesday's semifinal with
France.
	   Four of Croatia's regulars have been a tight group since winning
the world junior championship with Yugoslavia in 1987. They include
team captain Zvonimir Boban of AC Milan and star striker Davor
Suker of Real Madrid, who has scored four of Croatia's eight goals
at the World Cup.
	   The team surged onto the international stage at the 1996
European Championship, but it lost to Germany in the quarterfinal
after defender Igor Stimac lost his nerves and was sent off.
	   ``We were young lions then,'' Boban said. ``We wanted to do too
much. Now we have more experience. We have matured.''
	   Teams from former Yugoslavia had a reputation for being a bunch
of highly talented individual with a discipline deficit, but Boban
says Croatia disproved that in its 3-0 triumph over Germany in the
quarterfinals Saturday.
	   ``This is very important for us, actually playing the full 90
minutes,'' he said.
	   Croatia's success is even more remarkable because nearly all of
the regulars are scattered among Western European clubs. That many
of them, including Suker, are coming off unremarkable or
frustrating seasons with their clubs has fired them up to do well
at the World Cup.
	   Another motivation is spelled out in big letters on the team's
T-shirts: ``Proud to be Croat.''
	   But there's also coach Miroslav Blazevic, a 63-year-old talent
shaper with decades of experience who is rumored to have been
tapped personally by President Franjo Tudjman.
	   Blazevic offered to quit after the European Championship but
says he changed his mind after Suker and Boban pleaded with him to
stay.
	   ``He knows how to stimulate players to be part of a team and to
work as a team,'' said Croatian soccer federation boss Branko
Miksa. ``He knows the psychology of each player, he knows soccer,
and he knows how to bring the two together.''

World Cup: Brazil beware; Dutch team is packed with scorers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Brazil beware. Not only is Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp returning to his goal-grabbing best, but
the rest of the team is capable of getting on the score sheet too.
	   So far in the five Dutch World Cup games, seven different
players have found the net.
	   ``I think everybody can score on the Brazilian team,'' Dutch
midfielder Ronald de Boer, who already has two goals in the
tournament, said Monday. ``But we also have many players to watch
out for.''
	   Bergkamp, who began the tournament struggling for form after a
six-week hamstring injury layoff, has scored in three of the last
four Dutch matches.
	   His last strike was one of the tournament's standout goals.
	   Deftly controlling a 50-yard (45-meter) pass by Frank de Boer,
Bergkamp twisted inside Argentinean defender Roberto Ayala and
fired into the far corner of Carlos Roa's net to give the Dutch a
2-1 quarterfinal win with less than two minutes of regulation time
left.
	   But the Dutch strike force facing Brazil on Tuesday at
Marseille's Stade Velodrome is far from a one-man show.
	   There's AC Milan striker Patrick Kluivert, who also is running
back into form after a two-match red card suspension. He also
scored a memorable goal against Argentina, with Bergkamp providing
the crucial headed pass.
	   Or Phillip Cocu, who scored twice after being promoted from his
normal defensive midfield role to fill the suspended Kluivert's
boots.
	   ``Of course I am happy'' to be scoring, Cocu said. ``But it
doesn't really matter who is scoring, as long as we are winning.''
	   Hiddink was not planning to release his starting lineup until
shortly before kickoff Tuesday, but Cocu might be dropped back into
defense to fill the gap left by Arthur Numan, who is suspended for
the semifinal after a red card against Argentina, and Winston
Bogarde, who broke his leg in training.
	   Marc Overmars, Pierre van Hooijdonk and Edgar Davids also have
found the net.
	   Dutch captain Frank de Boer also hasn't yet had the chance to
try one of his trademark curling left-foot free kicks, but he's
been practicing them in training and is keen to add his name to the
list of Dutch scorers.
	   With Brazil also bristling with lethal strikers like Ronaldo and
Bebeto, Tuesday's final could be a goal feast.
	   ``Expect a good game between two teams who want to win the World
Cup,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``Both sides like to play as
the game was meant to be played _ to win games.''
	   Cocu summed up the optimism in the Dutch camp ahead of the
semifinal.
	   ``Now we have scored a couple of goals against Korea and
Yugoslavia and Argentina, we only need a couple more goals to win
the World Cup,'' he said.

Pak youngest winner in longest Women's Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Se Ri Pak pumped her fists and jumped
into her father's arms Monday after her 18-foot (5.5-meter) birdie
on the 20th extra hole made her the youngest U.S. Women's Open
champion in history.
	   The 20-year-old from South Korea put away amateur Jenny
Chuasiriporn, a U.S &QR;  College student, in the longest Women's Open
in history.
	   Pak, so impervious to pressure through 92 holes, beamed as her
father, Joon-Chul, raced across the green to hug her.
	   ``I'm really happy,'' Pak said after the first sudden death in
the history of this tournament. ``She is a really great player. I
didn't give up, I just kept playing my game.''
	   Pak, who took off her shoes and hit out of the water on the 18th
hole, had remained stoic and businesslike even as Chuasiriporn,
whose passionate and expressive play is reminiscent of Nancy Lopez,
grabbed a four-stroke lead through the first five holes.
	   The twosome was tied at 2-over 73 after 18 holes at Blackwolf
Run.
	   Chuasiriporn, who sank a riveting 40-foot (12-meter) putt on the
final hole Sunday to force a playoff, barely missed a 10-foot
(3-meter) putt for par on the same hole Monday that would have made
her the first amateur champion since 1967.
	   ``That's how it goes,'' Chuasiriporn, also 20, said. ``This is a
great experience for me, more than I ever expected going into
this.''
	   Pak, who won the LPGA Championship in May, became the first
rookie to win two majors since Juli Inkster captured the Nabisco
Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984.
	   Pak, who didn't take the lead until the 14th hole, overcame the
early four-stroke deficit thanks to a triple-bogey by Chuasiriporn
on No. 6.
	   Chuasiriporn, entering her senior year at Duke, was trying to
become only the second amateur to win in 53 editions of the Women's
Open, joining Catherine LaCoste, who won it at 22 in 1967. On
Sunday, Pak was awarded the first-place prize of dlrs 267,500
because amateurs are ineligible to collect prize money.
	   Before Pak, LaCoste was the youngest woman to win an Open. The
last woman to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   The last playoff in the Open was in 1992, when Patty Sheehan
defeated fellow American Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont,
Pennsylvania.
	   The sudden death playoff came after high drama on No. 18, where
both golfers bogeyed the par-4, 421-yard (385-meter) hole.
	   Pak's tee shots were true all day until she hooked one toward
the lake on 18, the ball landing in the rough on a steep slope. Her
caddie, Jeff Cable, had to help her so that she didn't slip into
the water as she took a look.
	   Taking off her spikes and socks, Pak stepped into the calf-deep
water, took an A-wedge and pitched the ball into the rough on the
other side of the fairway.
	   ``I didn't know how I was going to get of there,'' Pak said. ``I
just played my game.''
	   After offering her wedge to her caddie to help pull her back
ashore, Pak hit a 148-yard (135-meter) shot onto the green, about
15 feet (4.5 meters) from the hole.
	   Chuasiriporn's chip for a birdie from the rough was way too hard
and ended up 10 feet (3 meters) past the hole.
	   Pak's putt for par was short, leaving Chuasiriporn with a chance
to win it all with a 10-foot (3-meter) putt. But the ball went past
by less than an inch, and her tap-in sent the twosome back to the
564-yard (516-meter), par-5 10th hole for sudden death.
	   There, they each parred with tap-in putts.
	   And it was off to the 374-yard (342-meter) par-4 No. 11, where
Chuasiriporn missed a 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt, then watched
Pak sink an 18-footer (5.5 meter shot) for the win on the
tournament's 92nd hole.

Sampras: The best ever?

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ His fans may claim that Pete Sampras
is the best player in history, though an argument could be made
that he wasn't even the best player at dinner the night he won a
fifth Wimbledon title.
	   Resplendent in tuxedo at the Champions Dinner, one of London's
ritziest annual galas, Sampras spoke of how proud and amazed he was
to be tied with Bjorn Borg for Wimbledon victories, and with Borg
and longtime idol Rod Laver for overall Grand Slam triumphs _ 11.
	   There was a special buzz in the air on this occasion and a
debate arose about whether the man of the hour was indeed the man
for all time. Was Sampras, in this era of fast, heavy hitters with
giant, space-age rackets, the best ever to play the game? Better
than Borg? Better than Laver? Better than Roy Emerson, who won 12
majors, or Bill Tilden, who ruled the Roaring '20s?
	   And what of John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors, geniuses with rackets
no matter how they acted up?
	   And then there was the white-haired gentleman who sat quietly at
a table a few yards from Sampras' chair on the dais.
	   At 85, Don Budge is among the oldest of the champions who took
tennis to international prominence by touring the world with their
wooden rackets and white balls, playing on every surface from grass
and clay to carpet and concrete and gymnasium-floor wood.
	   During Centre Court ceremonies at Wimbledon this year, Budge was
introduced as ``the tall red-headed Californian with the greatest
backhand ever.'' His mark on the game, in fact, was much greater.
	   Budge stands 6-foot-1 (1.85 meters) and slope-shouldered, just
like Sampras. In 1938, Budge won the four major tournaments _
French, Wimbledon, U.S. Nationals, Australian _ in a single year,
an accomplishment that gave birth to the phrase Grand Slam,
borrowed from the card game bridge.
	   Nobody had done it before. Rod Laver is the only man to have
done it since, and he did it twice.
	   ``It's amazing,'' Budge said, ``that no other American man has
won the Grand Slam. Jack Kramer. Pancho Gonzales. I can't believe
it.''
	   So when people start talking about Sampras being the best of all
time, it is well to remember players like Budge and how they
stacked up against their peers with the same equipment and the same
conditions.
	   Surely, it could be argued, that if you magically took all the
great champions at the peak of their careers, gave them the same
rackets and shoes and played a fantasy Wimbledon, Sampras still
might win.
	   He might have the best serve ever _ that rare combination of
power, variety and pinpoint placement _ and he volleys with such
solidity and swiftness that he is almost impenetrable at the net.
He has, as he likes to say in evaluating others, no holes in his
game. His forehand is second to none, his backhand _ topspin or
slice _ is more than adequate.
	   Yet, it could argued with equal validity that Boris Becker, with
his flair at the net, might in his heyday have been better on
grass. Or that Borg, who revamped his baseline game to win
Wimbledon five straight times, was the greater genius.
	   In the ever fanciful endeavor of comparing champions of
different eras in any sport, the test is not in considering how
they would fare against each other but in how they fared in their
own times. And in tennis, the further issue is how they handled the
many surfaces on which the game is played.
	   In that regard, Sampras doesn't match up with Grand Slammers
Budge or Laver. Nor, for that matter, with Connors, McEnroe, Borg
or Ivan Lendl _ none of whom won all four majors but who
demonstrated proficiency on all four surfaces.
	   Sampras suffers by comparison because of his utter failures on
clay, a slippery, slow surface that may not be to his liking or
training but one that is, nevertheless, the court of choice all
over Europe and Latin America. In the most important clay court
event, the French Open, Sampras has gone as far as the semifinals
only once in nine appearances.
	   As aware of tennis history as anyone who has played the game,
Sampras recognized that gap in his resume and dedicated himself to
filling the last two years. He still he couldn't reach the final.
	   Winning the French remains his single biggest challenge, the one
he knows he needs to lay claim to being the best player ever. And
should he do it next year, while also tying or surpassing Emerson's
dozen majors, it would be a claim few fans could dispute.
	   ``I put him in the godlike stratosphere with Laver and Borg,''
McEnroe says. ``You have to put those people in the upper echelon.
The French would obviously be the icing on the cake. It would be
easier to argue he's the best if he won it.''

Arsenal foursome could come face to face in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Forwards Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars gained a
lot of help from midfielders Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira when
Arsenal won the domestic league and cup titles in England.
	   It may be the Gunners foursome will meet again at the World Cup
final.
	   On opposite sides.
	   Although Overmars was an injury doubt, he and Bergkamp were
expected to team up on the Dutch lineup against defending champion
Brazil on Tuesday in one semifinal in Marseille.
	   Petit and Vieira are in the French squad set to meet World Cup
debutant Croatia at the Stade de France on Wednesday.
	   It's as if Arsenal's amazing performance in coming through to
win English soccer's two big titles were rubbing off on the World
Cup and the July 12 final were beckoning for all four.
	   Bergkamp has scored three goals, including one of the best in
the championship in the final minute to put out Argentina, and
Overmars has bemused defenses with his fancy footwork and fast
raids down the flanks.
	   Although Vieira has made only one appearance so far, Petit has
been one of the top French players with his intelligent linkups
with the strikeforce. It's hardly his fault that the forwards
haven't managed to find the net in the last two French games.
	   Although the host has made the semifinal, the fact that the
goals appeared to have dried up for the strikers is alarming the
fans.
	   But not the players.
	   ``It doesn't matter if I don't score. The most important is the
defense and the title,'' said Stephane Guivarc'h, the French league
top scorer for the past two seasons, who hasn't scored a single
goal here.
	   ``I know I will score. I feel I will score against Croatia,''
said Youri Djorkaeff, who has scored 18 goals so far for France in
internationals, but has only one penalty goal in five World Cup
games so far.
	   Team captain Didier Deschamps, who plays in midfield, admits
it's a tough problem to solve.
	   ``It's an area you really cannot work on,'' he said. ``We won't
win the semifinal 5-0, that's for sure.''
	   While the Dutch prepared for their game against the Brazilians,
former coach Rinus Michels was recovering from a heart attack he
suffered during the quarterfinal victory over the Netherlands.
	   The 70-year-old, who guided the Dutch to a 1988 European
Championship after taking the team to World Cup finals in '74 and
'78, was treated at the game in Marseille by Argentine team
physician Dr. Raul Madero.
	   Michels, who had a heart-bypass operation 15 years ago, was
taken to hospital in Paris.
	   ``His condition has improved to stable and he is expected to
stay in the hospital for a couple days yet,'' FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said.

World Cup: Bergkamp, Owen, Raul on list of memorable strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Imagine it.
	   Dennis Bergkamp brilliantly controls a high, dropping pass from
deep on his right foot, deftly slips the ball to the fast-moving
Michael Owen who uses his pace to get past two defenders before
crossing to Raul who volleys it powerfully home first time.
	   It's impossible because they all play for different teams. But
all three have produced this kind of standout play to score some of
the best goals of the World Cup.
	   Bergkamp's last minute strike against Argentina put the Dutch
into the semifinal for the first time since 1978.
	   Frank de Boer played a long, high ball from deep and Bergkamp
expertly brought it under control with his right foot despite the
close attention of Argentina defender Roberto Ayala.
	   He then pulled the ball inside the defender and volleyed it past
'keeper Carlos Roa for a 2-1 win at Marseille. Bergkamp did it all
with his right foot as if the left one were just there to keep him
upright.
	   Owen's strike against Argentina at Saint-Etienne also was a goal
that was self-made.
	   The 18-year-old Liverpool forward, the youngest player this
century to play for England and the youngest ever to score, took a
short pass in midfield 40 meters from goal.
	   Owen, who has been timed at 10.9 for the 100 meters, used his
phenomenal speed to race diagonally past two defenders and, even
though he could have passed to an unmarked colleague by his side,
was confident enough to carry on alone and shoot home from level
with the penalty spot.
	   Playing for Spain against Nigeria at Nantes, Raul needed just
one touch.
	   Real Madrid teammate Fernando Hierro aimed a long pass from deep
and the striker, who turned 21 a few days after the game, timed his
run to perfection. He outpaced a Nigerian defender and volleyed the
ball first time past the 'keeper with his left foot.
	   The 16th World Cup has produced more stunning strikes to
remember.
	   Sunday Oliseh hit a 30-meter shot that glanced in off the post
for Nigeria's third against Spain. It gave his team a thrilling
come-from-behind 3-2 victory despite Raul's amazing goal for the
Spaniards
	   Another Nigerian, Victor Ikpeba, finished off a great three-man
move for the only goal of the game against Bulgaria at the Parc des
Princes to put his team into the second round.
	   Left back Celestine Babayaro brought the ball up the left flank
and slid it to Jay-Jay Okocha, who found Daniel Amokachi at the top
right corner of the penalty area. Amokachi side-footed the ball to
Ikpeba in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco striker, Africa's 1997 Player of the Year, danced
around sweeper Trifon Ivanov and rolled the ball just under the
'keeper's arm.
	   England's David Beckham, who later tarnished his reputation by
getting sent off in the second round loss to Argentina, scored with
a 30-meter free kick that swerved round the wall and curled inside
the left post. It helped England to a 2-0 victory over Colombia at
Lens.
	   Morocco went out in the first round but scored one of the best
goals in a 2-2 tie with Norway at Montpellier.
	   After taking a long pass from Tahar, Moustafa El Hadji, who
plays in Spain for Deportivo de La Coruna, sped down the left side
and spun a Norwegian defender around before blasting home a
right-footed shot just inside the right post.
	   And how about Ebbe Sand's goal in Denmark's 4-1 win over Nigeria
only 22 seconds after he had entered the game, the fastest World
Cup goal scored by a substitute?
	   Sand ran to meet a pass from Michael Laudrup, headed it around
defender Taribo West and volleyed in from the penalty spot.

Schering may seek injunction against Brazilian sales suspension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. ADDS four grafs about creation of special police
unit to combat phony drugs. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Schering AG said it may seek a court
injunction against a government order suspending sales of all
products made by its Brazilian subsidiary.
	   At least 13 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking fake Microvlar contraceptives made by
the German drug giant, which said they were intended solely to test
out new packaging equipment.
	   The placebo pills, made of lactose and sugar, were supposed to
have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen and sold
illegally. Some 650,000 packages, containing 21 pills each, were
manufactured but it is unclear how many were stolen and
distributed.
	   Also Monday, the Justice Ministry announced the creation of a
special federal police unit to combat the production and sale of
counterfeit drugs.
	   ``The medicine for those who falsify drugs is jail,'' Justice
Minister Renan Calheiros said at a press conference to announce the
unit's creation and a special hotline consumers could call to
report the sale of phony pharmaceuticals.
	   A spokeswoman for the health ministry said that over the last
four months, investigators found some 82 batches of phony drugs on
the market beside Microvlar. Unlike the birth control pills, the
other drugs are believed to have been manufactured by
counterfeiters.
	   Last week, the government fined Schering dlrs 2.5 million and
suspended sales of all products made by its Brazilian subsidiary.
Production of Microvlar has been stopped and will only resume after
Schering recalls all of its packages from drug stores and changes
its packaging format.
	   Schering marketing director Theodorus van der Loo said the
company is worried about medicines _ including ones for leukemia,
multiple sclerosis and prostate cancer _ not being available to the
public.
	   Schering's Brazilian subsidiary also exports these products to
other Latin American countries. ``If the scarcity of these products
becomes critical, we may ask for a court injunction against the
suspension,'' he said.
	   The sales suspension will remain in effect until authorities
conclude a new inspection of Schering's facilities, which has not
been scheduled.
	   Sergio Abdalla, the police chief in charge of the Schering case,
said he believed a well-organized gang stole the placebos and
possibly other medicine.
	   On Monday, he questioned the owners of seven pharmacies and
three pregnant women who said they took the fake pills, in an
effort to determine who distributed the placebos.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wealthier countries must support Japan and
other Asian nations trying to recover from the economic crisis by
granting new loans, restructuring existing loans and giving more
humanitarian aid, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund says.
	   Michel Camdessus and other leaders of the world's economic
institutions also urged Japan to shore up its banking system and
enact reforms so that the recent fall of the yen doesn't jeopardize
recovery from the Asian economic crisis.
	   Camdessus and James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank,
were among a host of speakers at Monday's opening the U.N. Economic
and Social Council's annual session.
	   Japan ``is not just another economy, it is of crucial
importance,'' Wolfensohn told the gathering.
	   Camdessus said the recent fall of the yen was ``a crisis within
a crisis'' that reflected a serious lack of confidence in Japan's
financial institutions.
	   The yen's continued weakness ``could seriously jeopardize the
ongoing recovering of the economies that were hit first,'' he said.
	   ``A lot depends now on the aggressive and quick moves Japan
intends and starts adopting to rehabilitate its banking sector, to
adopt reforms that will provide significant tax relief to ensure
that fiscal stimulus is not withdrawn too quickly.'' Camdessus also
called for Japan to open up and deregulate its economy.
	   In addition to urging wealthier countries to help in the
bailout, Camdessus called on the affected countries themselves to
improve their own financial management and preserve the stability
of exchange rates.
	   The session was to begin considering the findings of the U.N.
World Economic and Social Survey 1998, which found that growth in
the dollar value of world exports was projected to fall about 2.5
percent in 1998, from 4.3 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1997.
	   The Asian crisis plunged several of the fastest-growing
economies into a severe recession and slowed growth of world output
and trade, the report says.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the session by noting
that the financial turmoil hasn't only affected South Asia, but
countries as far away as Africa, in the form of reduced commodity
prices.
	   ``The crisis has had its most devastating impact on society's
margins: on the poor and vulnerable who are least able to withstand
the sudden loss of jobs,'' said Annan.
	   He advocated abolishing non-tariff barriers, relief from debt
for poor countries and more humanitarian aid. He said exports by
the least-developed countries should be duty-free.

Items on Pele's pick; Blazevic cap; French colors

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Croatia has defied the odds in getting to the World
Cup semifinal at its first attempt.
	   According to Pele, that's probably as far it will go.
	   ``To play against France will be different and complicated for
them,'' he said. ``France plays a lot to the wings and this will be
tough for Croatia to handle.
	   ``Players like Thierry Henry and Zinedine Zidane could take
advantage of that and France will attack to the outside.''
	   The Croats got to the last four by scoring a memorable 3-0
victory over three-time titlist Germany and face the French at the
Stade de France on Wednesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic and his
French policeman's hat are becoming a familiar sight at the World
Cup.
	   Blazevic says he was asked to wear the blue cap by the police
chief of Vittel, the team's training headquarters, as a good luck
charm for the gendarme who was savagely beaten into a coma by
Germans at the World Cup two weeks ago.
	   The 63-year-old Blazevic, who admits being superstitious,
consults the stars before games and feels close to France because
he coached there for years. So the cap stayed.
	   Blazevic first sported it while sitting on the bench during
Croatia's second-round win against Romania on June 30. Though he
doesn't wear it all the time, he says it never leaves his side as
the team travels around France during the championship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Beating Italy in all white, France will return to
its familiar blue shirts for the World Cup semifinal against
Croatia.
	   In fact ``Les Bleus'' will have blue shorts too but were able to
stick to their red socks.
	   The Croatians, who made the semifinal at their first attempt,
will wear their red and white check shirts and white socks for the
game at the Stade de France at Saint-Denis.
	   The two other semifinalists, Brazil and the Netherlands, wore
their traditional colors for Tuesday's showdown in Marseille.
	   Defending titlist Brazil wore yellow shirts, blue shorts and
white socks while Netherlands were in orange-white-orange.

World Cup: France desperately seeking goals against Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ In this World Cup semifinal gone
topsy-turvy, the underdog knows how to score and the favorite has
lost the touch.
	   Outsider Croatia is on a high after three great goals against
Germany. Now it longs to flaunt the red-and-white checkered flag
into the face of yet another soccer giant and reach the World Cup
final on its first attempt.
	   Host France sidesteps its goal drought and says Wednesday's
semifinal at the Stade de France is not so much about scoring than
about willpower. Les Bleus should know.
	   They scored once in almost four hours of play between the first
round into the semifinals.
	   France thrives on its defense, allowing one goal in five games,
and scrapes through despite its offense. Curiously, Croatian coach
Miroslav Blazevic lauds France's offense and belittles its back
four.
	   France's defense is ``not that strong,'' said Blazevic. ``The
defense is vulnerable'' when the line defenders move upfield. The
veteran coach forgot the underdog's rule No. 1 _ do not provoke the
opponent ahead of the game.
	   In this case it can only make the work of strikers Davor Suker
and Goran Vlaovic tougher when they face the likes of Marcel
Desailly and Laurent Blanc.
	   French coach Aime Jacquet was not to provide such psychological
fodder to the Croats, heaping praise on each and every one, after
derogatory comments from Germans had given the Croatians fire in
their heart.
	   ``It has quality. It is a very complete team. It has an
impressive defensive bloc and its players perform in Europe's
greatest clubs,'' he said.
	   Forward Youri Djorkaeff also tried to stroke the opponent the
right way.
	   ``I would have preferred to play the Germans, they are weaker,''
he said. ``Croatia now has the winds in its sails.''
	   Perhaps Djorkaeff should not have said he felt he would score
against the Croatian defense. Usually that works like a red flag to
a bull.
	   ``I know I will score. I feel I will score against Croatia,'' he
said Monday. Djorkaeff scored 18 goals so far for France, but only
one penalty goal in five World Cup games so far.
	   In what could again become a great defensive battle, both
nations have yet to concede a goal since coming out of the first
round.
	   ``It doesn't matter if I don't score. The most important is the
defense and the title,'' said Stephane Guivarc'h, the French league
top scorer for the past two seasons, who hasn't scored a single
goal here.

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: One student killed, two injured in clash with
police &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ One student was killed
and two others wounded during a clash with police at the Autonomous
University of Santo Domingo on Monday.
	   Student Franklin Fabian Mejia was shot and killed during a
demonstration against measures to lower enrollment at the
overcrowded university. Two other students were in critical
condition at local hospitals. Their names were not released.
	   Students threw homemade bombs and stones at riot police during a
standoff in front of the university. Police responded with tear gas
and fired pellet guns at the protesters.
	   It was unclear where the shots came from, and police had not
given an official account of the shooting.
	   The university has more than 100,000 students, and officials are
trying to lower enrollment to 70,000. The University Council
approved a new set of enrollment caps last week.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Police on alert, malls close as residents brace for
strike
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Shopkeepers covered windows with
steel shutters and riot police stood guard at airports and power
plants Monday, bracing for the Puerto Rico's biggest labor protest
in years.
	   Union leaders said they expected up to half a million of Puerto
Rico's 3.8 million people _ including electrical, water and airport
workers _ to join a 48-hour general strike starting Tuesday.
	   Demonstrators are protesting the sale of the state telephone
company to a consortium led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.,
and want to show support for the 6,400 telephone workers who have
been striking over the issue since June 18. The phone workers are
fearful of widespread job cuts once the sale takes affect.
	   Saboteurs have cut and damaged telephone cables, leaving more
than 250,000 people without long-distance service Monday, the
telephone company said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: 1970s pro-independence bomber arrested again
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican independence
activist convicted of trying to bomb a McDonald's restaurant in the
1970s was arrested Monday on charges he sold a bomb to drug
smugglers.
	   Guillermo Segarra Rivera, 45, was arrested at his home in
Patillas, in southern Puerto Rico, by local police and federal
agents.
	   Segarra Rivera was caught in 1975 planting a bomb at a
McDonald's in San Juan as part of a police sting operation. Police
defused the bomb, and Segarra was sentenced to five years in jail.
	   By 1978, he had been paroled. That year, police charged him with
planting a bomb in front of a U.S. post office in suburban San Juan
and with buying a shotgun that was later used in an attack on a
guardhouse near the home of former Gov. Luis Munoz Marin.
	   Segarra was acquitted of the charges. Police claimed his
guerrilla group was called the Anti-Imperialist Armed Forces, but
Segarra and other activists said the police made up the name and
that the group never existed.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Exile group sends raft with aid to Cuba
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a protest aimed at the United States and
Fidel Castro's government, a Cuban exile group sent a self-guided
blimp and raft loaded with food and humanitarian aid into Cuban
territory Monday.
	   The Miami-based Democracy Movement said it was the first action
by an exile group in Cuban territory since Cuba shot down two
unarmed planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue in 1996, killing
four exiles.
	   The raft, containing food, soap and other supplies, was launched
late Sunday from Cuban waters, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from
the Cuban coast, said Luis Felipe Rojas, a Democracy Movement
spokesman. Attached to the raft was a 6-meter-long (20-foot) blimp
with the word ``Democracy.''
	   A month ago, the United States resumed direct humanitarian aid
to Cuba, which had been suspended after the planes were shot down.
President Bill Clinton lifted the ban after Pope John Paul II
visited Cuba in January.
	   Democracy Movement said in a statement that it ``needs neither a
foreign law, nor the arrogant denial of the Cuban government, to
take assistance to its own people.''
 &UR; BERMUDA: Court turns down prosecutors' appeal in Canadian's murder
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ The supreme court for British
territories on Monday rejected the Bermudan government's request to
re-try a Jamaican accomplice in the murder of a Canadian teen-ager.
	   The British Privy Council in London refused to hear the
government's request to try Kirk Mundy on charges he murdered
17-year-old Rebecca Middleton of Belleville, Ontario, in July 1996.
A lower appeals court earlier denied the request.
	   The Privy Council gave no immediate reason for the rejection.
	   Mundy is already serving a 5-year sentence as an accomplice to
Middleton's murder.
	   He pleaded guilty in October 1996 to the lesser charge in
exchange for testimony against his former friend, Justis Smith, who
faces murder charges in the case. Prosecutors later claimed they
discovered new evidence indicating that both of the men
participated in the murder.

New definitions of love and courtship among Palestinians

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Layla walked into the dimly lit cafe
and scanned each dark corner. Ibrahim strolled in a few minutes
later and pretended not to know her. Only after Layla gave the
all-clear signal did Ibrahim move to her small marble-top table.
	   Layla, a 22-year-old bank employee, and Ibrahim, a 24-year-old
government clerk, have been dating secretly since spring, defying
centuries-old Arab traditions of strict separation of the sexes
before marriage.
	   ``I told my parents I was going out with my girlfriends,'' said
Layla, leaning close to Ibrahim in their favorite haunt, the hip
Kan Bata Zaman cafe. A Bob Marley CD played in the background.
	   ``I told everyone I had a meeting after work,'' said Ibrahim,
stylish with a moussed head of short hair, a gold necklace and a
goatee. Fearing the wrath of their families, both asked that their
real names not be used.
	   Dating, even in secret, is new to Palestinian society, where
arranged marriages are still the norm and young women are sometimes
killed by relatives for having illicit sex.
	   The bellwether is Ramallah, the Palestinians' bustling
commercial center. There, couples in their 20s and 30s _ members of
the Westernized elite, as well as office workers and university
students _ meet in the city's many new cafes and restaurants to
escape gossipmongers and nosy relatives.
	   Subtle changes in courtship also have occurred elsewhere in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip: In the desert oasis of Jericho, teen-age
boys and girls danced together at a recent outdoor concert. Even in
conservative Gaza, young couples try to sneak off for private
drives.
	   The turning point in dating mores came with the withdrawal of
Israeli soldiers from Palestinian towns and villages in late 1995.
During the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation, all entertainment was banned _ even swimming on the
Gaza beach _ and young women rarely were allowed into the street
without a family escort.
	   Once the Palestinian Authority took charge, many of those
restrictions were relaxed.
	   With the creation of thousands of new jobs since the end of
Israeli occupation, more and more women have joined the work force
and offices and universities have become important meeting places.
	   The changes are most pronounced in Ramallah, a cosmopolitan city
of 100,000 and the Palestinians' de facto capital, where dozens of
new restaurants and discos opened in quick succession, including
Raed Haddad's Kan Bata Zaman cafe.
	   ``We didn't plan it that way, but we have become a major meeting
place,'' Haddad said.
	   Ramallah is unique because many of its residents are U.S.
citizens and have been exposed to Western ways in their years
abroad. Ramallah residents began immigrating to the United States
at the turn of the century, but almost always returned once their
children reached adolescence, in order to avoid the American dating
scene. Now many families have homes both in the United States and
Ramallah, with relatives on both sides of the ocean.
	   Ramallah also has attracted many foreigners, such as aid workers
and U.N. officials, and the parties they throw give their
Palestinian friends a chance to mingle without chaperones.
	   Islamic preachers watch the erosion of tradition anxiously.
``Our society will pay a high price for our ever-increasing
immorality,'' warned Sheikh Hamed Bitawi, the chief justice of the
Islamic courts in the West Bank.
	   ``We will never regain our homeland this way. The only way to
solve our problems is to commit to Islam,'' he said.
	   Sociologist Salim Tamari said that the older generation still
shares Bitawi's conservative views. While dating is on the rise,
people's acceptance of it is not, he said.
	   But there are many signs that the old customs are still strictly
observed by most, as they are elsewhere in the Middle East,
especially in rural areas.
	   Many young couples are still brought together in an elaborate
matchmaking ritual and are hitched without knowing one another.
	   In poverty-stricken Gaza, where 1 million people live in an area
of a little more than 100 square miles (260 sq. kms), four young
women were slain by male relatives this year in so-called honor
killings.
	   Many young women who date say premarital sex is out of the
question because it would brand them as ``loose'' and destroy their
chances of getting married. They say they take the risk of dating,
however, because they expect the relationship to lead to marriage
and don't want to walk into marriage blind.
	   Haddad, the 28-year-old cafe owner, thinks young couples should
strike a balance between the old and the new. ``There are
traditions that must be respected,'' he said.

Summary executions highlight launch of Kosovo observer mission

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of wailing ethnic Albanian
villagers buried three farmers who official Serb reports said were
murdered by their own people for betraying them. But the villagers
say the slayings are the handiwork of Serb police.
	   ``The (Serb) police did this,'' said an elderly villager
standing near the three bodies, each with a bullet hole in an ear,
rope burns on their wrists and cuts and bruises on their bodies.
``Their policy is to kill and to do terrorism.''
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the constant conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's disputed Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Western diplomats hope to bring
some clarity to the confusion with the launch this week of a
multi-national observer mission.
	   Since Serb forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28, a tangle of roadblocks have prevented any
outside observers from confirming reports of fighting. Information
is largely channeled through centers representing either side.
	   The relatives' claims of summary execution by police came hours
after the Serb Media Center, which compiles official Serb
information, told reporters that ethnic Albanian militants killed
the three with automatic weapons because they were loyal to the
Serbs. Serbia is one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo. Recent attempts
to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government to the
negotiating table have produced few results.
	   Grieving friends said Muhamet Elshani, 60, his 16-year-old son
Afrim and Salin Gashi, 26, disappeared Sunday while working their
corn fields. A local farmer found them Monday morning near their
home in the 3,000-member community of Pirane, 75 kilometers (45
miles) southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina.
	   Western observers, Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union will regularly tour
villages in Kosovo to try and clarify the situation on the ground.
	   They also will share information with humanitarian organizations
struggling to cope with a flood of refugees and conflicts in the
remote Kosovo mountains where neighboring Serb and ethnic Albanian
villages form a checkerboard of front lines.

U.S. delegation urged to meet with Nigerian opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Pickering tentatively scheduled to leave Nigeria
about 1600 GMT. &QL;

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A high-level U.S. diplomatic delegation
headed to Nigeria on Tuesday, hoping to restore relations broken
off years ago because of the West African nation's abysmal human
rights record.
	   Thomas Pickering, a former ambassador to Nigeria, led the U.S.
delegation scheduled to meet Tuesday with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
Nigeria's new military leader, in the capital of Abuja.
	   The visit by the delegation comes amid dissident complaints that
other diplomats, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
refused to stand up for Nigeria's best-known political prisoner,
Moshood Abiola, apparent winner of Nigeria's 1993 presidential
elections.
	   Pickering ``must avoid being closeted in Abuja like the United
Nations Secretary-General and his Commonwealth counterpart who
failed to meet credible opposition groups,'' National Democratic
Coalition Secretary-General Ayo Okpadokun said in a statement
released in Lagos.
	   The U.S. delegation will not visit Lagos, Nigeria's commercial
capital where much of the country's opposition movement is
centered. However, the delegation will hold a small meeting with
various members of civil society, including some opposition
figures, said Charles Patterson, the principal officer at the U.S.
Embassy office in Abuja.
	   Annan's visit last week infuriated many of the country's
dissidents, who have accused him of putting pressure on Abiola to
renounce his claim to the presidency.
	   Abiola told Annan that he would give up his presidential claims.
	   There have been reports that Abiola will be freed this week,
after the 30-day mourning period for Nigeria's former dictator ends
Tuesday. During his visit, Annan announced that Nigeria would free
all its political prisoners ``at the appropriate time,'' including
Abiola.
	   However, the uproar from Nigeria's opposition since Annan's
announcement may mean that Abiola will end up spending more time in
his guest house-prison. Some Nigerian officials have said that he
will be held longer, apparently because the government fears
opposition anger spilling over into political violence.
	   Abubakar came to power last month after the death of Gen. Sani
Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship left Nigeria an international
pariah.
	   American-Nigerian relations have been poor in recent years _
though American firms do purchase millions of dollars worth of
Nigerian oil every year _ particularly after Abacha executed
playwright and pro-democracy activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
people in November 1995.
	   However, Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by
releasing some political prisoners and pledging that all will be
freed.
	   ``There is a moment of opportunity here,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said last week in announcing Pickering's
visit.

Puerto Ricans brace for 48-hour general strike

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Fearing their biggest protest in
years, Puerto Ricans stocked up on ice, water and batteries in
preparation for a 48-hour general strike called Tuesday to stop the
sale of the island's telephone company.
	   Union leaders said they expected up to half a million of the
island's 3.8 million people to come out in support of 6,400
telephone workers who have been on strike since June 18.
	   ``Put your names on the list for picket line or special missions
starting at 3 a.m.,'' strike leaders told employees Monday outside
the the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. headquarters. They refused to say
what the ``special missions'' entailed.
	   Saboteurs have cut and damaged telephone cables, leaving more
than 250,000 people without long-distance service Monday, the
telephone company said.
	   Riot police guarded the road to San Juan's international
airport. Police officers guarded power plants and other sensitive
areas. Firefighters and civil defense workers went on alert.
	   Hundreds of tourists have canceled vacations, hotels reported,
and at least one airline, the Caribbean LIAT, canceled flights.
	   Annie Cruz, president of one of two telephone workers' unions,
said she hoped the strike would persuade the government to hold a
referendum on the sale. Independence-minded union leaders have
equated it to ``selling the patrimony of the people'' at a time
when Gov. Pedro Rossello is campaigning for the U.S. commonwealth
to become the 51st state of the union.
	   Ignoring strikers who fear massive layoffs, Rossello last
Wednesday signed a law completing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale to a
consortium led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. It awaits
approval by the Federal Communications Commission.
	   Protesters reacted with two bombing incidents, numerous bomb
threats and hoaxes and violent clashes with police.
	   Rossello has refused to reconsider the deal, the most ambitious
yet in a project that already has privatized some hospitals,
hotels, ports and prisons.
	   Islanders, accustomed to power and water outages even when
utility workers are not on strike, stocked up on ice for deep
freezers and filled buckets and baths with water.
	   About 4,000 airport workers vowed to walk off the job. Port
Authority Director Hector Rivera said the 134 managers among the
agency's 1,600 workers would keep ports open, including the
international airport at San Juan that averages 300 flights a day.
	   Major shopping malls announced they were closing, including the
190-shop Plaza Las Americas, which employees 5,000 people. The
Plaza management said it was prudent because of the rash of bomb
threats.
	   It would be the first general strike in Puerto Rico since tens
of thousands of sugar cane cutters stopped working in 1934 to
demand better conditions and wages.
	   When former Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon tried to sell the
telephone company in 1990, he was dissuaded in part by massive
protests.
	   Last October, unions called a 24-hour work stoppage against the
telephone sale. It closed schools and left hospitals with skeletal
staff. Utility managers kept water and electricity services
running.

Northern Ireland watches Portadown to test who's `winning'

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ This is a land enjoying a peace
agreement, but not yet at peace.
	   Just as Northern Ireland is developing its first cross-community
government in history, rival Catholic and Protestant militants are
willing to riot over whether 1,200 men in orange vestments,
accompanied by accordion bands, may parade within earshot of their
enemies.
	   Such blunt confrontations over symbolism and status have driven
the past three decades of bloodshed and destruction in Northern
Ireland _ and they won't go away simply because eight parties and
two governments decided to back a history-making document.
	   Besides, the peace negotiators were never so naive as to dream
their accomplishments would magically defuse the antipathy and
violent retaliations shown by the Protestant Orangemen's attempts
to march down Portadown's largely Catholic Garvaghy Road over the
weekend.
	   April's political agreement was laden with deliberately vague
language that allowed both sides to claim victory. This
inconclusive result left many Protestants and Irish Catholics
unsure whether their side prevailed.
	   The Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein party asserts the
accord puts Northern Ireland on course to eventual absorption by
the Irish Republic, while the Ulster Unionist Party maintains it
makes Northern Ireland's union with Britain stronger than ever
before.
	   In the face of these contradictory claims, the uncompromising
confrontation over Garvaghy Road provides a graphic, unambiguous
test of who's really ``winning.''
	   The Ulster Unionists are institutionally linked to the Orange
Order, and Sinn Fein backs the Catholic anti-Orange protests. So
their collisions in Portadown and elsewhere provide a chance to see
whether Ulster Unionist orange or Sinn Fein green is stronger.
	   Whereas Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was able to avoid
talking directly to Sinn Fein leaders during the successful peace
negotiations, that approach doesn't work in a cruder,
winner-takes-all dispute like Garvaghy Road, where Orange leaders
have refused to meet the protest leader, a former IRA prisoner.
	   Trimble, elected last week to be first minister of the new
Belfast Assembly, now finds himself in a uniquely vulnerable
position: He's a past champion of the Portadown Orangemen, but must
now try to toe a neutral public line.
	   Time is on Trimble's side, though.
	   The Portadown showdowns of the past three years suggest that no
matter how angry they may be, rioters on both sides have to get
exhausted sometime, allowing political progress to resume.
	   Last year, for instance, the post-march violence in Catholic
areas seemed so intense as to rule out even the thought of
compromise. Yet, two weeks later, the IRA resumed a truce it had
broken in 1996 and Northern Ireland soon started down the road to
its most productive negotiations ever.
	   The architects of April's accord foresaw the short-term disaster
of Garvaghy Road 1998. They decided that the Assembly would meet
briefly in July and not convene again until mid-September _ when
Protestants will have put away their marching shoes for another
year.

murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ The supreme court for British
territories has rejected the Bermudan government's request to
re-try a Jamaican accomplice in the murder of a Canadian teen-ager.
	   The British Privy Council in London on Monday refused to hear
the government's request to try Kirk Mundy on charges he murdered
17-year-old Rebecca Middleton of Belleville, Ontario, in July 1996.
A lower appeals court earlier denied the request.
	   The Privy Council gave no immediate reason for the rejection.
	   Mundy is already serving a five-year sentence as an accomplice
in Middleton's murder.
	   He pleaded guilty in October 1996 to the lesser charge in
exchange for testimony against his former friend, Justis Smith, who
faces murder charges. Prosecutors later claimed they discovered new
evidence indicating both men participated in the murder.
	   A Bermudan court is to set a date for Smith's trial on Aug. 3.

Salvadoran prosecutors end fight against parole for convicted
</HEADLINE>
killers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Prosecutors have ended their
fight against parole for three former Salvadoran national guards
convicted of raping and killing four U.S. churchwomen, but a legal
hurdle still blocks the men's release, a judge said.
	   Under El Salvadoran law, the three men cannot be immediately
paroled because their case is tied to that of two other men also
convicted in the same crime who have been denied parole.
	   Defense attorneys have asked Judge Gloria Platero to reconsider
her denial and allow all five men to be released. Platero is to
rule on the request this week. If she denies the motion, defense
attorneys say they will appeal to a higher court.
	   The five former guards were sentenced to 30 years in prison for
raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and
Maura Clark and lay worker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   The women, as with many church workers and supporters, had been
on a blacklist of suspected leftist sympathizers kept by anti-rebel
death squads during El Salvador's civil war.
	   Platero said Monday that three of the men, Luis Colindres, Jose
Roberto Moreno y Daniel Canales, are eligible for parole under a
law passed in April to relieve prison overcrowding. However, she
denied parole for Francisco Orlando Contreras and Carlos Joaquin
Contreras.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items from Peru, the Dominican Republic, the United
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A bus trying to avoid a pothole slammed
head-on into a car carrying six nuns in northern Peru, killing five
of them and seriously injuring the sixth, authorities said Monday.
	   The incident occurred Sunday on a portion of the Pan American
Highway outside Tumbes, a coastal city 980 kilometers (610 miles)
northwest of the capital, Lima. The nuns were heading to Tumbes to
celebrate Teachers Day at a religious school.
	   The injured nun was in a coma, police said. None of the bus'
passengers were injured.
	   The nuns were members of the Menders of the Sacred Heart
congregation in the northern city of Piura.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Students demonstrating
against measures to lower the enrollment at overcrowded Autonomous
University of Santo Domingo clashed with police. One student was
killed and two others were wounded.
	   Franklin Fabian Mejia was shot and killed. The two other
students were in critical condition at local hospitals. Their names
were not released.
	   Students threw homemade bombs and stones at riot police during
Monday's standoff in which police responded with tear gas and fired
pellet guns. It was unclear who killed Mejia and wounded the other
students.
	   The university has more than 100,000 students, and officials are
trying to lower enrollment to 70,000. The university council
approved a new set of enrollment caps last week.
	   Students, however, want the university to expand its facilities
and hire new professors to ease overcrowded classes.
	   Last year, the university was forced to cancel classes after
demonstrations commemorating the 1965 U.S. invasion of the
Dominican Republic turned violent. Four students were wounded by
gunshots, soldiers were stoned and at least three cars were burned.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan begins a
Latin American trip next Monday that will take him to Brazil,
Uruguay, Argentina, Guatemala and Mexico, United Nations officials
said.
	   During the two-week trip, Annan will be discussing U.N. reform,
contributions by member states and other U.N.-related issues in
meetings with heads of state, lawmakers, international relations
experts and non-governmental organizations, said spokesman Juan
Carlos Brandt.
	   Annan had long been invited to visit the region; the timing was
chosen because it suited everyone's schedule, Brandt said.
	   In Buenos Aires, Annan will receive an honorary degree from the
Faculty of Law of the University of Buenos Aires, and will
participate in a Model United Nations event with students.
	   The trip ends over the July 25-26 weekend.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Fifteen human rights workers
investigating police abuse said they are being harassed with death
threats or brief detentions.
	   ``I'm afraid to pick up the phone, because I know it's that
policeman calling to threaten me,'' Marvelis Sifontes of the human
rights group Support Network said Monday.
	   Sifontes, a legal aide, said she has been receiving death
threats since she helped a neighbor file a complaint two weeks ago
after a police officer beat him.
	   She said she can't do anything about the calls, because she
can't prove the police are making them. The other activists say
they have received similar threats or been briefly detained.
	   A Justice Ministry spokesman said her office was not aware of
the complaints.
	   The Support Network says police killed 32 people from January to
March. Many were unarmed and not committing any crime.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan police detained seven Cubans
and their two guides after the Cubans allegedly were caught trying
use fake U.S. passports at La Aurora International Airport.
	   Police Commissioner Elias Perez said the Cubans, who apparently
had entered Guatemala illegally, planned to fly Monday to Flores, a
city 250 kms (155 miles) north of Guatemala City. They may have
planned to continue on to the United States, perhaps by crossing
through Mexico or Belize, he said.
	   The guides were identified as Pedro Oscar Ballares, 56, of Costa
Rica, and 42-year-old Julio Miguel Cruz, a U.S. citizen of Cuban
origin, police said.

Japan ruling party unlikely to regain upper house majority: polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party may be
unable to regain control of the upper house of Parliament in
elections this Sunday, according to surveys published Tuesday.
	   Results of two separate polls, conducted by the Asahi and Nihon
Keizai newspapers, indicate Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
party could fall short of the 69 seats needed to regain control of
the body, which it lost in 1989.
	   The July 12 vote, the first upper house election since Hashimoto
came to power in early 1996, covers half the 252 seats in the upper
house. It is widely seen as a referendum on Hashimoto's management
of Japan's slumping economy.
	   The Asahi forecast that the LDP will maintain its current
strength of 61 seats, plus or minus six seats. The Nihon Keizai
predicted the party will win 60 seats. It did not provide a margin
of error.
	   The estimates were based on surveys carried out this past
weekend. The Asahi polled 93,600 people, 58 percent of whom
responded. The Nihon Keizai polled 37,600 people and received
responses from 59.8 percent.
	   Even if the LDP does worse than expected, it is in little danger
of losing power because it wields firm control over the more
powerful lower house, holding 262 of 500 seats.
	   Barring an early dissolution of Parliament, lower house
elections will not be held until 2000.

Earthquake prediction spreads panic in Iranian capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranians have left town. Others
are stocking up on cash and food. And those with neither money nor
means are simply praying to God.
	   A prediction by a man in Slovakia that a powerful earthquake
will devastate Tehran this weekend or soon after has spread panic
in the capital city of 10 million.
	   For days, newspapers have printed statements by seismologists
and officials saying the earthquake prediction is a hoax. And one
of the nation's top earthquake experts was appearing on TV Monday
night to calm residents.
	   But callers to a local radio station from villages around Tehran
complained Monday that they had been deluged by city folk looking
for a safe place to spend the weekend.
	   ``They're even coming here asking if we have any tents to rent
out,'' one caller said. ``What's happening in Tehran?''
	   Fear, panic and official scrambling _ that's what.
	   The Slovak Embassy in Tehran received a letter from a man named
Lubomir Minarovjech, who predicted that an earthquake of magnitude
5 or more would jolt the capital this month, probably on July 10 or
13.
	   Trying to be helpful, the embassy faxed the letter to the
Foreign Ministry in Tehran, which sent it to the president, who
passed it on to seismologists at Tehran University. Somehow, the
letter leaked out.
	   ``Scientifically, the time and place of an earthquake cannot be
predicted. This letter is a lie and a hoax,'' said Dr. Bahram
Akasheh, one of Iran's top seismologists.
	   Akasheh said he would go on television Monday to try to restore
calm.
	   ``Iranians are generally pretty well-informed about a lot of
things. But they know nothing about earthquakes, and that's why
this rumor has spread like wildfire,'' he said.
	   It also probably does not help that Iran is prone to devastating
earthquakes.
	   In 1990, a town in northern Iran was destroyed when two quakes
struck, killing 50,000 people and leaving 10 times as many
homeless.
	   Last year, more than 5,000 people were killed in earthquakes,
and this year dozens have died in smaller quakes. A minor
earthquake jolted Tehran in November, but caused no casualties or
damage.
	   So, hoax or not, the prediction is the talk of the town.
	   ``I think this is just a rumor or a hoax, but I can't ignore it
and relax,'' said Fariba Ahmadzadeh, a secretary in Tehran who was
planning to go to the city of Mashhad over the weekend with her
family. ``I don't want to have to live in panic, to have nightmares
and be restless.''
	   But who is Minarovjech, and why does he think Tehran is in
trouble?
	   Mohammad Reza Gheitanchi, head of Tehran University's seismology
department, asked the Slovak Embassy about the mysterious Slovak.
	   ``They told me he is 74, has no university education, and is not
affiliated with any institution or scientific center,'' the Iran
daily quoted Gheitanchi as saying.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stock prices rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Tuesday on selling by some Japanese banks and speculators. Tokyo
stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 139.74 yen in early trading, down 0.79 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
140.15 yen overnight.
	   Traders said activity remained in a narrow range as other
players retreated to the sidelines ahead of Japan's upper house
parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   Also slowing down the pace of trading were conflicting reports
about whether the government will propose large-scale income tax
cuts to boost the sluggish economy.
	   On Sunday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto stopped short of
saying that permanent tax cuts would be implemented, reversing
remarks he made last week.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
72.63 points, or 0.44 percent, to 16,423.08 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei index closed down 160.79
points, or 0.97 percent, ending eight straight sessions of gains.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 2.99 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,261.44. The TOPIX
closed down 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, the day before.
	   An overnight advance on Wall Street and the slightly stronger
yen were among positive factors affecting the stock market.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.51 points,
closing at 9,091.77.
	   A stronger yen tends to encourage foreign investors to buy
Japanese stocks as it increases the value of yen-denominated assets
compared with assets in other currencies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.305 percent from Monday's finish of 1.300
percent, driving its price down to 111.15 yen from 111.19 yen.

General Assembly to vote on Palestinian mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Members of the United Nations will vote
Tuesday on an Arab request to upgrade the status of the Palestinian
observer mission that of a non-voting member.
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives could
raise issues of the peace process in the assembly, co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace and have the right of reply. The
representative could not vote or put forward candidates for U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   But more important, a vote in favor of the Palestinians would
affirm international support in the protracted peace process.
	   The resolution was expected to pass. Most resolutions favoring
the Palestinians are routinely approved with huge margins in the
General Assembly, where none of the 185 members has veto power.
	   The United States and Israel, which oppose the move, have asked
to address the assembly before the vote. Russia and Austria, on
behalf of the European Union, will speak afterwards.

Government says unemployment in Japan likely to worsen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's already record high unemployment rate is on
a long-term upward trend, the government said in a report released
Tuesday.
	   Increasing voluntary withdrawal from the job market, a shift
toward part-time work and a rapidly aging population were listed as
factors affecting the outlook, the Labor Ministry's annual ``white
paper'' said.
	   Joblessness, particularly among older males, has risen,
partially as a result of an over-supply of elderly workers, the
report said.
	   It also pointed to the growth of service-related work, which
tends to foster high turnover rates. Also, many young Japanese are
dropping out of the job market entirely, it said.
	   Last month, the government reported that the number of jobless
in May rose to a record high of 2.93 million people. The
unemployment rate remained steady at a record 4.1 percent.

Alleged kidnapper's wife turns herself in to Mexican police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. ADDS 2 grafs at end to UPDATE with arrests of five
men who claimed to be part of Arizmendi gang.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The wife of a leader of Mexico's most feared
kidnapping ring has turned herself in to police and helped them
recover dlrs 1.1 million, the Attorney General's office said.
	   Adriana Suarez Arista is the wife of Aurelio Arizmendi Lopez,
who along with his brother Daniel is accused of running a
high-ransom kidnapping gang known for cutting off the ears of its
victims.
	   She surrendered to police on Sunday, the Attorney General's
office said in a statement.
	   The agency says it now has seized most of the profits that the
kidnapping gang earned over the last three years _ more than dlrs
4.5 million in cash and nearly dlrs 2 million more in property.
	   Police captured Aurelio Arizmendi on June 30 after a shootout
that wounded him in both legs. On Monday, a judge ordered him held
over for trial on weapons charges. He also faces organized crime
and other charges.
	   His brother, allegedly the head of the gang, remains at large.
	   In Morelos state, south of Mexico City, police arrested five men
Monday who allegedly claimed to be part of the Arizmendi gang.
	   Morelos state Attorney General Arturo Estrada Carrillo said the
five threatened to kidnap members of a businessman's family and cut
off their ears unless he paid them 200,000 pesos(dlrs 22,500).

Marshall returns, Lomu axed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black scrum-half Justin
Marshall was restored to New Zealand's test team Tuesday for
Saturday's tri-nations test against Australia.
	   While Marshall was rushed back after just one match since
tearing his Achilles tendon in March, the selectors axed out of
form winger Jonah Lomu and replaced the 1995 World Cup star with
Joeli Viridi.
	   Coach John Hart received a setback in Tuesday morning's session
when center Mark Mayerhofler suffered a hamstring injury and was
forced out of contention.
	   Veteran center Walter Little is still in doubt with a foot
injury and Carlos Spencer has been selected on standby if Little
fails to improve.
	   ``In Walter's case, because he is easily the most experienced
midfielder and because he's very important to us, we might delay
any decision until much later in the week,'' Hart said before
announcing the team.
	   ``He's one player I would take over and wait and see. He's just
got huge experience; when you've lost Frank Bunce, you wouldn't
want to lose Walter Little as well _ he played so well in that
first test with England.
	   ``So if he can be ready by Saturday, then I'm prepared to delay
that decision as long as I have to, even until the day itself.''
	   Hart will take a squad of 24 to Melbourne on Wednesday but will
not finalize his reserves until later in the week.
	   Australia has won all three tests so far this season while New
Zealand swept England 2-0. South Africa is the third team in the
annual round-robin tournament.
	   New Zealand team:
	   Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Scott McLeod, Walter Little or
Carlos Spencer, Joeli Vidiri, Andrew Mehrtens, Justin Marshall,
Taine Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Robin Brooke, Ian Jones,
Michael Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd.

Dinner business growing in volume, complexity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY336 of July 1 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAN SEWELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The aroma of freshly baked bread greets customers
as they enter. A chef draws a long-handled tray from oven flames to
reveal roasted chickens. Display cases are filled with entrees like
salmon with peach dill relish.
	   But the sign at the cash register really tells the story:
	   ``You made dinner like 19 times last year _ three without the
microwave!''
	   This is EatZi's, a restaurant-market that recently opened in
Atlanta's trendy Buckhead section, giving working families another
option for dinner _ ready-to-eat or microwaveable meals.
	   Never have Americans spent so much money _ dlrs 336 billion this
year, according to restaurant industry projections _ or had so many
choices in fulfilling the basic human need to eat. Increasingly,
they're shopping at stores offering prepared meals, or they're
eating at restaurants that provide some atmosphere along with the
menu.
	   Chris Kilkelly, 31, and Wendy Miller, 30, surveyed some of the
offerings at EatZi's: sun-dried tomato couscous, New York strip
steaks, Chilean sea bass, rosemary chicken, twice-baked potatoes.
	   ``We're the type of people who go out to eat a lot,'' Kilkelly
said.
	   He and Ms. Miller are salespeople who work long hours, leaving
little time or inclination to prepare dinner at the end of the day.
Kilkelly has become a regular at EatZi's, a chain that began two
years ago in Texas.
	   EatZi's concept is a festive marketplace offering prepared
entrees, fresh vegetables, cheeses, gourmet groceries, salads and
desserts, mainly for takeout.
	   ``The atmosphere really adds to it, and they have a great
variety of fresh, well-prepared foods,'' Kilkelly said. ``And
price-wise, a meal you might pay dlrs 14 for in a restaurant, you
can get here for dlrs 7.''
	   Atlanta is the third EatZi's location, and the next two are
planned this year in New York. They are the latest product of
Dallas-based Brinker International, whose popular restaurant chains
include Romano's Macaroni Grill, Chili's and Cozymel's.
	   Such casual-dining restaurants are among the fastest growing in
the industry. But EatZi's is geared toward the hottest market:
ready-to-eat meals for home.
	   Four decades after the invention of oven-ready, tri-sectioned TV
dinners, EatZi's is a new version of competition for the home-meal
business.
	   Among factors driving the home-meal growth are budget-conscious
families and people who spend more time at home to enjoy their
entertainment centers or computers. Many working parents are not
only too tired and time-constrained to cook, they don't have the
time or energy to go out to eat.
	   At the same time, they want to get as many errands done in as
little time and with as few stops as possible. So Chevron has begun
offering the stylishly prepared pastas, pesto and pizzas of
Foodini's Fresh Meal Markets alongside its gas stations in
California. And supermarket chains such as Kroger and Publix have
expanded delis that offer hot meals and salad bars for carryout.
	   These outlets are filling a growing need. In metro Atlanta, for
example, nearly half the food dollars are spent on meals prepared
away from home.
	   That has also meant a huge growth in restaurant sales _ but only
for companies that are able to meet consumer demands for something
different.
	   Outback Steakhouse, influenced by ``Crocodile Dundee'' movies
now a decade old, is doing very well. Once-struggling KFC is
growing again after updating the Kentucky Fried Chicken name and
menu.
	   Some fast-food companies are having a hard time sharing in the
boom time. McDonald's is trying to reinvent itself and its kitchens
in hopes of bringing back customers who have tired of its fare.
Long John Silver's, the seafood chain, recently filed for
bankruptcy court protection.
	   Apple South Inc. sells, closes, acquires and opens restaurants
as it tries to keep itself fresh and grab bigger shares of the food
dollar. It squashed Tomato Rumba, an Italian-style chain, in 1996
and is selling off its 264 Applebee's restaurants to concentrate on
faster-growing chains such as Don Pablo's Mexican restaurants.
	   Kirk Kinsell, president of Apple South, is a married 43-year-old
with a son, 13, and daughter, 11. ``I'm my own target audience,''
he said.
	   Industry executives say the home-meal trend doesn't seem to be
hurting restaurants, many of whose carryout businesses are growing.
	   Kinsell has invested in focus groups and research surveys _
still somewhat rare in the narrow-margin restaurant business _ to
guide his strategy.
	   A dlrs 100,000 survey for Don Pablo's showed customer interest
in bigger and better margaritas. After they were improved, the
Mexican cocktails sold so well ``they paid for that study in three
and a half weeks,'' Kinsell recalled.

A company built on useful information
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CUNNIFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Analyst &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GREENWICH, Connecticut (AP) _ By delivering useful, impartial,
sound information in short, clear, graphically arranged articles,
Boardroom Inc. has become the world's largest newsletter publisher.
	   Its Bottom Line Personal, one of six newsletters created by the
privately owned company, has a circulation of 1.6 million copies.
The letters, which appear monthly or twice a month, are read by 2.7
million subscribers.
	   Boardroom arose from the vision of Marty Edelston, a somewhat
rumpled, low-key, ``not very smart'' but intensely curious guy who
distills things to their essence, the better to understand. He's an
original.
	   Newsletters are but one of the products produced by Edelston,
now 69, and a team of about 80 employees. They have published 30
books of factual information. One, ``The Book of Inside
Information,'' sold 3 million copies.
	   The success of Boardroom, whose annual sales recently exceeded
dlrs 100 million, is the envy of corporations seeking, often in
vain, to formulate publications that will sell.
	   Edelston's formula, if it can be so called, has eluded the
efforts of copycats. Part of the original vision when the company
began 26 years ago, it is remarkably simple and has since changed
only in details:
	   _Deliver useful information people need to run their lives. ``A
lot of people need information in a complex world,'' he says. ``And
there are a lot of people with good information.'' Bring them
together.
	   _Seek out those with ``not just good but authoritative''
information, interview many of them, check, report findings clearly
and concisely. Always list sources. Use art and graphics to accent
editorial content.
	   _No advertising.
	   The discipline applies to books and all six newsletters _
personal, health, business, money, taxes and ``Tomorrow.''
	   ``We focus on living,'' he says. ``To live a decent life in an
increasingly hostile world.''
	   Building Boardroom has meant hard work; Edelston can hardly deny
it. At first, he regularly went out on interviews while
simultaneously building circulation, mainly through direct mail. It
meant long hours.
	   Long hours, however, don't bother him because, he explains, his
``job'' is part of a fascinating life. His wife and adult children
work in the same company, but not his same hours, which span 6:30
a.m. to midnight. He hasn't lost a day to illness in 26 years. He
hasn't had a vacation in 15.
	   What comes from all this is generally creative and highly
productive. Asked about Boardroom's success, Barbara Hendra, a
publishing consultant familiar with it, responded instantly:
``Marty Edelston is a marketing genius.''
	   He does not create the impression of genius, and you sense he
really means it when he attributes his success to his staff and a
curiosity about what affects people. Then he hands you a copy of
the book ``I Power.''
	   The concept of I Power, a business system, is Edelston's
creation, as is the book, written with economist, editor and
consultant Marion Buhagiar. As with Boardroom's other products, it
reflects Edelston's quest for simplicity.
	   I Power (the power of the individual, ideas, invention,
ingenuity, innovation _ you get the idea) is a practical method for
encouraging creative employee contribution that might otherwise be
wasted.
	   It doesn't stop there. It then applies the ideas and other
findings to raising productivity, cutting waste and errors, and
improving personal and company growth. I Power, says Edelston,
leads to continual growth.
	   In a way, the system is an antidote for so-called scientific
management theories, which have a tendency to arrive on the scene
with great hoopla, destined soon after to die of their own
unnatural heritage.
	   I Power is based in reality. As you might expect from Edelston,
it returns to common sense, fundamentals and simplicity. It
encourages the flow of ideas from employees, and discourages
top-down management.
	   Edelston isn't modest about the book, saying it ``can easily be
the most important book you have ever read,'' and he credits much
of Boardroom's quickened growth to its implementation and
refinement.
	   He and his staff continue to refine the system as they prepare
for even further growth. He has had offers to sell, but says he
isn't interested. Too much to do, he says. Too much fun.

General Assembly to vote on Palestinian mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background. General Assembly scheduled to meet at
1430 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Palestinians are seeking to upgrade their
U.N. status _ and in the process, their international standing _
through a vote in the General Assembly which is opposed by the
United States and Israel.
	   Arab states sponsored a resolution that would upgrade the
Palestinian observer mission to a new status of a non-voting member
in the 185-member assembly.
	   A vote was scheduled for Tuesday. The United States and Israel
have requested to address the assembly before the tally is taken;
Russia and Austria, on behalf of the European Union, were to make
statements after the vote.
	   Resolutions favoring the Palestinians are routinely approved
with huge margins in the General Assembly, where no member has a
veto, and Tuesday's resolution was expected to pass.
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives could
raise issues of the peace process in the assembly, co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace and have the right of reply. The
representative could not vote or put forward candidates for U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   But more important, a vote in favor of the Palestinians would
affirm international support in the protracted peace process.
	   A draft resolution notes that Palestinians are full members of
the Arab League, the Group of 77 and other regional organizations
and that ``the Palestinian Authority was established on part of the
occupied Palestinian territory.''
	   The United States has argued against the new designation, saying
any U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   Washington has similarly opposed a draft resolution, circulating
in the 15-member Security Council, that would condemn Israel for
its decision to expand Jerusalem and extend some municipal services
to settlements in the West Bank.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution to upgrade
the Palestinians' status to that of a non-voting member.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move and the
resolution was derailed until Arab states resurrected it last
month.

Wealthier countries must aid Asia's recovery: IMF director
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese comment, details on euro, developing
countries asking not to be forgotten. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wealthier countries must support Japan and
other Asian nations by granting new loans and humanitarian aid or
restructuring existing loans, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said.
	   The comments by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus came as
leaders of world economic institutions gathered Monday at the U.N.
Economic and Social Council's annual session. Leaders reiterated
calls for Japan to shore up its banking system and enact strong
economic reforms.
	   Developing countries, such as Benin and Swaziland, pressed
Camdessus and World Bank President James Wolfensohn to remember
that Asian countries are not alone in facing economic turmoil.
	   And European countries asked for reassurance that the Asian
financial crisis wouldn't harm their plans for a common currency.
Camdessus replied that he expected the turmoil would be well behind
by the time the euro is introduced.
	   In addition to urging wealthier countries to help in bail out
Asia's troubled economies, Camdessus called on the affected
countries themselves to improve their own financial management and
preserve the stability of exchange rates.
	   The session was to begin considering the findings of the U.N.
World Economic and Social Survey 1998, which projected that growth
in the dollar value of world exports would fall to about 2.5
percent in 1998 from 2.7 percent last year and 4.3 percent in 1996.
	   The Asian crisis plunged several of the fastest-growing
economies into a severe recession and slowed growth of world output
and trade, the report says.
	   Japan's U.N. representative, Wataru Nishigahiro, said the
government was undertaking several measures to improve Japan's
``economic difficulties.''
	   ``The government of Japan basically recognizes the coordination
to the present Japanese economic situation and the Southeast Asia
financial crisis to a certain extent,'' he said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the session by noting
that the financial turmoil hasn't only affected South Asia, but
countries as far away as Africa, in the form of reduced commodity
prices.
	   ``The crisis has had its most devastating impact on society's
margins: on the poor and vulnerable who are least able to withstand
the sudden loss of jobs,'' said Annan. He called for relief from
debt for poor countries, more humanitarian aid and duty-free
exports for the least-developed countries.

Australian GP stays at Albert Park

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian leg of the formula
one grand prix circuit will stay at Melbourne's Albert Park until
at least 2006.
	   The Victorian state government has exercised its five year
option on the race, which moved from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1996.
	   Tourism Minister Louise Asher said the state had been able to
retain the grand prix despite strong interest from South Australia
which hosted it in Adelaide for 11 years from 1985.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stock prices rise at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning dollar-yen rate, stock and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday
morning amid lingering confusion about whether Japan would cut
taxes. Tokyo stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.07 yen in early trading, down 0.46 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also just below its late New York
rate of 140.15 yen overnight.
	   Trading was subdued amid conflicting reports about whether Japan
will propose large-scale income tax cuts to boost the sluggish
economy.
	   Traders also hesitated to place bets on the dollar's movement
ahead of Japan's upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   Confusion over Japan's tax policy continued Tuesday.
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency Koji Omi told a
small group of reporters that a permanent tax cut is likely.
	   But, also on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi said his
earlier remark that Japan had made a ``promise'' of permanent tax
cuts was a mistake.
	   ``I hadn't checked with the prime minister, and it was a
misstatement,'' Obuchi said.
	   On Friday Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he hoped Japan
would have ``so-called, permanent tax reforms,'' fueling hopes that
the government would implement a major income tax cut to boost
economic growth.
	   Japan has been under pressure from its trading partners to spur
growth and create a market for goods from struggling Asian
economies.
	   But on national television Sunday Hashimoto said tax ``reforms''
didn't necessarily mean an overall tax cut. On Monday a spokesman
for Hashimoto said the prime minister had never promised permanent
tax cuts.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
44.06 points, or 0.27 percent, to close the morning session at
16,394.51 points. On Monday, the Nikkei index closed down 160.79
points, or 0.97 percent, ending eight straight sessions of gains.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 1.76 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,260.21. The
TOPIX closed down 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, the day before.
	   An overnight advance on Wall Street and the slightly stronger
yen were among positive factors affecting the stock market.
Electronics, automobile and banking shares were among the biggest
gainers.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.51 points,
closing at 9,091.77.
	   A stronger yen tends to encourage foreign investors to buy
Japanese stocks as it increases the value of yen-denominated assets
compared with investments in other currencies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.290 percent from Monday's finish of 1.300
percent, nudging its price up to 111.26 yen from 111.19 yen.

Malaysian minister spurns Singapore demand for apology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's tourism minister has
refused to apologize after criticizing Singapore for allegedly
excluding Malaysia from a list of coveted tourist destinations, a
local newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The dispute between the two Southeast Asian neighbors was
sparked last week. Malaysian Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik
alleged a conference organizer in Singapore deliberately excluded
Malaysia from a brochure of countries to be visited by delegates to
an upcoming convention.
	   On Saturday, Singapore's Minister without Portfolio Lim Boon
Heng said Sabbaruddin should apologize for ``totally unwarranted''
comments.
	   ``Why should I apologize?,'' Sabbaruddin was quoted as saying in
Tuesday's Star newspaper. ``The organizers should apologize to
Malaysia for excluding us from their brochure.''
	   Singapore has said the government had no role in the compilation
of the brochure, but Sabbaruddin said he does not believe it was a
simple oversight by convention organizers.
	   ``Sometimes, these things are done on purpose,'' he was quoted
as saying.
	   The Rotary Convention, due to meet in Malaysia next year, had
offered travel for its members attending the conference to several
destinations around the region before and after the event.
	   Malaysia had allegedly been named only as a possible _ not a
preferred _ tourist destination for convention participants.
	   Tourists, residents and huge amounts of capital and trade flow
in both directions across Malaysia and Singapore, but their
relations are sometimes strained.

Cojuangco named new chairman of San Miguel Corp.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
on Tuesday regained his seat as chairman and chief executive
officer of San Miguel Corp., 12 years after he was booted out of
the Philippines' largest food and beverage conglomerate.
	   Cojuangco, who lost his post after the ``people power'' revolt
against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was named San Miguel
chairman at a special board meeting.
	   The company's former chairman, Andres Soriano III, and four
other board members stepped down July 2 to give way to a new
management.
	   Of nine board members present during the special meeting, eight
voted for Cojuangco. One board member, a government representative,
was absent.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   Cojuangco's take over came just a week after new-elected
President Joseph Estrada assumed office. Formerly a close associate
of strongman Marcos, Cojuangco is now one of the top leaders of
Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party.
	   Cojuangco's appointment is expected to speed the resolution of
an arduous ownership battle for San Miguel's shares, 47 percent of
which were impounded by the government after the 1986 revolt. The
move came amid allegations the shares were illegally acquired by
Marcos' allies.
	   The shares in question comprise Cojuangco's 20 percent stake,
estimated to be worth 23 billion pesos (dlrs 561 million), and a 27
percent share of the government-sequestered United Coconut Planters
Bank's, which was controlled by Cojuangco under Marcos.
	   Prior to the announcement, San Miguel's shares were flat in
early trading. The news of Cojuangco's take over caused share
prices to dip slightly.
	   Traders attributed the decline to a sell-on-news play after San
Miguel's stock had risen since Soriano's departure last Thursday.
Some investors were reportedly unhappy with Soriano's leadership of
the company.

Protestants, Catholics share anger over ruling in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to ADD context, details on rioting. &QL; 
 &UR; With ANALYSIS-Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Outraged Protestant mobs
battled police across Northern Ireland for a second straight night,
ignoring a government panel's decision permitting an upcoming march
through a hostile Roman Catholic neighborhood.
	   In the province's most serious violence since an April peace
agreement, rioters angered by a ban on a separate Protestant march
that began Sunday, blocked roads with burning cars and lobbed
gasoline bombs and rocks.
	   The turmoil Monday night came despite repeated appeals from
leaders of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's conservative
Protestant brotherhood, for people to demonstrate peacefully
against the ban imposed Sunday on the march through Portadown.
	   Earlier Monday, the Northern Ireland Parades Commission admitted
that its decision to permit a Protestant march in Belfast's Lower
Ormeau section took into account widespread anger over the ongoing
blockade of the separate and bigger march in Portadown.
	   ``This isn't justice. This is obviously just giving in to Orange
pressure and trying to buy off the mob in Portadown,'' said former
Irish Republican Army prisoner Gerard Rice, who is leading
opposition to the Lower Ormeau march.
	   The July 13 march by several hundred Orangemen would be the
first Protestant parade allowed past Lower Ormeau's eight hard-line
Catholic side streets in more than a year. Rice refused to say
whether Catholics would try to block Ormeau Road, as they have done
since 1995, in defiance of the commission's ruling.
	   Despite the Belfast decision, Protestants who were determined to
overturn the ban on the march in Portadown, 30 miles (48
kilometers) southwest of Belfast, protested and rioted.
	   Thugs hijacked and set fire to a bus and two cars in Craigavon,
Portadown's neighbor.
	   Soon Orangemen and other Protestants formed human blockades on
several main Belfast roads and Shaftesbury Square, where youths
began bombarding riot police with stones and bricks. As darkness
fell, billowing clouds of smoke from burning cars could be seen at
several points along the skyline.
	   In the most serious violence since the standoff began, police
came under gunfire in Belfast, but no one was injured, police said.
	   In religiously polarized west Belfast, rival mobs of Protestants
and Catholics threw rocks, bricks and bottles at each other over
the high fencing that separates their two neighborhoods.
	   In north Belfast, about 30 Protestant youths hurled gasoline
bombs at a police station and a makeshift grenade at passing
armored car. A grenade detonated beside a passing armored patrol on
north Belfast's Shore Road.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of any casualties or arrests
in connection with Monday night's riots. Police said they arrested
about 30 people during the first night's rioting in Belfast,
Londonderry and smaller towns. A police inspector's skull was
fractured by a mob burning a car near Londonderry.
	   More than 1,000 Protestants poured into Hillsborough, one of
Northern Ireland's prettiest villages and the official home of the
British Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam.
	   Outside Portadown's rural Drumcree Anglican church, where their
march has been blocked since midday Sunday, Orangemen and their
supporters pitched tents and had picnics behind the army's
barricades of barbed wire and trenches.
	   The crowd, which fluctuated from a few hundred to more than
1,000, cheered as Orangemen thumped massive drums and blasted
traditional Protestant tunes over a public address system _
christened ``Radio Orange'' _ in the direction of nearby Garvaghy
Road.
	   Catholic residents along that road have tried to block the
annual march since 1995, setting the scene for a confrontation that
has triggered violence across Northern Ireland for three
consecutive years.
	   David Trimble, the embattled Protestant head of Northern
Ireland's new cross-community government established under the
April peace agreement, warned that the crisis ``could put at risk
all the political progress we have achieved.''
	   Trimble, himself an Orangeman, is having to toe a more
conciliatory line in public _ and is being lambasted by Orangemen
as a traitor because of it.
	   July 12 is a national holiday in Northern Ireland, when
Orangemen commemorate an important Protestant military victory over
Catholics in 1690. Most parades are being postponed until Monday
because the holiday falls on a Sunday.

All-Star games serves up attitude with altitude
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Griffey winning HR derby. &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ What's going to stop Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey
Jr., Juan Gonzalez and the real sluggers from knocking a ball into
neighboring Wyoming state when they bring a longball attitude to
the All-Star altitude?
	   ``I think I have a vision of a high-scoring game,'' AL starter
David Wells of the New York Yankees said Monday, ``but hopefully
not when I'm in there.''
	   Just in case, he's got a strategy for pitching in Denver _
``Duck!''
	   Clearly, home runs are in the forecast for Tuesday night's game.
	   In a year that Roger Maris' record of 61 is in danger, fans are
no doubt hoping to see a repeat of the 1971 game when future Hall
of Famers Reggie Jackson, Hank Aaron, Johnny Bench, Roberto
Clemente, Frank Robinson and Harmon Killebrew all connected at
Tiger Stadium.
	   Same might come true at Coors.
	   ``It's a great hitter's ballpark,'' said McGwire, leading the
big leagues with 37 homers.
	   Proving his point, McGwire hit a 510-foot (155-meter) drive in
Monday's home run derby. But he didn't win the contest _ Griffey, a
surprise participant, wound up beating Jim Thome for the honor.
	   After saying for a month he would not take part, Griffey, booed
in batting practice, put himself in the lineup and bested nine of
baseball's other big boppers.
	   ``I felt if I felt good in BP (batting practice), I'd be in it.
I don't like to get booed. I've got 4 million reasons to do it,''
said Griffey, the top vote-getter in fan balloting for All-Star
starting spots.
	   Home runs, however, are not the only way to score at Coors, even
though more balls flew out of the field than any other stadium in
both 1996 and 1997.
	   ``You have to realize that Coors Field has a gigantic outfield
where balls will fall in,'' McGwire said. ``Normal singles in most
ballparks will be doubles if you have speed.''
	   Pitching at Coors, meanwhile, presents all sorts of problems.
	   ``Slider don't slide as much, curve don't curve as much,'' NL
starter Greg Maddux of Atlanta said.
	   Maddux, a four-time Cy Young winner, knows from first-hand
experience. In three starts at Coors, he's allowed 14 earned runs
in 18 1-3 innings.
	   ``I think probably one of the biggest things is the outfielders
have to play a little bit deeper and you always give up the extra
base on a base hit,'' he said. ``Instead of runners at first and
second, it's always first and third.''
	   Which is fine with NL batting champion Tony Gwynn.
	   ``I think most people expect to see some home runs, some
hitting, some high-powered offense,'' the San Diego outfielder
said. ``But there might not be. This game is really based on
pitching. If the pitchers are throwing the ball good, it could be
2-1, 3-2.
	   ``If they're getting the ball up, that's going to be the key. If
they get the ball up in this ballpark, you don't have to hit it
good to get it out. You don't have to hit it good to get a base
hit,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people will be watching this.''
	   The NL leads the series 40-27-1, and the highest-scoring game
came in 1954 when the AL won 11-9. There have been at least two
homers in each of the last seven games.
	   Remember, though, what happened the last time all the attention
was on offense at the All-Star game. It was 1987, the year of the
lively ball and home runs by the bunch.
	   That season, with Mike Schmidt and Andre Dawson and a rookie
named McGwire playing, the game was scoreless until the 13th
inning.
	   Then again, watching McGwire and his buddies take batting
practice _ in a light rain, no less _ it looks like it might be a
busy night for the scoreboard operator.
	   And a fun night for those who get to watch. Like Chicago Cubs
outfielder Sammy Sosa, who has 33 home runs but is sidelined by a
bad shoulder.
	   ``The way that Griffey swings, that's something that's
natural,'' Sosa said. ``Almost the same with Mark.''
	   ``Myself, I'm crazy. I'm swinging the bat all the way,'' he
said. ``If I'm not swinging the bat hard, I think I've been
cheating myself.''
