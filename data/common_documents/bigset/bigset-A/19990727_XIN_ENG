<HEADLINE> Regional Communications Workshop Opens in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Third African Communications
Regional Workshop aimed at dismystifying communications
technological language and improving satellite and other
frequency-based communication system in the region opened here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the workshop Lemba Nyirenda said in an interview
with reporters that the aim of the workshop was to come up with
resolutions that would help to bridge the gap between technology
designers and the users.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the language used in technology and
communications was too complex for an ordinary person to
understand and efficiently apply it.
</P>
<P>
Nyirenda said the knowledge acquired in universities and
colleges in the fields of communication technology should be
simplified in a way that people with low education could also
understand.
</P>
<P>
He said the participants would come up with ways of translating
 difficult technical language into an easy information package
that could assist the consumers and retailers to use the machines
and other technical tools without a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
The workshop coordinator, Anthony Ngoma, said earlier that the
event would accrue some economic advantages to the region in
general and Zambia in particular.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop would focus on the research findings on
the status of weather patterns in the region, which has for some
time been incorrectly deduced.
</P>
<P>
The research has proved that the weather patterns in the
region, specifically that of Zambia, Uganda and Tanzania, which
has been wrongly classified by the International
Telecommunications Union in terms of amount of rainfall received,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator said Zambia would economically benefit from the
 correction in that communication equipment since satellites would
now work more efficiently as they would be made according to the
right weather patterns obtaining in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the companies represented at the five-day workshop are
Zambia Telecommunications Authority, Telecel, Zamcel and other
telecommunication companies and some government departments.

<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Museums and Monuments
of Zimbabwe in conjunction with the French island of La Reunion is
set to soon establish a scientific and technological museum in the
resort town of Victoria Falls of west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The museum would be run along the same lines as the Volcano
museum in La Reunion, which focuses on the scientific explanations
about the island's active volcano.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Volcano museum Phillipe Dupont told the
Zimbabwe News Agency in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city,
Monday that the Victoria Falls initiative would center around the
Falls as the central theme.
</P>
<P>
He said the museum would focus on aspects such as water as a
natural element, the rain forest, human and historical content,
the development of art and craft, and environmental protection
among other points of focus.
</P>
<P>
"We envisage the museum to serve as a window for the
development and promotion of the Victoria Falls, and the
partnership and cooperation that will be fostered between Zimbabwe
and La Reunion will be extremely profitable for both countries,"
said Dupont.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's National Campaign Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Monday launched a new national campaign against the
childhood disease polio, calling upon the people to participate in
the drive.
</P>
<P>
With the great efforts made by the Mozambican government,
polio cases are rarely reported in the southern African country,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that as in the previous year, all the 3.3 million
children under the age of five years are expected to be vaccinated
this year.
</P>
<P>
The anti-polio drive will be carried out in two stages: the
first from July 26 to 30, and the second from August 30 to
September 3.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, some children will also be vaccinated
against measles, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the 41st Congress of the World Health Organization in May
1988, the Mozambican government promised it would wipe out polio
in the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The polio cases reported had dropped from 60 in 1980 to four in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Readiness of SADC Free Trade Accord Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Chamber of
Business said Monday it would present a memorandum to the
government outlining its concerns on the proposed Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said its members had for some time expressed "grave
concern" at the desire on the part of the South African government
to ratify and implement the agreement before important
fundamentals are in place.
</P>
<P>
While it recognized and supported the importance of economic
integration for the region, the chamber questioned "the soundness
of ratifying such an agreement in the absence of, inter alia,
customs and effective border control systems which are vital to
contain potential abuse and fraud."
</P>
<P>
It added that many problems were presently being experienced
with cross-border abuses within the Southern African Customs Union
(Sacu) which stemmed from inadequate trans-national mechanisms
with limited powers to deal with abuses.
</P>
<P>
"This serious defect is demonstrated by the apparent inability
of South Africa to upgrade and strengthen its very own border
control systems and to ensure that the present Sacu agreement is
honored," it said.
</P>
<P>
the Sacu groups South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Among the areas of concern are: The lack of cooperation and
enforcement of valuation procedures of imports for duty and VAT,
and the shortage of staff and support to handle anti-dumping
issues, as far as SADC applications are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The South African Chamber of Business would like to see a
special court created to handle commercial offenses and the
up-grading of both South Africa's domestic capability and that of
the SADC to police cross-border trade abuses.
</P>
<P>
"Unless our government grasps the seriousness of these
potential negative economic effects, the benefits of an FTA (free
trade agreement) will be dissipated and undermine the already
brittle business fabric in South Africa," said the chamber.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges U.N. Meeting on Killing of Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has demanded
that the U.N. Security Council meet on measures for the protection
of all nationalities in Kosovo, a Serbian province of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by charge d'affaires of its Permanent
Mission to the United Nations Vladislav Jovanovic in a letter
dated July 24 to the council president, Malaysia's Ambassador Agam
Hasmy.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, distributed as a council document on Monday,
Jovanovic said the killing of 14 Serbs in a village of Kosovo last
Friday is the "most ruthless" in a series of atrocities that the
armed gangs of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
committed against the non-Albanians recently.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "is duty-bound to take all necessary
measures" to "put an end to the ethnic cleansing of the
non-Albanian population", the Yugoslav diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been instructed by my Government to request you to
urgently convene a meeting of the Security Council to adopt
necessary measures to ensure the full protection of the Serbian,
Montenegrin, Roma and other non-Albanian populations of Kosovo and
Metohija and the full implementation of Security Council
resolution 1244 (1999) and the military agreement," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
Attached to the letter is a statement by the Yugoslav
leadership calling for the immediate arrest of criminal groups who
killed the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Kosovo special
representative Bernard Kouchner issued a statement Saturday on his
behalf saying that he "expects an urgent and relentless
investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice without delay".

<HEADLINE> Meeting for DRC Rebels Going on in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, which entered
the fifth day on Monday, is aimed at persuading the rebels to
choose a leader to endorse the Lusaka peace accord to end the
11-month-old strife in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete remained mum about the meeting, with a
top official revealing that it is still going on.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be identified, said that the
meeting even prevented the ministry from presenting its budget
estimates before the National Assembly in the central city Dodoma
in time.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry had planned to table its budget estimates
for the 1999/2000 fiscal year on Tuesday but has been forced to
postpone the date to July 30 to give way to diplomatic efforts to
resolve the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda are assisting
Tanzanian foreign minister Kikwete, who chairs the closed-door
meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a joint communique(&AMP; will be made public when the
meeting is over. At present, he said, only the foreign minister
can comment on any progress.
</P>
<P>
Six African governments involved in the war signed a cease-fire
 agreement on July 10 in Zambian capital Lusaka. However, rebels
refused to sign following a leadership wrangle.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who is based in the third largest city
of of Kisangani in northeast Congo (K) and represents a faction of
the main rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), has arrived in
Dar es Salaam for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Congolese Liberation Movement
(MLC) who occupies several northern towns, and Emile Ilunga, who
deposed dia Wamba as head of the RCD, have also sent
representatives to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda backs Ilunga, who is based in Goma town in eastern
Congo, while Uganda supports the MLC. Zambia, which has been
leading the mediation efforts, is trying to solve differences
between Ugandan and Rwandan-backed factions.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Leader Optimistic for Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Monday said he is encouraged that the Middle East peace process
is moving forward since Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took
office in early July.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks while addressing a joint press
conference with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel after their
meeting in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is time to stop talking about pessimism over
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic" about the Arab-Israeli peace talks,
Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who visited Israel and the Palestinian self-areas
earlier this month, called the peace process "a golden opportunity
that should not be missed."
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains close ties with Egypt and has a growing
political and military relationship with Israel despite suspicions
among Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Middle East peace talks stagnated under former hard-line
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There has been renewed
optimism since the election of Barak, who has vowed to push
forward with the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who paid a one-day visit to Alexandria, also
discussed with Mubarak ways of promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the summit meeting, the two countries signed eight
agreements on cooperation in trade, energy, crime-fighting,
agriculture, health and political consultations.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also visited an Egyptian project to build a world-class
library in Alexandria, once the home to one of the greatest
libraries of the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president donated to the project 2,000 books on
subjects ranging from Turkish archaeology to Ottoman and Islamic
history.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
returned home Monday afternoon from a two-day working visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Museveni, together with his host President
Benjamin Mkapa, attended the Heroes' Day ceremonies held in Mleba
district near Uganda border Sunday, a press release from the
President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the two presidents have probably
discussed the cease-fire agreement signed by the six warring
nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The DRC rebels have not signed on the agreement due to a
dispute over which group will sign on the accord on behalf of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, together with Rwanda, has been backing the rebels who
took up arms early last August to oust Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that during the talks, Mkapa has urged Museveni
to persuade the Congolese rebels to ink the pact on the cease-fire
in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The Heroes' Day ceremonies in Tanzania were carried out in
remembrance of the fallen Tanzanian soldiers who died 20 years ago
during the struggle to eject Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's forces of
occupation out of Tanzanian territories.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni reportedly visited some schools in Tanzania
and donated some money to those schools.
</P>
<P>
He was received at Kololo airstrip by Minister in charge of the
 Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda and other senior Ugandan officials.

JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
rand Monday ended weaker against the U.S. dollar as the bond

</P>
<P>
The rand was last traded at 6.1335 per dollar Monday, compared

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is working
on modalities to decentralize the supply of inputs so as to boost
agriculture in the country, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lusaka Province Minister Sonny Mulenga as
saying during the opening of the 19th Provincial and Agriculture
Show over the weekend that transport costs would be eliminated if
inputs were taken close to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga also encouraged peasants to concentrate on growing
traditional crops to ensure food security.
</P>
<P>
He said small-scale farmers who grow 75 percent of maize in the
country should take agriculture as a business if they are to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for small-scale farmers to form
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga said very few farmers have taken advantage of the
Cooperatives Act which was introduced in Parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
He further reaffirmed the government's commitment to supporting
small- scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the show chairman Duncan Chataya disclosed that the
1998/1999 agricultural season is expected to produce close to
100,000 tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
He attributed lower production to the late supply of inputs by
the Food Reserve Agency of the country.

UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. humanitarian agencies
on Monday urged donors to continue funding their work in the
countries of south-eastern Europe affected especially by the
Kosovo war, according to a press release issued in New York.
</P>
<P>
The agencies, including U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), U.N. Development Program (UNDP), U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF), U.N. Office for the Coordinations of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA) and several others, said over 500 million U.S.
dollars have been raised for the Balkans this year.
</P>
<P>
But some 290 million dollars are needed for the rest of the
year in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis, in addition to 144
million dollars to fund other relief work for those affected by
earlier Balkan wars such as the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday brushed aside the claim
by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the presence of
Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Terming Ecevit's remarks as "baseless," Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the PKK case is a
domestic issue of Turkey, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to stress that attributing domestic problems of
Turkey to the Islamic Republic of Iran would not help good
neighborliness and all-out expansion of relations between the two
neighboring countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said recently that Iran has taken over the role
formerly played by Syria in supporting and harboring the PKK, but
he stressed that Turkey wants to resolve with Iran through
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
"We never wish that the tension between Turkey and Iran leads
to a heated confrontation," the Turkish Daily News Monday quoted
Ecevit as saying. "But it is a fact that after Syria halted its
support of the PKK to a certain extent, Iran took over Syria's
role."
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels has been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984 for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The conflicts
between the rebels and government forces have claimed some 37,000
lives.

policy to reduce inflation which stands at 55.2 percent must be

immediate correction.

availability of funds, said the central bank.

<P>
Meanwhile, price stability continued to be its main objective

the United Nations Resolution 425 and condemned the Israeli
occupation of Lebanese land," Geremek told reporters after meeting
with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after the first Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1978, calls for a unconditional Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the former Israeli government led by Benjamin
Netanyahu endorsed the 20-year resolution, but conditioned the
withdrawal on a Lebanese government's security guarantee against
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria rejected the offer, asking Israel to
implement the resolution without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Geremek expressed the hope that Arabs and Israeli politicians
shift their eyes from the past to the future, where he believes
there are opportunities for the resumption of the stalled peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Polish foreign minister, who arrived
here Monday morning on a two-day visit, also held talks with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Following meeting with Hoss, Geremek and Lebanese Finance
Minister George Korom signed an agreement to avoid double
taxation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Greece Stresses Importance of Dialogue With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday stressed the
importance of its present dialogue with neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the need for communication between
Greece and Turkey was critical. The talks provided a chance to
examine Turkish intentions, he added.
</P>
<P>
While saying that the procedures getting under way Monday were
difficult and stubborn, he said that Greece must be flexible and
calm.
</P>
<P>
If these talks were successful, then it would be to the
advantage of both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that any negative development that might
rise would be born by Turkey because this time it was Greece which
had chose to move and not third parties.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that Greece would not to discuss with
Turkey issues concerning the country's sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis Monday
expressed his displeasure at the recent Turkish provocations in
the Aegean Sea as a Greek-Turkish dialogue was getting under way
in Ankara, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue got underway in Ankara Monday between senior foreign
ministry officials of Greece and Turkey in a bid to improve the
strained bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, which was agreed on early this month between
Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers George Papandreou and Ismail
Cem, will focus on bilateral cooperation in the fields of
commerce, environmental protection and tourism.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, the dialogue will be switched to
Athens, where both sides will discuss cooperation between the two
countries on combating organized crime, illegal immigration,
drugs, terrorism and culture.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have
been strained over decades for their disputes in the territorial
waters, air space limits, the delimitation of the continental
shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> ARF to Develop Forum Process Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
Monday decided to develop the evolving process of the forum at a
"comfortable pace."
</P>
<P>
In the chairman's statement issued at the end of the 6th ARF,
participants at the 6th ARF stressed that the process of the forum
will be developed "at a pace that is comfortable to all
participants."
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitment to make decisions by
consensus which they said "has contributed to steady progress
being made."
</P>
<P>
The ARF was attended by foreign ministers from the 22 ARF
members, including the 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) member countries, their 10 dialogue partners, Mongolia
and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The ministers emphasized the importance of "confidence
building," the first phase in the ARF's process, to the success of
the ARF and encouraged the further development of confidence
building measures.
</P>
<P>
They decided to discuss the concept and principles of
"preventive diplomacy," the second phase, before they may consider
moving into it from the current first phase.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will be preparing the draft paper on the concept and
principles of preventive diplomacy for discussion among ARF
members.
</P>
<P>
"The ARF is a framework for political and security dialogue and
cooperation in the region and that its discussions and activities
should be focused on issues which would have significant impact on
regional security," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the ARF would maintain its
evolutionary approach as the process progresses from confidence
building to preventive diplomacy and, as an eventual goal, the
elaboration of approaches to conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners includes China, Japan, Russia, the
European Union and the United States, among others.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Emergency Food Airlifted to Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Monday airlifted 501 tons of food to the capitals of
the central provinces of Huambo and Bie where the war pit the
Angolan government troops against the UNITA rebels fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Maria Flyn, spokeswoman for WFP office in Luanda, said the
humanitarian situation in the two provincial capitals, Huambo and
Kuito, is "worrisome" and that the WFP is providing assistance "as
more as possible."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman noted that there are 230,00 and 170,000
refugees in Huambo and Kuito respectively while war-created
refugees are found in all provincial capitals around this southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
In northern city of Malanje where the most fierce fightings are
going on, there are some 100,000 refugees, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Flyn said that the WFP can only afford to help 500,000
to 600, 000 refugees because it doesn't produce grain and edible
oil and only distributes materials received from international
donors.
</P>
<P>
Just on Sunday, Angolan Minister of Social Assistance and
Resettlement Albino Malungo complained that the funds donated by
the international community "is only a grain of sand in the
desert", noting that the 1.7 million refugees in Angola need some
200 million U.S. dollars in relief.
</P>
<P>
Flyn also announced that the 10,000 tons of maize donated by
the European Union arrived in Angola Saturday.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
Monday presented letters of credence to Lieutenant Colonel
Ebenezer Anku-Tsede as High Commissioner-designate to Sierra
Leone, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the peace accord signed in Togolese capital Lome
last month by the Sierra Leonean government and the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), Rawlings said: "If the accord is going to
improve the situation in Sierra Leone, let us see it."
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the rebels were given four cabinet and four
deputy ministerial posts. And their leader Foday Sankoh has the
rank of vice- president and chairs a commission, which controls
Sierra Leone's mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
During the war, the rebels were reputed to have carried out
brutalities that included amputations, burning, summary
executions, thus drawing condemnation from the international
community.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Surge to New Record in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of existing homes
jumped 10.6 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 5.53 million units, the highest level ever, the National
Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The big jump in sales in June followed two consecutive monthly
declines. In May, existing-home sales fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5 million units. And in April, sales
dropped to 5.25 million units after hitting what was then an
all-time high of 5.42 million units in March.
</P>
<P>
June's recorded performance was better than projections by many
analysts, who expected sales of 5.11 million units last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mortgage interest rates in June were at the highest
level in two years. According to Freddie Mac, the mortgage
company, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was
7.55 percent in June, up from 7.15 percent in May, as compared to
7 percent in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Association said that existing home sales were up all parts
of the country last month. But the biggest gains in sales were in
the Northeast, rising 11.1 percent to an annual rate of 700,000
units.
</P>
<P>
The Association's report follows a government report last week
that construction of new homes and apartments fell sharply in June
to the lowest level in just over a year.
</P>
<P>
Economists blamed that performance on rising mortgage rates and
a shortage of skilled workers and some building materials, and
suggested it was a sign that one of the economy's booming sectors
could be cooling off.
</P>
<P>
The Association also said the national median sales price for
existing homes rose 4.3 percent to 137,000 dollars in June over
June 1998.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Day of Bangladeshi Opposition Road March Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The second day of Bangladesh's
opposition alliance's road march ended peacefully on Monday amid
fresh calls for mid-term elections, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a series of public meetings on Monday, the second of
the three-day march of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in
northern Bangladesh's Mymensingh and Sherpur districts, BNP
Chairperson and leader of the Opposition in Parliament Khaleda Zia
asked people to prepare to join the next "Dhaka Chalo" (Dhaka
siege) program to force the government to quit from power.
</P>
<P>
This would overthrow the government "through action programs"
including sieges and strikes, she said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of failing to fulfill its pre-election
pledges and increasing the prices of agricultural input such as
fertilizers and seeds, she said the farmers were being deprived of
the just prices of their produce, and their bones had been broken
due to the wrong policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
Former president and chairman of the Jatiya Party (JP) Hussain
Muhammad Ershad also called for a mass movement to unseat the
present government. "There is no alternative to removing the
present government to save the country and free the people," he
told a public meeting in the southern Barisal district on Monday,
the second day of JP's four-day march.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition -- the
BNP, the JP, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (IJO),
started on Sunday their second road march this year to different
corners of the country to intensify the anti-government agitation.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed at protesting what they said the ruling
Awami League's misrule, corruption, repression, subservient
foreign policy and activities against national interests, as well
as the power crisis, deteriorating law and order situation, and
spiraling prices of essentials.
</P>
<P>
The BNP began its march from Dhaka to northern Mymensingh
district, the JP its "launch procession" from the capital to
Barisal, south Bangladesh, the Jamaat its three-day march from
Bogra district, 170 kilometers northwest of here, to the western
district of Chapainawabganj, and IOJ a two-day march from Dhaka to
southeastern Chittagong district.
</P>
<P>
The alliance staged similar road marches in mid-May this year
to whip up a campaign against the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Le Quang Dao, president of the
Presidium of the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VNFF) Central
Committee, died in Hanoi on July 24, 1999 of illness at the age of
78.
</P>
<P>
This was announced on Monday in a special communique by the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee, the National
Assembly, the president and the Government of Vietnam and the VNFF
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The special communique says that "Le Quang Dao has made
numerous great contributions to the party and the nation's
revolution" during more than 60 years of participation in
revolutionary activities.
</P>
<P>
"Dao's demise is a great loss to the Communist Party, the state
and people of Vietnam," it says.
</P>
<P>
The CPV Central Committee, the National Assembly, the president
and the government and the VNFF Central Committee declared Tuesday
and Wednesday as state mourning days during which national flags
will be flown at half-mast and all entertainment, cultural and
sports activities will be suspended throughout the country.
Memorial and funeral services will be held in Hanoi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

province of Bac Ninh. He joined the revolution at the age of 17,
taking part in the democratic youth and the Indochinese
anti-imperialist youth movements. He was admitted into the
Indochinese Communist Party, now the CPV, in 1940.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Territory and Sovereignty Not Allowed to Separate: People's Daily Commentator (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A People's Daily commentary to be
published tomorrow points out that Chinese territory and
sovereignty can not be separated.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui openly publicized his "Two-States" statement
through the foreign media, the article says, exposing his real
ambition to split Chinese territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Widely condemned for his separatist remarks, Lee still goes his
own way trying to split Taiwan from the motherland. Lee's theory
is accepted by some separatists in the island, who attempt to turn
the "Two-States" theory into the policy of Taiwan, and intend to
amend the constitution according to the theory, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lee has been engaged in promoting Taiwan independence for a
long time, and is deliberately planning to split Taiwan from the
motherland, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
"But it was never before done so openly or boldly. This time
his open remarks that relations between Taiwan and the mainland
should be dealt with on a "State-to-State" basis shed his mask,
exposing his attempt at Taiwan independence," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this time Lee again made the mistake of wishful
thinking that the world would go along with his theory and make
Taiwan an international issue, thereby seeking an excuse for
intervention by international forces. Although the world is not
peaceful at present, peace and development are still the general
trend.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Bankers Urged to Build Risk Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Ethiopia,
central bank of the country, Monday called on local banks to
develop an effective risk management mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Opening a training program for commercial bankers and bank
supervisors in Addis Ababa, Governor of the central bank Teklewold
Atinafu said that competitive and volatile banking environment
poses great risk to the sector.
</P>
<P>
loans and advances constitute, on average, over 52 percent of
total assets of banks in Ethiopia, Teklewold said, adding that
more than 75 percent of the total income of banks comes from
interest earned on loans and advances.
</P>
<P>
"Loans and advances are the primary sources of bank profits.
At the same time, they can be the single most important causes of
bank failures in this country unless they are properly managed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that Ethiopia had introduced far-reaching
changes in the banking sector after it embarked on a comprehensive
economic and structural reform in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Pegues, senior banking sector specialist with the
World Bank, said that lack of transparency, weak credit
management, and unsound supervision were some of the causes of the
recent financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The training is directed to avoid such problems and to create
common framework among bankers in Ethiopia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian central bank organized the four-day training on
credit risk management in collaboration with the World Bank.
About 25 participants from government and private banks
participated in the training, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The training aims at identifying and meeting the
capacity-building needs of the financial sector in Ethiopia as
required by the on-going economic reform program.

Although Lee and his followers claim they have not changed
their policy toward the mainland, and intend to further promote
talks and negotiations across the Taiwan Straits, their self-
contradictory words just do not hold water, the article continues.
</P>
<P>
The article says a complete analysis of Lee Teng-hui's past
remarks and activities have shown that Lee is a sophist who uses
specious words to cover his true nature as a deep-rooted
separatist.
</P>
<P>
"Sophism just will not save Lee Teng-hui, nor can the will for
unity among the Chinese people at home and abroad be undermined.
The only way for Lee Teng-hui is to immediately stop separatist
activities, abandon the 'Two-States' statement, and resume the
policy of adhering to the 'One China' principle," the article
concludes.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Forum Hopes For Stable Ties Among Major Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the grouping's
dialogue partners Monday expressed the concern that the relations
among the major powers in the Asia-Pacific were affected by events
in other regions, including that in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, attending a regional security forum in
Singapore, said that stable relations among the major powers were
an integral element underpinning regional stability.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers recognized that the state of relations among the
major powers in the Asia-Pacific was affected by events in other
regions," said the chairman's statement issued at the end of the
6th meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the statement said, the foreign ministers
discussed the Kosovo crisis and the developments in Yugoslavia,
and were concerned with the events' wider implications.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers welcomed the regular exchanges
of visits between the major powers, including those at the
leadership level, which have contributed to their stable
relations.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also stressed the importance of the major powers
continuing to promote dialogue and cooperation among themselves
through all available modalities, including the ARF.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's 11-week air strikes against Yugoslavia, the ministers
expressed their deep regret over the loss of thousands of innocent
lives and reaffirmed their support for the U.N. Charter and
respect for the basic principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed their deep regret over the U.S.
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in early May and
extended their sympathy and condolences to the Chinese people and
the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 members, the grouping's 10 dialogue partners
including China, Russia, Japan and the United States, and Mongolia
and Papua New Guinea were represented at the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Participants also discussed the security implications of the
regional economic and financial crisis, which had a significant
economic, political and security impact on the region.
</P>
<P>
They said the ARF should continue to pay attention to the
security implications of the crisis. The ASEAN region's economy is
beginning to recover, but continued restructuring and policy
reform would be needed to sustain the recovery, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed trans-boundary problems that could
have a significant impact on regional security, the statement
said. The illegal accumulation of small arms and light weapons
have posed a threat to peace and security in many regions and the
international community should focus its attention on this
problem, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers voiced concern over the problem of piracy in the
region and said cooperative approaches are needed to deal with it.

<HEADLINE> IMF Board to Discuss Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Monday said it will hold its board meeting on aid to
Zimbabwe on August 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
IMF Director for Africa Goodall Gondwe told the Zimbabwe News
Agency Ziana in a telephone interview from Washington that the IMF
staff had proposed that the board give Zimbabwe 200 million U.S.
dollars over the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It was not a board decision but the IMF staff which
made the proposal to the board which will consider this request.
The 212 million U. S. dollars was supposed to be for three years
but this 200 million U.S. dollars is for 14-months."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail reported on July 18 that the IMF had finally
agreed to disburse 200 million U.S. dollars over the next 14
months starting in two weeks' time under a new balance of payments
support agreement.
</P>
<P>
It said all outstanding issues had now been resolved between
the IMF and the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe said, "The biggest thing that has happened is that
Zimbabwe and ourselves have agreed on a program which we are to
take to the board. Zimbabwe and the IMF staff hope this is going
to be approved."
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would not get the whole amount at once and
expressed the hope that the amount approved would be released
almost immediately after the board meeting.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of the funds would put an end to an almost
two-year wait by Zimbabwe to receive the much needed balance of
payments support expected to shore up the country's ailing
economy, strengthen the local currency and unlock more than 300
million U.S. dollars support from other international donors.

<HEADLINE> UK to Lose EU influence outside Euro: de Silguy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain risks losing influence in
the European Union because of its reluctance to join the euro, the
outgoing European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de
Silguy told a news conference in London on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The euro is changing the dynamics of Europe...and can create
risks to UK influence as the euro has political consequences,"
Reuters quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price for the UK of staying outside the euro would increase
with time, and the pound was becoming "a satellite to a much
larger euro," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was a risk of a two-speed Europe, with those countries in
the euro gaining momentum, with a strengthening in particular of a
Franco-German axis, according to De Silguy.
</P>
<P>
He said the UK risked losing influence in key European
institutions, which are designing the framework for the single
currency's operation.
</P>
<P>
Britain has decided to "wait and see" how the euro evolves
before making a decision whether to join or not, though Britain's
ruling Labor party is sympathetic in principle to a common
European currency.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Hong Kong Seek Ways to Promote Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- There were great potentials
for Hong Kong and South Africa to increase the two-way trade,
visiting Hong Kong Finance Secretary Donald Tsang said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang was speaking after co-chairing a South Africa/ Hong Kong
trade and investment workshop with Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and Hong Kong totalled about 1
billion U.S. dollars last year -- less than one percent of Hong
Kong's total foreign trade, according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
"I think that with an economy like South Africa's, a lot more
is possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Tsang said bilateral investment was
also in its infancy. By early 1997, Hong Kong companies had
injected about 187 million dollars in South Africa, with South
Africa investing about 77 million dollars in Hong Kong by the end
of the same year.
</P>
<P>
"This simply means that there are plenty of opportunities that
have yet to be fully explored and exploited to our mutual
benefit."
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who is leading a business delegation on a 12-day visit
to South Africa, said Hong Kong was an ideal access market to
China.
</P>
<P>
In turn, South Africa was a gateway to Southern Africa with its
market of about 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the two delegations had discussed the effects of the
recent global economic crisis on their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda was the negative impact on developing
countries of developed nations attempting to protect their own
industries.
</P>
<P>
"I found it very interesting that Mr Tsang was raising similar
issues," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
"We share a common approach to the global economy, we are not
seeking to lock ourselves out from it.
</P>
<P>
"We accept these are realities, which properly managed can be
very positive. But within that acceptance, there seems to be room
to explore how adjustments could be made."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said ways should be found for developing and
industrialized nations to pursue their respective goals within the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Tsang arrived in South Africa on Sunday leading a business
delegation to explore trade and investment opportunities with
their South African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong mission represented a number of industries,
including gold and silver, textile, clothing, telecommunications,
toys, seafood and exotic meat. A number officials from the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council also formed part of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Tsang would hold talks with President Thabo Mbeki
and Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in Pretoria. He would also meet
Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Zuma, and Reserve Bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
Tsang would lead the trade delegation to Durban and Cape Town
before leaving the country on August 5.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Govt. Claims 3,000 Rebels Surrendered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"They came to their senses after the signing of the cease-fire
agreement" in Zambian capital on July 10 by the heads of state of
the six nations fighting in the DRC, presidential spokesman
Lambert Kaboye said in a statement. He called on the rebels to
lay down their weapons and join the government army.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) surrendered last week, John Numbi, the commander of the
fourth military regiment in southeastern Katanga, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cease-fire agreement, the matter remains unresolved
due to a dispute over which faction is entitled to sign the accord
for the RCD rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rebel groups have since continued their campaign, capturing
towns in the northwest and south of the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has announced that he was
granting an amnesty to all rebels after the signing of the
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kabila was expected to hold private talks with South
African President Thabo Mbeki Monday, seeking help to solve the
crisis in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Mbeki played a prominent role in talks that led to the
cease-fire agreement in the DRC, where rebels allegedly backed by
Uganda and Rwanda have been fighting for nearly a year to oust
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Balkan Crisis Affects Asia-Pacific Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Monday that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia
has cast doubt on the recent years' achievements in international
relations and even affected the situation in the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regional security forum in Singapore, Ivanov said
there is now an attempt to rely on the use of force in
international relations, and he stressed the indispensable role of
the United Nations in finding ways of resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force by NATO against Yugoslavia -- without the
sanction of the U.N. Security Council -- has questioned all the
positive achievements in international relations during recent
years, giving rise to natural worries of states for their
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stability in the Asia-Pacific region has become more fragile
than a year ago, Ivanov said. "The heavy blow of the Balkan crisis
against the established system of maintaining international peace
and security has affected the regional situation, making it less
predictable and stable."
</P>
<P>
The developments in the Balkans showed that international
stability can be plausible only on the basis of multipolarity, he
said. But "we witness the recurrence of the thinking based on the
use of force, an attempt to rely on the law of force in
circumvention of fundamental norms and principles of the
international law."
</P>
<P>
"It is the enhancement of the role of influential international
organizations, first of all the U.N., strict compliance with the
principles of non-interference into internal affairs of states and
solution of the existing problems exclusively by political means,
that is the alternative to such a development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain confident that the U.N. is a unique regulating
mechanism of the entire system of international relations. The
U.N. is indispensable in finding agreed approaches to the
settlement of conflict situations, ensuring progressive
development of state and finding solutions to global problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that increasing support has been voiced in the
region to the ideas of building a multipolar world that would
improve the balance in the system of international relations as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Pledges to Help Persuade Congo (K) Rebels to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua)-- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Monday pledged to do everything necessary to persuade
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) rebels to sign a cease-fire
agreement aimed at ending the conflict in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
"We will give all the support that is necessary ... to make
sure that they indeed sign the cease-fire," Mbeki told reporters
after meeting visiting Congolese President Laurent Kabila in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said it was imperative that the rebels also endorse the
cease- fire agreed to by the other warring parties in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said talks with Kabila also touched on the role South
Africa could play in the reconstruction of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"So we will look at those questions which are wide-ranging,
affecting the infrastructure, central banks, economic recovery,
and support for the rebuilding of the public service," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, for his part, confirmed that his country was hoping
Mbeki could use his influence to achieve a cessation of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki played a prominent role in talks leading to the July 10
cease-fire pact in the war-torn DRC, where rebels allegedly backed
by Uganda and Rwanda have been fighting for almost a year to oust
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, along with his allies Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe,
signed the cease-fire agreement, as did Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels did not endorse the treaty because of a dispute
over who was entitled to sign for them. Some groups have since
continued their campaign, capturing towns in the northwest and
south of the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, accompanied by a ministerial delegation, arrived at
Waterkloof air base near Pretoria earlier in the day for what he
described as a working visit.
</P>
<P>
Asked after his meeting with Mbeki how far the rebels were from
 endorsing the cease-fire, Kabila said: "I don't know. I hope
they will sign."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails U.S.-Vietnam Trade Pact as a Step Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday described a U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement as a major step
forward and hoped it will be completed "very soon."
</P>
<P>
"The provisional arrangement is a major step forward for both
countries," Clinton said in a statement released by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"A bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam constitutes one more
positive step," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tentative accord, announced in Hanoi on Sunday, would help
build normal trade relations between the two countries after the
U.S. invading troops left the country.
</P>
<P>
"I will review the agreement carefully and consult further with
Congress and the government of Vietnam in the hope that we will be
able to move on to finalization, formal signature, and the
establishment of normal trade relations very soon," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said on Sunday he hoped the agreement
could come into force by the end of the year after some technical
issues were resolved and the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National
Assembly approved the pact.
</P>
<P>
Washington expected the accord would ease access to the
Vietnamese market for U.S. goods and services, including farm
products as well as telecommunications and financial services.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber of Commerce Urges House to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on
Monday urged the House of Representatives to support normal trade
relations (NTR) with China, a vote it called "the right step for
American business, workers and consumers."
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining open ties to China is critical for Businesses in
every corner of this country," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President
and CEO Thomas, J. Donohue said, noting trade data showing the
country's nearly 200,000 jobs and 18 billion U.S. dollars in
exports depending on trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, every U.S. president has supported granting NTR
status to China.
</P>
<P>
Renewal of China's NTR status would allow foreign goods to be
sold in the United States with average tariffs and ensure that
U.S. goods receive the best tariff treatment China offers to
foreign imports, the Chamber said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"As China offers to open its vast markets as part of its bid to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO), U.S. exports are poised
to grow tremendously. A strong House vote on NTR is important to
U.S. negotiators' efforts to secure a WTO deal that will benefit
American business," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber said that it is mounting a vigorous grassroots and
lobbying effort to secure NTR. More than 115 state and local
Chambers of Commerce around the country have joined the U.S.
Chamber-led "Chambers for China Trade," a growing group from
across the United States committed to expansion of U.S. trade with
China.
</P>
<P>
Many of these chambers have visited or written their Members of
Congress, prepared op-eds for their local papers, and reached out
to their smaller member companies to make sure they are aware of
the tremendous stake small business has in China NTR.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber will continue to press for permanent NTR status for
China upon conclusion of a commercially meaningful WTO agreement
with China, Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the World's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Association
of Manufacturers (NAM) Monday urged the House of Representatives
to vote to maintain normal trading relations with China by
defeating Tuesday's scheduled resolution of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
"Normal trading relation is not a favor we are doing for China,
it's a favor we are doing for ourselves," said Dianne Sullivan,
NAM director of trade policy.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. economic health and expansion depends upon selling to
markets outside of our own, and China has one-quarter of the
world's population," Sullivan said, adding that "it would be
foolish and more than a little dangerous" for the United States to
simply disengage from the most populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Cutting off normal trade relations will only cede China's
market to America's international competitors, Sullivan said, and
hamper critical efforts to get China inside the multilateral
rules-based system of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"China's market offers enormous potential for U.S. companies,
translating into high paying, quality jobs, shareholder and
retiree profits and competitiveness here at home," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
In seven years, China has moved from the tenth to the fourth
largest U.S. trading partner, behind Canada, Japan and Mexico.
U.S. exports to China have increased 252 percent since 1986,
faster than overall average U.S. export growth.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Russian Officials Hold Talks on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior government officials of
Greece and Russia Monday began here their second round of talks on
cooperation in the fields of economy, industry, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The Greek delegation was headed by National Economy Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou while the Russian side was led by Deputy Prime
Minister Valentina Matvienko, the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Deputy National Economy Minister Rodoula Zisi said
that existing agreements signed by the two countries provided an
important basis for economic cooperation while there were
extensive private investment incentives in both directions and a
system of Greek credit facilities to Russian regions already in
place.
</P>
<P>
She said that there was interest and prospects for bilateral
cooperation in the fields of tourism, construction, banks, and
especially in telecommunications, after the signing of the Black
Sea optical fibre deal recently.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the need for developing a comprehensive web
of road, air, rail and shipping transport networks to facilitate
trade, and further potential for cooperation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Matvienko, who was Russia's ambassador to Greece before she
became deputy premier, Monday also met with Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos to discuss the program for the Balkan
reconstruction and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Both sides supported the immediate implementation of a
comprehensive program for the reconstruction of the entire region
and hoped that final decisions regarding stabilization would be
adopted in Sarajevo at the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Common Country Assessment Launched in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government and the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Monday launched a Common
Country Assessment program in Ghana to harmonize support from
Ghana's development partners.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating program of action is also aimed to strengthen
Ghana's long-term development framework, the Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
It will review and analyse Ghana's development situation and
identify key issues and causes of development problems. It will
also analyse the needs and priorities, which would define the
purpose and strategy of U.N. system development assistance to
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Moses Asaga, a Deputy Minister of Finance of Ghana, who chaired
the function, traced the program to a 1997 U.N. reform initiated
by U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan and endorsed by the General
Assembly for country level development operations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. initiative - U.N. Development Assistance Framework
(UNDAF) - lays the foundation for cooperation among the U.N.
system, government and other development partners.
</P>
<P>
Moses Mukasa, U.N. resident coordinator, said that the first
country assessment of Ghana, which was conducted in March 1997,
focused on trends and challenges related to social development in
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The program would achieve deeper knowledge of development
challenges among the partners involved, based on a common analysis
and understanding of the development situation of the country with
a people-centered approach,

said the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
To ensure and facilitate a broad and human centered country
assessment, Mukasa said the U.N. country team has chosen
sustainable human development as the analytical framework for the
assessment.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's long-term development framework, Vision 2020, has made
it important to forge strong, strategic partnerships not only
among the U.N. system, but foremost with relevant government
entities, civil society, the private sector and other external
development partners.
</P>
<P>
According to a document from the Ghanaian National Development
and Planning Commission, this calls for an increase in external
resources toward poverty reduction at the domestic front and new
development strategies to attract external support.
</P>
<P>
The assessment mission to be completed in November, would
produce a document that assesses the status and trends of human
development, key development problems and underlying causes as
well as progress on follow-ups to international conferences and
conventions.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced on
Monday it would offer up to 500 million U.S. dollars in additional
humanitarian aid for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be announced at an international donors conference
on Wednesday in Brussels, National Security Advisor Samuel Berger
told a seminar at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce today that at the conference the
United States will be prepared to commit up to 500 million U.S.
dollars for Kosovo, subject to... confirmation that other donors
will do their part," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union and its member nations will be principal
contributors for humanitarian aid and for reconstruction in
Kosovo," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The conference was arranged to raise money for immediate
humanitarian needs for the hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians returning to devastated homes and villages.
</P>
<P>
"In the fall, after a more comprehensive damage assessment is
completed, another conference will mobilize aid for long-term
reconstruction," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berger admitted that most Serbs have left Kosovo
after NATO took control of Kosovo. However, he said, "We must
work to create an environment where those Serbs who wish to return
and remain can do so in safety."

<HEADLINE> Albania Drafts Plans for Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Albania has drafted plans for
presentation at the Summit of the Stability Pact for Southeastern
Europe to be held on July 30, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency
(ATA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albania's plans outlined three fundamental issues of the pact
to be launched in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina --
democratization, economic cooperation and reconstruction, and
security in Southeastern Europe, according to the ATA.
</P>
<P>
Albania this time highlighted in its plans the role of economic
cooperation for stability in the region, proposing some priority
cooperation projects for that purpose, especially in the fields of
energy and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, the Albanian government will present at the
summit some regional cooperation projects on energy and
infrastructure, including construction of hydro-power stations on
regional rivers and connection of Albania's gas pipeline network
through Italy and Greece to North Africa.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo
Sunday presented the Corridor 8 project in Sofia, capital of
Bulgaria, where he was meeting with his Macedonian counterpart,
Alexksander Dimitrov, and Bulgarian counterpart, Nadezhda
Mihajillova, to coordinate their joint projects for presentation
in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Corridor 8 project is designed to link the road network
from the Albanian port of Durres to Macedonia's capital of Skopje,
Sofia and Bulgaria's coastal city of Varna.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday sent a letter to Albanian
President Rexhep Mejdani, urging Albania to prepare plans for
presentation at the Sarajevo summit.
</P>
<P>
The ATA Monday said that Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
had urged his ministers to work hard so that the Albanian
government can present a clear and detailed strategy at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the summit will take place on July 30 with
the presence of over 50 heads of state and government.

<HEADLINE> Course on plant tissue culture opens in Accra, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Ghana
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Professor J.K.A Amuzu, Pro-Vice
Chancellor of the University of Ghana, Monday urged biologists
to use plant tissue culture principles for the rapid
multiplication of disease-free plants.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Amuzu said modern biology has taken a new turn in
biotechnology and that its principles could also be used for
conservation, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported from Accra,
capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He was opening the second international training course in
plant tissue culture, where participants will learn to produce
disease-free plants.
</P>
<P>
It is organized by the Department of Botany, University of
Ghana and the United Nations University/Institute for Natural
Resources in Africa (UNU/ INRA).
</P>
<P>
 The nine participants are from six African Universities --
Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
 They will be taught how to identify plant cells, eliminate
their viruses and use them to produce healthy plants.
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Amuzu said, "our forests are being depleted of useful
medicinal plants, non-timber products and many plants are now on
the list of endangered species awaiting conservation through
tissue culture techniques."
</P>
<P>
 He said the problem is accentuated by the yearly occurrence
of devastating bush fires that take away a heavy toll of many rare
plant species.
</P>
<P>
 "Should we not begin to conserve these vital biological
diversity by applying tools that science can offer," he asked and
appealed to friends of the university and other agencies
interested in the development of science to come to the aid of the
university to organize such programs.
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Uzo Mkwunye, Director of UNU/INRA, said the UNU
agreed to provide 40,000 dollars to the University for expansion
of the existing physical facility of plant tissue culture
laboratory of the Department of Botany.
</P>
<P>
 A similar course was held last year to rethink the vision of
UNU in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "Today our vision is firmly fixed on the notion that forming
strategic partnerships with the scientists and academics in
Africa's universities and research institutions is the most
appropriate way to promote institutional and human capacity
building in Africa."
</P>
<P>
 He asked the botany department to work closely with INRA to
develop research and training programs and jointly look for
financial resources to support their activities.

<HEADLINE> Murder of Spouses, Problem in Tanzania: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
of Tanzania said Monday that the murder of spouses remains a
problem in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament session in the central city Dodoma,
Deputy Minister of Labor and Youth Development William Lukuvi said
that 384 women were killed by their husbands from 1995 to last
May.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, some 144 men were beaten to death by
their wives because of excessive drinking, extra-marital affairs
or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Lukuvi, who stood in the place of the Minister of Home Affairs,
was answering questions from Monica Mdogo, a parliament member,
who sought to know the number of murder cases related to discord
of spouses and penalties on convicts.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said 94 accused persons, including 61
husbands and 33 wives, were convicted of murder charges between
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lukuvi said the remaining cases are still under investigation
and some files have been handed over to the Director of Public
Prosecution, according to reports from Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
He said these are only the officially reported incidents and in
some cases the accused persons have committed suicide or escaped.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's New Civil Services Head Urges to Wipe out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Newly appointed Head of
Civil Service Richard Leakey said Monday that he is confident of
wiping out corruption and inefficiency in government in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While making the remarks at his first news conference here,
Leakey said that he has full support of the president, emphasizing
that corruption would no longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Leakey, appointed as Head of Civil Service and Secretary to the
Cabinet by President Daniel arap Moi last Friday, pointed out that
"public officers who let us down are not going to be transferred
to another place to let us down, but will be removed."
</P>
<P>
Leakey, a white Kenyan, is a famed conservationist in the
country. He was the Director of the Kenya Wildlife Service before
his new appointment.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that "there is a fairly huge task ahead of us
if we are going to restore confidence in the public service."
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that he had given a mandate by the president "to
change the culture of corruption and inefficiency in our public
service."
</P>
<P>
The mandate will be supported by foreign donors and investors
at a time when they are gradually pulling out of the country or
withdrawing development projects due to the rampant corruption in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Leakey said President Moi had been unequivocal in delivering a
message of transparency and accountability to senior civil service
officials earlier Monday, saying that he had confidence the
president was backing him all the way.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Set New Summer Speed Limit to Avoid Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- German drivers will have to comply
with the new summer speed limit by the Environment Ministry next
year, which says the current regulations are insufficient to
prevent severe air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Juergen Trittin told the Suedduetsche
Zeitung newspaper Monday that cars would not be allowed to run
over 100 kilometers per hour on German highways in summer starting
in the year 2000, and the speed limit for trucks would be 60. The
current speed limits are 130 kilometers per hour for cars and 100
for trucks on highways.
</P>
<P>
Martin Waldhausen, a spokesman for the ministry, said in Berlin
that the government found it ineffective only to prohibit cars and
trucks without a catalysator running on German roads to reduce air
pollution in summer days.
</P>
<P>
Under the law valid since 1995, automobiles must be equipped
with catalysator, a reactor made up of platinum to reduce the
emissions, before they can run on German roads. The law does not
stipulate any speed limit for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted by the conservative cabinet under Helmut Kohl,
was aimed at cutting the near-ground smog and ozone pollution by
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
But, under a new European Union law, the ozone level in the air
must be kept under 180 micrograms per cubic meter. The ozone is
the main ingredient that may hurt human health in the smog, the
air pollutant caused by automotive emissions.
</P>
<P>
According to tests in several German states, ozone
concentration is far over 200 micrograms per cubic meter air
without a specific speed limit under high temperature in summer
days. And German environmentalists demand more regulations to
limit the air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Germany's federal environment bureau supported Trittin's
initiative, saying a more extensive speed limit is needed to cut
the smog pollution.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has calculated that restricting the automotive speed
to 80 percent of the current standards will reduce the ozone
pollution by 5 percent, said Karsten Klenner, a spokesman for the
bureau.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Global Debt Relief Program to Be Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration on
Monday urged international financial leaders to agree in September
on a program to provide debt relief to the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a development conference at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
the world's wealthiest nations had to find "an appropriate way to
finance this relief that would win broad international support."
</P>
<P>
Last month in Cologne, Germany, leaders from the world's seven
largest industrial countries unveiled an initiative to help ease
the crushing debt burdens of the world's poorest countries, most
of them in sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
"What is important now is that we take the extra momentum that
the Cologne commitments afford -- to strengthen and accelerate
these efforts and integrate them into a single package by the
fall," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the international community ought to reach
agreement on such a program at the annual meetings" of the
182-nation IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank, at the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
There is a "historic opportunity to accelerate (debt relief)
efforts and help these countries finally build an attractive
environment for private investment and market-led growth," Summers
said. "We should not and must not allow that opportunity to go to
waste."
</P>
<P>
He said the question of financing the 27-billion-U.S.-dollar
debt relief program "raises some difficult issues." He referred to
a proposal for the IMF to sell 310 metric tons of gold, about 10
percent of its total reserves, which running into mounting
opposition in U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, I am confident that working together, we can find
a way to do this in a way that can command broad support," Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Summers said the Clinton administration was looking
at alternatives to financing debt relief for 41 heavily indebted
poor countries after several key members of both the Senate and
House said sale of IMF reserves could weaken already depressed
gold prices and hurt countries in Africa that rely on gold mining
for export revenue.

<HEADLINE> China: Aid Disparity, Unfair to African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China Monday criticized
certain donor countries for "selectively and conditionally"
providing aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The practice was extremely unfair to African refugees, said Qin
Huasun, representative of China's Permanent Mission to the United
Nations, at a U.N. Security Council meeting on humanitarian
assistance to the refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Fairness and impartiality in humanitarian affairs should be
observed by the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
While each refugee in Kosovo received 1.60 U.S. dollars per
day, each African refugee only received 0.11 dollars per day, he
pointed to the fact which drew international attention.
</P>
<P>
Qin said Africa had over 3 million refugees and over 2 million
displaced persons, one third of all such people in the world, and
the key to resolving the problem was to remove the root causes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, the relatively backward economies of
underdeveloped countries, coupled with threats presented by
globalization, threatened many of those countries with
marginalization.
</P>
<P>
Such factors, he said, contributed to the growth in conflict,
poverty and instability and prevented the removal of root causes.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, Qin said, China had provided
assistance to many African countries through bilateral agreements
and enjoyed a good relationship with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.

LONDON July 26 (Xinhua) - European markets all closed sharply
lower in volatile trading Monday as the dollar remained on the
defensive after being hit by strength in the euro and the yen.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 closed down 38 points, or 0.62 percent, at
6169.1. The index was flat for much of the morning in light trade,
then dramatically slumped more than 110 points to hit a four-month
low of 6092.1 before recovering at the close.
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight oil stocks led the FTSE's fall - BP Amoco lost 1.1
percent and Shell Transport fell 2.55 percent. Pharmaceutical
shares were also pulled back, with SmithKline Beecham off 1.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they were expecting the UK market to go higher on
the back of the banking sector's results, but even at its low, the
market never felt like it was down 115 points.
</P>
<P>
Germany's DAX index fell about 2 percent on the day as strength
in the euro combined with a lower start on Wall Street to extend a
correction after the market's climb to fresh year highs earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The DAX ended down 104.1 points, or 1.96 percent, at 5206.44.
"The stronger euro, the weaker dollar, a lower start on Wall
Street - it's all added up," one trader said.

Paris CAC-40 closed down 1 percent at 4395.91 in volume of 2.1

<HEADLINE> UK Government Report Sums Up Progress, Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has admitted his government still has much to do to fulfill some
of the Labor Party's election promises made two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the government's annual report, Blair said Monday
that health and education still required significant changes to
meet his election pledges.
</P>
<P>
The report, published Monday, painted a glowing picture overall
of the administration that produced it, but the opposition
dismissed it as a "gimmick."
</P>
<P>
The report claimed 90 of the party's 177 manifesto commitments
had been met and said another 85 were under way. Only two still
had to be put into the parliamentary timetable, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister expressed irritation with delays in
reforms to the health service as he answered questions in an east
London hospital Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"No one is more frustrated than me, but I think to turn around
a big public service is a 10-year project and it will take time to
do it," he said. "There are still things where we have got to
improve things and do better."
</P>
<P>
In his introduction to the report, Blair said his five basic
pledges were all on course to be met.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas, the government has made good progress but in
other important fields, it will take more time to achieve our
goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Striking an optimistic note, he said he believed Britain's
influence in the world was growing and that the country was "on
the right track."
</P>
<P>
"Our public services are steadily improving. Working people
have more support, decent standards, paid holiday and more
childcare," he said. "The economy has avoided lurching from boom
to bust."
</P>
<P>
He said one of the government's biggest achievements was that
the nation was starting to look like "a society coming together,
not torn apart." Other success stories cited are falling
unemployment and devolved government in Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the prime minister said it would take years of
hard work before the NHS reforms were in place. But he said the
extra 21 billion pounds, which had been earmarked for health over
three years, was "well under way."
</P>
<P>
Blair also admitted "reforming the complicated web of social
security benefits will take more time before its real impact will
be felt."
</P>
<P>
But before the report was published, it was dismissed by the
Conservative Party as a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Cabinet Office minister Andrew Lansley said, "The point
has come where Labor can no longer publish hyped-up over-stylized
material."
</P>
<P>
"The public's experience is that Labor is letting them down.
Labor's year of delivery so far has been a failure," he said.
"This annual report is necessarily understated for one simple
reason -- because Labor are under-performing."
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives have produced their own version of the
document, entitled Labor's Real Annual Report. In it, they accused
Blair of "fudge, failure or delay" on most of his pledges, a BBC
report said.

<HEADLINE> "One China" Policy, an International Trend (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui's remarks of defining
the cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state" relations has
aroused not only great indignation from the Chinese people in and
out of China, but also led to widespread criticism from the world
public opinion, says a "People's Daily" article to be published
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The international communities have pledged their firm support
to the "one China" principle over the past days, frustrating Lee
Teng-hui's attempt of creating "two Chinas", "one China, one
Taiwan" or "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lee has played a role of provoking incidents and undermining
the stable relations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, it
says.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why Lee Teng-hui has stripped off his mask to preach
the "state-to-state relations", the article says, "he thinks the
current international situation provides an opportunity for his
splittist activities."
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the U.S.-led NATO interfered in the internal
affairs of Yugoslavia with the excuse of "human rights is superior
to sovereignty" and attacked the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
Taiwan intended to force its way in the TMD system initiated by
the United States, erecting a barrier on the development of Sino-U.
S. relations, it says.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Lee has made his own wishful thinking that the
anti-China forces in the world would openly support his splittist
acts. However, the international situation runs counter to his
wish. His adventurous acts were based on his subjective desire,
the article notes.

<TEXT>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton reaffirmed his position of
not supporting Taiwan independence, not supporting "one China, one
Taiwan," and not supporting Taiwan's access into any international
organizations that only admit sovereign state during his visit to
China last year. He also reiterated the U.S. government's "strong
commitment" to adhering to its "one China" policy on the Taiwan
issue in a recent phone conversation with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Russia is committed to not selling arms to Taiwan. Japan has
also reiterated its "one China" policy and promised not to support
an "independent Taiwan". These instances demonstrate that the "one
China" policy has gained widespread recognition from the
international community, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Since Lee dished out his "state-to-state relations" statement,
countries including the United States, Japan, Russia, and the
European Union all made immediate responses supporting the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in the Asian-Pacific Region reaffirmed that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and that the
Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion in Taiwan showed that Lee's "state-to-state"
theory produced an unexpected negative effect, and caused Taiwan
authorities to become even more isolated in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars have described Lee as a "political hyper-active
child." A child who suffers from hyper-activity does no harm to
others. But a political "hyper-active child" can bring disaster to
the people of Taiwan by damaging across-straits relations, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Though Taiwan is still separated from the motherland, its
status as part of China has not changed, nor has China's
sovereignty over Taiwan. This is a generally acknowledged fact
accepted by the United Nations and the majority of countries, the
article concludes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Meets PNG Envoy in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan Tuesday met with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) prime
minister's special envoy Tarcisius Eri here and had a friendly
conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tang asked Eri to convey his congratulations
and cordial greetings to newly-elected PNG Foreign Minister
Michael Somare and said he was looking forward to meeting him at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed appreciation for the PNG new government's recent
reaffirmation of its adherence to the "one China" policy, and its
wise decision to declare as invalid the so-called communique the
PNG's previous government signed with Taiwan authorities on
establishing "diplomatic ties."
</P>
<P>
He said "the two-states theory" of Lee Teng-hui has met with
strong opposition and condemnation from the whole Chinese people,
including the compatriots in Taiwan, and from the international
community, and Lee has been left in an extremely isolated
position. This shows that "Taiwan independence" can never find a
way out, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China always attaches importance to the
development of friendly relations and cooperation with PNG and the
Chinese people cherish deep and friendly feelings toward the PNG
people.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Chinese government, to the best of its
ability and with sincerity, has provided PNG with aid with no
political strings attached, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, make efforts to develop
relations with PNG and strengthen and expand the mutually
beneficial cooperation between the two countries in trade,
economic and other fields, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Eri said the new PNG government, as soon as taking office,
reviewed the decision made by the previous government on Taiwan
and announced that it would adhere to the "one China" policy which
successive governments had pursued since 1976.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Prime Minister Mekere Morauta had asked him
to reiterate at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting that PNG will adhere
to the "one China" policy and maintain state-to-state relations
with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The PNG government recognizes China's increasingly important
role in regional and international affairs, and in particular
values and appreciates the positive contributions China has made
over the years to PNG's economic and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Tang also met with Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy. The two sides exchanged views on Sino-Canadian
relations and other issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Dips In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Consumer Confidence
Index dipped nearly three-and-a-half points in July, the first
time after eight months of consecutive gains, the Conference
Board, a prominent research group, said in a report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Consumer Confidence Index declined 3.4
point to 135.6 in July from 139.0 in June.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers appear to have taken a brief vacation to reflect
on the healthy economy their spending has created, " said Lynn
Franco, Associate Director of the Conference Board's Consumer
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Franco said, "While the current dip in confidence may
reflect concerns about future job prospects, some tightening
in the availability of credit and the recent interest rate hike,
it does not suggest a long-term erosion in consumer optimism."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 percent on
June 30 in a "pre-emptive" action to curb inflation. Last
Thursday, the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raised the
possibility of the second interest rates hike in a testimony at
the House Banking Committee and the remarks have dragged the
stock market lower.
</P>
<P>
The report said consumers' outlook six months form now was
much less optimistic than in the previous survey. The
percentage of respondents anticipating a pickup in business
conditions dropped to 16.4 percent form 18.1 percent in June and
those expecting conditions to worsen, however, only increase
moderately from 5.6 percent last month to 6.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Draw up Guidelines on Wetlands Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will impose some
form of control on the development of strategic forest areas so as
to protect the country's ecosystem, Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines would be drawn up for forest conservation,
safeguarding water catchment areas and maintaining the required
water table in forests, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
quoted the minister as saying in the northern state of Pulau
Pinang.
</P>
<P>
He said the rapid transformation of strategic tropical forest
areas, especially wetlands, into developed areas had disturbed the
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 to 15 years, Southeast Asia had experienced an
increasing rate of development that had led to degradation of
wetlands, including peat swamps, he told the three-day
International Conference and Workshop on Tropical Peat Swamps
being held in Pulau Pinang.
</P>
<P>
Peat swamp areas in this region were estimated at 30 to 45
million hectares, or about 60 percent of the world's tropical peat
lands and one-tenth of the global peat lands, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, peat forest fires throughout the region in
1997/98 burnt nearly 1 million hectares of peat lands and
contributed to transboundary problems such as haze and air
pollution.

<HEADLINE> No Place for Lee Teng-hui's Splittism: Xinhua Commentator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A commentator's article of the
Xinhua News Agency says today there is no space in the world for
the existence of Lee Teng-hui's "two-States" remarks, which
preached "state-to-state" relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks have not only aroused unanimous opposition from
the international community, but also reinforced the wide
acceptance of the "One China" policy and further isolated Lee Teng-
hui, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
A great number of countries have reiterated their position of
adhering to the "One China" policy, stating that Taiwan is part of
Chinese territory. Even the United States and Japan, which Taiwan
pins great hope on, have reaffirmed the "One China" stand,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The reason Lee's "two-States" remarks have been rebuffed
internationally is that it violates the basic norms of
international law which stipulates that in a sovereign state,
there is only one government representing the State's sovereignty,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China
as the sole legal government when it was founded in 1949. The
replacement of the old government with the new is an internal
affair of China. As the sole legitimate representative of China,
the People's Republic of China, of course, has the qualifications
for exercising sovereignty over Taiwan, which are facts generally
acknowledged by the world, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is entirely different in its nature from the
German issue. The separation of East and West Germany was largely
influenced and restricted by international factors. But the
separation of Taiwan from the mainland is an issue left over from
China's civil war. Therefore, the reunification of China is the
internal affair of China. the article says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the state of separation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits is temporary. The mainland's status as China's
mainstay and its dominant position have been defined. The Taiwan
issue should be solved by the Chinese themselves under the
framework of One China.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who attempts to separate Taiwan from Chinese territory
gravely violates the law. Whoever in the world recognizes such
illegal acts runs counter to the basic norms of international
relations, interferes in China's internal affairs, and undermines
the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of China, the
article concludes.

The non-Communist party members are urged to be with the CPC
Central committee ideologically and in action to safeguard
political stability and unity of the country.

Some parties, including the Revolutionary Committee of the

<HEADLINE> Russia to Announce Amnesty to Free 90,000 Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice intends to
announce another amnesty that will free about 90,000 inmates from
its crowded prisons, Russian Justice Minister Pavel
Krasheninnikov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A group has already been set up to draft the amnesty program,
and appropriate documents will be ready by the end of the year,
the Interfax news agency quoted Krasheninnikov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pardon will cover convicts who pose no danger
to society, such as offenders whose negligence led to road or
traffic accidents and disabled persons, war veterans, minors, and
women who have behaved well and whose prison term is under five
years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that overall, the ministry is planning to
reduce the prison population by 200,000-300,000 in one year to one
and a half year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current size of the prison population, at one
million, is very high. The over-crowdedness has been blamed for
alarmingly high incidence of such contagious diseases as AIDS and
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
"It is our task to increase the number of prisons and
detention centers while reducing the number of convicts in order
to create decent living conditions for them," Krasheninnikov said.
</P>
<P>
"When we sentence criminals to imprisonment we should not be
sentencing them to be infected with AIDS, TB or other deadly
diseases," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian parliament last month passed an amnesty measure
that calls for the release of 100,000 inmates who are first-time
offenders convicted of lesser crimes.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to strengthen its air
force strike component by 10-20 percent in five years, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting Defense Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Russia's strike potential will be raised through an increase
in the size of strategic bombers and attack aviation and the
modernization of existing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that the latest developments in the Balkans were
one of the reasons for increasing the strike potential of the air
force.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 MiG-29 jets of the fighter fleet will be updated by
the end of the year. Sukhoi-27 and MiG-31 fighters will also be
involved in the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
New TU-160 strategic bombers will join the existing fleet of
TU-95MC and TU-22MZ aircraft. By 2005 strategic aviation should
take up cruise missiles of a new generation, the ministry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The existing fleet of front-line aviation should be modernized
and equipped with multi-purpose systems.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that after 2005 the Air Force will start
using multi-purpose aircraft of the fifth generation, Interfax
reported.

<HEADLINE> Poor Russian Policy Blamed for Failure to Stem NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A former Russian ranking
intelligence officer said Tuesday that NATO's eastward expansion
could have been prevented if the country had pursued a single and
coordinated policy.
</P>
<P>
Fyodor Ladygin, former chief of the Russian General Staff's
Main Intelligence Department, told the Nezavisimaya Gazeta
newspaper that NATO enlargement could have been stopped way back
in 1994-1995, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I think that our amorphous foreign policy, pursued, among
others, by ex-foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, gave a go-ahead to
the expansion of the alliance," Ladygin said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia said the United States has
a larger intelligence in Russia than its presence in the United
States, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a report in The Washington Times
saying that the U.S. administration has warned Moscow to
voluntarily reduce the number of intelligence officers operating
in the U.S. or face expulsion, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The article also said that about half of the Russian
diplomatic staff working in Seattle and San Francisco are working
for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Samolis, the press secretary of the Foreign
Intelligence Service director, said the sources that supplied
information to Bill Gertz, the article's author, "are well known,
and we do not think it worthwhile to argue with them."
</P>
<P>
"But if Russian intelligence presence in the United States is
compared with the presence of U.S. intelligence in Russia,
Washington has far surpassed Moscow," she said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted another expert of the Foreign Intelligence
Service as saying that the article "was timed to coincide with
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin's visit to the United
States."
</P>
<P>
"If Russia is drawn into a discussion on this theme, Stepashin
's talks will be seriously complicated," the expert said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Communal Clash in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have been killed and
32 others injured in communal clash between residents from three
villages outside Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
since Saturday, the Antara News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The communal clash had spread to downtown Ambon Tuesday, said
the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted witness reports as saying that Tuesday's
clash started at 06:00 a.m. local time outside Ambon, but later
also involved people living in downtown Ambon. In the town, the
rioters pelted and burnt shops on A.Y. Patty street, which leads
to the town's center.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday noon, thousands of people were still out in some of
Ambon's main streets carrying sharp weapons. The situation became
more tense after hand-made bombs exploded and shops along three
streets were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 60 shops had been torched.
</P>
<P>
Maluku police chief Col. Bugis M. Saman personally led police
troops in the streets to calm the crowds, Antara reported.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI) spokesman Maj. Gen.
Syamsul Maarif told reporters that TNI Commander Gen. Wiranto had
instructed the military and police chiefs in Ambon to take
whatever measures necessary to prevent the unrest in their region
from escalating or spreading.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population are Christian,
while most of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from
other islands.

CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Geoff Hoon has said his country is confident that
"a good opportunity" has appeared for realizing peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an interview screened on Egyptian TV Channel Two on Tuesday,
Hoon said Britain, if asked, is ready and keen to play a role in
helping achieve just, comprehensive and lasting peace between Arab
countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been in close contacts with Egypt, the first Arab
country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and an active mediator
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hoon arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria,
220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, on Monday on the first leg of a
regional tour and held talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The British official told the Egyptian TV that he discussed
with Moussa the Mideast peace process and other issues related to
Libya, Iraq and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Hoon said Britain knows that the Iraqi people need help and it
"really wishes to ease their sufferings."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged Iraq to comply with the United Nations
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions
on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq blames the
sanctions for the shortage of food and medicine suffered by its
people.

CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Most Australian financial

Costello said financial sector regulators actively encouraged
disclosure by financial institutions as a means of maintaining

<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 27 (Xinhua)-- China's Arctic expedition
team will solve some of the mysteries surrounding the water
exchange between the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean through
the Bering Straits, thus contributing to the study of global
climate changes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the expedition has concluded its research at 14
sites in the Chukchi Sea, and reached the halfway mark in its
research at the Bering Sea today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jinping, an assistant to chief scientist, said, "Climate
change is a global problem, so we can't discover its principles by
studying the phenomenon in China only."
</P>
<P>
Water exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean
through the Bering Straits has a great impact on the climate
changes of China, however. The devastating floods last year and
the rainy season in South China has a direct connection with the
ocean, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Chinese scientists had accumulated some "
exciting" data from their research in the Bering and Chukchi seas,
which will greatly contribute to research on the water exchange
between the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, and to the
forecasting of natural disasters in China.
</P>
<P>
Because of the hazardous ice conditions, Chinese scientists
have been held back from pushing further north, and the expedition
will put off the research in the permanently frozen area, and
carry out further research at the heart of the Chukchi Sea.

<HEADLINE> Australian Health Officials to Discuss Blood Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's state health
ministers will meet next week to discuss blood testing after a
girl in Melbourne city became the first Australian in 14 years to
acquire HIV from donated blood.
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose identity and age have not been released, was
confirmed HIV-positive last Tuesday after undergoing surgery at
Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said
blood screening was already on the agenda for next Wednesday's
meeting in Canberra before the Melbourne case emerged.
</P>
<P>
Health ministers are expected to consider the introduction of a
new test for donated blood to show up antibodies that are
undetectable by the tests now in use.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge, who is overseas, was distressed and concerned about
the situation for the Melbourne girl and her family, his spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first-known case of HIV transmission since screening
all blood donations for the virus started in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
The case in Melbourne follows a HIV contamination scare at

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Sudan Keen on Boosting Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Sudan have voiced
their keenness to cement their bilateral ties once impaired by
Khartoum's sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah met his
visiting Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Osman Ismail here on Tuesday
on ways to boost bilateral ties in all fields as well as Arab and
international issues of mutual concern, according to a statement
issued by Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Both sides asserted, during the meeting, their keenness to
unify the Arab stand and work toward constructive Arab relations
based on the principles of respecting each country's sovereignty,
non-interference in its internal affairs and peacefully solving
inter-Arab disputes, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also underlined the importance of Iraq's
implementation of all United Nations Security Council resolutions
concerning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister arrived here late Sunday for a
three-day visit primarily aimed at restoring the Sudanese-Kuwaiti
ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait downgraded its diplomatic ties with several fellow Arab
nations, including Sudan, which it accused of sympathizing with
Iraq during Baghdad's 1990-1991 seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mustafa hoisted his country's flag on the Sudanese
Embassy in Kuwait. He said that raising the flag indicates the
restoration of the brotherly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his country "gives the relations full concern and
is keen on maintaining the bridge of friendship between both
nations."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Kuwait's Minister of Commerce and
Industry and Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Abdul Wahab
Al-Wazzan, the Sudanese minister also hoped for stronger economic
links between the two states, and asked for Kuwait's role in
achieving peace in south Sudan and in Sudan's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The famines and the 16-year-old civil war between Sudanese
government and the south rebels have claimed 1.5 million lives.

<HEADLINE> Internet Growth Fast in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Internet growth is accelerating
faster in developing countries than anywhere else, a report
presented to the Third African Communications Regional Workshop in
Lusaka said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report presented by Zambia Telecommunication corporation
Limited said that Internet users in Africa have passed the one
million mark but South Africa accounts for more than 90 percent of
Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sub-Saharan Africa with a population of 520 million
has fewer than 9,000 Internet hosts whilst North Africa with 130
million inhabitants has only 2,550 hosts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that all African countries have some form of
Internet access. However, estimates of Internet growth in Africa
need to be treated with caution. Much of the growth occurred in
one country - South Africa. For example, out of the 155,623
hosts, 144,445 are in South Africa which ranks about 16th in world
terms in number of Internet hosts.
</P>
<P>
The poor state of telecommunications infrastructure adversely
affects the Internet, which totally depends on some minimum level
of telecommunications infrastructure for existence, the report
said, adding that measure of tele-density (number of telephone
lines per 100 people) in Africa is the largest constraint.
</P>
<P>
Average tele-density for the developing world is just 1.5,
while in some African countries like Guinea, Liberia, Niger and
Somalia the figure plummets to just 0.002. In Chad and the
Democratic Republic of Congo the figure is 0.0001, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Internet will continue to be one of the buzz-words in the
telecommunications industry, appealing to both operating and new
entrants in the field, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Announces Package to Boost Hi-Tech Exports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and the Ministry of Science and
Technology have decided to jointly implement a package to boost
China's exports of hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a joint circular issued recently by the
two ministries entitled "Boosting Exports through Science and
Technology."
</P>
<P>
Under the package, China will designate a number of hi-tech
products and their exporters, and will map out special supporting
policies to encourage the manufacture and export of hi-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
Boosting exports through science and technology is the way for
China to become a larger and more powerful exporter, the circular
notes, adding that encouraging the growth of the hi-tech sector
and its exports is the ultimate way to enhance the competitiveness
of Chinese products in the international market and maintain
continuous export growth.
</P>
<P>
Through the implementation of this new package, China aims to
increase its exports of hi-tech products by 30 percent annually
beginning this year. By the year 2002, the proportion of China's
exported hi-tech products should climb from a current six percent
of overall exports to 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Reconsideration of Marcos Assets Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government urged
Tuesday the country's graft court, Sandiganbayan, to reconsider
its decision striking down the proposed 150-million-U.S.-dollar
settlement in favor of the human rights victims of the late
president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the government will
file a motion for the Sandiganbayan to reconsider its decision
made earlier Tuesday which announced the transfer of 150 million
dollars of Marcos assets to about 10,000 human right victims
"illegal and void."
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the motion will be filed by the Office of
the Solicitor General (OSG) on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
The government had asked the Sandiganbayan to approve the
transfer of 150 million dollars of the 590 million dollars of the
Marcos assets now in escrow after it had been transferred from the
Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) to the Philippine National Bank
(PNB).
</P>
<P>
Asserting the legality of the transfer, Barican said "the OSG
noted that the Swiss Magistrate, Dieter Jann, in a letter to the
Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), expressed no
objection or opposition to the release of the funds to the human
rights victims."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, said Barican, the proposed settlement in favor of the
human rights victims will not violate the law of Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) which only refers to assets of the
Marcoses that are "in legal possession of the government."
</P>
<P>
Barican explained that "In the present case, the ownership of
the 590-million-dollar fund is still being disputed. Neither is
this fund in the government's possession as contemplated under the
CARP law."
</P>
<P>
According to the CARP law, all proceeds from Marcos-related
sequestered assets shall go to the government's CARP fund to
benefit more farmers.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Parliament
approved Tuesday the Consumer Protection Bill 1999 which, among
others, provides for the establishment of a Consumer Claims

The tribunal will enable consumers to seek compensation for

including concerning repairs, replacements and refunds.
</P>

Under the bill, traders also face a fine of up to 500,000

<P>
Five hi-tech areas -- information, bio-medicine, high value-
added new materials, consumer electronic products, and family
appliances -- have been designated this year as the first group of
products to enjoy government preferential treatment and other
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes a preferential policy to cultivate hi-
tech products development zones, cities, and companies, and set-up
a nationwide hi-tech exports information service network, and the
launching of annual hi-tech fairs, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two departments will establish special
coordinating bodies for the implementation of the package.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng first put forward the strategy
of "boosting exports through science and technology" early this
year, saying that China's export of hi-tech products was far too
low.
</P>
<P>
Considering that China has witnessed the upgrading of its
technological level and the rapid growth of its economy, Shi said,
China needs to catch up with India and other developing nations in
terms of hi-tech exports.
</P>
<P>
India's software exports, for example, reached 1.75 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997, second only to the United States. This figure was
many times that of China, the minister said.

MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Social Welfare
and Development (DSWD) of the Philippines said Tuesday in a report
that it has received 1,275 sexual abuse cases during the first six
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these cases were brought to the DSWD's Quick Response
Team because they required residential services, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the DSWD handled 2,746 reported cases of sexual abuse
while the Philippine National Police (PNP) recorded 3,081 cases.
</P>
<P>
The DSWD said the cases were handled through the two different
channels according to their requirements, adding that those
brought to the attention of the DSWD often required protective
custody and residential services, while the PNP received all kinds
of reports.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 report of the DSWD showed that the majority of the
victims of sexual abuse were in the age range of 11 to 15 which
comprised 48 percent of the total number of reported cases.
</P>
<P>
This is also supported by the findings of the Baseline Survey
on Sexual Abuse and Exploitation in the Philippines conducted by
the DSWD and the Community and Family Service International in
December 1998.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily On Struggle Between Materialism &AMP; Idealism (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As China is now in a period of reform and opening-up, the
article says, it has become all the more important for its people
to cherish ideals and pursuits which will foster a pioneering
spirit and the virtues of frugality and perseverance, and hard
work and constant self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Marxism does not deny self-cultivation, but it also holds that
such cultivation must be scientific and conform to the spirit of
the times," says the article. "Belief in superstitious ideas and
enthusiasm for dark witcheries and the abandonment of all pursuits
in life and careers do not constitute healthy self-cultivation,
but only leads to the degeneration of humanity."
</P>
<P>
The article continues to say that another intense point of
confrontation between materialism and idealism lies in the
conflict between science and superstition.
</P>
<P>
"Science is a direct result of the materialistic world outlook,
" says the article, adding that science and technology constitute
the number one productive forces, and also provide the
revolutionary power which promotes the advancement of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
"Only by respecting and believing in science and by applying
science to the resolution of realistic problems can society
achieve progress and mankind see hope," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
Though science itself constantly encounters puzzles,
difficulties and even "crises" which challenge its fundamental
theories and research methods, no one can deny the accomplishments
of science, which will continue to develop, the article says.
</P>
<P>
"A real materialist is always full of confidence in science and
in mankind's capacity to recognize and reform the objective world,
" it adds.
</P>
<P>
The article concludes by saying that with materialism and
modern science gradually assuming a prevailing role in the world
today, any idealistic ideas attempting to earn popularity will
have to put on the cloak of superstition and witchery and deceive
the people by various vulgar means, just as Falun Gong did.
</P>
<P>
"Dialectic and historical materialism is a powerful ideological
weapon which will help us triumph over all mistakes and
superstitious ideas," the article says.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Free Movement of Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The free movement of residents of
European Union (EU) member states was once more stressed as the
executive body of the 15-nation union clarified the rights of
residents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission made the clarification after an
increasing number of complaints from citizens concerning residence
and free movement problem was registered.
</P>
<P>
The complaints focused on member state restrictions on citizens
' fundamental rights of residence and free movement within the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The commission reiterated the issue in the hope of improving
the implementation of citizens' rights by reducing differences
between member states' interpretation of the rules and by raising
citizens' awareness of their rights.
</P>
<P>
The European Community Treaty entitles member states to
restrict these rights on grounds of public policy, public security
or public health but member states are obliged to ensure that
citizens are offered certain safeguards and guarantees for their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Member states may only take measures to restrict or deny entry
into the country, issue or renew residence permits or expel a
foreign resident on the basis of the personal conduct of the
individual concerned.
</P>
<P>
Previous criminal convictions cannot in themselves constitute
grounds for taking such measures, the commission emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice said that member states should be
able to demonstrate that an individual represents a "genuine and
sufficiently serious threat" affecting one of the fundamental
interests of society in order to justify a restriction on his or
her right of residence or free movement.
</P>
<P>
A measure cannot remain in force forever and citizens have a
right to re-examination of their case after a reasonable period of
time has elapsed, said the commission.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Concerned Over Humanitarian Crisis in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The regional office of the United
Nations World Food Program (WFP) expressed here Tuesday its fears
over a worsening humanitarian crisis in southern Sudan as a flight
ban by the government of Sudan across the Western Upper Nile
region enters its second week.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which was announced on July 14, makes most of the
region inaccessible for the WFP and other relief agencies trying
to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to 150,000 people in an
area continually wrecked by war and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely worried that unless the ban is lifted soon,
we could be heading toward a humanitarian catastrophe, not unlike
the famine last year," said Ramiro Lopes Da Silva, WFP director of
transport and logistics, in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the region started fleeing their homes just
after the flight ban, said Silva.
</P>
<P>
Between February and April last year, a flight ban imposed by
the Sudanese government meant that little relief assistance could
reach the war- torn region of Bahr El Ghazal, quickly turning a
region into a famine zone.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement of the current ban, which covers five
main population and relief centers in Western Upper Nile, a WFP
team was forced to abandon food distributions in two relief
centers.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, WFP has had very limited
access to the Western Upper Nile region, often distributing food
on a "hit and run" basis, where WFP teams stay on the ground just
long enough to receive airdrops and hand out the food.
</P>
<P>
Flight approvals by the Khartoum government are normally issued
at the beginning of each month. The current flight denial to
Western Upper Nile was suddenly imposed in the middle of this
month.
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight
against global hunger. Last year, its relief workers fed 75
million people, including most of the world's refugees.

<HEADLINE> Britain's BBA China Factory Starts Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a factory for the
production of adhesive-bonded cloth in north China's Tianjin
Economic and Technological Development Zone began today. The
project is funded by the BBA Industrial Group of Britain, famous
around the world for its aviation industry and materials
technology.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the project occupies an area of 70,000
square meters, with a total investment of 68 million U.S. dollars.
The entire project is scheduled to be completed in April 2001, and
the factory's annual output is set at 16,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
The decision to establish this factory in Tianjin was made
according to a marketing survey, which showed that China is a
great potential consumer of sanitary products, especially those
for babies and women.
</P>
<P>
However, this aspect is only part of the BBA's business
exploration in China. The company also plans to invest 250 million
dollars to set up an industrial park in the zone, thereby turning
Tianjin into its production base in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The multinational BBA is one of the 250 largest British-listed
companies, and its adhesive-cloth division is the third-largest
producer in the world, with nine production bases in six countries
and annual profits of 650 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors across China recovered
880 million yuan (106.41 million US dollars) of potential direct
economic losses for the state through their investigations of
cases of official corruption in the first half of 1999, said Han
Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
at a national tele-conference here today.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, procuratorates at all levels

duty, conducted preliminary checks into 39,684 cases, and filed 18,
192 for criminal investigation, Han told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Prominent cases brought to the court by prosecutors include a
number of felonies perpetrated by high-ranking officials and law-
enforcement officials, both in the judiciary and the government,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited a case of smuggling in the city of Zhanjiang in south
China's Guangdong Province in which the municipal Party chief was
given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve; and a case in
which officials were executed for illegal dealings in the course
of the construction of a bridge that collapsed in Chongqing,
killing 40 people.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, procuratorates at all levels in China also
validated warrants for the arrests of 310,537 criminal suspects
during the first half of the year, after reviewing lists
containing 370,425 names proposed by police. Also during this
period, 282,236 suspects were brought into legal proceedings by
prosecutors.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Army Tuesday
unveiled a high technology digital communications systems which
will allow e-mails to be sent to the front line.
</P>
<P>
The new system will allow front line troops to communicate with

e-mail, said Major Alison Creagh of the army's 1st Joint Support
Unit.
</P>
<P>
The 120-million-Australian dollar (79.2 million U.S. dollars)
transportable communications system, which is called Project

<HEADLINE> Mining Ranks as Most Hazardous Work in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Mining ranks first in the list of
hazardous occupations in the Philippines, the Department of Labor
and Employment (DOLE) disclosed Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
But the report admitted the DOLE could not do anything about
the problem as "the mining industry is under the jurisdiction of
the Bureau of Mines which follows a different standard of health
and safety."
</P>
<P>
The report said a study of the DOLE showed that children in
small-scale mining were on top of a list of those with the most
threatening working conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Hazards ranged from working in make-shift tunnels to exposure
to toxic chemicals" said the report, adding that "children should
not be involved in any mining-related activities."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, most of the child miners were involved
in activities outside the mines like carrying sacks of rocks,
processing minerals and pounding stone.
</P>
<P>
Child miners worked for an average of 4 1/2 years for an
average of three hours a day on weekdays and 4 3/4 hours a day on
weekends and earned 200-2,000 pesos (5-50 U.S. dollars) weekly.
</P>
<P>
The report said the parents were aware of the side-effects and
hazards of mining but still allowed their children to work to
supplement the family income.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory diseases were the most common illnesses suffered by
the working children, followed by musculo-skeletal,
gastro-intestinal disorders and skin diseases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of illnesses can be attributed to the high level of
mercury and lead at the tunnel and poor work environment, which
aggravate the already heavy workload that children carry.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the observance of health practices to
avoid hazards posed by mercury and other harmful substance and the
use of masks and other protective devices by miners.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Information and Software
Industry Association (ISIA) of Hong Kong was established here

sustainable growth of Hong Kong's information and software
industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to announce the establishment of
the association, C. S. Ng, chairman of the ISIA, said that the
association is established to promote the standard, recognition
and profitability of the local information and software industry
and to expedite the development of high value-added information
and software services for the industries in Hong Kong and the
Asia-Pacific region.

A pamphlet of the association said that the objectives of the
ISIA is to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong information
and software industry locally and globally; to promote the
awareness and usage of information technology; and to provide a
forum for experience sharing and partnership facilitation.

<HEADLINE> China Applauds ASEAN Ties, Proposes Cooperation Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China said on Tuesday that its
friendly relations and cooperation with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) enjoy a solid foundation, promise
tremendous potentials and have broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the China-ASEAN Dialogue in Singapore, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also called for continued efforts to
carry out the principles and tasks set out in the China-ASEAN
Joint Statement so that their partnership of good-neighborliness
and mutual trust will grow more steadily.
</P>
<P>
China has become a full dialogue partner of ASEAN from a
consultative dialogue partner in only a few years, and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and ASEAN leaders held their first-ever
summit in 1997 and issued a joint statement, in which they
announced their decision to establish a 21st century-oriented
partnership of good-neighborliness and mutual trust between China
and ASEAN, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement "charts the future course and sets a
framework for the all-round and in-depth development of relations
between our two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The evolution of China-ASEAN relations is a process of
enhancing understanding and friendship, strengthening mutual trust
and cooperation, and expanding good-neighborly friendship," Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
"China-ASEAN friendly relations and cooperation based on the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are firmly founded and
widely endorsed, and promise tremendous potentials and broad
prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as countries in the world respect each other, treat
each other as equals, seek common ground while shelving
differences and conduct mutually-beneficial cooperation, they will
be able to co-exist in harmony and achieve common development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is useful experience gained in the ever-growing
China-ASEAN relations, and it serves the fundamental interests of
people of all countries, contributes to regional peace and
stability, and can facilitate the establishment of a new, just and
rational order of peace and cooperation," the Chinese foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Observance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the
purposes and spirit of the U.N. Charter as well as the principles
enshrined in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia
are the soul of China-ASEAN relations," he said. "It is also of
vital significance to the international relations and
international order in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"So long as we continue to pursue the objectives and implement
the principles and tasks set out in the China-ASEAN Joint
Statement with immense ardor and through concrete actions, our
cooperation in various fields will surely expand and deepen,
guided by the principles of reciprocity, mutual benefit and
complementarity, and our partnership of good-neighborliness and
mutual trust will surely grow in a more steady and sound manner,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"After many years of joint endeavor and continuous
explorations, I think we now have a clearer idea on how our two
sides should consolidate and develop our friendly relations and
cooperation and how we can bring such relations forward," Tang
told the dialogue meeting.
</P>
<P>
He summed up the general approach as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- First, to further generate concrete contents into the
partnership of good-neighborliness and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are to be made to strengthen the full dialogue
cooperation mechanism and maintain the friendly exchanges between
the two sides at all levels, in all fields, and through all
channels so as to enhance mutual trust and friendship, he said.
</P>
<P>
Within the overall framework of partnership of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust, and in light of the specific
features of the relations between China and various ASEAN
countries, further efforts have to be made to explore and identify
options for bilateral cooperation in the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, to open up multiple channels and employ multiple
ways and means to deepen and broaden the mutually-beneficial
cooperation in various fields with the focus on economic, trade,
scientific and technological cooperation, in accordance with the
principles of "equality, mutual benefit, efficiency, long-term
cooperation and common development."
</P>
<P>
As China and ASEAN countries are fairly complementary
economically, there is a huge potential for the two sides to tap
each other's markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, to expand regional and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are needed to increase regional and sub-regional
economic cooperation such as East Asia dialogue and cooperation
and the Mekong Basin development cooperation, to enhance
coordination and cooperation in the reform of international
financial and economic order, to reinforce regional multilateral
and bilateral security dialogue and cooperation, and to strengthen
mutual support in the United Nations and other international
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will attend the third
ASEAN plus China, Japan and ROK (Republic of Korea) informal
summit to be held in Manila of the Philippines in November this
year to exchange views and ideas with heads of state or government
of East Asian countries on the strengthening of cooperation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reiterate as well that China will take
concrete measures to support Southeast Asian countries' effort to
establish a nuclear weapon-free zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Fourthly, to proceed from the overall interests of regional
peace and stability, strictly abide by the political consensus
reached between China and ASEAN at the top level, persist in the
approach of seeking common ground while shelving differences, and
handle differences and disputes between the two sides by peaceful
means and through bilateral friendly consultations and refrain
from letting these disputes affect the vital interest of the
good-neighborly friendship.
</P>
<P>
As a good neighbor, good friend and good partner of ASEAN,
China has "witnessed with joy and admiration that the
long-cherished vision of the founders of ASEAN for 'ASEAN-10' has
been realized, and that positive progress has been made by ASEAN
in tiding over the Asian financial crisis and achieving economic
recovery," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of ASEAN tallies with the trend of global
multi-polarization, and an ASEAN that is united and prosperous and
strives for development through its own efforts is instrumental to
lasting peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are still many difficulties and challenges
facing ASEAN, after more than 30 years of development, ASEAN has
already emerged as an important force in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world at large, he said, adding that China will, as
always, support ASEAN in its effort to play an active role in
regional and international affairs.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Decreases in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's re-
exports, domestic exports and imports in June 1999 all registered
year-on-year decreases according to figures released by the Census
and Statistics Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) in June decreased by 5.3 percent over a year earlier to
110.6 billion HK dollars (14.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports was down by 3.7
percent to 95.3 billion HK dollars (12.2 billion U.S. dollars),
and that of domestic exports by 13.9 percent to 15.2 billion HK
dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports fell by 6.1 percent over a
year earlier to 115.7 billion HK dollars (14.8 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 5.1 billion HK dollars (654 million
U.S. dollars) was recorded in June 1999, which was smaller than
the deficit of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1999 as a whole, the value of total
exports was lower by 7.4 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that export
performance had improved in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the decline in export prices, total exports
should have decreased only moderately by around 3 percent in real
terms in the first half of 1999 over a year earlier, compared with
a 10 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Underlying this improvement was the rebound in exports to a
number of East Asian markets, amidst economic recovery in the
region, according to the spokesman. The pick-up in exports to the
United States also contributed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that the decline in imports moderated
significantly in June, suggesting possibly some renewed intake of
goods for local use. Meanwhile, the visible trade deficit
continued to shrink in June as compared with a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Continues in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A new armed group in Somalia,
the Digil Salvation Army (DSA), is increasing its war efforts in
and around the Qoryoley town, about 120 km south of Mogadishu, the
Somali capital, with the aim of what they called liberating the
grip of Hussein Aidid's faction from the town.
</P>
<P>
The latest such clash took place early Tuesday morning.
However, an official for Hussein Aidid had denied that any of his
men was killed in Tuesday's confrontation.
</P>
<P>
An official from Hussein Aidid's side confirmed to the press
that the leader of the attacking Garreh militiamen has been
apprehended unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the DSA has 150 armed men from the Garreh clan.
</P>
<P>
The mainly Garreh clansmen fighting in the name of DSA are the
second dominant people around the town of Qoryoley who had been
allegedly annoyed by excessive taxes imposed by the militiamen of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid for all commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Only two days ago, the DSA launched their first attack against
the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid in Qoryoley town. About five
people were known to have died during that fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Garreh clansmen, mainly nomads, are believed to have had
close ties with the Ethiopian-backed Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) based in Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's supporters in Qoryoley town accuse the
Ethiopians for supplying weapons and military personnel to the RRA
and other Somali clans in their effort to destabilize Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Although calmness has returned to the town around noon Tuesday,
the tension is still high. More armed clashes are being expected
as the retreated DSA fighters could launch their insurgencies any
time against Hussein Aidid's men in Qoryoley town.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals continued
growing in Hong Kong, with the June total reaching 817,070, up 7.7
percent on June last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released Tuesday by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
This was the twelfth consecutive month of growth, particularly
from key Asian markets, said Douglas Gautier, HKTA deputy
executive director.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Provided there is no setback for the rest of the year,
total arrivals in 1999 should top 10.2 million, more than six
percent above last year and almost double the growth rate forecast
at the beginning of the year."
</P>
<P>
The short-haul markets continue to produce the best results,
especially from the South and Southeast Asian countries and
Chinese mainland, helped by attractive tour pricing fueled by keen
market competition.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in the first half of 1999 were up 11.4 percent
to just over five million, with the mainland accounting for almost
30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong hotel average occupancy rate for the January-June
period was 77 percent, compared with 72 percent in the same period
of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua)-- Despite the recent heat wave, there
has been a decrease of heatstroke cases, but a staggering rise in
the number of people suffering from summer colds in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since June 23, when a heat wave with temperatures topping 40
degrees Celsius descended north China, Xuanwu Hospital in the city
has seen a dramatic rise in the number of patients stricken with
colds.
</P>
<P>
Director Liu of the hospital's outpatient department said that
most of the patients are old people with fevers symptoms. He said
that these fevers are often induced by low indoor temperature
produced by air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The patients remain cool at home, but are suddenly exposed to a
high temperature when they go outdoors, causing the colds.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that indoor temperatures be kept in a range of 25-
26 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave caught Beijingers by surprise, and now swimming
pools and lakes are full of people, prompting the Beijing Daily to
say today that "it is hard to tell if there is water in the crowds,
or crowds in the water."

<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has all
along attached great importance to the improvement and development
of Sino-U.S. relations, a senior Chinese trade official said today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), told U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce David
Aaron, who is here for a two-day visit, that keeping sound and
stable ties between the two countries accords with the common
interests of both, and is conducive to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
However, barriers affecting the further development of Sino-U.S.
ties, including in the economic and trade sectors, still exist,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the United States properly handles the
incident of the U.S.-led NATO's attack on Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, and take concrete actions to make an explanation
satisfactory to the Chinese people and government, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister also said that the Cox report is based on
sheer fabrication, and has enormously poisoned the atmosphere for
economic and technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Cox report has seriously reduced U.S. technology export to
China, he pointed out.

</P>
<P>
Aaron, in his own name, expressed sorrow over the bombing of
the Chinese embassy. He said that the U.S. hopes to expand
economic and trade cooperation with China, and engage in
constructive negotiations and dialog with China.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng also briefly

<HEADLINE> Youth Urged to Uphold Science and Oppose Superstition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Special Commentator's article
released by the Xinhua News Agency today calls on the youth of
China to become an effective force for upholding science and
opposing superstition.
</P>
<P>
"With the Party Central Committee's decision to ban Falun Gong,
and the revocation of the Research Society of Falun Dafa and its
subordinate organizations, the Chinese people have come to
recognize the true face of Falun Gong," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Founded by Li Hongzhi, the Falun Gong organization was banned
by Chinese authorities last Thursday as an "illegal organization"
spreading superstition and fallacies and disrupting social order
in the name of physical fitness exercises.
</P>
<P>
Although a very small number of the Falun Gong practitioners
are young people, members of the Communist Youth League of China
in particular, we should not underestimate the harm and influence
that Falun Gong could do to the young, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
"Arming the youth with scientific theory and calling on them to
advocate science and eradicate superstition is a matter of
importance that concerns the future and destiny of the Party and
the country, and will always remain an important task for us," the
article continues. "Young people should become an effective force
for advocating science and opposing superstition, and firmly fight
against Falun Dafa, founded by Li Hongzhi."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the glorious tradition of Chinese youth's advocacy of
science, the article mentions the May 4 Movement of 80 years ago,
when young Chinese held high the banner of patriotism, progress,
democracy, and science, and spread Marxism in China to enlighten
the broad masses.
</P>
<P>
After a half-century of struggle under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, the Chinese people finally founded the
People's Republic of China and embarked on the path toward
prosperity, democracy, and civilization, the article says, adding
that Chinese are becoming increasingly aware of the role of
science in social life and the progress of mankind.

"Only by depending on science can we promote national
development and get an upper hand in the international arena in
the future," the article says. "To meet the challenge of
international competition, we have mapped out a strategy for
invigorating the country through science and education."
</P>
<P>
The article also calls for modern young Chinese to inherit and
carry forward the glorious tradition of the May 4 Movement, study
hard, and acquire scientific knowledge to achieve success.
</P>
<P>
Referring to science and superstition as two opposite forces,
the articles says attitudes toward these two forces impact social
development in differing manners. "Young people should master
modern scientific knowledge and firmly fight against superstition
to become an active force for promoting social progress and
carrying out the historical mission of revitalizing the Chinese
nation."
</P>
<P>
"Marxism provides a scientific world outlook which is already
proven by history, and is a strong weapon enabling us to
understand and reform the world," the article says. "Only when we
firmly believe in Marxism, can we advocate science and oppose
superstition effectively."
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that the fight against the fallacies
of Li Hongzhi will help youth to distinguish science from pseudo-
science and materialism from idealism, and realize the difference
between a healthy and civilized lifestyle and a fatuous and
unhealthy lifestyle, and thereby become an effective force for
advocating science and eradicating superstition.
</P>
<P>
Calling on youth to arm themselves with scientific theory and
knowledge and a scientific world outlook and staunch faith, the
articles concludes by saying that the growth of a new generation
is the hope of the socialist cause and the hope of the Chinese
people as they aim to achieve prosperity in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily On Struggle Between Materialism &AMP; Idealism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, today published a signed article highlighting
the confrontation between materialism and idealism and warning the
Chinese people against any individuals or groups spreading
idealism through vulgar means.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, an organization named Falun Gong has, in the
name of science and physical fitness exercises, fanatically spread
idealistic concepts by some extremely vulgar means," says the
article, written by Yue Yan and titled Watch Out And Recognize
Idealism In Vulgar Forms -- An Analysis Of the Nature Of Falun
Dafa.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong (or Falun Dafa) organization was banned last
Thursday by Chinese authorities as an illegal organization
spreading superstitious and heretical ideas and disrupting social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The Falun Gong issue has sparked a struggle between atheism
and theism, superstition and science, and idealism and materialism
in China," says the article.
</P>
<P>
It has also highlighted the importance and urgency of carrying
out education on dialectic and historical materialism and
promulgating modern scientific and cultural knowledge among all
members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the entire
Chinese people, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
"Idealism advocates theism and attributes the development of
the objective world to supernatural forces, thus creating gods,"
explains the article, adding that the so-called "God's will" is in
fact the will of man. It points to the fact that leaders of many
superstitious and cultist organizations, in order to attain
certain specific political and social objectives, often disguise
themselves as "prophets" or even "gods" to deceive the public.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi, founder and head of Falun Gong, is just one such
person," says the article.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, all Marxists are atheists and their
ideals and beliefs lie in the realization of socialism and
communism, which is a scientific belief established on a realistic
foundation.
</P>
<P>
"The great achievements the Chinese people have scored in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics have proved the
realistic nature of socialism, as well as the fact that socialism
and communism are a scientific ideal which can be realized some
day," it notes.

<HEADLINE> Senior PLA Officer Meets Malaysian Army Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), has warned Lee Teng-
hui to immediately stop his separatist activities or he will "pick
up stones to have his own feet squashed."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark here today while meeting with Malaysian Army
Commander Mohd Hashim Hussein and his party.
</P>
<P>
Fu descried Lee's separatist rhetoric calling for cross-straits
relations to be "state-to-state relations" as "a dangerous step
forward toward splitting China."
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has the determination and strength to defend the State
's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between China and Malaysia, Fu spoke highly
of the traditional friendship between the two countries and
peoples.
</P>
<P>
During the 25 years since the two countries forged diplomatic
ties, the bilateral friendly and cooperative relationship has
witnessed smooth growth in all fields, he said. Hashim's current
visit will "further promote understanding, friendship, and
cooperation between the two armed forces," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fu also cited Malaysia's adherence to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Hashim said Malaysia treasures its ties with China. The
maintenance and development of these ties is very important, he
told Fu.
</P>
<P>
Qian Shugen, deputy chief of the General Staff, was among those
present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily On Struggle Between Materialism &AMP; Idealism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article goes on to criticize the historical view of
idealism, which opposes to the power of material and mankind with
some kind of supernatural power, and goes further, denying the
progress of history and human morality.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from this historical view, Li Hongzhi has asserted
that human morality is constantly deteriorating and human society
has come to the brink of destruction, thus creating his doomsday
theory and proclaiming himself to be the 'savior' of the world,"
says the article.
</P>
<P>
The key purpose of Li's theory is to fundamentally deny the
progressive tendency of human history, deny the tremendous
accomplishments China has attained in the two decades of reform
and opening-up, and deny the significant changes and progress of
the Chinese people's ideological and mental outlook, the article
proposes.
</P>
<P>
The article concedes that under the newly established market
economic system, some signs of moral decline and social evils have
emerged in Chinese society, including interest-oriented human
relations, coldness and indifference between people, a few corrupt
officials who trade power for personal benefits and lead a
decadent life, rampant drug abuse, gambling and porno activities
in some places, widespread fakes and shoddy merchandise, and many
other commercial and financial frauds.
</P>
<P>
"However, we're firmly determined to find solutions to these
problems, one after another. And with the further development of
reform and opening-up, and with steady economic growth, we will
continuously find new and more effective solutions," says the
article.
</P>
<P>
The article also accuses Falun Gong, which persuades people to
give up all "desires, ideals and pursuits" and avoid social
practice and concentrate on Falun Gong exercise to "transcend the
secular world," of spreading a negative and idealistic philosophy
of life among the people.
</P>
<P>
"Without lofty ideals and persistent pursuits, human society
would never have been able to develop from its primitive stage
into the current nuclear age, and mankind would never have entered
the age of space flight," the article argues.

<HEADLINE> Sale of State-Owned Enterprises Earns Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A document available here Tuesday
from the Angolan Ministry of Industry showed that the southern
African country has obtained 42.86 million U.S. dollars through
sale of state-owned enterprises since the country implemented
privatization policy in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Of the 80 state-owned enterprises now privatized, 42 are still
in operation while production in the rest 38 has been paralyzed,
said the document.
</P>
<P>
Currently, according to the document, the sale of 25
enterprises are still under negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Angola announced to give up socialism in 1991. Since then, the
 government has been promoting actively the privatization strategy
in the hope to alleviate its economic burdens and increase
efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the privatization progress of large
enterprises taken over from former colonialists undergoes fairly
well, whereas those mis-managed or highly-indebted medium-sized
enterprises are rarely inquired.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fact that most of the buyers of the state-owned
enterprises are big foreign companies gives the government a
reason to worry about the declining national enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the fairness and transparency of the privatization
process, the government also resorts to public auction under
professional auction agencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Eddie Irvine won the Austrian Grand
Prix to throw open the Formula One world championship but he still
believed Mika Hakkinen is the favorite to retain his title.
</P>
<P>
Irvine's win at Austrian Grand Prix boosted Ferrari's hopes of
winning both the driver's and constructor's titles this season
since its number one driver Michael Schumacher broke his leg two
weeks ago at Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
Irvine's win at Zeltweg, his second this season, promoted him
within two points of Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
"The championship is certainly much more interesting now.
Hakkinen is the number-one threat in the points table and I'm
going to make a fight of it." said Irvine.
</P>
<P>
But Irvine admitted: "Mika is still the favourite. He's faster
at the moment, although Ferrari are working hard on improvements."

HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government said Tuesday that
fiscal prudence is important for Hong Kong's success.

the views on the budgetary strategy and the revenue and
expenditure proposals, including the call for the drawing up of
deficit budgets for 2000/01 and the years to come.
</P>

maintain a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the growth of
government expenditure commensurate with the growth rate of its
gross domestic product," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Prudent financial management is an important pillar of the
fiscal policy which Hong Kong has successfully followed for years.
It is vital to our economic well-being that we maintain that
fiscal prudence so as to retain the confidence of the
international financial community and overseas investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Events in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and their
impact on public finances have highlighted the importance, in
drawing up budget proposals, to give due regard to the prevailing
economic circumstances as well as the economic prospects in the
medium terms, the spokesman added.

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Arab Gulf states are expected to see their

<HEADLINE> HK Medical Expert On Causes of Osteoporosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Improper diet and inadequate
physical exercise are identified as the major causes of
osteoporosis that afflicts about half of elderly women in Hong
Kong, said a medical expert.
</P>
<P>
Edith Lau, an associate professor with the Chinese University
of Hong Kong (CUHK), told a press conference Tuesday that the diet
with high animal protein, high salt and low calcium is detrimental
to bones.
</P>
<P>
A CUHK research shows that the elderly who do not walk outdoors
every day are twice as likely to fall and fracture their hip than
controls, she said.
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis, which has become 300 percent more prevalent in
Hong Kong in the last 30 years, has drawn increasing attention in
the medical study. The decease features a reduction in bone
density and makes patients easy to cause fracture.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 3,920 elderly men and women fractured their hip due to
osteoporosis and the estimated 7,641 fracture patients in 2010
would bring a major burden to the health care system in Hong Kong,
according to the CUHK research.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prevention of osteoporosis, Lau noted
maintenance of an adequate calcium intake from childhood onwards
is important in maintaining bone density.
</P>
<P>
Absorption of calcium from green vegetables and soya products
are as good diary products, and increased intake of such foods
would be important in maintaining bone health, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, good nutrition should be coupled with exercise, she
said, adding that the CUHK is investigating the health benefits of
the traditional Chinese exercise Tai Chi (shadow boxing).
</P>
<P>
For clinical treatment, Lau said subjects at high risk of
fracture and with extremely low bone mineral density should
definitely be treated by drugs, noting that such drugs as
alendronate have been proved very effective in preventing
fractures.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Streamline Incentives for IT Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will streamline
various incentives and assistance given to the information
technology (IT) industry to enhance the IT development.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has been directed to streamline all
efforts made together with the Multimedia Development Corporation
(MDC), the Ministry of Energy, Communications and Multimedia and
other relevant parties, Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is to be the new
growth engine, it should be given special focus and thus the
National Economic Action Council (NEAC) has asked us to look into
this," the Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted him as
saying after launching MSC's Central Incubator in Cyberjaya near
here.
</P>
<P>
Among the incentives to be looked at in particular is the
venture capital of 120 million ringgit (31.578 million U.S.
dollars) launched last June which has received good response.
</P>
<P>
The role of the incubator is to create an environment conducive
to the development and growth of start-up IT and multimedia SMEs
within the MSC. Thus, Mustapa suggested that MSC status companies
relocate or site themselves in Cyberjaya to take full advantage of
the comprehensive and state-of-the-art infrastructure and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The MSC Central Incubator, located on the Mutimedia University
campus, involving an investment cost of 15 million ringgit (3.947
million U.S. dollars), will also be part of the Incubator
Information Exchange that will allow the sharing of resources and
networking with other incubators in Malaysia and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has targeted 1,000 IT and multimedia SMEs in the MSC
by the year 2003 from the current 400 with a forecast that they
would reach 700 by the year 2001, according to Mustapa.

<HEADLINE> China Applauds Ties With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China said Tuesday that its
friendly relations and cooperation with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) enjoy a solid foundation, promise
tremendous potentials and have broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the China-ASEAN Dialogue in Singapore, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also called for continued efforts to
carry out the principles and tasks set out in the China-ASEAN
Joint Statement so that their partnership of good-neighborliness
and mutual trust will grow more steadily.
</P>
<P>
"The evolution of China-ASEAN relations is a process of
enhancing understanding and friendship, strengthening mutual trust
and cooperation, and expanding good-neighborly friendship," Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
"China-ASEAN friendly relations and cooperation based on the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are firmly founded and
widely endorsed, and promise tremendous potentials and broad
prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as countries in the world respect each other, treat
each other as equals, seek common ground while shelving
differences and conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, they will
be able to coexist in harmony and achieve common development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is useful experience gained in the ever growing
China-ASEAN relations, and it serves the fundamental interests of
people of all countries, contributes to regional peace and
stability, and can facilitate the establishment of a new, just and
rational order of peace and cooperation," the Chinese foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Observance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the
purposes and spirit of the U.N. Charter as well as the principles
enshrined in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia
are the soul of China-ASEAN relations," he said. "It is also of
vital significance to the international relations and
international order in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"So long as we continue to pursue the objectives and implement
the principles and tasks set out in the China-ASEAN Joint
Statement with immense ardor and through concrete actions, our
cooperation in various fields will surely expand and deepen,
guided by the principles of reciprocity, mutual benefit and
complementarity, and our partnership of good-neighborliness and
mutual trust will surely grow in a more steady and sound manner,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
After more than 30 years of development, ASEAN has already
emerged as an important force in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world at large, he said, adding that China will continue to
support ASEAN in its effort to play an active role in regional and
international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Elect Indonesia's Leader Carefully, Says Megawati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- General Chairman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri
Tuesday said Indonesians should carefully make use of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) to elect its leader.
</P>
<P>
"The assembly reflects the people's aspirations. Through the
assembly we will show ourselves as a civilized nation. Carefully,
elect your leader," Megawati said at the commemoration of the July
27 tragedy attended by thousands of the party's supporters.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, 1996, the Megawati-led Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) was attacked by a group of people. As a result, dozens of
lives were lost, some supporters of the party disappeared, dozens
of buildings and cars were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Some people made accusations that the attackers were supporters
of the Soerjadi-led PDI, and some other attackers looked like
military personnel. However, there is no final result yet from the
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
After the bloody incident, PDI was formally divided into two:
Soerjadi's PDI which had strong support from the government, and
Megawati's PDI which later became PDI-P and recently won the 1999
general election.
</P>
<P>
Megawati noted that an attitude of anti-violence should also be
shown during the MPR general session, and people should remember
that the assembly is owned by the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she said, people should close ranks for the
country's unity in the future.
</P>
<P>
During the commemoration, Megawati asked her supporters to
recall the three-year-old tragedy, which she said was an
uncivilized action.
</P>
<P>
Violence, she said, will not provide a solution, therefore
supporters of PDI-P should not be easily provoked to commit acts
of violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the party Dimyati Hartono said if
Megawati is elected the next president, there is still a chance
for other groups to take part in the government.
</P>
<P>
During the election, PDI-P gained some 36 million votes, which
reflected the people's wish to elect Megawati their leader,
Hartono said.
</P>
<P>
However, some political elites tried to refuse the result of
the election, he added.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president. Megawati has
been nominated by the PDI-P for the upcoming presidential
election. She is in competition with incumbent President B.J.
Habibie, who is nominated by the Golkar Party.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Capital Hit by Rockets: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance fired three rockets into the Afghan capital of Kabul
Tuesday as the factional war in the country intensified, according
to a report of the Afghan Islamic Press.
</P>
<P>
The rockets landed near Khwaja Rawash airport early Tuesday
morning, however there were no immediate reports about damage and
casualty.
</P>
<P>
Artillery exchanges between the Taliban militia and the rival
Northern Alliance have intensified north of Kabul following the
collapse of peace efforts by tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are reported to have massed 20,000 fighters in
Tagab, Najrab and Koh-e-Safi areas but neither side has committed
its infantry to the battle so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report reaching here from Kabul said the
United Nations, Red Cross and Pactec group, a U.S.-based group
which transports foreign aid workers in and out of Afghanistan,
were forced to divert flights into Kabul early Tuesday after three
rockets struck the Khawaja Rawash airport.

<HEADLINE> Fixed Asset Investments in Cambodia Fall in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia attracted 201 million
U.S. dollars in fixed asset investments in the first six months of
this year, while the total investment to Cambodia in 1998 reached
910 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures obtained from Council for the
Development of Cambodia (CDC), local companies have a 34.36
percent share in the fixed asset investment, while the foreign
investment accounts for 65.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has become the fourth largest foreign investor in
Cambodia this year, with an investment of 13.8 million U.S.
dollars, after Thailand with 20.5 million U.S. dollars and the
United States with 16.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is on top of the investors list with 35.7 million U.S.
dollars and a share of 16.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which was the largest investor in 1998 with 146
million U.S. dollars capital investment, has just invested 4.2
million U.S. dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the investment capital this year went
down although the country's stability is much better as compared
with last years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cambodian economist, the decrease has several
factors, including the limited quota set by the United States on
garment exports and value added tax (VAT) which was implemented at
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The CDC had approved about 50 investment projects by the end of
June this year. The garment is still the largest investment
sector, attracting 44.3 million U.S. dollars. Others include
telecommunications, hotels and agro-industry.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's garment industry has seen dramatic growth in recent
years despite the regional crisis and local political turmoil, as
investors take advantage of its export quotas. But the sector is
affected this year by limited quotas from the United States.

Jerusalem Post Tuesday quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, the legislature and executive will be
entirely independent of each other, as they are in many European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Barak's coalition agreements with the partners of the
left-wing coalition One Israel all point to the various factions'
willingness to support such a move.
</P>
<P>
However, the religious parties in the government -- Shas,
National Religious Party, and United Torah Judaism -- will oppose
any attempt to introduce the change, which would bring some 18-24
new faces into the Knesset, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Barak's One Israel are also opposed to the
plan as are several opposition parties - including the Likud,
Shinui, and members of the National Union.
</P>
<P>
Several factors are being cited by the Knesset members as the
cause of the likely rebellion against the proposal, including
that it will cost lots of money a year and that the change must
not be introduced purely to serve the interests of Barak and his
government.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Knesset members will also mean an increase in
competition for jobs in the Knesset, and then in the next party
primaries there will be more challengers.
</P>
<P>
Barak's aim was to introduce the Norwegian law alongside the
bill to expand the government's size from 18 to 24 ministers.
</P>
<P>
This would allow Barak, who assumed office early this month,
to compensate those who missed a place in the Knesset and in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Barak's political adviser Roni Bondy Monday confirmed the
prime minister's intention to introduce a Norwegian law bill
after the Knesset's summer recess.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sees Recovery of Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The recent recovery in Egypt's
tourism sector has been reflected in investment in the country's
tourist projects, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian ministerial committee has recently approved the
implementation of 209 tourism projects, the English-language
newspaper said. It did not give details of the projects and the
time they will be put into operation.
</P>
<P>
The new projects, which are estimated to cost 5 billion
Egyptian pounds (1.47 billion U.S. dollars) will, among other
things, provide 20,000 hotel rooms. They will also create 90,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the aviation authority is working in
cooperation with the private sector to build airports in Mersa
Alam, Ras Sedr, Dabhaa and Alamein.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the private sector in building airports
designed to accelerate the movement of tourists in the country is
the first of its kind in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The move is viewed as part of the country's efforts to rally
support from the private sector for further improving the tourism
industry, one of the four main foreign currency earners of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism suffered a heavy blow in November, 1997 when
Islamic militants killed 58 foreign visitors in the southern
resort town of Luxor, 520 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that Egypt's tourism revenues dropped by 19.36
percent to 2.94 billion dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year from
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government newspaper said that Egypt has successfully
survived the crisis due to the efforts exerted by the tourism
sector and various government institutions.
</P>
<P>
The tightened security measures taken by the government in
tourist and archaeological sites across the country have played a
leading role in the campaign to overcome the challenge facing
tourism, the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is confident that tourist influx will be restored to its
heyday soon.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics, up to 2.14 million visitors arrived
in Egypt in July to December in 1998, up by 2.8 percent from the
same period in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Auto Output Drops 3.3 Percent in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's domestic motor vehicle
output in the first half of 1999 fell 3.3 percent from the same
period of last year to 4.93 million units despite brisk exports.
</P>
<P>
Production of passenger cars, buses and trucks decreased to 4,
931,940, marking the second consecutive first-half drop from year-
earlier levels, according to Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
An association official said that the shrinkage in percentage
terms, however, is a marked improvement from the 10.4 percent
contraction posted in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic auto output appears to have bottomed out," the
official said, adding "both domestic auto demands and exports to
Southeast Asian countries are recovering."
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, Japan's car output amounted to 4,
032,371, down 0.3 percent, with truck output dropping 14.9 percent
to 875,539 and bus output 20.9 percent to 24,030, the association
said.
</P>
<P>
In June, Japan's overall motor vehicle output sank 2.5 percent
from the same month last year to 858,095, down for the third
straight month from year-earlier levels, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's computer giant Great Wall
Technology Co., Ltd. will be listed in Hong Kong on August 5,
Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
According to information faxed to Xinhua by the Shenzhen-based
company, Great Wall is placing 355 million new shares at an issue
price of 3.15 Hong Kong dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of the share offer is for public subscription in
Hong Kong from July 26 to 30, while the remaining 90 percent is
allocated to international placing.
</P>
<P>
The company said its global recommendation campaign from July
14 to July 22 has been so successful that even after it raised the
price from the originally-planned 2.22 to 2.78 Hong Kong dollars
to 3.15 dollars, subscriptions by international investors hit
eight times over the total issue.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to raise over 184.4 million U.S. dollars
from the issue.
</P>
<P>
It plans to use the proceeds to fund the expansion of
production facilities and office buildings in connection with the
establishment of production facilities for hard disk drives for
personal computers and to invest in a joint venture project with
the U.S.-based Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to invest in Internet and mobile phone
development, company officials said.

<HEADLINE> China Sends 338,000 Laborers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China has sent more laborers to
work abroad these years and its overseas work force had grown to
338,000 by the end of June this year, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an increase of 14,000 people over the
end of June last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China made great progress in
signing contracts with developed countries in Europe and North
America while going on smoothly with large projects signed with
African countries, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
While the number of projects, especially large projects, kept
growing, the technical level of these projects has been upgraded,
too, according to the MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
China's labor export and foreign project contracts have been
growing rapidly since 1978, and there remains huge potential in
this market, for China's labor export accounts for only one
percent of the shifting work force in the world.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC has pledged to give a boost to the development of
foreign project contracts and labor export by granting more
companies access to the business and exploring the European market.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Meaningful Dialogue With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday reiterated his offer to India for a "meaningful
dialogue" to reduce tension and arms race in the region by
resolving the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks must be "result-oriented" if India is sincere to
resolve the Kashmir issue, and it must be "without any
precondition," Sharif said during his meeting with the media in
his chamber in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said it is in the interest of Pakistan and India to resolve
the Kashmir issue through meaningful dialogue. The resolution of
the issue would divert precious resources for the prosperity of
the masses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that the tension prevailing in the region is not
in the interest of India. "New Delhi is keeping a huge army of
over 600,000 in Kashmir. Spending a huge amount on it is hampering
the country's development activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that he had taken the decision to de-escalate the
Kargil situation in the best interest of the Pakistani nation.
Once the Kashmir problem is solved, resources of both Pakistan and
India could be diverted to economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's decision on Kargil is being appreciated.
"The ball is now in the Indian court and they must respond," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kargil has once again highlighted the urgency
to resolve the Kashmir issue, said Sharif, adding that after the
resolution of the Kashmir issue, the relations between Pakistan
and India would improve.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Kashmir issue is resolved, tension will persist,
something not good for the two countries," he noted.

<HEADLINE> PMC Holds Cautious View on Regional Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries and
their ten dialogue partners Tuesday echoed a cautious attitude
toward the recent signs of economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening plenary session of the Post Ministerial
Conference (PMC), many participants expressed the hope that ASEAN
and its dialogue partners should cooperate in addressing future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day conference are foreign ministers from the
ten member countries of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) and their dialogue partners such as the United States,
China, Japan, the European Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the PMC, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam said that Asia is now on the road to recovery, but "many
challenges remain".
</P>
<P>
The challenges include, he said, the slow and difficult
recovery process, the need of setting up social safety nets for
the poor, security issues, transboundary crimes and ASEAN's
solidarity and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He called on the dialogue partners to continue to cooperate
with ASEAN as the regional grouping prepares to face the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said: "There is
still a long way to travel before we can confidently say that
we've seen a resumption of sustained economic growth in East Asia,
and there are still many potential risks."
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia welcomes the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA)
adopted by ASEAN in 1997 as it is an ambitious range of
initiatives to hasten economic recovery and address the social
impact of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Downer said, will continue to work with ASEAN to
help it out of the depths of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement to the PMC, Singapore Foreign Minister
Shunmugam Jayakumar said the dialogue partners are invited to take
part in the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA).
</P>
<P>
The HPA, said Jayakumar, is "an outward-looking plan as it
represents an open invitation to our dialogue partners to
cooperate with us in the many areas for the next six years".
</P>
<P>
"The HPA outlines the immediate and long-term priorities of
ASEAN and provides a comprehensive list of activities that ASEAN
hopes to undertake to bring us towards the ASEAN envision in the
Vision 2020," Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out to
realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for the
region, adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis which began two years ago has caused
severe economic damage to many Asian countries, several of them
also suffering serious and political repercussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that many of these countries have started to
show signs of economic recovery and are recording positive growth
figures, "the reforms still need to run their course before we can
safely declare ourselves as out of the woods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Asian countries, the crisis also affected other
regions as it is an increasingly globalized world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To effectively resolve problems which have potential
transboundary effects, we need to work together and deal with them
collectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's ten dialogue partners are Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and
the United States.

<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Finance Ministry has
recently urged local finance departments to give top priority to
the anti-flood work in a bid to fend off damages that might be
caused by the coming summer floods.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has issued a directive requiring all local
branches to raise enough funds to support the reinforcement and
renovation of dams and other anti-flood structures.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged local finance departments to strengthen
supervision over the use of funds to ensure timely allocation and
avoid diversion of the funds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has called for increased efforts in
flood control along the Yangtze River earlier this month, saying
that the flood-control work is of great significance this year
since China is to celebrate its 50th anniversary and Macao is
expected to return to the embrace of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Allocate  $16M for Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to spend 1.2 billion
shillings (about 16 million U.S. dollars) on poverty eradication
programs in this fiscal year, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year from July 1 this year to June 30, 2000,
there would be no need to seek extra funds from local and external
donors if the allocation is well used, according to Kenya's
Poverty Eradication Commission.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Oluoch, an official with the commission, said Monday
that the major task of the commission was to ensure funds meant
for reducing poverty reach the needy without disappearing halfway.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen million Kenyans, 43 percent of the east African
country's population, are reportedly living under the poverty line
of one dollar per day.
</P>
<P>
Oluoch said that the commission had earmarked some money to pay
tuition fees for children from poor families in this fiscal year,
but he noted that in the past children from rich families also got
such money.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that an anti-poverty trust fund will be
set up for donors to contribute money and the fund will be managed
not by the government, but by a board of trustees.

<HEADLINE> Gap Widens Between Jewish, Arab Schools in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The gulf between Jewish and
Arab school children is widening in Israel, local daily Haaretz
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a report published by Israeli Central Bureau
of Statistics as saying that Arab pupils and students are
discriminated against in the allocation of funds compared to
Jews.
</P>
<P>
The report relates to the years from 1990 to 1996 during both
the Likud and Labor governments.
</P>
<P>
It said Arab children studied in more crowded classrooms and
received fewer classroom hours at all educational levels.
</P>
<P>
Beyond free services provided by the government, the overall
spending on other education services for Jewish household was
greater than for an Arab household. Per Jewish household could
get 441 shekels (about 107 U.S. dollars) a year, compared to 200
shekels for an Arab household.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the gap started to close in high
school education, with an increase in the allocation of teaching
hours to Arab schools during the period.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a Jewish high school class was allocated 58.3 weekly
teaching hours compared to 53.9 hours for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report claims former Likud Education Minister
Yitzhak Levy failed to implement a planned five-year program
decided on by the previous Labor government to improve Arab
education.
</P>
<P>
The new Education Minister Yossi Sarid, who took office early
this month, has said he will take positive measures to better the
lot of Arab school children.
</P>
<P>
Israel has a population of 6 million and one-fifth of it are
Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Submits Budget Proposal to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
submitted Tuesday to Congress a proposed government budget of 651
billion pesos (16.3 billion U.S. dollars) which clearly defines
the government's spending strategy for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Our spending strategy for the year 2000 calls for a more
intensified focus on strategic areas and sectors which will
ultimately make our economy robust enough to fulfill its growth
potential," the president said in his Budget Message to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Estrada cited agriculture, education, housing and local
governments as the main areas which will receive substantial
budgetary support.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, agricultural development will be
bolstered by the creation of a 21.8-billion-peso
(545-million-dollar) fund to support the implementation of the
Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural development is imperative not only because of its
strategic linkages in the economy but primarily because it will
help alleviate poverty," the president said.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 118 billion pesos (3 billion dollars) has been
proposed for the education sector.
</P>
<P>
"Education and skills development provide our people a chance
to participate in the opportunities offered by greater economic
activity and trade in a globalized world," the president pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The government's housing program will be supported by 5.9
billion pesos (147.5 billion dollars), which represents an
increase of 84 percent over the 1999 allocation of 3.2 billion
pesos (80 million dollars) and intended primarily for socialized
housing.
</P>
<P>
Local governments will get a total of 131.2 billion pesos (3.28
billion dollars), with 121.8 billion pesos (3 billion dollars)
going to Internal Revenue Allotment, which represents an increase
of 26 percent from its 1999 allocation of 96.8 billion pesos (2.42
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We have infused more funds to local governments so that they
can have a wider leeway to extend their delivery of public
services, improve productivity, increase tax collections, and
ultimately reduce their dependence on national government
assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that the spending strategy for next
year calls for fiscal responsibility and discipline, including
operating on a reduced budget deficit and promoting efficiency and
accountability in the use of public money.
</P>
<P>
Next year's budget deficit has been estimated to amount to 40
billion (1 billion dollars) or 1.1 percent of the Gross National
Product (GNP), compared with the 68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion
dollars) or 2.2 percent of GNP in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Ready to Surrender to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces fighting the government from the jungles of the Rwenzori
mountain in western Uganda have accepted the presidential pardon
and is ready to give up.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter written to Second Division Commander of
the government army, Benon Biraro, the rebels expressed concern
over President Yoweri Museveni's recent announcement to pardon
them if they surrender before the army launches a mop-up exercise
in the jungles.
</P>
<P>
Biraro would travel to some western districts of the country to
meet those who want to surrender, the New Vision daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The army commander was quoted as saying that the rebels were
tired of fighting and wanted to put down their weapons and rejoin
their families.
</P>
<P>
Some of the rebels were misled and they saw no cause of
fighting against the government, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The rebels began to fight the government from early 1996 and
have committed abductions and killings, wreaking havoc in the
western region.
</P>
<P>
The government army has tried to corner the rebels by launching
numerous mop-up exercises, leaving little room for the rebels to
manoeuvre.
</P>
<P>
During touring the northern region of the country two months
ago, President Museveni said he would pardon those rebels fighting
the government if they would like to come out and surrender before
it was too late.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices End Lower in Tokyo For 5th Straight Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices finished lower in Tokyo
for the fifth consecutive trading day Tuesday, as traders took
profits after the key Nikkei index gained some 120 points during
the morning session.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 28.62 points, or 0.16
percent, from Monday's close to end at 17,462.72.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 2.21 points or 0.15 percent to 1,
434.11.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index touched the day's high of 17,613.24 before 10
a.m., when the dollar topped 117 yen, but lost ground soon after
as the U.S. currency slipped, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were affected by movements in the foreign exchange
market throughout the day, they said.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented blue chips were higher in early trading due to
the dollar's strength against the yen, but the issues lost their
early gains when the dollar turned down, leading the Nikkei and
the TOPIX lower, they added.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 462.53 million shares
from 395.38 million shares Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for New Int'l Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday called for the
establishment of a new international economic and financial order
and respect for the right of all countries to choose their roads
of development and economic models in efforts to achieve common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a dialogue meeting between ASEAN and its
dialogue partners in Singapore, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said uncertainties and volatility in the world economy
remain and the international economic relations are far from being
free of unfairness and irrationality.
</P>
<P>
The trade protectionism practiced by the developed countries is
on the increase and the amount of their official development aid
continues to decline, Tang told the opening of the two-day ASEAN
Post Ministerial Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
Harsh conditions are attached to aid and technology transfer to
developing countries and plans for international financial reform
have failed to fully reflect the interest of the developing
countries, he said, adding that the gap between the South and the
North is still widening.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, he noted, has shown that the global
economy is closely interconnected and the different economies of
the world "rise or fall with one another."
</P>
<P>
Without the development of the vast number of developing
countries, the economic growth of the developed ones cannot last
long, he said.
</P>
<P>
World peace depends upon the establishment of a new
international economic order, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tang expounded on China's positions on efforts to realize the
goal of common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
-- It is important to respect the sovereignty of all countries
over the right to choose their roads of development and economic
models, respect and support developing countries in formulating
and implementing development strategies and policies suited to
their realities according to their specific national conditions
and the order of priority.
</P>
<P>
-- It is important to establish a new equitable and reasonable
international economic and financial order.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries have been integrated into the process
of economic globalization under unequal conditions, they are
therefore weak in terms of international competitiveness and
vulnerable in terms of the capability of withstanding risks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
New rules in international economic, trade, financial and other
fields must reflect in an equitable manner the interest of
developing countries, fully guarantee their rights and interests,
and embody the principles for exchange and cooperation featuring
mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, consensus and
incrementalism, he said.
</P>
<P>
-- It is important to strengthen the mutually beneficial
cooperation in the economic field and trade, and science and
technology in particular.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial to and serves as an impetus to global economic
development in the 21st century to optimize the economic structure
and accelerate scientific and technological progress, and
therefore cooperation between developing and developed countries
should be focused on science and technology, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the developed countries to increase
investment and strengthen technology transfer to developing
countries, and provide them with practicable assistance in
financial monitoring and regulation as well as monetary
cooperation, with a view to enhancing the capability of all
countries in meeting challenges brought by globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
-- It is important to promote regional economic cooperation for
common development.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic cooperation facilitates effective allocation
of resources in a larger area, helps the expansion of investment
and trade, and accelerates the process of drawing on each other's
strong points in economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
China supports ASEAN in its efforts for regional economic
integration, attaches importance to and takes an active part in
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Asia-Euro Meeting
(ASEM) economic and technical cooperation, and has made
unremitting efforts for Mekong Basin Development Cooperation and
other subregional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have gained, through this conference, a new understanding
of ASEAN's progress in promoting Vision 2020. We are pleased to
see the achievements ASEAN has made and stand ready to strengthen
cooperation with it so as to make greater contribution to
deepening regional cooperation in various fields," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The Vision 2020 is a long-term and broad blueprint for the
region, adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's foreign ministers and their counterparts from the
regional grouping's dialogue partners began a two-day dialogue
meeting Tuesday in Singapore after attending the ASEAN Regional
Forum Monday.

ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the General Staff of the
Turkish Armed Forces, said that the Turkish security forces hit
the camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) located in
northern Iraq, not in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian reaction to the two Turkish soldiers
who passed to the Iranian side of the border is "groundless."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit accused Iran of
supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) by replacing
neighboring Syria which supported the PKK.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's capture of two Turkish soldiers possibly
means that Iran is trying to distract its agenda due to the
troubles it has been having.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel paid a one-day working
visit to Egypt on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes Foreign Relations Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) passed the Foreign Relations Bill in a
plenary session here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, House Vice Chairman Hari Sabarno said
the bill, presented by the government on April 6 this year, had
been deliberated by all factions in Commission I on law, security
and foreign affairs comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of Commission I Aisyah told the session that it was
a very important instrument to boost establishment of the free and
active principle of the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
With the bill, she said, the House would have a greater role in
accordance with the establishment of foreign relations as such in
the matter of connecting or disconnecting diplomatic relations,
opening or closing down diplomatic representative offices and also
in the matter of deploying Indonesian peace keeping force abroad
which was previously decided by the president only.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the House will have a greater role and the government
should listen to the House opinions to decide it," she added.
</P>
<P>
Government representative Coordinating Minister of Political
and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung said it would be a basic norm
in applications of the Indonesian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a strong norm to boost Indonesian foreign policy
reaching its goal, also to strengthen our free and active
principle in foreign policy," Feisal said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be the first law the Foreign Affairs
Department had and would become a guidance in conducting foreign
relations.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the bill in April, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali
Alatas said there are four main reasons for the formulation of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
First, the bill will regulate the duties, rights and
responsibilities of all Indonesians involved in foreign relations,
be they civilians or members of the government. The authority of
Indonesians abroad will be strictly monitored.
</P>
<P>
Second, the bill will provide Indonesian citizens living abroad
with better protection, because it is in line with the preamble of
the 1945 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Third, Indonesia's goals in the international arena will only
be achieved if there is good coordination between the government
and non-governmental groups operating abroad.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the foreign affairs minister -- being the main person
dealing with international relations -- must be supported by
credible and competent staff.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the Foreign Relations Bill will also function as a
reference for international affairs.

LHASA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
of China has had 13 generals from Tibet over the past 50 years,
military sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Most of them came from serf families and rose up through the
ranks. As early as in 1955, when the PLA introduced the military
rank system, 5 Tibetans were given the rank of major general or
lieutenant general.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 8 more Tibetan officers were given the rank of major
general. All of them were the children of poor serfs.
</P>
<P>
Garma Cedain became famous for marksmanship and horsemanship
and was considered both intelligent and courageous. He was made
deputy commander of a military area command at the age of 35 and

<HEADLINE> Petrol Price Rises by Another 3 cents in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Shell is increasing petrol
prices by another three cents of the New Zealand dollar a liter,
the second rise in a fortnight in New Zealand, and more increases
are not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Tuesday quoted Shell as announcing it is
lifting wholesale petrol and diesel prices by three cents a liter
from Tuesday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Mobil, Caltex and BP (British Petroleum) are considering
whether to raise their prices in New Zealand, the Wellington-based
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Shell blames sharply higher international crude oil prices for
the latest increase.
</P>
<P>
Its spokesman said the three cent rise imposed by all petrol
companies in New Zealand two weeks ago is insufficient to recoup
the increased costs of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The six cent petrol price rise still leaves room for another
three or four cent increase, "but we're in a competitive market
and we want to remain competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest petrol price rise will take the price of Shell 91
octane to 86 cents of the NZ dollar (46 cents of the U.S. dollar)
a liter in the main centers in the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Anticipates East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Coordinating Minister of Political
and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung Tuesday said the Indonesian
government had been anticipating any result of the East Timor
direct ballot scheduled for August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate on the matter, of course," Feisal told reporters
after a session with the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He said whether East Timor would remain a part of Indonesia or
become independent, the Indonesian government had made
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to disclose what anticipation the
government had made.
</P>
<P>
"You needn't know that," he said, citing it was a government
authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would the Indonesian government do if
pro-integration group lose in the ballot, Feisal said: "Who said
that (prediction). Let East Timorese make decision. We'll
appreciate whatever they will be decided."
</P>
<P>
Under a United Nations-brokered agreement with Portugal,
Indonesia agreed to hold a direct ballot in August. The ballot
will allow the territory's people to choose whether their homeland
should become an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally
independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Have New Bank Notes in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two banks in Macao will have new
bank notes printed before Macao's power transfer from Portugal to
China and the notes will be put into circulation on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the Macao Currency and Foreign Exchange Authority,
the Macao branch of the Bank of China and Macao branch of
Portuguese Banco Nacional Ultramarino will share the issuance of 2.
2 billion patacas (275 million U.S. dollars) half-and-half.
</P>
<P>
The two banks joined hands to issue bank notes for the first
time in 1995 and they agreed that each would undertake half of the
new bank note issuance.
</P>
<P>
Some bank notes have worn out over the past several years and
the 10-pataca notes were put out of circulation not long ago. As a
result, the monetary market demands new notes, according to
sources with the Macao branch of the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
With the new century approaching, the two banks have to prepare
enough cash to cope with public worries about the millennium
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
The overall design of the new bank notes will remain unchanged
except for the new issuance date and signatures of bank heads. It
is believed that part of the new bank notes may go to the hands of
money collectors because the issuance will coincide with China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Budget for 2000 Free From Pork Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
proposed 651-billion-peso (16.3-billion-U.S.-dollar) budget for
the year 2000 would remain free of any form of pork barrel, a
ranking official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management said in a radio interview that the new budget would not
allow lawmakers to get their hands on funds intended for priority
pro-poor programs.
</P>
<P>
"Projects are integrated in the budgets of the concerned
departments. The money is relegated to line agencies, not to the
congressmen," Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada stressed lawmakers
can only identify priority projects for funding under the budget,
and only so long as these conform to the government's pro-poor
thrusts.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said the proposed 2000 budget would be "closely linked"
to the national budgets in the succeeding years to support the
Estrada administration's five-year medium term development plan.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget, he explained, was designed more to lay the
foundation for the country's sustained development.
</P>

Meanwhile, Diokno belied claims by some sectors that the 1999
budget failed to produce tangible results.
</P>
<P>
He said the first quarter of 1999 saw a seven percent growth in
government consumption expenditures and a 20 percent hike in
public construction.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts at pump-priming the economy, he said,
contributed to the two percent growth in the Gross National
Product in the first quarter.

Estrada presented to Congress Tuesday the proposed
651-billion-peso (16.3-billion-U.S.-dollar) budget for year 2000
focusing on four areas -- agriculture, education, housing and

<HEADLINE> Russia to Upgrade Nuke Arms if U.S. Breaches ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has threatened to upgrade
its nuclear forces and take "other asymmetric measures" if the
United States violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The threat, from an unidentified Russian Defense Ministry
expert, came after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill on
the development of a national anti-ballistic missile system, a
move that has prompted criticisms from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the bill was a sign of double standards in the
American diplomacy, the Defense Ministry expert said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of "working and taking practical steps
which do not simply contradict the spirit and aims of the ABM
treaty but openly lead to its destruction."
</P>
<P>
U.S. calls to modify the ABM treaty were in fact attempts to
emasculate the 1972 treaty and legalize its activity in the field
of the anti-ballistic missile defenses, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"If, in defiance of the common sense, the United States
continues its line of deployment of a national ABM system, which
we do not want, Russia will be forced to engage in the perfecting
of its strategic nuclear forces and the taking of other asymmetric
measures designed to raise its national security in new military-
strategic conditions," the expert warned.
</P>
<P>
"Russia was and remains a country of high technologies," he
said. "No one should have any doubts on this count."

<HEADLINE> UAE Population Growth Expected to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The population growth of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expected to slow down in the first
five years of next millennium, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the country's population growth rate will
fall from 6.5 percent to 2.9 percent, and the number of people
living in the UAE is expected to grow from the present 2.94
million to 3.48 million, says the study on development indicators
in the UAE, which was quoted by the Gulf News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court, the study
contains comprehensive data covering the years from 1975 to 1998,
which make it a main reference document for researchers,
investors and decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the workforce in the UAE has grown from 288,414
in 1975 to 1,378,390 last year, and the type of work people are
doing is changing.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the largest sector was construction, which accounted
for 26 percent of the work force, followed by the wholesale,
retail, restaurant and hotel sector, which made up 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, however, the wholesale, retail,
restaurant and hotel sector was the largest, making up 22 percent
of the workforce, pushing construction into second place with 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of the workforce is based in Abu Dhabi, which
is followed by Dubai and Sharjah, with 30 percent and 15 percent
respectively, the study says.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Mining Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's mining earnings decreased
in the first five months of this year to 205.3 million U.S.
dollars from 282.07 million dollars recorded in the same period of
last year, according to the Financial Mail weekly.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released by the Finance Ministry showed that
copper earnings fell by 37 percent while cobalt earnings rose by
15 percent in the five months.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, copper exports earned the southern
African country 143.3 million dollars, 61 million dollars came
from the cobalt exports and the remaining was from the exports of
other metals such as gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
Mining earnings dropped partly due to falling copper prices on
the international market because of low demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the five months, the total volume of finished copper
production fell slightly to 116,343 tons from 116,811 tons
registered during the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline in export earings of the mining industry could make
the copper-producing country need more external financing.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Conflict Derails Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The one-year conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has dragged down Zambia's
non-traditional exports by three percent because of the dwindling
demand of building materials in the DRC, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's earnings from non-traditional exports have declined by
three percent from 90.48 million dollars in the same period of
last year to 87 million dollars in the first four months of this
year, the Zambian Financial Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The directorate of macro-economics policy analysis in the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development said in its the Real
Sector Report for May that the fall in non-traditional exports
earnings has been evident in building materials.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from building materials have fallen by 47 percent from
2.98 million dollars registered in the first four months of 1998
to 1.6 million dollars this year because of reduced demand in the
DRC, Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a source close to the Export Board of
Zambia as saying that the DRC, which has previously been the
country's regional biggest export market, is now second with more
exports from Zambia going to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, for instance, exports to the DRC amounted to 32.8
million U.S. dollars while those to South Africa totalled 28.8
million dollars, but the situation has changed in the past two
years with exports to South Africa reaching 57.7 million last year
while those to the DRC were 38.4 million dollars.

NEW DELHI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Pointing to an industry
recovery, India's production of machinery and equipment grew 25

</P>
<P>
This is against the negative growth of 3.3 percent recorded
during April-December 1998, the local newspaper Economic Times

</P>
<P>
The surge in production is due to the "growing demand from
industry which is creating fresh capacities and inducting new

"Both these developments signal a pickup in business
expectations and industry's determination to take on the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Major Vocational Guidance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's biggest vocational
guidance program was launched Tuesday to further decrease
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to provide information on vocational courses
which would help the unemployed youth to find jobs easily in the
future, a Labor Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A number of mercantile and state sector institutions took part
in the program to create an awareness among the participants about
available vocational courses relating to the fields of computing,
accountancy, management, jewelry and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent of the labor
force in 1998 from 10.4 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate fell steadily, considering the rate of 12.3
percent in 1995, 13.8 percent in 1993 and 15.9 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent study conducted by the Labor Department
reveals that the majority of unemployed youth in the country who
possess better educational qualifications are still among the
unemployed due to their lack of knowledge on certain employment
avenues.
</P>
<P>
The program is open to parents as well for them to know about
the jobs that their children are going to do according to their
educational qualifications and abilities.

<HEADLINE> Divorce Rate in Shanghai up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 27 (Xinhua)-- A more open and tolerant society
has resulted in a growth in the divorce rate in the metropolitan
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu District civil affairs bureau approved divorces for
1,650 couples last year, 2.6 times the number in 1989 and 33.3
times that of 1979.
</P>
<P>
A survey the bureau did last year found that 36 percent of the
respondents cited incompatibility and 22 percent, extramarital
affairs, as the cause of divorce. Drug addiction and excessive
gambling or dancing were blamed for 12 percent of the failed
marriages.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haiyan, the bureau's division chief, says that people of
Shanghai have become more demanding about their sex life in
marriage and that those divorces resulting from "incompatible
character" are in many cases due to an inharmonious sex life.
</P>
<P>
Xu Anqi, an expert on marriage at the Shanghai Academy of
Social Sciences says that the rise in divorce rate is normal and
understandable and that the demand for quality in a marriage
should be respected.
</P>
<P>
She says that China's divorce rate is still quite low when
compared to the West. A recent study showed 0.5 percent of Chinese
women in the age range of 25-44 divorced and that ranks 121st in a
listing of 129 countries.

<HEADLINE> Fall in Gold Prices Leads to High Sales in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The steady fall in gold prices
in the world markets over the last few weeks has brought good
business to jewelry shops in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The recent decline in gold prices, following the sale of vast
reserves of gold by countries like Britain and South Africa, and
the proposed sale of bullion by Switzerland, has led customers to
crowd into various jewelry outlets in the UAE, said the
Dubai-based Khaleej Times daily.
</P>
<P>
The customers want to avail themselves of the crashing prices,
which are at a 20-year low, the paper quoted jewelry store owners
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most shops have seen a 30 percent increase in their usual
summer sale, said Tushar Patni, President of the Abu Dhabi Gold
and Jewelry Group.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we have decided not to have the
Abu Dhabi Gold Festival this year, because business is already
good," he added.
</P>
<P>
He anticipated that a steady decline in gold prices by 3-4
percent until the end of the year was likely, before prices
started steadying again.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that at least 65 percent of the population in the
UAE buy gold at one time or another, and the per capita
requirement is one ounce, which equals 35 grams. Arabs and
Indians are the biggest buyers of gold in this country.
</P>
<P>
The UAE imported about 26.7 tons of gold in the first quarter
of this year, compared to 25.3 tons in the same period last
year.

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) --Fuzhou, the capital of China's
Fujian Province, plans to develop ways to encourage the city's
sluggish real estate market.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, they will include lowering prices
for apartments on the market, simplifying procedures for getting
housing loans, and rescinding rules that limit the sales of state-
subsidized apartments on secondary markets.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, 1.59 million sq.m. of
apartments were sold, worth about 2.06 billion yuan, according to
the Fuzhou City Real Estate Administration.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 734,000 sq.m. of apartments, office
space, and other space on the market. China has long suffered from
a nationwide glut of apartment dwellings and different places are
being encouraged to try different ways to help reduce the
stockpile.

<P>
The first grape festival was held in 1990 to mark the 2,100th

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Sovereignty Principle, U.N. Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China said on Tuesday that
upholding the principle of sovereignty has become all the more
necessary in the present-day world where there is a severe lack of
equilibrium in the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a dialogue meeting in Singapore between ASEAN
and its dialogue partners, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
also stressed the importance of respect for the role and authority
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
the purposes and spirit defined in the U.N. Charter and the
norms governing international relations advocated at the Bandung
Conference, Tang said, are still of strong vitality and practical
significance today.
</P>
<P>
These are the basis of a new international political, economic
and security order and carry the hope of a lasting peace for the
world, Tang told the opening of the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
The core of these principles and norms is mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Countries, big or small, strong or weak, are all equal before
the principle of sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reality that globalization has made national interests
closely intertwined cannot alter the effectiveness of the
principle of sovereignty, nor can it change the unlawfulness of
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"When the reality is marked by a severe lack of equilibrium in
the balance of power in the world, upholding the principle of
sovereignty has become all the more necessary. This is especially
true of the vast number of developing and small and medium-sized
countries, whose sovereignty and independence are the basic
prerequisite for their subsistence and development," the Chinese
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the claim such as "the supremacy of human rights over
sovereignty" and "there is no national boundary in safeguarding
human rights" are in essence excuses for strong countries to bully
weak ones and attempts to have a rationale for big countries to
control small ones.
</P>
<P>
Disputes among states, he said, can only be resolved peacefully
through dialogue and negotiations on the basis of mutual respect
of sovereignty. "This should be an important principle for the new
international order."
</P>
<P>
"What is equally important is that the role and authority of
the United Nations must be respected," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
As an association of sovereign states, the United Nations has a
major responsibility for easing up regional conflicts, promoting
disarmament and boosting world peace, cooperation and development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It (the United Nations) cannot be replaced by any other
international or regional organization or any group of nations in
terms of its standing," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"To bypass the U.N. and its Security Council so as to have
one's own way will definitely weaken the pillar for the
international security system and bring chaos into the
international order," he said.
</P>
<P>
When mankind is about the enter the 21st century, what should
be the guiding principles for international relations, what should
be the guidelines for the handling of international affairs and by
what means should world stability be promoted are the questions
which "bear upon whether the human society can be free of the
havoc of war, win a lasting peace and realize the rosy dream of
establishing a new world of equality, cooperation and prosperity,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Hegemonism and power politics can not provide a secure and
reliable international peaceful environment of long-term
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
While hegemonism and power politics may prevail for a certain
period of time, they do not, in the final analysis, conform to the
historical trend of multipolarization and globalization, nor do
they serve the common interest of the world's people, or represent
the direction in which human civilization develops, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's EPZ Exports Goods Worth US$475 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The industrial units in the
Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ) of Bangladesh exported
products worth about 475 million U.S. dollars during the 1998-99
fiscal year ending on June 30, a newspaper report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total employment in the CEPZ has exceeded 50,000 and
foreign investment there had gone up remarkably, the Independent
quoted CEPZ sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 57 units among the 90 industrial units in the zone
are 100 percent foreign investments and they are owned by
investors from the United States, Hong Kong, Japan, Pakistan,
Malaysia, Thailand, Germany, Britain, Denmark, Sweden, South
Korea, the United Arab Emirates, China, Singapore, France, Canada
and other places.
</P>
<P>
The products made in the zone include electrical equipment,
electrical components, electronic goods, software, optical goods,
woven and knitted fabrics, engineering products, footwear, toys,
medical instruments, pharmaceuticals and ready-made garments.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 30 industrial units are now under the
different stages of implementation and of them, 23 units are
foreign-invested. With the completion of the 30 units, the total
industrial units in the zone will increase to 120.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two EPZs in this South Asian country and
the other one is the Savar EPZ, which is located in the suburbs of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132 industrial units are engaged in production in
the two EPZs, while 101 others are being set up. Investment in the
two EPZs, which have employed more than 81,000 people, reached 391
million dollars in the July 1998-May 1999 period against 71
million dollars during the corresponding period of the last fiscal
year, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Fresh investment in the EPZs in the next two years will likely
be 600 million dollars for 200 new enterprises, officials
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has decided to set up three more EPZs
in Mongla, the country's second largest seaport and the
northwestern Ishwardi and southeastern Comilla districts with a
view to attracting more foreign and local investment for the
country's industrial development.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Importance of Principle of Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China said on Tuesday that
upholding the principle of sovereignty has become all the more
necessary in the present-day world where there is a severe lack of
equilibrium in the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a dialogue meeting here between ASEAN and its
dialogue partners, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the
purposes and spirit defined in the U.N. Charter and the norms
governing international relations advocated at the Bandung
Conference are still of strong vitality and practical significance
today.
</P>
<P>
These are the basis of a new international political, economic
and security order and carry the hope of a lasting peace for the
world, Tang told the opening of the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
The core of these principles and norms are mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Countries, big or small, strong or weak, are all equal before
the principle of sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reality that globalization has made national interests
closely intertwined cannot alter the effectiveness of the
principle of sovereignty, nor can it change the unlawfulness of
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereignty state," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"When the reality is marked by a severe lack of equilibrium in
the balance of power in the world, upholding the principle of
sovereignty has become all the more necessary. This is especially
true of the vast number of developing and small and medium-sized
countries, whose sovereignty and independence are the basic
prerequisite for their subsistence and development," the Chinese
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said claims such as "the supremacy of human rights over
sovereignty" and "there is no national boundary in safeguarding
human rights" are in essence excuses for strong countries to bully
weak ones and attempts to have a rationale for big countries to
control small ones.
</P>
<P>
Disputes among states, he said, can only be resolved peacefully
through dialogue and negotiations on the basis of mutual respect
of sovereignty. "This should be an important principle for the new
international order."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urges Dialogue Partners to Join Regional Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Tuesday called on its 10 dialogue partners
to participate in a regional development plan.
</P>
<P>
In the opening statement to the Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC), Singapore Foreign Minister shunmugam Jayakumar said the
dialogue partners are invited to take part in the Hanoi Plan of
Action (HPA).
</P>
<P>
The HPA, said Jayakumar, is "an outward-looking plan as it
represents an open invitation to our dialogue partners to
cooperate with us in the many areas for the next six years."
</P>
<P>
"The HPA outlines the immediate and long-term priorities of
ASEAN and provides a comprehensive list of activities that ASEAN
hopes to undertake to bring us toward the ASEAN vision in the
Vision 2020," Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region, adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes measures to deal with the financial crisis
and its fallout, transnational issues, as well as many other
important subjects, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenge facing ASEAN now is to continue to adhere
to the reforms against the backdrop of "glimmers of hope on the
horizon."
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis which began two years ago has caused
severe economic damage to many Asian countries, several of them
also suffering serious and political repercussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that many of these countries have started to
show signs of economic recovery and are recording positive growth
figures, "the reforms still need to run their course before we can
safely declare ourselves as out of the woods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Asian countries, the crisis also affected other
regions as it is an increasingly globalized world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To effectively resolve problems which have potential
transboundary effects, we need to work together and deal with them
collectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the future direction of PMC, Jayakumar suggested that some
follow-up mechanism will be established so as to provide
continuity and direction to what was discussed at the previous
PMC.
</P>
<P>
"Various suggestions have been made," he said, citing as an
example the proposal that dialogue partners may work with the
various ASEAN sectoral subcommittees to follow up on their
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he said, the foreign ministers at the PMC
will discuss the future of the conference during "an extended
lunch," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to allow the ministers an opportunity to
brainstorm on how to revitalize the Post Ministerial Conferences
and the dialogue relationships," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PMC followed the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on July 23
and 24 and the ASEAN Regional Forum on July 26. Singapore, as the
current ASEAN chairman, presides over all these meetings.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners are Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Groups Urge House to Support NTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) on Monday
urged the House of Representatives to maintain normal trading
relations with China, which they view as vital to promoting
American business and consumer interests in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining open ties with China is critical for businesses in
every corner of this country," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President
and CEO Thomas J. Donohue said, quoting trade data as showing that
about 200,000 jobs and 18 billion U.S. dollars in exports depend
on trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Donohue made the appeal just before the House is to vote on a
bill concerning Normal Trade Relations (NTR) with China on Tuesday.
He called on the House to vote for the NTR, a move he described as
"the right step for American business, workers and consumers."
</P>
<P>
"As China offers to open its vast markets as part of its bid to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO), U.S. exports are poised
to grow tremendously. A strong House vote on NTR is important to U.
S. negotiators' efforts to secure a WTO deal that will benefit
American business," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
He noted "a policy of engagement with China promotes U.S.
interests on issues of vital importance, including security, non-
proliferation, the rule of law, and human rights as well as trade.
"
</P>
<P>
The Chamber, the world's largest business federation
representing over three million businesses and organizations of
every size, has been working hard to mobilize grassroots support
for China's NTR.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 115 state and local Chambers of Commerce
around the country have joined the U.S. Chamber-led "Chambers for
China Trade," an expanding group aimed at boosting U.S. trade with
China, said a news release from the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
It will also continue to press for permanent NTR status for
China upon conclusion of a commercially meaningful WTO agreement
between Washington and Beijing, Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dianne Sullivan, NAM director of trade policy, said
in a press release that "normal trading relations is not a favor
we are doing for China, it's a favor we are doing for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. economic health and expansion depends upon selling to
markets outside of our own," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
China, with one-quarter of the world's population, has a market
that offers "enormous potential for U.S. companies" and may bring
about "high paying, quality jobs, shareholder and retiree profits
and competitiveness" in the United States, she added.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan emphasized that cutting off normal trade relations
will only cede China's market to America's international
competitors, and hamper critical efforts to get China into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish and more than a little dangerous for the
most powerful country in the world to simply 'disengage' from the
most populous country in the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
As Congress prepares to vote on the NTR, U.S. lawmakers are
finding themselves bombarded by full-page ads and articles from
their hometown newspapers, as well as e-mails from business and
many other communities, calling for increased trade links with
China.
</P>
<P>
"There has not been an issue more heavily lobbied," the
Associate Press quoted Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the AP, each lawmaker has received a letter
recently from the Chamber of Commerce with state-to-state
statistics showing the value of trade with China. Citing as
examples, the figures from New York stood at 679 million dollars
in goods exported in 1998, and those of California 2.4 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Plunges, Export Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's trade deficit in the first
seven months of this year has plunged on the back of an export
recovery, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's deficit now stands at 167 million U.S. dollars, a
colossal decline of 1.2 billion dollars from the same period of
last year, according to Vietnam's General Statistics Office (GSO).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports over the first seven months rose 12.2 percent
to 6.166 billion dollars due to increased shipments of shoes and
higher oil prices, said GSO.
</P>
<P>
Imports of the country for the period fell 8.3 percent to 6.333
billion dollars, with the fall blamed on a downturn in foreign
direct investment and fragile domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 out of 15 Vietnamese major exports posted positive
growths.
</P>
<P>
Footwear exports grew 32.1 percent while textile and garment
exports increased 7.6 percent. Volume exports of oil, the
country's third largest export, rose 26.7 percent during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Exports of rice, Vietnam's top agricultural export, increased 5
percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>

38.8 percent; and groundnuts, 42.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises' exports grew 20.3 percent to 1.38
billion dollars while their imports grew 8.2 percent.

<P>
Motorbike imports fell 13.9 percent and those of automobile and
spare parts 36.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Village Of Twins in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The village of Bazhou in Central
China's Hunan Province is known as the "Village of Twins" because
its women for generations have borne twins.
</P>
<P>
The village with 427 families have 18 pairs of twins and even
when women marry outside the village they have a large chance of
giving birth to twins.
</P>
<P>
Shu Xiaoliang and Shu Xiaoyi, who are 61, are the oldest twins,
and the youngest are 2. Shu Xiaoyi said that villagers often
confuse twin brothers and sisters and there are many jokes about
this at the village school. He said that his mother's sister also
gave birth to twins and his wife's family has had this legacy for
three generations.
</P>
<P>
The chance of having twins is quite low, according to doctors
at Hunan Medical Sciences University, and the director of its
Genetics Lab, Xia Jiahui, said that the phenomenon here is still a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
The environment and medicine can affect the possibility, but
genetic factors are generally considered to have a major effect,
Xia said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
fast-tracking the development of airports nationwide worth 18.65
billion pesos (466 million U.S. dollars) to meet the deadline of
2004, a ranking official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera, secretary of the Department of Transportation
and Communication (DOTC), said in a report that DOTC's thrust is
to develop one airport of international standards in each of the
administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said DOTC, through the Air Transportation Office (ATO),
plans to expand existing runways, construct terminals and upgrade
facilities for night operations.
</P>
<P>
ATO is also encouraging the development of rural air transport
facilities so that small carriers can serve routes normally
thought of as unprofitable by the bigger airlines, Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Philippines has four international airports,
four alternate international airports, 12 trunkline airports and
36 secondary and 33 feeder airports.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the development projects of ATO are being backed
up by multilateral funding agencies and lending institutions,
Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that several lending agencies, such as the Asian
Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, are infusing
funds for the development of the different airports nationwide.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan medical authorities are
concerned over air pollution in the country's capital city and has
urged the government to take action to reduce the pollution, media
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A recent study on air pollution by a team of doctors has
revealed that air pollution in certain parts of the city is far
above the maximum permissible levels stipulated by the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the doctors, data on the
quality of ambient air in the city of Colombo was reviewed
together with blood lead levels of children living in close
proximity to a junction with heavy traffic throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Fifty of the children between one and 15 years of age had blood
samples for lead levels by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.
Demographic, environmental, behavioral factors and
neuro-development were also investigated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ambient air in certain areas in Colombo and lead levels above
permissible standards by the WHO were detected. Elevated lead
levels were found in traffic policemen and children who were
screened.
</P>
<P>
Children in particular inhale a proportionally larger air
volume, have a higher gut absorption rate of lead and are
particularly vulnerable to excessive lead, the sources added.

"The game against Brazil wasn't satisfactory, but we still hope
to qualify for the semifinals, so we'll need victories in both of
the upcoming games," Stielike said.
</P>

He also said the German team performed badly because its

<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Morgan White of the
United States claimed the Pan Am women's gymnastics all-around
title by skin of the teeth here on Monday, holding off heavily-
favored Canadian Michelle Conway by a slender margin of 0.031
points.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old American botched her vault routines, managing a
modest 9.087 points before putting herself together for a steady
and solid showing later on, which earned her a total of 37.649
points and a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
But the day-high performance was executed by White's closest
rival Conway. The inspiration for Canada's women team triumph on
Saturday churned out a superb 9.750 points for her near-flawless
floor exercise, but still missed out on the title with 37.618
points.
</P>
<P>
White's teammate Jennie Thompson added a bronze to the United
States by accumulating 37.236 points.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Bank Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans to
impose another round of bank capital increases after an ongoing
campaign is completed by end-2000, Journal newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu as saying a
further adjustment is necessary to further insulate the local
financial system from external shocks and give local banks more
muscle to compete on a regional scale.
</P>
<P>
Philippine banks at present observe a capital adequacy ratio of
10 percent, two percentage points higher than the internationally
observed level of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The capital adequacy ratio gauges capital strength in relation
to the so-called risk assets like loans and other credit
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
The higher the ratio the stronger the bank and those that fall
below the minimum must recapitalize, said Espiritu.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu pointed out that while present bank capital levels are
above the standards set by the Bank of International Settlements,
they are "still one of the lowest in the region in absolute
terms."
</P>
<P>
He said the combined capital of the three biggest banks in the
country "pale in comparison to Bangkok Bank or the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi."
</P>
<P>
Under the schedule set by the Philippine Central Bank,
universal banks or banks with expanded licenses to engage in
non-bank allied areas must have 5.4-billion-peso
(135-million-U.S.-dollar) capital by end-2000.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary commercial banks must maintain 2.8 billion pesos (70
million dollars), thrift bank within Metro Manila at least 400
million pesos (10 million dollars) and thrift banks outside Metro
Manila at least 64 million pesos (1.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the
central bank, has also acknowledged the possibility of imposing
another capital hike after the original schedule is completed.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said higher minimum capital would not only
encourage mergers and consolidations among local banks to face
stiffer competition but also enable the banks "to compete on a
regional basis."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities to Play Role in High-tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education has
outlined a program to encourage colleges and universities to play
a greater role in economic growth, especially in the high-tech
sector, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Wu Guilong, an
official from the Department of Science and Technology at the
ministry as saying that starting from next year, the state will
initiate "university-based high-tech projects" to bolster the
development of technologically advanced industries.
</P>
<P>
Through these projects, colleges and universities will
contribute more to developing key technologies for the country's
economic growth, upgrading traditional industries and speeding up
rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government has drawn up plans to stimulate knowledge
creation and technological innovation with the aim of speeding up
implementation of the strategy of "revitalizing the country
through science, technology and education", Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"A critical task for higher education institutions is to
nurture increasing numbers of specialized talents and to help
train highly skilled employees for enterprises," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
College teachers and students can operate high-tech enterprises
independently or set up industrialization centers around campuses.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities have become the backbone for
undertaking key national scientific projects and technology
upgrade programs for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Each year, colleges and universities are responsible for about
70 percent of programs sponsored by national natural science funds
and 14 percent of state key projects, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Aid Disparity Draws International Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The disparity in aid to
refugees has been a focus of criticism at Monday's U.N. Security
Council meeting on humanitarian assistance to refugees.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako
Ogata said Kosovo and other emergencies attracted more attention
than other refugee programs.
</P>
<P>
The Serb province has been the focus of unprecedented
political attention and material support and in particular by
Western countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Undeniably, proximity, strategic interests and extraordinary
media focus have played a key role in determining the quality and
the level of response. However, that has not been true, and
continued not to be true, in other situations, including some of
those in Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
During the council debate, Namibia's Martin Andjaba said the
level of financial and material assistance rendered to refugees in
other regions is far higher than what is available for Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I is unfortunate that selectivity is applied in providing
financial support," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, out of 1.6 million U.S. dollars requested
through the appeal for Angola, only 14 percent has been made
available and of 27.9 million dollars for Sierra Leone, only 26
percent have reached the agencies.
</P>
<P>
Gelson Fonseca of Brazil said Brazil is sympathetic to
international calls for the same level of interest and political
involvement for the African refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Robert Fowler said the perception that Africa's
conflicts are neglected in favor of those in Europe must never be
allowed to take root or the very premise of the United Nations
would be called into question.

STOCKHOLM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Portugal scored a lone goal
against Italy, winning the title of the European under-18 soccer
tournament in Norrkoping, Sweden on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decisive goal was netted in the 33rd minute by Joao Paulo
as the Portugese eleven resorted to aggressive tactics with a
string of attacks launched in front of the Italian goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
The Italians only intensified their attacks after the break and
especially after Portugal was reduced to ten men in the 64th
minute, but still failed to find the target as the Portugese were
unwilling to give up their hard-fought victory.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Rosario Rampanti explained that the defeat was
mostly due to mental pressure as the Italians failed to live up to
their competitive level as they were afraid of losing the match.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exempts Food, Medicine from Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Starting from Tuesday, U.S.
sanctions against Iran, Libya and Sudan will be eased to allow
American companies to sell them food, medicine and medical
equipment, Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions on food, medicine and medical equipment do not
generally advance our policy goals and may have adverse
consequences in the humanitarian realm," Eizenstat said in his
announcement.
</P>
<P>
But he said companies selling humanitarian goods would need
licenses from the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
New policy would offer American farmers the opportunity to sell
more than 13 million tons of grain, worth as much as 2 billion
dollars, to Iran, Libya and Sudan, administration officials
estimated.
</P>
<P>
The change of policy toward Iran, Libya and Sudan "should
provide U.S. farmers and businesses with a significant measure of
predictability and enhance their ability to establish markets in
every corner of the globe," the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the new rules easing
sanctions "could not have come at a better time."
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the Clinton administration announced a change in
U.S. policy to exempt food, medicine and medical equipment sales
from economic sanctions against Iran, Sudan and Libya. Since then,
an interagency task force has been working to write new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The easing of the economic sanctions against the trio of
countries was cheered by farm state lawmakers, who have pressed
the administration to help find new export markets for U.S.
growers facing some of the lowest grain and livestock prices in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
The new policy generally allows licensed companies to sell
"agricultural commodities and products that are intended for
ultimate consumption as food by humans or animals," Eizenstat
said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations do not allow sale of non-food agricultural
commodities such as cotton or tobacco, he said.

Italian club Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Lazio have agreed to pay 22 million pounds for the player in an

</P>
<P>
The deal now depends on the Frenchman agreeing to take a cut in

Speaking after Arsenal's 1-1 draw in a friendly against Monaco,
manager Arsene Wenger said: "We wait until tomorrow midday. If
there's no decision tomorrow morning then he has to come back (to
Arsenal)."
</P>
<P>
Lazio and Arsenal had previously failed to agree on a price for
Anelka with the Italians refusing to meet the 22m asking price.
</P>
<P>
Now the deal rests on Anelka agreeing to a lower salary package.
</P>
<P>
Anelka's agent, Marc Roget, said: "We have yet to reach an
agreement on Nicolas' personal terms, because Lazio have decided
they want to pay him four million less.
</P>
<P>
"But I am hopeful I can persuade Nicolas to accept the new
package and that a deal can be concluded."
</P>
<P>
Even if Anelka does agree to the salary cut, he will still earn
a reported 14 million over five years - 56,000 a week. Lazio have
also asked his agents to cut their fee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anelka's Arsenal team-mate and fellow Frenchman
Emmanuel Petit has criticised the 22m valuation.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about too much money for just one player,"
Petit said.
</P>
<P>
"If Anelka does leave, then we'll probably need to buy another
striker very quickly - but I'm more concerned about the money
involved."
</P>
<P>
Petit believes Juventus striker Thierry Henry, who has been
strongly linked with the Gunners would be an excellent replacement
if Anelka does move to Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I know Henry very well and I think he would be a great player
for Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"He could make a lot of difference for us," he added.

<HEADLINE> Snooker Star Clarke Fined for Marijuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Snooker star Scot Darren Clarke has
been fined 2,600 pounds after testing positive for marijuana
during a tournament.
</P>
<P>
Clarke submitted a positive urine sample on the day of his 5-1
defeat to Scotland's Chris Small at the Scottish Open in Aberdeen
in February.
</P>
<P>
He was fined 2,600 pounds by the World Professional Billiards
and Snooker Association, his earnings for reaching the second
round of the event after defeating Steve Davis.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the WPBSA's disciplinary committee, Clarke
confirmed the sample contained marijuana, which meant he was in
breach of two rules relating to the presence of banned substances.
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary committee automatically disqualified Clarke
from the tournament, leading to his forfeiture of the 2,600 prize
money and 855 ranking points.

<HEADLINE> Snooker Star to Sue Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Former world snooker champion Alex
Higgins announced that he is going to sue the tobacco industry,
according to local reports here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Belfast-born Higgins, who is suffering from throat cancer, said
he has instructed a Dublin solicitor to start legal proceedings on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
He claims he had no idea of the dangers of smoking and thinks
he has a very strong case.
</P>
<P>
He is joining in a court case being taken on behalf of up to
200 Irish people by Dublin solicitor Peter McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell said the snooker star's recruitment to the legal
proceedings would be "a great boost to the others fighting this
case".
</P>
<P>
The ex-champion looks gaunt and weak after more than 40 doses
of radiotherapy and an operation to remove a cancerous lymph node
in his neck. Many were shocked at his appearance at actor Oliver
Reed's funeral two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The man dubbed Hurricane Higgins in his snooker heyday has
described himself as "a living example of the damages of smoking".
</P>
<P>
He said: "I intend to fight this case to the end. It's easy to
stop smoking. I have a strong will-power. What chance has cancer
against me?
</P>
<P>
"Forget about cigarettes completely. I've got a taste for ice-
cream now. Generally, get away from the weed. It's going to do you
some sort of damage."
</P>
<P>
Higgins was 22 when he won snooker's world championship at his
first attempt in 1972, and repeated the feat in 1982.
</P>
<P>
In Tobacco Wars on Tuesday night, BBC1's history of the
cigarette, the legendary player blames the industry for his 30-
year habit and free cigarettes during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
But Higgins tells Michael Buerk that he believes he will beat
the disease.
</P>
<P>
With a voice reduced to a whisper by the cancer, he said he
felt "nothing but disgust" for the industry that still sponsors
all the major snooker tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco companies and snooker were as thick as thieves,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I think that they have got their advertising for a
song for 25 years. Cigarettes are everywhere in snooker. Freebies
everywhere. Most snooker players were given free cigarettes."
</P>
<P>
When Michael Buerk asked him if he was going to live, he said:
"Of course. I have got a heart like a lion."
</P>
<P>
Higgins was known as a 'flair' player and attracted an army of
fans. But he led a colorful life away from the sport and drank
heavily throughout his tempestuous career.
</P>
<P>
Both snooker and Formula One racing are rare exceptions to the
current ban on tobacco sponsorship of sport.

<HEADLINE> Match-fixing Suspensions 'Overdue' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan cricket chief Mujeebur
Rehman has insisted the suspension of three of the country's top
players is long overdue, according to the BBC reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Captain Wasim Akram and batsmen Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmed have
been removed from the national team pending investigations into
match-fixing charges.
</P>
<P>
Mujeebur, chairman of the ad hoc committee of the Pakistan
Cricket Board (PCB), said the three "will not be considered for
selection until the investigations are completed."
</P>
<P>
A PCB committee set up to investigate the matter and
recommended the players be suspended last year.
</P>
<P>
"I think the players should have been suspended there and then,
" Mujeebur said.
</P>
<P>
All three players have repeatedly denied any involvement in
match-fixing.
</P>
<P>
Wasim rejected the charges on British TV, saying: "I haven't
done anything wrong. I refute any charges, I always have done."
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Pakistan is that everybody gambles, rich guy,
poor guy, lawyer, they all gamble and when they lose they have to
blame someone so they blame the Pakistan team," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Marcelo Rios withdrew
from the Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament because of injuries
in both hips on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rios, fourth seed of the tournament, was to play Magnus Larsson
of Sweden on Tuesday. Instead, he was replaced by lucky loser
Paradon Srichaphan of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Rios, the world's 13th-ranked player, was very successful in
the ATP Tour last year, winning seven titles and once became world
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
However, injuries have dragged him back this year, including a
bad back that kept him from playing Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"It's been the worst year of my career," he said. "It's the
first time I'm so injured in four years."

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Arrives in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin arrived in Washington Monday and is expected to meet
Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton Tuesday to
repair U.S.-Russia relations strained over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
They will talk about economic and security issues. "The focus
of the discussion will primarily be economics, as that is the
focus of Stepashin's portfolio," National Security Council
spokesman Mike Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
"Given Russia's return to discussions with NATO, the president
will certainly discuss post-Kosovo implementation and explore ways
to further cooperation with the Russians on winning the peace,"
Hammer added.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin arrived in Washington from Seattle two days before
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board is due to approve a
new 4.5 billion U.S. dollar loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's visit is the first by a Russian prime minister
since former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned back to Russia
on the way to the U.S. after being informed that NATO started
bombing Yugoslavia in March.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing has pushed the Russian-U.S. relationship to its
lowest point since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's visit will be another effort to repair the ties
after Clinton and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, met in
Germany during the G-8 summit last month.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Warn of Another Refugee Crisis in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday warned the international
community of another refugee crisis in Kosovo in the wake of
increasing incidents in the Serb province recently.
</P>
<P>
The return of ethnic Albanians to Kosovo has coincided with the
expulsion, harassment and killing of people of non-Albanian
ethnicity, particularly Serbs and Romas, UNHCR Sadako Ogata told
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The council met in open session on humanitarian assistance to
refugees. Devoted mostly to African refugee problems, the UNHCR
also touched upon the issue of refugees in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata said the massacre of 14 Serbs last week is the
latest and most worrying such episode.
</P>
<P>
The international community, which has provided support to
Kosovo Albanians, "could not and must not tolerate that the end of
one refugee crisis overlapped with the beginning of another," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"Retaliation and revenge must not be allowed to prevail," she
added.
</P>
<P>
About 730,000 refugees have returned home since the end of
hostilities and the deployment of international forces in Kosovo
last month, while some 170,000 Serbs from the province have been
displaced recently, according to the number she gave.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits Two-Month High Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The euro hit two-month highs
against the dollar Monday, benefiting from broad dollar weakness
and stronger-than-expected consumer price data from North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's largest state.
</P>
<P>
The single currency rose as high as 1.0722 U.S. dollars, its
strongest since mid-May and 5.7 percent higher than the life low
of 1.0104 U.S. dollars hit less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Demand for euros has been mounting in the past week amid
expectations that economic activity in Germany, Europe's largest
economy, is picking up.
</P>
<P>
Such talk was triggered after a stronger-than-expected rise was
reported last week in the Ifo economics institute's west German
business climate index. German state consumer price data has
further stoked such speculation.
</P>
<P>
Data released Monday showed consumer prices in Germany's
North-Rhine Westphalia rose by a larger-than-expected 0.5 percent
in July and were up 0.8 percent from a year earlier, according to
a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar has suffered in recent days from losses
in the U.S. stocks and bonds amid concern that foreigners quitting
the U.S. asset market would sell dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also fell as low as 1.5121 Swiss francs
Monday, its weakest since June 11, and eased to a one-month low
against the pound at 1.5882 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there was room for the euro to rise to 1.0750 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Parity worries for euro/dollar are now over and we are
starting to get into new territory based on concerns about
generalized dollar weakness," Reuters quoted David Bloom, forex
strategist at HSBC Markets in London, as saying. "The big question
is: `Are currency markets adjusting to a new world order?'"

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Hails Arms Destruction in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday hailed the arms destruction in Liberia as a welcome
step and an important confidence building gesture.
</P>
<P>
The move implies that the countries of the region are committed
to fighting the illegal proliferation of small arms, and to
implementing the arms moratoria adopted by the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOMOG), he said.
</P>
<P>
"It signals that the peoples of the region will seek to settle
their disputes peacefully, through dialogue, and not through the
resort to arms," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the western African country's 152nd Independence Day which
fell on Monday, it held a ceremony to destroy arms and ammunition
collected by the United Nations and the Monitoring Group of the
ECOMOG at the end of a long time civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The burning of the weapons and ammunition began Sunday on the
Bomi hills near Tupmanburg, according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A German non-governmental organization GTZ has been contracted
to manufacture farming implements out of the leftover metal,
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.

a pair of golds in the men's and women's events.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Bernardo Segura and the 36-year-old veteran

raised the possibility in the testimony at the House Banking
Committee last Thursday. Greenspan will address a Senate panel
Wednesday.

Greenspan said the Federal Reserve must be "especially alert"
to inflation risks and be prepared to "act promptly and

<HEADLINE> Over 1 Million Work From Home in UK: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 1 million people in the
UK are working from home using new information technologies, said
a new report published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Institute of Employment Studies, also
forecast that in Britain, about 200,000 people a year will start
teleworking so that they can live and work in the same place.
</P>
<P>
The significant rise in teleworking was the results of many
organizations' decision to release staff from the drudgery of
commuting. Cutting numbers of people in the office also means that
companies can reduce costs through the amount of space they need
to lease.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, many British companies are beginning
to accept the idea of teleworking and there could be advantages
for other types of employees.
</P>
<P>
Disabled people, those who live in remote areas or who need to
stay at home because they have parents or children to look after
could all be employed as teleworkers.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the obvious advantages of not having to go
into the office every day, many people are put off by the thought
of loneliness, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Easing of Sanctions Helps Develop New Markets: White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- New rules easing U.S. exports
of food would "enhance" the ability of American farmers to develop
new markets, the White House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the Clinton administration announced a change in
U.S. policy to exempt food, medicine and medical equipment sales
from economic sanctions against Iran, Sudan and Libya. Since then,
an interagency task force has been working to write new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
And the new rules are expected to be announced at a news
briefing late Monday afternoon by the U.S. Treasury Department and
the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The change of policy toward Iran, Sudan and Libya "should
provide U.S. farmers and businesses with a significant measure of
predictability and enhance their ability to establish markets in
every corner of the globe," the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The easing of the economic sanctions against the trio of
countries was cheered by farm state lawmakers, who have pressed
the administration to help find new export markets for U.S.
growers facing some of the lowest grain and livestock prices in a
generation.

<HEADLINE> Political Will Urged to Solve Refugee Problem in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday appealed to African
governments to renew their commitments to resolve the refugee
problem through negotiations instead of force.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fundamental precondition for international support,"
UNHCR Sadako Ogata told the Security Council which met on
promoting peace and security: humanitarian assistance to refugees
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
She called for resources from the international community to
support the implementation of the Sierra Leone peace agreement and
the Lusaka agreement to cease fire in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) as the accords could help resolve some of the
worst refugee problems in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata said her office spends over 40 percent of its
resources in Africa which has about 6 million people of concern to
her office, including refugees and displaced persons as a result
of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Recent crises have added the number of the people "of concern,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Such people include over half a million Sierra Leoneans, the
260,000 Burundians and 150,000 people who have fled conflict in
the DRC, she said.
</P>
<P>
There are older, unresolved conflict situations which have
produced refugees many years ago, she added.
</P>
<P>
More than 370,000 Sundanese continue to be refugees in Uganda
and Ethiopia, and 120,000 Saharan refugees are still in camps in
Algeria and other countries, plus 150,000 Angolan refugees
elsewhere, she noted.
