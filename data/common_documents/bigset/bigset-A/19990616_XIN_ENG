<HEADLINE> Swiss National Jailed for Defaming Ghanaian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hubert Frank, a Swiss national,
was Tuesday sentenced to one month imprisonment in hard labor by a
circuit tribunal in Accra after he had been found guilty on a
charge of defaming Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
 The tribunal ordered that the accused be deported after
serving the sentence, the Ghana News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 But Frank, 48, a former supervisor of Bilfinger and Burger, a
German road construction company, pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
 Police Inspector E.K. Dunyo told the tribunal that in May,
1997, a worker of the company went to Frank and asked for
protective clothing before filling a silo with cement.
</P>
<P>
 The policeman said the worker requested proper dress, boots,
nose cover and goggles because the work environment was
"dangerous".
</P>
<P>
 However, Frank shouted obscene words against Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
 When the worker told him that he would report his utterances
to the police, he said, "with Ghana Police, it is a matter of
money."
</P>
<P>
 In his defense, Frank denied making those statements and said
he was framed up.

CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's sixth largest tire
maker, Italy's Pirelli, has held a majority stake in Alexo Tires,
one of Egypt's biggest tire producers, a spokesman for Alexo said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed recently by Egyptian Industry
Minister Suleiman Reda and Pirelli's president, Pirelli bought
some 998,820 shares previously owned by the public sector, said
the spokesman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Each share was sold at 160 Egyptian pounds (about 47.1 U.S.
dollars), he said, adding that the acquisition raised Pirelli's
stake in Alexo from 11 percent to about 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began the privatization process in 1995 to sell
state-owned enterprises to strategic investors. So far, one third
of the 314 targeted companies have been privatized.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's business daily Al-Alam Al-Youm has reported that
Pirelli will invest some 90 million dollars by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Pirelli has plans to increase export of
Alexo products to Europe to 66 million dollars by 2004 from 12
million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the company's shares are in the hands of
Alexo employees and the remaining 22 percent are owned by the
Egyptian-Saudi Industrial Investment Corporation (ESIIC).
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Pirelli will also buy another 8
percent stake from ESIIC within three months.
</P>
<P>
Pirelli's turnover in 1997 reached 3.2 billion dollars and
Alexo's sales stands at 200 million pounds (57.97 million dollars)
a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri on Tuesday announced
his resignation as leader of Israel's powerful religious Shas
party, paving the way for Shas participation in the incoming
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Deri, who made the announcement during a meeting with Shas
Knesset (parliament) members, said his resignation is aimed
at bringing about reconciliation and harmony among different
groups of the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who defeated outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in last month's elections, has vowed
to form a broad-based government which may include religious or
right-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
But he has been conditioning Shas' inclusion in the new
government on Deri's resignation because he was sentenced to four
years in prison for bribe-taking and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that a new title of Deri will be "Shas World
President" only in charge of the cultural and educational issues
of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Ultra-Orthodox Shas, which holds moderate stance on the
Middle East peace process, won amazing 17 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament) in the May general elections from last
Knesset's 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Deri's announcement Tuesday, senior Labor Party
member Matan Vilnai said the way has been cleared for conducting
negotiations with Shas over its joining in the new government.
</P>
<P>
The intense negotiations on formation of the next government is
under way and Barak should present his new government to the

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Chief Rules out Concern over Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- There is no ground for worries over
the stability of the euro though its exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar has been continuously dropping, the president of
German Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The common European currency has a very good perspective,
especially on a long-term basis," the central bank chief said
while giving a speech in the city of Halle.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the euro's exchange rate declined to 1.0392 U.S.
dollar, down from 1.0437 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Frankfurt said the market, more concerned about
Germany's domestic problems after the settlement of Kosovo crisis,
was waiting for Bonn's signal on domestic reforms, including the
government's tax reform plan and an austerity budget of the
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the euphoric assessment on the euro has been changed
into a realistic attitude in the financial market, commented
Tietmeyer.
</P>
<P>
But members of the Eurolands should take more responsibility to
secure the success of the European currency with better national
financial policy, he said, adding, "the common monetary policy
does not mean to relieve those countries' homework."
</P>
<P>
Only when all those responsible make their contributions, will
the euro be able to play a key role in the world monetary system,
Tietmeyer said.

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will join Cohen in

<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Tuesday expressed concern over the latest tensions between
Pakistan and India over disputed Kashmir, said the Pakistani
ambassador in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Pakistani Ambassador to Egypt Taeb Sideeki told
reporters after a meeting with Moussa that the Egyptian foreign
minister stressed the importance of reaching a peaceful solution
to the crisis, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between the two neighbors broke out on May 26 after
India accused Pakistani infiltrators of seizing the mountain range
on the Indian side of the Line of Control and shelled the area to
expel the penetrators.
</P>
<P>
The Line of Control is a cease-fire line signed in 1972 to
divide the two rivals. Pakistan has called for a peaceful solution
to the tensions. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz paid a
one-day visit to India Saturday, but the talks failed to break the
ice.
</P>
<P>
Sideeki said Egypt is a friendly country to both Pakistan and
India and might play a role in helping resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad is keen on realizing peace in the Indian
sub-continent in a bid to uproot the problem of Kashmir, Sideeki
said. But it takes two to tango, he stressed, in allusion to New
Delhi's hardline policy.

the capital Abuja, violence flared up in Nigeria's oil city Warri,
confronting the days' old civilian government with the first test.
</P>
<P>
The test starts when militant ethnic Ijaw youths set the entire
Itsekiri village of Aruton ablaze and killed more than 100
Itsekiris including many kids on the morning of May 30.
</P>
<P>
The accident rekindled a decades' old feud between the two
ethnic communities in the southern Nigerian city, which claimed
lives only several months ago. The Itsekiris waited no time in
fighting back, and this sucked in the Urhobos, who fought in
alignment with the Ijaws.
</P>
<P>
Death toll soon hit 300, with some areas of Warri city,
Nigeria's most important oil hub, virtually burnt to the ground.
The conflict also forced about 300,000 people to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The crisis also affected greatly the country's lifeline -- the
oil industry. Big oil companies like Shell, which has many of its
operations based in Warri, had warned of possible output
reductions.
</P>
<P>
Given Nigeria's total reliance on oil incomes and the new
government's ambitious plans on yet extremely tight fiscal
resources, the flare-ups in Niger delta, the country's oil tank,
are by no means a regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
To quench the flare-ups, Abuja urgently dispatched thousands of
soldiers into the region, who soon received order that they could
shoot on sight any rioters or violators of a curfew that Delta
state Governor James Ibori imposed on June 7.
</P>
<P>
In a quite unusual move, the new president, setting aside the
job of lobbying for his cabinet list, flew to Warri on June 11 to
meet leaders of major ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of the crisis was a 1997 decision by now
deceased dictator General Sani Abacha to relocate a local
government in Warri from a Ijaw dominant district to an Itsekeri
dominant area. The decision was originally to punish the Ijaw
community for its opposition to Abacha regime.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws' resentment on the relocation had been suppressed by
past military regimes until it boiled over at the beginning of
the new civilian rule when an Itsekeri was installed as the head
of the disputed local government. The morbid sentiment led to
the massacre in Aruton village.
</P>
<P>
But despite the apparent ethnic factors in the conflict, the
crisis is far from being just a tribal war and could find its
roots in the decades' long confrontation between local
communities and foreign oil companies as well as the federal
government. Poverty and a feeling of being neglected are actual
drives behind the bloody killings.
</P>
<P>
Warri, like other towns around the oil fields, presents a harsh
contrast of staggering wealth and appalling poverty. Heavily
guarded oil company compounds with swimming pools, satellite
telephones and supermarkets yards away from villages without
electricity, running water or a school. The western oil giants
like Shell, Chevron and Mobil siphoned back dollars that can only
be counted in astronomical terms, yet they feedback virtually
none.
</P>
<P>
Oil spills and decades of pollution and acid rain from gas
flaring have destroyed the livelihoods of the indigenous people.
Yet compensation for the devastating effects is always inadequate,
and often stolen by corrupt local traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Failure of the past military regimes to redress local
grievances and their deliberate manipulation of ethnic tensions
aggravated the sufferings of local people. These, along with the
excessive exploitation by the oil companies have driven the
indigenous peoples to the very edge of survival and fueled a
desperate competition among themselves for what little resources
are available.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian law, oil wealth belongs to the federal
government. For decades, Nigeria's ruling generals and the oil
companies have extracted billions of dollars a year from these
communities and returned only a nominal share in the form of
salaries and administration fees. That is why the controlling of
local governments has become a life-and-death issue for different
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that giving back a larger share of the oil wealth
both from the federal government and oil companies to assist the
development of the Niger delta is the key to prevent future
crisis in this region.
</P>
<P>
As a leader of Nigerian oil workers union has said recently,
only the immediate intervention of the Obasanjo government and the
establishment of a credible dialog among the communities, the
government and the oil companies on a fundamental restructuring of
economic and political institutions in the region can bring an end
to the bloody crisis in Nigeria's oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's government might have recognized the problems.
During a meeting with a foreign oil delegation on June 14, the
president urged the oil companies to do more for their host
communities either by way of financing local development programs
or providing more opportunities for the youths, who might
otherwise be idle or engaged in violence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier over the weekend, the president unveiled in Port
Harcourt, southern Nigeria, a government-assisted development
program for the Niger delta, which as some government officials
hailed, might hopefully put smiles back on to the lips of the
people in this region.
</P>
<P>
But given the overall tottering condition of its economy,
Nigeria still has a long way to go in bringing in real peace and
prosperity to the long-neglected region.

<HEADLINE> France Suspends Sale of Some Coca Cola Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- France suspended on Tuesday the sale
of the products of a Coca-Cola manufacturing plant in Dunkerque,
northern France, after Belgium and Luxembourg reported about 100
cases of intoxication of children who had drunk Coca-Cola made in
the factory.
</P>
<P>
France also reported two cases of light intoxication
resulting from drinking Coca-Cola bought at near Franco-Belgian
border, as two men suffered from digestive problems after drinking
Coca-Cola, said the office of the French State Secretary of
Health.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the toxication of the drink was linked with a
fungicide in the paint which could have contaminated the aluminium
containers of the drinks, said government officials of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Dunkerque Coca-Cola factory is the biggest provider of
Coca-Cola drinks in France, Britain and Benelux countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides Dunkerque, France has a second Coca-Cola plant in
Marseille.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Sets Strict Standards for Poor Nation Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 15 (Xinhua)--The seven wealthy nations (G-7) will at
this week's Cologne summit relieve up to 70 billion U.S. dollars
of debts owed by the world's 36 poorest countries, a German
minister said Tuesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But, the debt-relief initiative raised by Germany will not
benefit all the 41 least developed countries in the world, said
Development Aid Minister Heidemarie Wieczock-Zeul.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the 36 chosen countries must meet strict
standards set by the G-7, a bloc including Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, Liberia and the Republic of Congo have been excluded
from the list "considering their humanitarian and democratic
situations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The top demand to the chosen countries would be what
Wieczock-Zeul termed "reform programs" that would last for three
years before the actual start of the debt relief process.
</P>
<P>
The reform plans aimed at helping citizens in those 36 nations
should be hammered out after wide consultation, she said, adding
that the resources and funds released by the debt remission
process must be invested in public health care and education.
</P>
<P>
G-7 officials have drafted the formal text of the initiative
that is due to be adopted by their leaders on June 19 or 20, said
Wieczock-Zeul.
</P>
<P>
Totally, the 41 poorest countries have owed 157 billion U.S.
dollars to the wealthy nations. Thus some 45 per cent will be
wiped out under the plan, and in some cases 90 per cent, or even
100 per cent debt remission can be expected, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The water and sewerage
authority of Addis Ababa said Tuesday that it encourages people to
tap subterranean water in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The authority told the Ethiopian News Agency that it has so far
given licenses to 260 investors and various institutions to dig
deep-water wells in Addis.
</P>
<P>
It said various hotels, health institutions, manufacturing
industries, religious institutions and schools have been licensed
to tap subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
The authority pledged that investors who sink deep bore holes
would get all the necessary assistance from it.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa, with a population of 2.3 million, is a water
shortage city. The current water supply of 173,000 cubic meters
daily is only 70 percent of the water the city demands. For this
the city administration has launched two major water emergency
projects, the Dire Dam project and the Akaki Subterranean Water
Project, to curb water shortage in Addis.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Greets Obasanjo's Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Parliament Tuesday
congratulated General Olusegun Obasanjo on his inauguration as
Nigeria's 12th Head of State and third constitutionally elected
leader, the Ghana News Agency reported in Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
 Gen Obasanjo, in 1979 made history as the second African
Military Leader after the late General Akwasi Amankwaa Afrifa, to
hand over power to a civilian regime.
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to Parliament, Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyeman,
Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, said Gen Obasanjo's
return to power through the ballot box is an eloquent testimony to
the trust and confidence Nigerians have in him.
</P>
<P>
 It also shows their appreciation of the very good work he did
while in office between 1976 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
 The MP indicated that President Obasanjo has assumed office
at a very critical period in Nigeria's history with challenges
that are truly enormous.
</P>
<P>
 "For the majority of Nigerians, 38 years of independence out
of which 29 years have been under military rule, virtually brought
Africa's most populous nation to its knees."
</P>
<P>
 Mr Owusu-Agyeman, however, noted with dismay that the unity
of Nigeria at a point seemed to be under threat as intolerance,
inordinate ambition and high level corruption held sway.
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped the inauguration of Gen Obasanjo on
Saturday, May 29, would address these and others problems that
plague the Nigerian society.
</P>
<P>
 The Minority Spokesman said President Obasanjo deserves the
support of the International Community, especially, "we in the
sub-region bound together by ECOWAS, as he embarks on the path of
national reconciliation, regeneration and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
 Mr Owusu-Agyeman wished as he leads Nigeria on the path of
democracy, President Obasanjo should be inspired not only by the
massive vote of confidence given him by Nigerians, but "by the
prayers of all those of us in the sub-region, Africa and indeed
the whole of mankind".
</P>
<P>
 Concluding, the Minority Spokesman said, "we in the New
Patriotic Party (NPP) particularly, are most happy that the story
of President Obasanjo is yet another vindication of our long
cherished ideal of multi- party governance in a liberal democratic
environment with the ballot box as the centerpiece".
</P>
<P>
Members of the ruling party and the opposition including
majority leader, Kwabena Adjei, supported the statement, saying
it urged African leaders to realize that the democratic system of
government is the most ideal one for the continent.
</P>
<P>
 African leaders, they said, should, therefore, take a cue
from the Nigerian experience, because authoritarian rulers have
woefully failed the continent.
</P>
<P>
 They also commended President Obasanjo for his role in
international politics, saying, he has contributed in no small
measure to ensuring peace and stability in most parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of the Ghanaian lawmakers that with the
return to the track of democracy, Nigeria would continue to lead
the continent onto the path of democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes German Plan on EU Railway Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- France called on Germany on Tuesday
not to present its project on privating railways in Europe at the
meeting of transport ministers of European Union (EU) countries to
be held on Friday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transport and Equipment Jean-Claude Gayssot
expressed his hope that Germany, the rotating president of the EU,
would withdraw its project on liberalizing the railway industry in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has written to German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, saying that a privatization of
railway industry should not be on the present EU agenda.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French economic daily Les Echos to be
published on Wednesday, Gayssot said that such a project would be
a ``bad blow'' on European railway industry.
</P>
<P>
``New private operators will not buy but the most profitable
parts, while leaving the rest of the traffic to the present
(public) railway companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot said that France will rally countries opposing
privatization of railways at Friday's meeting, such as Belgium,
Luxembourg, Italy and Portugal, to torpedo the German plan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlements Denounced as Harmful to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a U.N. conference on
maintaining Palestinian rights ended their two-day gathering here
by denouncing Israeli settlement construction in the occupied
Palestinian land as harmful to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including legal experts, diplomats and
peace activists, also called on Israel to adhere to the Fourth
Geneva Convention, which prohibits activities such as annexing
land and building up a civilian population in occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
The conference was a preparation for a July meeting in
Switzerland that could begin a process under international law for
incriminating Jewish settlements. At issue is the land seized by
Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, which includes the West
Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We need it badly and urgently," Palestinian observer to the
U.N. Nasser al-Kidwa told the nearly 200 participants.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss conference, which was originally due in April, was
postponed until July 15 and the participants insisted it not be
postponed again. "A proposal to postpone it practically means an
end" to efforts aimed at putting the conference together, al-Kidwa
said.
</P>
<P>
He did not say who might propose a postponement. Israel and the
United States opposed the U.N. General Assembly's February
decision to hold the conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have not held substantive peace
talks partially due to Israel's construction of Jewish
settlements, a policy adopted by outgoing hardline Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu since he took power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has decided to cut
advantages received by the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The final document from Cairo's meeting described the Israeli
settlement activities as "detrimental to the (Middle East) peace
process."
</P>
<P>
It also expressed "serious concern" about a host of Israeli
"grave breaches and violations of the Geneva Convention," such as
arbitrary detention, torturing Palestinian civilians and
destruction of the economic and social structures of the occupied
territories.

<HEADLINE> Most of S. African Provincial Premiers Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight of South Africa's nine
provinces have new premiers Tuesday with the re-election of
Western Cape premier Gerald Morkel being the most eventful, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Morkel of the New National Party (NNP) was elected to serve a
second term as more than 4,000 demonstrators protested outside the
provincial legislature in Cape Town, and the African National
Congress (ANC) boycotted his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who once tried to storm the entrance of the
legislature building, were angry about the fact that the ANC was
excluded in the coalition government although it won the greatest
number of votes in the province in the June 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
The NNP and the Democratic Party will form a coalition
government and the provincial cabinet is expected to be announced
by Morkel Friday.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, where negotiations on a coalition government
are still under way, the premier will only be elected Friday, when
most other premiers are also scheduled to be formally inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
Mbhazima Shilowa, was unanimously elected as premier by the
Gauteng legislature.
</P>
<P>
Shilowa is expected to announce his new executive council, or
cabinet, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the Free State legislature, Winkie Direko's election as
premier to replace Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri was greeted with
praise-singing from the public gallery and promises of cooperation
from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Cape Premier Makhenkesi Stofile, Northern Province
Premier Ngoako Ramatlhodi, North-West Premier Popo Molefe and
Northern Cape Premier Manne Dipico were re-elected for a second
term in office.
</P>
<P>
Mpumalanga's new premier, Ndaweni Mahlangu, issued a blunt
warning that even the slightest infringement of civil service
regulations would result in immediate disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
Mahlangu extended a hand of friendship to the legislature's
four opposition parties, stressing that the ANC would not use its
overwhelming majority to bulldoze them.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the DP, NNP, United Democratic Front and Freedom
Front all pledged their support for Mahlangu's planned reforms but
warned that they were elected as "watchdogs and not loyal
lapdogs".

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Officials Discuss Kosovo, Nonproliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian security official on
Tuesday called attention to the need for disarming the Kosovo
Liberation Army who are infiltrating the Yugoslav province as NATO
units enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"They threaten the safety of both the local population and the
peacekeeper units and hinder the withdrawal of Yugoslav army and
police forces," said Vladimir Putin, head of the Russian Security
Council, in a telephone conversation with U.S. National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
"This calls for immediate steps to disarm the so-called Kosovo
Liberation Army as prescribed by the U.N. Security Council
resolution of June 10," the Interfax quoted Putin as saying in the
conversation taken place at the U.S. side's initiative.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo, Putin said the problem
"must be resolved in the light of Russia's interests in the
Balkans and the role played by this country in the Kosovo
settlement," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
A united command can be set up with the inclusion of Russian
officers in the command structures of the multinational forces, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The two also discuss bilateral cooperation in nonproliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery platforms.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, 15 trucks carrying food, water,
fuel from Uglevik, Bosnia, arrived Tuesday evening at the Pristina
airport where about 200 Russian peacekeeping troops are stationed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops arrived in Pristina early Saturday, taking
NATO by surprise. Days of talks have failed to break an impasse
over Russia's peacekeeping role in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
NATO has divided five peacekeeping sectors in Kosovo to be
controlled by troops from Britain, the United States, Germany,
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
Russia does not want its troops to be under NATO's command and
wants full control of a sector of its own in the northern part of
Kosovo where many ethnic Serbs live.
</P>
<P>
More talks are scheduled. Defense and foreign affairs chiefs of
Russia and the United States are expected soon in Helsinki,
Finland, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S.
counterpart, Bill Clinton, will continue to talk about Kosovo
during the G-8 summit scheduled for June 18-20 in Cologne,
Germany.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is scheduled to pay an official visit to Russia next week, a
U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a press question, Fred Eckhard, the U.N.
spokesman, told a news conference that "Yes, in fact, he is
planning a trip to Russia to an official visit in a planning stage
for a time."
</P>
<P>
At the end of his Russian tour, Annan is expected to start an
unofficial visit to the United Kingdom, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will offer detailed information on the proposed
visit at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Annan is starting an official visit to Russia at a time when
Washington is eager to wipe out the standoff between Russian
troops and NATO forces in Kosovo, a Serb province.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who has helped mediate a peace in Kosovo, has sent its
troops into Kosovo in advance of NATO forces and the move caught
NATO off guard.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council,
has long been condemning the 79-day bombing of Yugoslavia by the
U.S.-led NATO, which was suspended on June 10 shortly after
Belgrade accepted a peace plan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asked to Clarify Positions Towards Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will seek clarifications
from the U.S. concerning U.S. criticism of two Cypriot political
parties in relation to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, government
spokesman Costas Serezis said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Acting Foreign Minister, Finance Minister Takis Klerides will
meet U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Brill concerning the position of the
American embassy towards the Democratic Party (DIKO) and
left-wing AKEL party," Serezis said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, DIKO and AKEL expressed dissatisfaction with a
U.S. embassy statement that party members had not accepted
invitations to embassy sponsored events in recent weeks, but only
went to the embassy to demonstrate against NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the
U.N. Security Council, unilaterally launched two-and-half months
air strikes against Yugoslav Serb targets since March 24 after the
Serb-led government refused to accept a peace agreement to grant
greater autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in
the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Rallies organized by DIKO, AKEL and other Cypriot political
parties condemned the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an AKEL spokesman said that diplomatic missions
should respect political parties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, DIKO president Spyros Kyprianou said after
his meeting with President Glafcos Clerides that the government
would try to establish whether the American remarks reflect
Washington's views or whether the embassy position was decided
locally.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Tuesday called for an immediate political settlement to
the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"I am dubious and concerned about the future of Kosovo. There
is a possibility that Kosovo is to be divided into several
sectors and this will bring about certain consequences," Ecevit
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian speedy deployment in Kosovo and the ongoing
sporadic fightings, Ecevit said that "a very dangerous process"
has started.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the political settlement to the problem should be
put on the agenda as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are the close relatives for the Kosovars and their
problems are our problems, " Ecevit added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the NATO military equipment and
ammunition which had been brought to air bases in the air bases
in Bandirma and Balikesir, western Turkey, is being sent back.
</P>
<P>
The Bandirma and Balikesir as well as Incirlik Air Base
were supposed to be used by NATO in an attempt to intensify
air campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Visit Russia Next Week  (Updated with background information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is scheduled to pay an official visit to Russia next week, a
U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a press question, Fred Eckhard, the U.N.
spokesman, told a news conference that "Yes, in fact, he is
planning a trip to Russia to an official visit in a planning stage
for a long time."
</P>
<P>
At the end of his Russian tour, Annan is expected to start an
unofficial visit to the United Kingdom, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will offer detailed information on the proposed
visit at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was in Moscow on April 28-29 in connection with
is efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan is starting an official visit to Russia at a time when
Washington is eager to wipe out the standoff between Russian
troops and NATO forces in Kosovo, a Serb province.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who has helped mediate a peace in Kosovo, has sent its
troops into Kosovo in advance of NATO forces and the move caught
NATO off guard.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council,
has long been condemning the 79-day bombing of Yugoslavia by the
U.S.-led NATO, which was suspended on June 10 shortly after
Belgrade accepted a peace plan.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Chief Secretary on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Monday that Sino-U.S. relations are too important to
degenerate or to be affected by mistrust and lack of understanding.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region Government, expressed her concern
over the current deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations and called
for efforts to bring the ties back on track.
</P>
<P>
"A constructive relationship, constructive engagement between
America and China" serves the interests of the United States and
China, including Hong Kong, Chan told a press conference at the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"Mainland China and the United States are our two largest
trading partners, and any tension in that relationship has a
direct or indirect impact on Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan is paying a visit to Washington at a time when a debate is
under way on China's trade status on the Capital Hill. She
described China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
"a crucial important issue" and urged the U.S. government to put
it on the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"As the world's most populous country, it must be in everyone's
interest for China to open its economy and to be allowed to play
its part on the world stage," she added.
</P>
<P>
The chief secretary dismissed as "unfounded" charges by some
Americans that Hong Kong has been used as "a shipment center for
the diversion of strategic commodities and high-tech goods".
</P>
<P>
"We believe these accusations to be unfounded," and "we feel
that the Cox report is unfair to Hong Kong," she said. "All we ask
is for an opportunity to be heard, and to be judged by our actions
and not by perception," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed that Hong Kong remains a separate trading entity
and a separate customs territory, which has a physical border with
the mainland that is policed "by our own enforcement authorities."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a "very strict export, import and re-export
control" system which is "open and transparent," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We allow unlimited post shipment checks by your (U.S.)
authorities. We have your law enforcement agencies actually
stationed in our Trade Department, and they can see for themselves
how we implement these control regimes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan also refuted the allegation of "unrestricted access of the
PLA to computers in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has a legitimate role to play in Hong Kong," and they
have been "exemplary in their behavior since the first day they
arrived in Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan applauded as "almost seamless" the political
transformation of Hong Kong that has undergone ever since the
establishment of a Special Administration Region there two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government authorities have been exemplary in
keeping their hands off Hong Kong, while at the same time giving
us every support when we ask for it," she said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Prioritizing Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels should
guarantee the priority status of education when framing plans for
economic and social developments.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made the remarks at the national
education work conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, urged leaders at various levels to prioritize
funding for education when drafting fiscal budgets.
</P>
<P>
The general public should respect teachers and all workers in
the field of education, said Jiang. He pointed out that efforts
must be made to improve the status of teachers, and to establish a
responsibility system to link leaders and schools.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens should fully support the development of
education and governments at all levels must list education as a
strategic development target, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that teaching children and personnel training depend
heavily on the efforts of schools, as well as on a favorable
social environment. Society as a whole should create a healthy
environment for students.
</P>
<P>
Life-long education is an unavoidable trend in modern society,
said Jiang. Schools must open wider by providing degree-oriented
programs, as well as continuing adult and vocational education.
Diversified education opportunities must be available for all
people.

the reform and opening drive, as well as efforts to restructure
state enterprises and further regularize the country's stock
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Law, which will go into effect on July 1, will
require stock exchanges to rectify and regularize market
activities, according to Tu. He said the Shanghai exchange will
work diligently to ensure the safe operations of the trading and
clearance system in order to reduce risk.

<HEADLINE> Indian Currency Falls Sharply Due To Border Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian currency rupee went
into a tail-spin against the U.S. dollar as heightened
Indo-Pakistan border tension sent it reeling under severe pressure
in fairly hectic but nervous trade at the Interbank Foreign
Exchange market in Mumbai Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said rupee closed at 43.15/16 for one
dollar, sharply lower from the weekend finish of 43.04/06 after
dipping to an early low of 43.17/19 on a virtual rush to cover
dollar positions by banks due to escalating tensions in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said warnings by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on
Sunday that "India could go to any extent if war was thrust on it"
coupled with the failure of India-Pakistan talks last Saturday to
defuse the border crisis made nervous operators scramble to cover
dollar position.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign exchange market has been uneasy since May 26
when the Indian Air Force launched air strikes in the Kargil
sector of Kashmir to push out what India described as
"Pakistan-backed infiltrators" and the subsequent downing of two
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said today that he was
not worried over the sharp fall in rupee against the greenback and
Indian economy would not be affected by the developments in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried over the fall in rupee. The economy is very
strong and everything is under complete control," Sinha told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Continued fierce fighting on Indo-Pakistan borders sparked
heavy dollar buying by both companies and banks which sent the
rupee reeling under severe pressure.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the crash in rupee would have an adverse impact
on the economy, Sinha said "rupee has not crashed. Don't use that
term."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Want Sale of Closed Bank Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliamentary committee
on national economy has recommended the suspending of the
impending sale of the assets of the closed Cooperative Bank by the
Bank of Uganda, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Issac Musumba, chairman of the parliamentary committee, was
quoted by Tuesday's New Vision daily as saying that he held a
closed-door meeting with Charles Kigonyogo, governor of the Bank
of Uganda, on the matter earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the bids for the closed bank would not be opened
Tuesday as expected. They would wait till agreement was reached.
The central bank boss had agreed not to open the bids.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the bank's assets was due Tuesday morning, some
confidential sources were quoted as revealing.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative Bank officials appeared before the same
committee last week, alleging that their bank was closed without
adequate warnings. Some figures were not included on the
central bank's documents which gave a false account showing
insolvency to the tune of 4.7 billion shillings (3.4 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank was closed by the central bank on May 19 for
insolvency, leaving money of more than 100,000 depositors locked
up in the bank.

<P>
ZHONGSHAN, SOUTH CHINA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China maintained
their winning momentum as they routed South Korea All-Star 114-85
in the last match of the Guangdong leg at the Asia Basketball
Superleague (ABSL) here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese All-Star side, which consists some of China's
national team members, dominated the game from the outset as they
took the upper hands in rebounds and played a fast game, cruising
to a 33-16 lead in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the margin remained unchanged as the resilient South Korean
side turned stronger in outside shots and fast breaks, holding
China to 59-42 at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Jiang Xingquan, who led China to three Asian
championships titles and a best ever eighth place in the 1994
world championships, fielded a total different line-up in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
But China could not yet hold off the charge of the South
Koreans who trailed 61-85, reducing the 17-point margin by one.
</P>
<P>
Jiang fielded Yao Ming, 19, standing 2.25 meters, and his
decision paid off as China pulled away before they stormed to
their third win in as many matches.
</P>
<P>
China overpowered Hong Kong Regal 103-68 at Shenzhen on Monday
after they slammed the Japan All-Star team 93-71 in the opener
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ABSL is divided into two groups of four. Group A consists
of China, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, China, while Group B
features Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team ABSL will tour from Shenzhen to Hong Kong before
closing on June 25 at Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> UK's Inflation Rate Falls to Six Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 15 (Xinhua) - The underlying rate of inflation has
plunged to its lowest level for almost five years, according to
the latest official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics put the annual rate of
underlying inflation in May at 2.1 percent - down from 2.4 percent
the previous month - compared to the Government's target of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures for underlying inflation mark the biggest
undershoot of the Government's inflation target since it was
adopted two years ago and are likely to raise hopes of a further
cut in interest rates, already at a 22 year low.
</P>
<P>
The data will be keenly watched by the Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee, which has pledged its readiness to
reduce borrowing costs if inflation is set to undershoot.
</P>
<P>
After its monthly rate-setting meeting last week, the Bank's
Monetary Policy Committee warned that inflation was falling below
target rates.
</P>
<P>
However, Chancellor Gordon Brown said Tuesday he had no plans
at present to change the Bank of England's inflation target nor to
change the definition of inflation it uses.
</P>
<P>
"The setting of the inflation target is reaffirmed every year
in the budget. I think it is right that we hold to the 2.5 percent
target as we have done this year," he told a parliamentary
committee.

<HEADLINE> Over 21,000 Ugandans Abducted by LRA Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 21,000 people have been
abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) from
northern Uganda since the beginning of the insurgency 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Among the abducted, there are 6,652 children and the rest are
adults, the New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The northern district of Kitgum recorded 10,802, the highest
number of people abducted, followed by Gulu (6,626) and Apac
(2,039), which are also northern districts.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 3,703 captives are still in the hands of
the LRA rebels spearheaded by Joseph Kony, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A security official said the number of abducted children could
rise to 8,000 because another 2,000 names were not on the list.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels reportedly attack Uganda's northern districts
from bases in southern Sudan. They often cross the border to
abduct, maim and rob.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have tried in vain to wipe out the
wrong-doers because of the poor infrastructure and complex terrain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni extended an amnesty to all
those fighting the government and offered a ministerial post for
Kony if he would come out to surrender.
</P>
<P>
However, this offer was categorically turned down by Kony who
demanded, among other things, to hold direct talks with government
and to secure more ministerial posts for his officers.

<HEADLINE> Liverpool Set British Record Transfer Fee for Goalkeeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Liverpool have broken the British transfer fee record for a
goalkeeper by paying Vitesse Arnhem four million pounds (6.4
million U.S. dollars) for 24-year-old Sander Westerveld.
</P>
<P>
But the keeper, who made his international debut for the
Netherlands last week, does not believe his fee will affect his
performance.
</P>
<P>
"I will play to the best of my ability and that ability will
not be affected by how much Liverpool paid for me," he said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Westerveld turned down UEFA Cup football to move to Liverpool,
who are not in Europe next season, but he is content.
</P>
<P>
"It might be better that we don't play European football," he
maintained. "It might help me settle in if we play less matches
and just concentrate on getting into the Champions League."
</P>
<P>
Westerveld is the ninth signing Gerard Houllier has made since
joining Liverpool last season and all of them have been foreign
players.
</P>
<P>
But executive vice-chairman Peter Robinson defended his manager
's transfer policy.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are very conscious of the fact we have signed
foreign players. We have in fact made substantial offers for
English players in the last few weeks, all of which were refused
because clubs won't sell."
</P>
<P>
The previous British record fee for a goalkeeper was the 3.3
million pounds (5.3 million U.S. dollars) Everton paid Tranmere
for Steve Simonsen last season.

<HEADLINE> GCC Leaders Keen on Strengthening Alliance: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan Tuesday tried to play
down differences which surfaced recently among member states,
mainly over the GCC-Iran rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Before concluding his two-day visit to Kuwait, the
secretary-general stressed that Gulf leaders are keen on
strengthening the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan called on mediamen to stay away from speculations
about the differences within the alliance, referring to absence of
a final communique of the GCC foreign ministerial meeting held in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed a number of issues topped by the
UAE-Iranian islands dispute and the rapprochement between some
GCC members and Iran, but it failed to issue a final communique.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan said GCC leaders had expressed their keenness on
consolidating the group's march and extending support to each
other.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah,
Al-Hujailan said he submitted a detailed report to Jaber on the
consultative meeting of the GCC leaders held in the western Saudi
city of Jeddah on May 10.
</P>
<P>
"He (Jaber) attentively listened to the report and offered
wise advice on how the GCC General Secretariat should go on
performing its duties."
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Forty-One Chinese Government Sectors Go On-line (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He noted the great success of several websites, including sites
operated by the SETC, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) and local government websites in Beijing,
Guangzhou, Kunming, Haikou and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
Various authoritative websites offer extensive information
which is updated on a regular basis, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
However, most Chinese government websites simply release
information which falls short of the needs for on-line government.
</P>
<P>
Government sectors should polish their image on-line and take
full advantage of the Internet to serve the people, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
He noted the Public Security sector needs to issue identity
cards, the railway sector needs to sell tickets and Customs
offices need to check foreign exchanges. Related activities can be
carried out quickly and efficiently on computer networks, said
Yang.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of on-line government is to link and enable
different government sectors to share information.
</P>
<P>
Yang said future exports transactions will be conducted on-line
to link the inspection, Customs, trade and transportation sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one Chinese ministries or
departments directly under the State Council has established
homepages, according to Yang Baosheng, an official with Chinanet,
the nation's largest computer network.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Chinanet and the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) introduced "Government On-line", a project
designed to encourage government administrations to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight ministerial sectors participated in the initial
project, with the current number of participants standing at 63,
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
The sectors have either established or plan to introduce
websites to provide the general public with current information,
including the latest trends and developments.
</P>
<P>
Some 46 ministries and departments operate directly under the
State Council, with the total number rising to 84 when considering
subsidiary departments.
</P>
<P>
"Government-Online" plans call for 60 percent of related
departments to be on-line by the end of 1999, with the figure
rising to 80 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yang said some 1,564 Chinese websites end with "gov.cn".  (

<HEADLINE> 26 Muscovites Drown in Three Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six people drowned while
swimming in Moscow's reservoirs over the long weekend as people
fled a spell of hot summer weather, the city's ambulance service
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Another six people, including two children, were rescued and
taken to the hospital on Saturday through Monday, the service
said.
</P>
<P>
June 12 was Independence Day and the Russians had an extra day
off on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims were apparently drowned after getting drunk
during picnics by the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
A total of 63 people have drowned while swimming in the city's
rivers and ponds since the beginning of this June, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, in June, when Russia encountered a record-breaking
heat wave, the number of drowned people was measured in dozens
every week just in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties occur in reservoirs not officially
designated as swimming zones. A swimming zone, by Moscow
regulations, has be to equipped with proper toilets, drinking
water and life guards, and the water has to be checked for
chemical and biological pollution.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, 32 people drowned in rivers and
lakes in Lithuania since Saturday as the Baltic republic
experiences extremely hot weather. Many of the 32 victims were
also drunk, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting the
country's interior ministry.

LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said arrangements for the hosting of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) peace talks scheduled here at the end of this month
have reached an advanced stage with the invitations being sent to
all stake-holders.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this at Lusaka International Airport before his
departure Tuesday to South Africa where he will attend the
installation of the new South Africa President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said invitation letters have been sent to presidents in
the region as well as the current chairman of the Organization for
African Unity (OAU), Blaise Compoure.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting Laurent Kabila's government have also been
invited and will take part directly in the talks and hopefully an
agreement will be reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the sending of troops to the DRC will depend on the
outcome of the Lusaka talks which will involve the foreign and
defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also revealed that a Zambian delegation was currently
visiting Rwanda, Uganda and hold talks with the rebels in DRC to
narrow the difference and work out a document to be signed in
Lusaka later.

bilateral relations are moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Qian met Letsie Tuesday afternoon in Johannesburg, South

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Targets Bombed by U.S. Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Some civilian targets in northern
Iraq were bombed on Tuesday by U.S. and British warplanes, an
Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:33 (0633 GMT) eight formations
of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva.
</P>
<P>
The enemy formations attacked civilian facilities in the
northern Iraqi city of Mosul, said the spokesman. But he did not
mention whether casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced the enemy
planes to flee to their base in Turkey, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have made 1,629
sorties over the so-called northern no-fly zone in Iraq, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south against
possible attacks by the Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, U.S. and British warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets in the no-fly
zones, causing severe civilian casualties and property damages.

<HEADLINE> Survey Cites Effectiveness of Fishing Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A results of a recent survey
released today show that the fishing ban China initiated four
years ago has effectively yielded satisfying economic and social
returns.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the ban to the East China Sea and Yellow Sea
in 1995. The annual ban prohibits fishing by trawlers and trawl
net from June 1-September 15.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Fisheries Department under the
Ministry of Agriculture revealed that an increase in the
population of major species such as hairtail, and large and small
yellow croakers over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The ban protects fish during the spawning season and thereby
substantially increases fisheries resources, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that protecting one ton of immature fish will
yield 1.8 tons of resources following the annual summer ban.
Therefore, the annual ban yields several million tons of marine
resources on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The balance of different fish species has also returned to
normal as a result of the four fishing ban, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen welcome the ban which not only helps to reduce costs,
but also leads to increases catches once lifted.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed Yellow Sea fishermen have reduced annual
costs by one billion yuan, with their counterparts plying the East
China Sea reducing costs by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official noted that the ban has helped promote the
quality of fishermen and readjust the fisheries mix.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that the overfishing problem still exists
and suggested the introduction of additional strict measures to
protect marine resources.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Environmentalists Warns of Rising Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian environmental group is
warning of "rising greenhouse gas emissions at our peril" and
calls for "action to meet Kyoto targets" and changes in the way
Canadians use energy.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued on Monday, the Sierra Club of Canada said, "
1998 was the hottest year on record, with July of that year being
the hottest month ever recorded."
</P>
<P>
Heat waves in India are causing deaths with temperatures
soaring above 50 degrees Celsius. Killer tornadoes of
unprecedented strength are being witnessed. Droughts plague much
of the world, with Northern Mexico suffering the worst in history,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, low water levels in the Great lakes are being
witnessed while melting ice cover and drought has become a matter
of fact in Atlantic Canada. Toronto, in particular, is
experiencing freakish winds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group appealed to the Canadian government for
"much more action" to meet the greenhouse-gas-reduction targets it
agreed to in an international pact signed 18 months ago in Kyoto,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, Canada agreed to reduce emissions by 6
percent below 1990 levels, by 2012. But now the country is
estimated to be at least 25 percent behind that target. The main
source of emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels like
gasoline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, has expressed confidence in its
ability to devise a plan to tackle global warming by the end of
this year or early next year, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, are
produced largely when oil, coal and gas are burned.

<HEADLINE> Serious Environmental Pollution in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that more
than half of Chinese citizens say that China faces serious
environmental pollution, but they place greater concern on other
major social problems.
</P>
<P>
Some 56.7 percent of respondents cited China's environmental
problem as "very serious" or "serious", with only 22.8 percent of
respondents doubting the seriousness of the problem, according to
a survey conducted last year by the State Environment Protection
Administration (SEPA). The survey covered 10,000 people in 31
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that environmental problems ranked fourth
behind poverty, poor education and over population on the list of
problems of greatest concern to Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection ranked fifth on the list of China's
development goals behind goals for economy, science and technology,
population and social justice.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that people with higher education
levels are more concerned with environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The respondents exhibited the greatest level of concern for
water and air pollution, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the survey was to enhance social awareness of
environmental problems, discuss relevant factors in the area and
provide a reference for government decisions concerning the
sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
About half of respondents attributed reduced pollution levels
to the introduction of effective government measure and 43 percent
expressed their belief that the government will adopt additional
measures to further improve the environment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Beef Exports to EU Remain Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cattle Producers Association
(CPA) of Zimbabwe said Tuesday that the depressed industry is
again not likely to reach its targeted amount of beef exports to
the European Union (EU) this year.
</P>
<P>
"The EU requires about 9,100 tons of beef annually," CPA
Chairman John Heyns told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Last year the Cold Storage Commission (CSC) fulfilled about
6,000 tons, " he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Heyns, the industry was adversely affected by the
heavy rains experienced last year which made it difficult to
pen-feed cattle beasts to achieve high quality beef.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to farmers to make use of the good weather the
country was now experiencing to pen-feed their cattle.
</P>
<P>
By this, he added, the farmers would be able to send more beef
to the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Barak Admits Forming Coalition Not Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak admitted Tuesday that it has not been an easy job for
him to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Talking to One Israel's Knesset (parliament) members after the
opening of the Knesset working session, Barak said left or right
political parties that want to join the coalition have raised so
many demands and at each meeting they added something new.
</P>
<P>
But Barak has promised his fellow legislators that he has
decided to form a narrow-based government and will try to finish
the work by the end of this week, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two days, Barak held several secret meetings with
leaders of potential coalition partners and focused his attention
on allocation of portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that, based on the principle of one
minister for every four Knesset members, the Center Party, Shinui,
Yisrael Ba'aliya and the National Religious Party (NRP) can each
get a minister and a deputy minister; two ministers and a deputy
will go to Meretz; and nine ministers will be for One Israel,
including one for Barak and another for Barak's "personal choice."
</P>
<P>
Barak did not disclose who will be his "personal choice." Labor
insiders predict that Center Party lawmaker Dan Meridor will be
the most hopeful, to head the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meridor left the Likud party before the May 17 elections and
formed the Center Party with former Chief of Staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak. Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later
joined it and became its leader.
</P>
<P>
NRP held secret talks with Barak Monday and both sides made
some compromise on settlement issues. But NRP claimed Tuesday it
will get the Education Ministry under its control, otherwise it
will not join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya hopes to get more portfolios, saying with six
Knesset members, it should be allocated two minister quotas.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab parties Tuesday also expected to join the
coalition, saying Barak's refusal to include the three parties,
with 10 Knesset members, into his coalition is a big mistake and
there will be no way for them to support One Israel on any issues
to be discussed in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of One Israel, defeated outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in last month's elections. He is engaging in
intense talks with potential partners on the formation of the
incoming government.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Lawmaker Stirs Dispute for Sensitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An Arab lawmaker's plan to run
for a seat in a sensitive committee of the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) has aroused dispute in the country's political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, member of the Arab party Balad, told Israel Radio
Tuesday that it will be undemocratic to place any barrier in front
of an Arab lawmaker to compete for a seat in the Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, who announced his candidacy for the semi-secrete
committee Monday, had been an adviser to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat until early this year.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said that he had been only an ordinary adviser to Arafat,
which should not be considered as an excuse to prevent him from
joining the committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a representative of 1 million Arab citizens in
Israel, he should be allowed to be part of any decision-making
process in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is time for an Arab member to join this
important committee. Until now, no Arab lawmakers have ever served
on the committee.
</P>
<P>
However, Uzi Landau, outgoing chairman of the Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, said that it will be ludicrous for a
former adviser of Arafat to be briefed by the government leaders,
the Israeli army's intelligent officers and the directors of the
noted intelligence agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Some committee members also said that government and security
officials would restrict their briefings to the committee if an
Arab lawmaker became a member.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ori Orr, former Knesset member of the Labor party,
said that he does not oppose an Arab lawmaker to serve on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Michal Aharoni, Tibi's spokeswoman, also said that Tibi had
the support of certain senior Knesset members of the left-wing
coalition One Israel, but she refused to give names.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arab parties took 10 seats in the 120-member Knesset in
the May elections.
</P>
<P>
It appears that it is impossible for Tibi to get his candidacy
for the committee passed in the Knesset plenum.
</P>
<P>
And Tibi's announcement is mainly considered as a way to arouse
awareness of the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan criminal court in
Gashora, south of the capital Kigali, Monday sentenced to life
imprisonment one man accused of genocide and crimes against
humanity, and acquitted 31 others after having found them not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
The thirty-one suspects originated from Karera sector, in
Gashora commune where they allegedly committed crimes, the Rwanda
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were part of a group of 67 people, including two women
whose joint trial opened on April 19,1999 at Gashora where the
Nyamata Criminal Court had moved to get closer to residents in a
bid to gather more evidence on charges.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the suspects were sentenced to jail terms
ranging from seven to 20 years, and those found guilty will pay
about 13 million U.S. dollars as compensation to the victims.

<HEADLINE> UN Terms Angola Ambush "Barbaric" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed men ambushed a car
full of aid workers who were carrying out a polio immunization
campaign in Angola, killing two people and seriously injuring two
others, the United Nations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits also stole personal belongings from the workers of
the Portuguese Institute for Preventive Medicine and their hand-held
radio before setting the car ablaze, a statement from the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator's office said.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary-General Sergio Vieira de Mello called the attack
"barbaric," saying the car was clearly marked as a humanitarian
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government and the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to bring those responsible to
justice and improve security for aid workers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Angola's civil war, which resumed in December last year, has
drastically limited access by international aid groups to only a
few provinces in the southwestern African nation.
</P>
<P>
The ambush took place in Barraca in Bengo province on Saturday
last week, 80 kilometers east of the Angolan capital of Luanda.
The driver and one of the aid workers were killed immediately.
</P>
<P>
The car veered into the bush, and the other two workers
pretended to play dead while the gunmen fired again at the
vehicle. They managed to escape after the car was set ablaze, and
were rescued by a passing police security patrol.
</P>
<P>
Angola's protracted civil war first began in 1975. A 1994
U.N.-brokered peace protocol collapsed last December when the
government and rebel group UNITA resumed fighting. Since then,
UNITA has taken control of 80 percent of Angola.

<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main bourses overcame a
negative start Tuesday to close solidly in the black, cheered by
Wall Street's good showing and as domestic stock gains underpinned
trade.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100, edged up 0.3 percent, or 21.1 points, to
6451.2, supported by better-than-expected UK inflation figures and
a more than 50 point early gain on the resurgent Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
Early sentiment had been clouded by sharp losses for U.S.
technology shares, although subdued UK inflation data for May lent
some support.
</P>
<P>
Oil heavywight BP Amoco jumped nearly 2.5 percent to 1162
pence. But overall buying activity in the UK was kept on a tight
lead as investors awaited the release of U.S. retail price data.

<P>
Germany's Xetra DAX share index shrugged off early losses and
rose 1 percent on Tuesday as Volkswagen AG and HupoVereinsbank AG
surged.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Ethiopian Cooperation Fruitful: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said Tuesday that cooperation in the political and economic
fields between Ethiopia and China has been fruitful since the
Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front came to power.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks when he met with Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada Tuesday afternoon in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
1996 gave fresh impetus to bilateral relations of the two
countries, and that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to developing friendly relations with Ethiopia and
wishes to expand cooperation in various fields on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said China upholds justice in international affairs and
adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries. China, therefore, is an important
force to maintain world peace and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's robust economic growth has also
stimulated the economic growth of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said he is satisfied with the development of bilateral
relations and that he hoped the two sides would make more efforts
to fully explore the potential of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Negasso also briefed Qian on the border war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the war has caused the loss of lives and severe
material damage to both countries. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea face
the task of developing the economy and uplifting people's living
standards. He said China hopes the two sides could soon halt the
military clashes and find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts of the Organization of African Unity
in this regard and hopes that African countries could solve their
problems by themselves, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan and Ambassador to
South Africa Wang Xuexian were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and President Negasso are in South Africa for
Wednesday's inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as the new South African
president.

LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Tuesday approved the setting up of a panel to look into the
country's uncompleted projects, supplies and services in the
period from January 1984 to December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member Panel chaired by Alhaji Iguda Inua is authorized
to take the inventory, examine all records and make the necessary
assessment of all the unfinished projects, supplies, and services
in this period.
</P>
<P>
The panel will decide whether the amount of money paid to the
contractors by the client was commensurate with the amount of work
done.
</P>
<P>
The panel will also examine the reasons why the projects,
supplies, and services were not executed in accordance with the
terms of the contract between the client and the contractors.
</P>
<P>
The panel will determine whether the projects are still viable
and make appropriate recommendations to the client Ministry and
department.
</P>
<P>
The president also order the panel to make recommendations in
an order of priority, which of the uncompleted projects, supplies
and services should be completely finished and work out the
estimated total costs to complete each of them.
</P>
<P>
The president had earlier set up a panel to review contracts
approved from January 1 till May 28 this year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Move to Reinforce Macroeconomic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday that it plans to provide a total of 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars in loans to Mexico between now and 2001 to improve social
conditions for the country's poor, to reinforce macroeconomic
stability, and to strengthen reforms to public governance.
</P>
<P>
The bank's executive board discussed last week a new Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico which proposes the loans. The
CAS was jointly prepared by the World Bank and its private-sector
lending affiliate, the International Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The strategy cites Mexico's efforts in reforming macroeconomic
management, and notes progress in reforms to education, health,
and agriculture in recent years.
</P>
<P>
It congratulates Mexico's government for "commendable efforts"
to tackle poverty and inequality through improved targeting of
health and education programs, but notes that poverty reduction
remains a serious challenge for the country.
</P>
<P>
On Macroeconomic policy, the bank recognizes Mexico's success
in weathering the global financial turmoil of the past two years
through decisive and timely responses to changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Michel Camdessus, Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), announced that the IMF's
executive board will meet for early July to consider a stand-by
credit totaling 4.1 billion dollars for Mexico in support of the
government's economic program for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
"The credit would help ensure the maintenance of a strong
policy framework during the transition to the next administration,
and thereby support market confidence during this period,"
Camdessus said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The 1999-2000 economic program aims to reduce inflation to 10
percent by 2000. Real gross domestic product growth is projected
to slow in 1999 reflecting, in part, reduced access to
international capital markets and then recover to 5 percent in
2000 as market access improves and investment picks up.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Mexico's economic program, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said in a statement that Mexico's commitment to a
sound economic program, supported by the IMF, should improve
prospects for continued strong economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that Mexico's firm policy response to recent
economic and financial turbulence helped to preserve stability and
growth over the past year, building on reforms of the past several
years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Find New Method for Diagnosing Iron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGElES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. researchers
said that they have developed an effective new strategy to
diagnose iron deficiency in children.
</P>
<P>
According to their research study, published in the June 16
issue of the Journal of American Medical Association, the method
allows earlier detection and prevention of complications from
anemia and cognitive impairments that may develop as a result of
undetected deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by researchers at Children's Hospital,
Boston, shows the new test, which measure the reticulocyte
hemoglobin content or CHr of the blood, is an easier and more
cost-effective alternative to the traditional combination of
biochemical and hematological tests that have been used to
diagnose in iron deficiency. The test can be done as part of
regular blood tests using a small amount of blood.
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency often is not noticed until symptoms of anemia
present when a child is one to three year old, the researchers'
report said. "There is a real need for earlier identification so
treatment can begin before anemia or other long-term complications
develop."
</P>
<P>
Children with low iron levels can develop anemia, a condition
caused by a shortage of oxygen in red blood cells that can cause
fatigue and weakness. Iron plays such an important role in mental
development, that children who are iron deficient can also develop
more serious problems such as alterations in cognitive
performance, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
The clinical study involved measuring the CHr level of 210
children of the average age of two after their blood was taken for
a routine lead test. The Chr level was the strongest predictor of
43 children who were found iron deficient and 24 others who had
iron deficiency anemia.

<HEADLINE> Shas Spiritual Leaders Accept Deri's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) - The spiritual leaders of
Israel's powerful religious Shas party Wednesday accepted the
resignation of the party's political leader Aryeh Deri, a move
which would facilitate Shas's entry into the new government.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour meeting in Jerusalem, Shas's Council of Torah
Sages, led by the party's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,
announced that it accepted Deri's resignation with great regret.
</P>
<P>
But the council stressed that although Deri was convicted of
corruption by Jerusalem District Court, the council believed he
was innocent.
</P>
<P>
The council said that before the High Court hears the appeal
by Deri, no other leader will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
Deri, who announced his resignation Tuesday night, was
convicted of bribe-taking and fraud, and sentenced to four years
in jail just before the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Following his landslide victory in the elections, Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak has said that he wanted to form a broad
coalition government, which may include religious or right-wing
parties.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset in the elections,
an amazing growth from 10 seats in the last Knesset, and it
became the third-largest party in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak has noted that he might not include Shas into
the coalition government if Deri continued to be the party's
leader.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz party, which got 10 seats in the Knesset,
has also warned that it would not sit in a coalition government
with Shas, because it would be impossible for Shas to cut itself
off from Deri.
</P>
<P>
Following Deri's resignation, a senior source of One Israel
coalition led by Barak told Israel Radio on Wednesday that it is
now possible for Barak to form a broad government including both
Shas and the Meretz party.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid also relaxed his stance, saying that
it is Meretz's commitment to help Barak build a coalition
government since more than 90 percent of Meretz members voted for
Barak in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Real Estate Developer Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A real estate joint venture
between a Beijing developer and a Hong Kong-based company has more
than 790 million yuan in debts and the Beijing Number One
Intermediate People's Court ruled today that its prestigious "Rose
Villa" residential houses will be auctioned off to pay off some of
the creditors.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of shares of the Beijing Lida Rose Villa Company
changed several times in recent years while the operation and
management was steadily deteriorating, resulting in heavy deficits.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, the court declared that the company must
file for bankruptcy and 105 creditors have registered with total
debt rights worth one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The majority are from Hong Kong with a few foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
The court has ruled that house buyers who have made a whole or
partial payment could move into the villas as normal or could ask
for a refund as a common creditor, in accordance with the law, and
be repaid on a proportional basis.
</P>
<P>
The real estate project is located in Changping County, Beijing,
and so far, 186 villa houses in American, Japanese and European
styles have been built and are ready for occupation.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Parliament Hears Reports on National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Assembly,
or parliament, held a plenary session Wednesday to hear reports
from the defense and unification ministers over national security.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the parliament, Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae
pledged that utmost efforts will be made to contain the naval
skirmish with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
from developing into a full-scale battle. But he vowed to take
stern moves against any aggressive action by DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the entire armed forces of South Korea are now on
alert.
</P>
<P>
An inter-Korean exchange of gunfire happened in the Yellow Sea
early Tuesday, in which a DPRK torpedo boat was sunken and three
others seriously damaged while two South Korean military ships
were slightly damaged and seven servicemen wounded.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK may be attempting to gain the upper hand in the
upcoming general-level meeting between Seoul and Pyongyang and in
its approach to the rich fishing ground in the buffer zone,
according to Cho.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Unification Minister Lim Dong-won reiterated at the
parliament that the government is determined to stick to the
engagement policy despite the clash.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the government's intention to
continue the engagement efforts with the North on the basis of a
firm defense readiness."
</P>
<P>
Lim also said the government will attend the ministerial talks
with the DPRK as scheduled and will continue to provide fertilizer
assistance to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
However, the unification minister added that the government
will never tolerate any aggression from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The unification minister's report to the parliament was
interrupted by shouts and jeers from opposition Grand National
Party GNP) lawmakers who are against the Kim Dae-jung government's
"sunshine Policy", which seeks reconciliation and cooperation
based on separating business from politics.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lawmakers walked out in the middle of the
minister's report and dismissed the sunshine policy as a "total
failure." They urged the government to stop inter-Korean exchange
programs such as Mt. Kumgang tours and the supply of fertilizer to
the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the parliament formed a five-member
emergency committee to deal with the Tuesday inter-Korean military
clash in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, the parliament failed to adopt the earlier scheduled
resolution on national security as the opposition Grand National
Party (GNP) lodged a protest against the Kim Dae-jung government's
insistence on upholding the "sunshine policy" toward the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Concerted Effort to Ban Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday called for a concerted international effort to eliminate
the worst forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 87th session of the International Labor
Conference here, Clinton said, "Today, the time has come to build
on the growing world consensus to ban the most abusive forms of
child labor, to join together and to say there are some things we
cannot and will not tolerate."
</P>
<P>
"Every single day tens of millions of children work in
conditions that shock the conscience," he told the delegates from
the members of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
The 174 ILO members are expected to conclude the annual
conference on Thursday with the adoption of the "Worst Forms of
Child Labor Convention 1999".
</P>
<P>
According to ILO estimates, about half of 250 million children
between the ages of five and 14 work full time, while the rest
combine work and schooling. In some cases, as many as 70 percent
of these children are engaged in hazardous work.
</P>
<P>
The new convention defines the worst forms of child labor as:
</P>
<P>
-- All forms of slavery and practices similar to slavery, such
as the sale and trafficking of children, forced or compulsory
labor, debt bondage and serfdom;
</P>
<P>
-- The use, procurement or offering of a child for prostitution,
production of pornography or pornographic performances;
</P>
<P>
-- The use, procurement or offering of a child for illicit
activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of
drugs;
</P>
<P>
-- Work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it
is carried out, is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or
morals of children.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new standards were first discussed at the 1998
conference and apply to all children under the age of 18.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Highlights "Three Stresses" on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, continues its campaign to highlight the "Three
Stresses" on education within the Communist Party of China by
publishing its 11th commentary on the topic on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "Three Stresses" on education refers to the emphasis on
studying theories, raising political consciousness and fostering
healthy trends among Party members.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Rectification is the Kernel", says
rectification and correction must be carried out in the whole
process of the "Three Stresses" on education program, so that the
people could feel the positive changes and progress brought about
by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The paper warns that all the Party members and leaders should
pay greater attention to the drive, that has entered the phase of
"rectification and correction".
</P>
<P>
It should be fully understood that the "Three Stresses" on
education program is aimed at improving the political quality and
theoretical level of the Party leaders at different levels as a
whole, it says, adding that the results of the drive could only be
reflected by the "rectification and correction".
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges leading Party officials at different
levels to take charge of the work of "rectification and correction
", insisting that this is the key to the ongoing "Three Stress" on
education.
</P>
<P>
The "rectification and correction" work should be focused on
the issues that have been badly opposed by the people as they are
detrimental to the reform, development and stability of the
country as well as the relationship between the Party and the
people, it emphasizes.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former Formula One auto
racing world champion Damon Hill said here on Wednesday that he
will retire at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Hill, now 38, won the drivers' title in 1996 for the Williams
team and has since driven for the Arrows team and, currently for
Jordan - for whom he won the Belgian Grand Prix last season. The
1996 world champion has won 22 Grand Prix in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
He said: "After much reflection I have decided not to continue
racing in Formula One after the end of the 1999 season. Despite
being a late starter to Formula One, at the age of 32, I am very
proud of my record of having won 22 Grand Prix and the world
championship itself.
</P>
<P>
"Formula One has afforded me many incredible opportunities and
I will cherish some fantastic memories. I have fulfilled my
ambitions and consider myself very fortunate to have done so."
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes just days after Hill crashed out of the
Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
"To Eddie (Jordan) and the whole team thank you for all your
support and I know Spa will be only the first of many victories,"
said Hill. "I am committed to give you everything I can in order
to secure your highest possible placing in the constructors'
championship," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua)-- Lobang Toinzhub, vice chairman of
Tibet Autonomous Region, met here today with Pierre Morel, French
Ambassador to China and they exchanged views on economic and
social development and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Lobang Toinzhub said that Tibet has witnessed dramatic changes
in contemporary times compared with the period before the
democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
The grain output in 1998 reached historical record levels, he
said. Tibet has established four universities and a wide range of
primary and secondary schools in every county providing free
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government has always attached great
importance to education in Tibet and said that over 20,000 Tibetan
students are now studying at different schools in 26 provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Lobang Toinzhub stressed that the Tibetan people have enjoyed
extensive human rights and are able to fully enforce their
political rights.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, before the democratic reform the Tibetan working
people were classed merely as serfs, enslaved by monks, autocrats
and officials who owned most of the local wealth and resources
while constituting only five percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the incomes of Tibetan farmers and urban residents
have been increasing and over fifty percent of the people are
enjoying an increasingly well-to-do level lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Lobang Toinzhub stressed that there is no human rights problem
in Tibet, but that the Dalai Lama spread rumor on the issue,
adding his intention is to regain his power in Tibet and restore
the old system.
</P>
<P>
Morel exchanged views on cultural contacts with Lobang Toinzub.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador arrived here on June 12 and will finish his
visit on June 17.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Hits 4.5% in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's month-on-month inflation
rose to 4.5 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, according to
the June Monthly Economic Review of the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rose due to the effect of the weakening Kenyan
currency shilling, the review says.
</P>
<P>
The shilling declined to 73.99 shillings to one U.S. dollar
last week, compared to about 60 shillings to one dollar early this
year, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank report, the average annual
inflation declined marginally from 7. 4 percent in April to 6.7
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall annual inflation remained subdued due to
the tight money supply and improved supply of basic food stuffs in
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The review predicts that the recent weakening of the shilling
will result in price increase.
</P>
<P>
The shilling weakened against all major foreign currencies
during May. It declined to 68.8 shillings to one dollar from 65.4
shillings to one dollar in April. It also dropped by five percent
against the sterling pound, from 105. 3 shillings to one pound in
April to 111.2 shillings to one pound in May.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the fall of shilling to a shortage
of foreign exchange inflows from tea and coffee sectors, the delay
in concluding negotiation with the International Monetary Fund,
capital flight as hot money fled the country and the government's
involvement in the foreign exchange market to raise money to repay
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kenya's foreign exchange reserves declined to
the lowest level in recent years, falling to 674 million dollars
in April this year from 866 million dollars in April, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as South
Africa's second ever black president here Wednesday, assuming the
office of the 80- year-old Nelson Mandela, who is named as
"Africa's greatest son."
</P>
<P>
"I swear that I will be faithful to the Republic of South
Africa and will obey, observe, uphold and maintain the
constitution and all other law of the republic," 56-year-old Mbeki
pledged before Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson in
the amphitheater of the government headquarters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The second democratically-elected president since the country's
first all-race multi-party elections in 1994, with his voice rough
as a result of influenza, took the oath in several South African
languages including Zulu, English and the Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that what we will do will not only better our own
condition as a people, but will also make a contribution, however
small, to the success of Africa's renaissance, towards the
identification of the century ahead of us as the African century,"
Mbeki said later in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
This shows that foreign policy would figure highly in Mbeki's
first five years in the presidential seat, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the South African government policy will be driven by
economic considerations much more than under Mandela, the analysts
noted.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 guests including Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe witnessed the swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Mandela sat side by side while some 20,000 tribal
praise singers, dancers and spectators paid tribute.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 foreign heads of state and government and thousands of
other dignitaries attended the inauguration ceremony.

<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Risk control should be stressed in
business management and large lending projects should be put on
top of the agenda for assessment, according to Chen Yuan,
president of the China Development Bank (CDB).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a bank-wide business and management working meeting
today, Chen said that presently the CDB has 900 large lending
projects, accounting for over 95 percent of the bank's total
amount of outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the key to credit management is to
minimize the risks of large and medium-sized projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that this requires the CDB to set up a risk control
responsibility system and an effective supervision system. The
bank has selected 100 large projects for key supervision.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of re-examining the priorities of
projects, explaining that this year the bank will revalue 387
projects, involving loans of some 140 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The bank also needs to set up index systems for statistics
analysis, risk control, capital management, financial accounting,
personnel management and supervision, in a bid to implement asset-
liability management," he said.

<P>
PRETORIA, june 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new president,
Thabo Mbeki pledged here Wednesday to pull South Africa out of
nightmares of poverty and crimes.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the promise in his acceptance speech at his
inauguration as the second ever black president since the county's
first all-race multi- party elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has just assumed the office of 80-year-old Nelson
Mandela, has pledged to speed the delivery of a better life to
millions of poor blacks denied basic rights for 300 years by the
ruling white minority.
</P>
<P>
"Our nights cannot but be nights of nightmares while millions
of our people live in conditions of degrading poverty," said the
56-year-old new president.
</P>
<P>
"No night can be restful when millions have no jobs, and some
are forced to beg, rob and murder to ensure that they and their
own do not perish from hunger," Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to fight against the rampant crimes which pose
threat to life of the people and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Our days will remain forever haunted when frightening numbers
of the women and children of our country fall victim to rape and
other crimes of violence," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Africa suffered a murder rate of 59
per 100, 000 people and 116 rapes per 100,000 in 1998 and is
believed to be one of the most violent countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
There won't be peace of mind "when the citizens of our country
feel they have neither safety nor security because of the terrible
deeds of criminals and their gangs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new president also called upon the people to cooperate with
the government to seek a safe environment for both life and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South African government is fully conscious of
the fact that it has entered into a contract with the people and
should work in partnership with them to build a winning nation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Hits 4.5% in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's month-on-month inflation
rose to 4.5 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, according to
the June Monthly Economic Review of the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rose due to the effect of the weakening Kenyan
currency shilling, the review says.
</P>
<P>
The shilling declined to 73.99 shillings to one U.S. dollar
last week, compared to about 60 shillings to one dollar early this
year, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank report, the average annual
inflation declined marginally from 7. 4 percent in April to 6.7
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall annual inflation remained subdued due to
the tight money supply and improved supply of basic food stuffs in
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The review predicts that the recent weakening of the shilling
will result in price increase.
</P>
<P>
The shilling weakened against all major foreign currencies
during May. It declined to 68.8 shillings to one dollar from 65.4
shillings to one dollar in April. It also dropped by five percent
against the sterling pound, from 105. 3 shillings to one pound in
April to 111.2 shillings to one pound in May.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the fall of shilling to a shortage
of foreign exchange inflows from tea and coffee sectors, the delay
in concluding negotiation with the International Monetary Fund,
capital flight as hot money fled the country and the government's
involvement in the foreign exchange market to raise money to repay
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kenya's foreign exchange reserves declined to
the lowest level in recent years, falling to 674 million dollars
in April this year from 866 million dollars in April, 1998.

LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has disclosed a failed attempt of the late Nigerian head of state,
Sani Abacha, to kill him in the jail.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception for him by the Nigerian community in
Pretoria, South Africa, the president said that he was perspired
"to step on toes to better the lot of the nation," even if it
means death.
</P>
<P>
After commissioning the new Nigerian Chancery in Pretoria,
Obasanjo said that when he was under incarceration, "they sent
someone to kill me. Somebody was sent from Abuja to inject me to
death."
</P>
<P>
"When he came, my doctor asked the person they sent what he
wanted. He said he wanted to take my blood sample," recalled the
president.
</P>
<P>
"Then my doctor said, 'fine, if you want his blood sample, I
will take it and give to you.' And the person left.
</P>
<P>
"Till today, we have not seen the person nor the result of the
analysis nor whatever he did with the sample," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The president that his reference to the past was borne out of
the need for Nigerians in South Africa and everywhere to
contribute their quota to national development as that is the
easiest way to reposition the country for greatness.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo arrived Pretoria via Water Kloof Air Force Base
Tuesday after a four-hour stop-over in Namibia where he held talks
with Namibian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Beef Up Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will strengthen its police
force by recruiting some 10,000 policemen annually after the
military withdrawing from its post anti-crime duties, the Post
Express, a major Nigerian daily, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the recruitment will last for the following 12
years, said Ovuakporo Ekama, commissioner of police of Ogun
State.
</P>
<P>
The police boss in Ogun state added Tuesday that records showed
that inadequacy of policemen contributed to the increase in crime
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
The orgy of armed robbery has intensified all over the country,
 signaling a renewed wave of gangsterism and a siege on innocent
citizens less than a month into the new political dispensation,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The worrisome state of the trend prompted the Lagos State House
of Assembly to raise a motion calling on state Governor Bola Ahmed
Tinubu to make the newly established "Rapid Response Squad" to be
more alive to its responsibilities in the new political reality.
</P>
<P>
The squad is widely criticized for its inefficiency in
combating the fast rising crimes in Lagos state. Even some state
legislature members have become victims of the armed robberies
recently, said the report.

HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean youth should be
sensitized to the danger of AIDS, an official with the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Felicity Hatendi, UNICEF external relations manager said in
Harare Tuesday that it is time issues of sex and sexuality are
openly discussed at all levels if the pandemic is to be kept under
check in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Knowledge is power and in light of the AIDS scourge, if we
give youth scanty knowledge then anything is possible," the daily
Herald Wednesday quoted Hatendi as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford to treat these issues as taboo," the
UNICEF official said. "We have to discuss them at family and
national levels."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe joined the rest of the world in marking the Day of the
Africa Child declared by the Organization of African Unity. This
year's theme focuses on the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
About 44 percent of Zimbabwean girls aged between 15 to 19
years are mothers or pregnant, said the Herald.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF, at least 30 percent of the pregnancies
are estimated to be HIV/AIDS positive.

Obasanjo said that when he was under incarceration, "they sent
someone to kill me. Somebody was sent from Abuja to inject me to
death."

"When he came, my doctor asked the person they sent what he
wanted. He said he wanted to take my blood sample," recalled the
president.

"Then my doctor said, 'fine, if you want his blood sample, I
will take it and give to you.' And the person left.

<P>
"Till today, we have not seen the person nor the result of the
analysis nor whatever he did with the sample," said Obasanjo.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Beef Up Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will strengthen its police
force by recruiting some 10,000 policemen annually after the
military withdrawing from its post anti-crime duties, the Post
Express, a major Nigerian daily, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the recruitment will last for the following 12
years, said Ovuakporo Ekama, commissioner of police of Ogun
State.
</P>
<P>
The police boss in Ogun state added Tuesday that records showed
that inadequacy of policemen contributed to the increase in crime
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
The orgy of armed robbery has intensified all over the country,
 signaling a renewed wave of gangsterism and a siege on innocent
citizens less than a month into the new political dispensation,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The worrisome state of the trend prompted the Lagos State House
of Assembly to raise a motion calling on state Governor Bola Ahmed
Tinubu to make the newly established "Rapid Response Squad" to be
more alive to its responsibilities in the new political reality.
</P>
<P>
The squad is widely criticized for its inefficiency in
combating the fast rising crimes in Lagos state. Even some state
legislature members have become victims of the armed robberies
recently, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Sensitize Youth to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean youth should be
sensitized to the danger of AIDS, an official with the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Felicity Hatendi, UNICEF external relations manager said in
Harare Tuesday that it is time issues of sex and sexuality are
openly discussed at all levels if the pandemic is to be kept under
check in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Knowledge is power and in light of the AIDS scourge, if we
give youth scanty knowledge then anything is possible," the daily
Herald Wednesday quoted Hatendi as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford to treat these issues as taboo," the
UNICEF official said. "We have to discuss them at family and
national levels."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe joined the rest of the world in marking the Day of the
Africa Child declared by the Organization of African Unity. This
year's theme focuses on the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
About 44 percent of Zimbabwean girls aged between 15 to 19
years are mothers or pregnant, said the Herald.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF, at least 30 percent of the pregnancies
are estimated to be HIV/AIDS positive.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Delta State Finds Hard to Collect Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Delta state Governor James
Ibori's plan to mop up arms in exchange for cash and job
opportunities in Warri city may encounter difficulties, said a
Nigerian daily Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Itsekiri leader Patrick Fregene said Tuesday "My fear is
whether government has the wherewithal to implement the plan
lofty as it is," according to the Vanguard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
His fear was anchored on the fact that similar calls for arms
surrender had been made in 1997 and 1998 by the state government
but to his knowledge, no group surrounded arms.
</P>
<P>
But ethnic Ijaw leader Elder Eric Botu contended that the
disarmament plan would only work if the warring groups agreed to
really live together as brothers.
</P>
<P>
"If those who have arms now are not sincere or they harbor
hidden motives, it will be difficult to carry out the plan," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
"What Ijaws need to surrender their arms is for the government
to relocate the headquarters of the local government which was
removed from them to Ogbe-Ijoh."
</P>
<P>
"As soon as this is done," said Elder Botu, "Ijaws who are
armed will willingly return their arms to the government. We do
not have any other problem in Warri, it is just this issue of
local government."
</P>
<P>
Governor Ibori had announced his peace plan over the last
weekend offering cash and job opportunities for the militant
youths who surrendered their arms.

<HEADLINE> Thabo Mbeki Inaugurated As S. African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thabo Mbeki was inaugurated here
Wednesday as South Africa's second democratically-elected
president, signalling an end to the (Nelson) Mandela era and the
beginning of a new chapter in the history of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Two days before his 57th birthday, Mbeki raised his right hand
and took the president's oath as South Africa and the world
watched.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, in the president's oath, said he would be faithful to
the Republic of South Africa, and would "obey, observe, uphold and
solemnly and sincerely promise that I will always:
</P>
<P>
--"promote all that will advance the Republic, and oppose all
that may harm it; Protect and promote the rights of all South
Africans;
</P>
<P>
--discharge my duties with all my strength and talents to the
best of my knowledge and ability and true to the dictates of my
conscience, and
</P>
<P>
-- do justice to all; and devote myself to the well-being of
the Republic and all of its people."
</P>
<P>
After signing the oath, Mbeki addressed the nation, saying: "As
South Africans, whatever the difficulties, we are moving forward
in the effort to combine ourselves into one nation of many colors,
many cultures and diverse origins."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to fight poverty, corruption and crimes that are
haunting the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our nights cannot but be nights of nightmares while millions
of our people live in conditions of degrading poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No night can be restful when millions have no jobs, and some
are forced to beg, rob and murder to ensure that they do not
perish from hunger," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki lauded the legacy of the generation represented
pre-eminently by outgoing president Nelson Mandela, the generation
of Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Albertina Sisulu, Ray
Alexander and others.
</P>
<P>
"None of us can peer into their hearts to learn what they feel
as this infant democracy they brought into the world begins its
sixth year of existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Mbeki spoke, thousands of people descended on the Union
Building's lawns to watch the ceremony on a large-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever contingent of world leaders -- including five
members of the royal families, at least 30 presidents, six deputy
presidents and 11 prime ministers -- were seated to watch the
historical event.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Jaroslaw Janicki of Poland
and Birgit Lennartz of Germany upset the early favorites to claim
the men's and women's titles in the 89.9-kilometer Comrades
Marathon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Janicki broke clear with 20 kms remaining to win in five hours
30 minutes 10 seconds, with another dark horse Viktor Zhadanov
from Russia placed second in a time of 5:31.31.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorites Dmitri Grishine of Russia and South African
Charl Mattheus both had wretched runs, lamenting for their loss of
the titles and the dented attempt to break nine-time winner Bruce
Fordyce's 13-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
Diminutive policeman Andrew Kelehe scampered home in 5:32.42 to
finish as first South African in third place.
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Lennartz, 33, who had run over 20 100 kms
races and 19 marathons, overtook early leaders Firaya Sultanova of
Russia and South African Helene Joubert and pulled away with 40
kilometers left.
</P>
<P>
She clocked a relatively slow time of 6:31.03 for the race,
almost four minutes ahead of South African debutant Grace de
Oliveira with Russian Marina Bychkova third in 6:36.34.

<HEADLINE> US  Pledges $10 Million to Support Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has pledged 10
 million U.S. dollars to support the Rwandan judicial system which
plans to resort to traditional court, known as ''Gacaca'' in a bid
to speed up the trial of over 120,000 genocide suspects currently
detained in Rwandan prisons.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made Tuesday by David Scheffer, the U.S. special
envoy for war crimes issues, who was ending a one-day visit to
Rwanda during which he held talks with government officials,
Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
''I'm here to talk with government officials, and with the
office of the prosecutor of the Arusha Tribunal in Kigali, to talk
about how to keep moving forward on bringing justice from the 1994
genocide,'' Scheffer told the press before his departure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official told Rwandan leaders that his government will
provide 10 million dollars this year in support of the domestic
justice initiative including the discussions still under way on
the ''Gacaca Law'' which still needs to be approved by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
About 124,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons for alleged participation in the 1994
mass-killings which claimed over 500,000 lives, mostly Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Trials which began in December 1996 have moved on a slow pace,
and experts believe that at the current rhythm, they could take
about 200 years to finish. Up to now, over 1,500 trials have
taken place in Rwanda's criminal courts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China is now establishing a social
security network including endowment insurance, medicare and
unemployment insurance to provide cover for the employees of
enterprises and retired workers.
</P>
<P>
A recent report, jointly issued by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security and the National Bureau of Statistics, showed that
over 80 percent of employees and 98 percent of retired workers in
China have joined a relevant social security network.
</P>
<P>
China is now reforming the medicare services for urban workers
in over 40 cities. Over four million workers and over one million
retired workers have begun to enjoy this reform since last year,
up 36 percent and 45.7 percent from the figures of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.8 billion yuan was brought in nationwide for
unemployment insurance in 1998 and 5.2 billion yuan paid out, both
up 45 percent from the figures of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report also disclosed that the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security also discovered some cases involving abuse of the social
security fund and has pledged it will strengthen the supervision
of it.

<HEADLINE> CPC, State Council Decision Stresses Priority Status of Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China is to gradually increase its
funding for education which will eventually account for four
percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to a
decision jointly issued by the Communist Party of China's (CPC)
Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Part of this strategy involves local governments shouldering
some of the responsibility by increasing their own education
budgets and giving priority to educational development.
</P>
<P>
Several of the main elements of the education masterplan stress
that the healthy development of both the body and mind of students
has to be guaranteed, and that the legitimate interests and rights
of students and teachers should be well protected.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government decided to raise the ratio of education
expenditure in the annual fiscal budget by one percentage point
each year from 1998 to 2002. Provincial level governments should
also increase their own funding in accordance with their own
financial situations," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The Government encourages various methods of financially
supporting the development of education, such as the introduction
of insurance and loan schemes as well as improving scholarship
programs, and fund-raising activities by enterprises and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The decision also pointed out that China needs more laws and
rules regulating the quality of education.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Construction Posts Rebound in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Wednesday that construction of new homes and apartments posted a
big rebound in May after a sharp decline in April.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts increased 6.3 percent last month to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.676 million units, as compared to 9.7
percent drop in April, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in May was expected and was in line with analysts
expectations.
</P>
<P>
May's housing construction was up in all parts of the country,
with the Northeast leading the way with 158 thousand units, a 16.2
percent increase in May from the month before.
</P>
<P>
The Midwest posted a 10.6 percent jump with 355 thousand units.
The South reported a 4.35 percent increase in housing starts with
744 thousand units and the West posted a 3.20 percent increase
with 419 thousand units.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in housing starts was led by construction
of single-family homes and came despite a 18.3 percent drop in
apartment construction.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in May comes as home builders, while
optimistic about the prospects for home sales in the present and
near term, have voiced concerns about shortages of skilled
construction workers and building materials, such as gypsum
wallboard, insulation and brick, the National Association of Home
Builders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite low unemployment and high consumer confidence, sales of
existing homes dropped in April after an all-time high in March
and the pace of new home sales has begun to cool in recent months,
a move that analysts have attributed to the rising mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Makes Stir at Mbeki's Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi,
unpopular in the West, was accorded a warm welcome here Wednesday
as he was entering the amphitheater at the inauguration ceremony
of South Africa's new President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever contingent of world leaders were watching as
Mbeki, chairman of the African National Congress (ANC), was
inaugurated as South Africa's second democratically-elected
president.
</P>
<P>
The guests were introduced to the 4,500-strong audience as they
walked one by one into the amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
Applause had been sporadic. But when the name of Gaddafi was
announced, the audience responded with a rapture of applause, many
of them rising to their feet, eager to see what a South African
reporter called "a charismatic leader".
</P>
<P>
Among the guests, Gaddafi, wearing a blue army uniform,
received the warmest welcome. Walking with a stick, he waved to
the audience, smiling in response to the ovation.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, a close friend of former South African president
Nelson Mandela, is popular among most of South Africans. But the
close relations between South Africa and Libya have irritated
certain Western countries, the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who always called Gaddafi "my brother", has indicated
on many occasions that South Africa would maintain close ties with
Libya despite pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
Those who disapproved South Africa's relations with Libya, Cuba
and Iran would "go jump in a pool", Mandela said at a recent
luncheon in honor of Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude displayed to Mr. Gaddafi by the audience clearly
showed that we, South Africans, are not dictated by any power in
our dealings with any countries," said the reporter, who refused
to be named.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six presidents, five members of royal families, six
deputy presidents and 11 prime ministers were present at the
ceremony.

XINING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Torrential floods and hail sweeping
parts of northwest China's Qinghai province since June 12 have
claimed 21 lives and injured dozens, while the whereabouts of
three others are unknown, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four days, heavy rains and hail storms fell on
Qinghai and caused deluges and mudflows in 15 counties, where the
rainfall reached 30 mm over the period.
</P>
<P>
So far, the floods and hail have affected hundreds of thousands
of local residents, mostly farmers and herdsmen, damaged 160
houses, submerged 2,400 hectares of farmland, killed 12,000
livestock, and destroyed 16 highways, 39 bridges and a number of
telecommunications and water conservancy facilities.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams have been sent to the affected counties by the
provincial civil affairs department.
</P>
<P>
This year's floods have arrived earlier than the usual period
of July-September, according to experts here. They say that
droughts that have prevailed in the province since last Autumn
further weakened the ability of the soil to absorb water, due to
the lack of vegetation.

<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Flash flood is likely to occur in
the northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh by the end
of this month, the national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The flash flood is likely to submerge Sylhet district, 208
kilometers northeast of here, and its adjoining areas following
heavy rains and onrush or hill waters during the last week of
June, the Meteorological Department (MD) sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Climatic features indicate more rainfall activities along the
northeastern part of the country than that of its northwestern
part, they said.
</P>
<P>
There will be adequate rainfall this year as the monsoon has
set in right time over the country since May 20, they stated.
</P>
<P>
During the month of June last year, the rainfall was almost 50
percent less from the normal as the monsoon was quite delayed or
lately set.
</P>
<P>
"But this year the rainfall recorded in the country was almost
10 percent more than that of the normal in the last month, and it
is likely to remain normal or above normal in June," Deputy
Director of the MD M. Akram Hossain said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the monsoon is likely to become more active
within the next two to three days all over the country and
significant rainfall may be experienced.

HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Seeded Japan became the only
team without a loss after demolishing Malaysia 4-0 here on
Wednesday at the five-team Asian Group Six football qualifying
tournament for the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But the day's highlight went to underdog Nepal who surprised
the Philippines 1-0 to rank second in the group standings with two
wins and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Speedy Nepalese were in total control of the whole match,
outshooting Malaysians 17-10 and their attacking game was finally
rewarded when forward Joshi Naresh shot home in a melee in the box
at 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
"We lost too many chances. For me this is a bad match because
I was very nervous until the last minute," said Nepal's German
head coach Torsten Frank Spittler who trained the Nepal team just
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Japan met much trouble from stubborn Malaysians in the first
half when Junichi Inamoto put Japan 1-0 lead nine minutes into the
game.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese played more aggressively, allowing the Malaysians
no clear chances in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Masahsi Motoyama made it two for his team just 49 seconds into
the second half before Japan sealed the match by adding two more
goals after nine attempts.
</P>
<P>
"We felt much pressed in the first half, and the first two
goals are very important to us," said Japan's French head coach
Philippe Troussier.

MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Olympic Committee
President Celso Dayrit came up with Wednesday an initial list of
240 athletes for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games slated on
August 7-15 in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said in a statement that the number would be the
smallest in the last two decades although the list might still be
reduced or increased depending on the final decision of POC's
general assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 Jakarta SEA Games, the Philippines under the former
POC lady chief Cristy Ramos sent a 600-strong delegation but won
only 23 gold medals behind third placed Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the number of the delegation, the new POC leadership
under Dayrit announced earlier that they will no longer adopt the
"have money, will travel" policy which Ramos used during the 13th
Asian Games last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent POC leadership crisis which ousted Ramos,
the country's sports officials remained optimistic the country
would be the strong contender for third place with a 22-gold medal
prediction.

<HEADLINE>   Philippines Unveils Delegation for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Olympic Committee
President Celso Dayrit came up with Wednesday an initial list of
240 athletes for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games slated on
August 7-15 in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said in a statement that the number would be the
smallest in the last two decades although the list might still be
reduced or increased depending on the final decision of POC's
general assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 Jakarta SEA Games, the Philippines under the former
POC lady chief Cristy Ramos sent a 600-strong delegation but won
only 23 gold medals behind third placed Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the number of the delegation, the new POC leadership
under Dayrit announced earlier that they will no longer adopt the
"have money, will travel" policy which Ramos used during the 13th
Asian Games last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent POC leadership crisis which ousted Ramos,
the country's sports officials remained optimistic the country
would be the strong contender for third place with a 22-gold medal
prediction.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bank to Issue Loans for Overseas Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Pudong Development
Bank, a rising commercial star in this metropolis, will offer
loans for people wishing to study overseas starting on July 1 this
year, bank president Jin Yun said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new service will first be launched for residents in five
cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Ningbo -- and
will be expanded to Chongqing, in southwest China, Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, and several cities in
east Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces before the end of this year,
Jin added.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, all of the bank's operations in major cities
will offer this service," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai bank's move, approved by the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank, has been hailed by observers as a "new
breakthrough" in the provision of loans for educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Residents wishing to study overseas and their direct relatives
or spouses can apply for loans to cover one year's tuition and
other costs, with the maximum set at 500,000 yuan and the longest
repayment term six years," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the stringent regulations applying to the loans stress
that recipients must not be older than 55 years by the time the
loan expires; that they have permanent residence where the loans
are offered; that they have been officially accepted by overseas
universities; and that they have obtained visas. They must also
provide mortgages or third party guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"Loan applications will be processed within seven work days,"
Jin said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Shanghai-headquartered bank became the first in
China to extend loans for education in domestic higher learning
institutions. So far it has issued a total of 100 million yuan in
loans to 1,679 university students nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched its reform and opening-up program in the
late 1970s, 320,000 Chinese students have gone to study in 103
countries and regions and nearly 100,000 of them have returned to
China, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Bank Clerks Seized for Huge Cash Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Greed was the downfall of two bank
clerks who stole 1.4 million yuan from their employer during a
night shift and they have since been arrested by police in the
city of Huludao in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The two robbers, Wang Lianyou and Zhao Guohui, came under
suspicion when local police were informed that the money had gone
missing on May 6.
</P>
<P>
The two originally only stole 10,000 yuan in cash from the
bank, and each got 5,000 yuan. Zhao took his share of the money
home, but Wang could not resist his greed and later returned to
scoop up more than 1.3 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security disclosed today that 24,500
yuan of the stolen money was found in Wang's residence in Changtu
County on May 7, and another 740,000 yuan was seized in the
residence of one of his friends in the small hours of May 8.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, police discovered that Wang was at large in the
vicinity of Manzhouli city, and a special squad was immediately
dispatched to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
He was captured on the afternoon of May 11 on the No. 301
train, which links Beijing with Manzhouli, and police found a
further 260,000 yuan in his luggage.
</P>
<P>
Wang later confessed that he and Zhao got hold of the keys for
the bank's vaults 20 days before the theft by cheating another
bank clerk and that they had another set of keys made secretly.
</P>
<P>
So far, police have recovered 1.37 million yuan and the case
in still under investigation.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Wednesday called for open and merciless fight against
the country's shadow economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the third economic forum in the country's second
largest city of St. Petersburg, Stepashin said Russia's "double-
bottomed economy" is based on semi-criminal capital and on the
concealment of incomes.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that officials are being "drawn in the orbit" of
this economy, Stepashin pointed to the need for "openness and
transparency of the economy," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the special importance of anti-monopoly
regulations as the Russian economy "remains monopolized."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stepashin called for stronger government that "
should create an economic security system based on broad economic
regulations."

He also pledges to support the country's enterprises. "

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Fields Bring Children in Danger of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Children exposed to powerful
magnetic fields are nearly five times more likely to develop
leukemia than those less exposed, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian researchers measured the magnetic fields in the homes
of 201 children diagnosed with leukemia in the Toronto area
between 1985 and 1993. They compared their experience to 406
randomly selected children in the same geographic area who did not
suffer from the cancer.
</P>
<P>
They found that children exposed to high magnetic fields were 4.
5 times more likely to develop leukemia, said local newspaper "
National Post".
</P>
<P>
In most Canadian homes, the average strength of magnetic fields
ranges from 0.5 to 1 milligauss. But homes located near heavy
transmission lines and utility transformers, or those having
poorly grounded wiring, often have a much higher magnetic field,
according to the reports, which described one milligauss as equal
to 1/1000 natural magnetic field of the Earth.

<HEADLINE> Barak Not to Bring Change in Israeli Policy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Wednesday that the election of Ehud Barak as
Israeli Prime Minister will not bring any changes to Israel's
expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
"Iran believes that with the election of Barak, there has not
been any change in the Israeli regime's expansionist policies and
the regime's pressures on the Palestinians have continued,"
Kharrazi said at a meeting with visiting Speaker of the Lebanese
National Assembly (parliament) Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon have been in a deadlock as a result of the hard-line
policies pursued by outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, head of One Israel and leader of the Labor party
defeated Netanyahu in the May 1 7 elections and has almost
completed formation of a new coalition government, reportedly
believed to be narrow-based.
</P>
<P>
Praising the Lebanese Islamic resistance against Israel as
"the pride for Muslims," he said the resistance has made Lebanon
proud and given an impetus to closer unity among the Lebanese
population.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-style security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust the Israeli occupation troops
and their proxy South Lebanon Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's policy is to support Lebanon's Islamic resistance and
unity and independence of the country, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the unity between Iran, Syria and
Lebanon would be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Berri said Israel's pressures on the Palestinians
have not subsided.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese speaker also expressed his country's willingness
to boost bilateral economic and trade ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Berri is currently in Tehran for a three-day founding
conference of Organization of Islamic Parliaments, which started
Tuesday with participation of about 40 Islamic countries.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Attaches Importance to Civil Service Stability: Tsang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Wednesday that the government fully recognizes
the importance of maintaining stability in the Civil Service and
will take forward any proposals on corporatization of government
department in a pragmatic manner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in response to a motion debate on "Privatization of
Government departments" in the Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Tsang said that changes
towards a more efficient public sector is the direction that the
SAR government has to go.
</P>
<P>
In implementing these changes, the government will take into
account the concerns of all stakeholders and strive to seek a
balance of interest when working out individual proposals, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On job security which is one of the key issues of concern,
Tsang said: "Private sector participation or corporatization does
not necessarily mean that all or a significant portion of staff of
the department concerned has to be made redundant."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there were various options to deal with the
staffing arrangements such as secondment of the existing civil
servants to the new corporation or gradual redeployment of any
surplus staff to other suitable positions within the Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to proceed carefully in the process of
achieving  efficiency gains in exchange for a more stable
transition towards corporatization," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We always bear in mind that it is government's policy that
redundancy should be avoided as far as possible," the financial
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He assured the legislators that staff who were directly
affected would be consulted as early as possible when any specific
proposal on corporatization had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the concern about the monitoring mechanism of
service quality and level of charges, Tsang said improvement of
service quality was one of the government's major objectives to
introduce private sector participation, corporatization or
privatization.
</P>
<P>
"This is the thing that we would never sacrifice in the process,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the level of charges, Tsang said free market competition was
the best mechanism to control fees. He pledged that the
Legislative Council's agreement would be sought should there be
any proposal to amend any existing mechanism whereby fees are
subject to the council's approval.

<P>
Pyongyang, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A military source of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Wednesday accused
South Korea of sending eleven warships into its territorial waters
in the wake of an exchange of fire in a disputed area in the
Yellow Sea early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that seven warships of South Korea on Wednesday
morning intruded into the DPRK's territorial waters off the
Kangryong county, south Kwanghae province, at around 08:00 local
time and they were joined later by four more ships at around 08:30
local time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Committee for Peaceful
Reunification of Fatherland of DPRK announced Wednesday that it is
severing contacts with South Korea for the time being in the wake
of an exchange of fire in a disputed area in the Yellow Sea early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, South Korea has reportedly declared
to continue its engagement policy toward DPRK.
</P>
<P>
At a national security meeting chaired by Unification Minister
Lim Dong-won on Tuesday afternoon, the South Korean government
reaffirmed that it will continue to implement President Kim Dae-
jung's "sunshine policy" which favors engaging Pyongyang through
reconciliation, cooperation and exchanges based on separating
business from politics.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Makes Stir at Mbeki's Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi,
unpopular in the West, was accorded a warm welcome here Wednesday
as he was entering the amphitheater at the inauguration ceremony
of South Africa's new President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever contingent of world leaders were watching as
Mbeki, chairman of the African National Congress (ANC), was
inaugurated as South Africa's second democratically-elected
president.
</P>
<P>
The guests were introduced to the 4,500-strong audience as they
walked one by one into the amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
Applause had been sporadic. But when the name of Gaddafi was
announced, the audience responded with a rapture of applause, many
of them rising to their feet, eager to see what a South African
reporter called "a charismatic leader".
</P>
<P>
Among the guests, Gaddafi, wearing a blue army uniform,
received the warmest welcome. Walking with a stick, he waved to
the audience, smiling in response to the ovation.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, a close friend of former South African president
Nelson Mandela, is popular among most of South Africans. But the
close relations between South Africa and Libya have irritated
certain Western countries, the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who always called Gaddafi "my brother", has indicated
on many occasions that South Africa would maintain close ties with
Libya despite pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
Those who disapproved South Africa's relations with Libya, Cuba
and Iran would "go jump in a pool", Mandela said at a recent
luncheon in honor of Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude displayed to Mr. Gaddafi by the audience clearly
showed that we, South Africans, are not dictated by any power in
our dealings with any countries," said the reporter, who refused
to be named.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six presidents, five members of royal families, six
deputy presidents and 11 prime ministers were present at the
ceremony.

<HEADLINE>   IOC President Vows for Comprehensive Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 16 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee (IOC)
President Juan Antonio Samaranch vowed here on Wednesday to
conduct comprehensive reforms necessary to consolidate the Olympic
Movement.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the 109th IOC session held at Seoul
Art Center, Samaranch acknowledged the errors IOC had committed
and said IOC accepted its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that the IOC has faced a crisis which arose
from the selection of Salt Lake City to host the XIX Olympic
Winter Games in 2002, and which was followed by an unprecedented
worldwide media campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
So he said it was for this that the Ethics Commission and the
IOC 2000 Commission, which are composed of representatives of the
athletes, the IOC, the International Federations, the National
Olympic Committees as well as outside personalities, were set up
and began their respective tasks.
</P>
<P>
"We can say yes to the reforms necessary to consolidate the
Olympic Movement without renouncing our convictions, to reforms
without destroying the heritage of founder Pierre de Coubertin, to
reforms which lead to a greater association of the International
Federations and the National Olympic Committees with the
leadership of the Olympic Movement," said the IOC chief.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said his concern is to leave to his successor at the
end of his term in 2001 an institution which is over 100 years old,
solid and beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
"My concern today is to bring the IOC 2000 Commission's work to
a successful conclusion and ensure that proposals for reform are
implemented in the best interests of the Olympic Movement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the IOC chief announced that South Korea's
traditional sport, taekwondo, will for the first time be on the
Olympic program at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Present in the last session of the IOC Congress in the 20th
century are South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and some 3,000
prominent figures from sports administrators, national Olympic
committees and journalists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul session will select a host city for the 2006 Winter
Olympics from among a list of six cities -- Helsinki of Finland;
Klagenfurt of Austria; Zakopane of Poland; Poprad-Tatry of
Slovakia; Turin of Italy and Sion of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The result of the final selection will be made public Saturday
after a vote.
</P>
<P>
The session will also elect a new IOC vice-president and
several IOC executive board and IOC members.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Xiao Yang, president of the
Supreme People's Court, met today with a delegation of the Supreme
Constitutional Court of Egypt led by justice Wahid Mahmoud Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views about various judicial matters.
</P>
<P>
Legal professionals from all countries should abide by valid
international norms, including the United Nations Charter and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
"Only by those norms being commonly adopted could the world
build a new political and economic order," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that national sovereignty must always have priority
above human rights and that no nation should violate the
sovereignty of another nation under the guise of protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said he hoped that courts of China and Egypt will help
encourage the world's nations to safeguard international norms
under the auspices of the law.

SHENZHEN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Customs Office in
south China's Guangdong Province has collected duties valued at 5.
28 billion yuan (636 million U.S. dollars) in the first five
months of this year, 75.4 percent of that expected for the whole
year.
</P>
<P>
It is also 117.9 percent more than that of the corresponding
period last year. Wang Keguang, vice head of the office,
attributed the vast increase to the severe crack-down on
smuggling in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Office uncovered 1,501 smuggling cases during the
period with the value of the cargo totaling 411 million yuan (50
million U.S. dollars), 30 and 22.3 percent up respectively. Among
these cases, the tax evasion would have exceeded 800 million yuan,
and 220 suspects were detained.
</P>
<P>
The office has also made progress on cracking down on the
smuggling of refined oil. Such cases in the first five months of
this year reached 364, and 12,000 tons of oil valued at 28.86
million yuan was confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Hits 4.5% in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's month-on-month inflation
rose to 4.5 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, according to
the June Monthly Economic Review of the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rose due to the effect of the weakening Kenyan
currency shilling, the review says.
</P>
<P>
The shilling declined to 73.99 shillings to one U.S. dollar
last week, compared to about 60 shillings to one dollar early this
year, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank report, the average annual
inflation declined marginally from 7. 4 percent in April to 6.7
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall annual inflation remained subdued due to
the tight money supply and improved supply of basic food stuffs in
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The review predicts that the recent weakening of the shilling
will result in price increase.
</P>
<P>
The shilling weakened against all major foreign currencies
during May. It declined to 68.8 shillings to one dollar from 65.4
shillings to one dollar in April. It also dropped by five percent
against the sterling pound, from 105. 3 shillings to one pound in
April to 111.2 shillings to one pound in May.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the fall of shilling to a shortage
of foreign exchange inflows from tea and coffee sectors, the delay
in concluding negotiation with the International Monetary Fund,
capital flight as hot money fled the country and the government's
involvement in the foreign exchange market to raise money to repay
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kenya's foreign exchange reserves declined to
the lowest level in recent years, falling to 674 million dollars
in April this year from 866 million dollars in April, 1998.

<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has disclosed a failed attempt of the late Nigerian head of state,
Sani Abacha, to kill him in the jail.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception for him by the Nigerian community in
Pretoria, South Africa, the president said that he was perspired
"to step on toes to better the lot of the nation," even if it
means death.
</P>
<P>
After commissioning the new Nigerian Chancery in Pretoria,
Obasanjo said that when he was under incarceration, "they sent
someone to kill me. Somebody was sent from Abuja to inject me to
death."
</P>
<P>
"When he came, my doctor asked the person they sent what he
wanted. He said he wanted to take my blood sample," recalled the
president.
</P>
<P>
"Then my doctor said, 'fine, if you want his blood sample, I
will take it and give to you.' And the person left.
</P>
<P>
"Till today, we have not seen the person nor the result of the
analysis nor whatever he did with the sample," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The president that his reference to the past was borne out of
the need for Nigerians in South Africa and everywhere to
contribute their quota to national development as that is the
easiest way to reposition the country for greatness.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo arrived Pretoria via Water Kloof Air Force Base
Tuesday after a four-hour stop-over in Namibia where he held talks
with Namibian leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will strengthen its police
force by recruiting some 10,000 policemen annually after the
military withdrawing from its post anti-crime duties, the Post
Express, a major Nigerian daily, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the recruitment will last for the following 12
years, said Ovuakporo Ekama, commissioner of police of Ogun
State.
</P>
<P>
The police boss in Ogun state added Tuesday that records showed
that inadequacy of policemen contributed to the increase in crime
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
The orgy of armed robbery has intensified all over the country,
 signaling a renewed wave of gangsterism and a siege on innocent
citizens less than a month into the new political dispensation,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The worrisome state of the trend prompted the Lagos State House
of Assembly to raise a motion calling on state Governor Bola Ahmed
Tinubu to make the newly established "Rapid Response Squad" to be
more alive to its responsibilities in the new political reality.
</P>
<P>
The squad is widely criticized for its inefficiency in
combating the fast rising crimes in Lagos state. Even some state
legislature members have become victims of the armed robberies
recently, said the report.

Felicity Hatendi, UNICEF external relations manager said in

LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Delta state Governor James
Ibori's plan to mop up arms in exchange for cash and job

<P>
Itsekiri leader Patrick Fregene said Tuesday "My fear is

lofty as it is," according to the Vanguard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
His fear was anchored on the fact that similar calls for arms
surrender had been made in 1997 and 1998 by the state government
but to his knowledge, no group surrounded arms.
</P>
<P>
But ethnic Ijaw leader Elder Eric Botu contended that the
disarmament plan would only work if the warring groups agreed to
really live together as brothers.
</P>
<P>
"If those who have arms now are not sincere or they harbor
hidden motives, it will be difficult to carry out the plan," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
"What Ijaws need to surrender their arms is for the government
to relocate the headquarters of the local government which was
removed from them to Ogbe-Ijoh."
</P>
<P>
"As soon as this is done," said Elder Botu, "Ijaws who are
armed will willingly return their arms to the government. We do
not have any other problem in Warri, it is just this issue of
local government."
</P>
<P>
Governor Ibori had announced his peace plan over the last
weekend offering cash and job opportunities for the militant
youths who surrendered their arms.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Lebanese Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Wednesday reiterated Iran's support for Lebanon's resistance
movement against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabin
Berri, Khatami said that "to support the (Lebanese) resistance is
our Islamic and religious duty," the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend that all streams consider resistance as a
manifestation of the dignity of the Islamic and Arab nations and
that everybody supports this resistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Berri that the Lebanese resistance has stood
against an aggressor on behalf of the entire world of Islam
and Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of the God, has been fighting
to dislodge Israeli occupation forces and its ally South Lebanon
Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also noted that the Palestinian crisis would not be
resolved as long as the occupied territories are in Israel's hands
and the Palestinian people are displaced.
</P>
<P>
On the Tehran-Beirut ties, he said that Iran attaches special
importance to promoting ties with Lebanon and voiced Iran's
willingness to expand economic cooperation with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri said Lebanon favors that Tehran-Beirut economic relations
would not be restricted to the two governments and that Iranian
and Lebanese businessmen should further promote such ties.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official is here to attend the three-day founding
conference of the Organization of the Islamic Parliaments which
opened Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Top French Cyclist Barred from Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Organizers on Wednesday kicked
French cyclist Richard Virenque out of this year's Tour de France,
citing his presence would be incompatible with the image of the
cycling classic.
</P>
<P>
"Richard Virenque epitomizes, in his name, in his image, the
doping phenomenon, whether or not he is responsible for the
situation," said Jean-Marie Leblanc, director of the race.
</P>
<P>
Organizers also expelled Casino's Laurent Roux and Cofidis'
Philippe Gaumont, two riders under suspension from their teams.
The TVM team has been banned in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
Spanish team ONCE is free to enter, but without its sporting
director Manolo Saiz and its doctor Nicolas Terrados.
</P>
<P>
Virenque, a former Tour de France runnerup, is still under
formal investigation by French authorities following the Festina
doping scandal at last year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
Virenque quit the sport last year after his team Festina
canceled his contract and he was unable to find a new team until
the Italian Polti team offered him a two-year deal in January.
</P>
<P>
Virenque had said he was looking forward to competing in the
Tour for it is "my reason for living".

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh Wednesday emphasized the
importance to further strengthen Cambodia-China friendly and
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with Xinhua before his visiting
to China, Ranariddh said that he is convinced that his visit to
China will strengthen traditional Cambodia-China friendship and
promote trade and economic cooperation as well as the exchanges
between two country's parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in order to enhance the exchanges of friendly visit
between the two parliaments, we has planed to form a
Cambodia-China friendship working group."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh highly appraised China's status and role in the
regional and international affairs, saying that as a power in
Asia, China has played the most important role in promoting peace,
stability and economic development of the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
He firmly believed that China will be sure to play more and
more important role in the 21st century in maintaining peace,
promoting human progress and development.
</P>
<P>
The Prince thanked for China's important contributions in
helping maintain the independence and sovereignty of Cambodia, and
helping realize his country's peace and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also spoke highly of China's great achievements in
the reform and opening-up drive initiated by late leader Deng
Xiaoping, and expressed congratulations for the forthcoming 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cambodia always pays great attention to the
relation with China because China hold a significant status in
Cambodia's foreign policy. "Cambodia will continue to maintain and
develop friendship with China," the Prince stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the trade and economy, Ranariddh expressed his welcome of
Chinese companies and businessmen to invest in Cambodia especially

rich agricultural resources to develop plant and aquiculture
industries as well as the processing of agriculture products for
export.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh will head a delegation on a week-long official visit
to China on Thursday at the invitation of Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China.

<HEADLINE> Law For Protecting Famous Cities In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Legislators in east China's
Zhejiang Province have just passed a law protecting historical and
cultural cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
The law is intended to preserve the original appearance of
historical and cultural cities and says that local governments
need to make protecting cities a part of their economic and social
development plans and that they need to work out special
protection plans at most two years after an historical and
cultural city is officially designated.
</P>
<P>
No construction projects will be allowed without approval from
local relics administrations.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang now has 11 state or provincial-level historical and
cultural cities and 18 historical and cultural zones.
</P>
<P>
Damage has already been done to some historical sites because
of a lack of legal protection in the province.

<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran fetched 56 million U.S. dollars from fisheries
exports last Iranian calendar year which ended March 20, up by 14
percent compared to the year before, an Iranian official announced
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 56 million dollars, 42 million dollars came from exports
of caviar and the rest from exports of various kinds of fishes,
said deputy construction Jihad minister and director general of
the Iranian Fisheries Organization, who was named only as Jalali.
</P>
<P>
Out of over 423,000 tons of fish caught last Iranian year,
75,000 tons were netted in inland waters, he added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab oil producers are expected to see their oil
revenues exceed 90 billion U.S. dollars this year, up by over 30
percent, the Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arab oil revenues last year had reached some 69.5 billion
dollars which in real terms would amount to only 51 billion
dollars, less than one third of the standard revenues in 1980,
which stood at approximately 160 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average prices of OPEC oil would vary from 14 to 15 dollars
a barrel this year, as compared to 12.28 dollars last year, said
Nicola Sarkis, Director of the Paris-based Arab World Oil
Institute.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will see its gross domestic product (GDP) grow
by over 5 percent this year, making it a forerunner in economic
development in the whole Arab region, the Egyptian daily "Alam Al
Yom" reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia ranks the second with a growth rate of 4.2 percent,
followed by Morocco at 3 percent, Lebanon, Qatar and Algeria at
2.5 percent respectively, and Syria the last at 1.5 percent, said
a study conducted by the research department of the Middle East
Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco delivered the ownership of 52 state-owned
business to private sector from 1993 to 1998 and subdivided them
into 24 companies and 18 hotels, the Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom"
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The transfer was carried out by 78 transactions, of which 52
were sold to principal shareholders, 15 on behalf of the workers,

<HEADLINE> Thabo Mbeki Inaugurated As S. African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thabo Mbeki was inaugurated here
Wednesday as South Africa's second democratically-elected
president, signalling an end to the (Nelson) Mandela era and the
beginning of a new chapter in the history of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Two days before his 57th birthday, Mbeki raised his right hand
and took the president's oath as South Africa and the world
watched.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, in the president's oath, said he would be faithful to
the Republic of South Africa, and would "obey, observe, uphold and
solemnly and sincerely promise that I will always:
</P>
<P>
--"promote all that will advance the Republic, and oppose all
that may harm it; Protect and promote the rights of all South
Africans;
</P>
<P>
--discharge my duties with all my strength and talents to the
best of my knowledge and ability and true to the dictates of my
conscience, and
</P>
<P>
-- do justice to all; and devote myself to the well-being of
the Republic and all of its people."
</P>
<P>
After signing the oath, Mbeki addressed the nation, saying: "As
South Africans, whatever the difficulties, we are moving forward
in the effort to combine ourselves into one nation of many colors,
many cultures and diverse origins."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to fight poverty, corruption and crimes that are
haunting the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our nights cannot but be nights of nightmares while millions
of our people live in conditions of degrading poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No night can be restful when millions have no jobs, and some
are forced to beg, rob and murder to ensure that they do not
perish from hunger," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki lauded the legacy of the generation represented
pre-eminently by outgoing president Nelson Mandela, the generation
of Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Albertina Sisulu, Ray
Alexander and others.
</P>
<P>
"None of us can peer into their hearts to learn what they feel
as this infant democracy they brought into the world begins its
sixth year of existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Mbeki spoke, thousands of people descended on the Union
Building's lawns to watch the ceremony on a large-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever contingent of world leaders -- including five
members of the royal families, at least 30 presidents, six deputy
presidents and 11 prime ministers -- were seated to watch the
historical event.

<HEADLINE> US  Pledges $10 Million to Support Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has pledged 10
 million U.S. dollars to support the Rwandan judicial system which
plans to resort to traditional court, known as ''Gacaca'' in a bid
to speed up the trial of over 120,000 genocide suspects currently
detained in Rwandan prisons.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made Tuesday by David Scheffer, the U.S. special
envoy for war crimes issues, who was ending a one-day visit to
Rwanda during which he held talks with government officials,
Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
''I'm here to talk with government officials, and with the
office of the prosecutor of the Arusha Tribunal in Kigali, to talk
about how to keep moving forward on bringing justice from the 1994
genocide,'' Scheffer told the press before his departure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official told Rwandan leaders that his government will
provide 10 million dollars this year in support of the domestic
justice initiative including the discussions still under way on
the ''Gacaca Law'' which still needs to be approved by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
About 124,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons for alleged participation in the 1994
mass-killings which claimed over 500,000 lives, mostly Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Trials which began in December 1996 have moved on a slow pace,
and experts believe that at the current rhythm, they could take
about 200 years to finish. Up to now, over 1,500 trials have
taken place in Rwanda's criminal courts.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Figure Plunges To 19-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people out of work
and claiming benefit fell in May to its lowest level for 19 years,
according to the latest official figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Office for National Statistics show that
unemployment fell by 6,500 to 1.285 million in May, with the rate
unchanged at 4.5 percent, based on the number of people claiming
benefit.
</P>
<P>
The broader measure of unemployment by ILO also fell from 6.3
percent to 6.2 percent in the three months to April. That figure
fell by 23,000 to 1.81 million.
</P>
<P>
The figures are better than was expected by most analysts, and
suggest that the UK has weathered the economic storms of the past
six months, and is heading for a "soft landing."
</P>
<P>
Employment minister Andrew Smith welcomed "the continued
strength and buoyancy of the labor market."
</P>
<P>
However, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) believes the official
data paints a picture which has little to do with reality, and
says there are large numbers of "hidden unemployed."
</P>
<P>
In a report the TUC's researchers say the real rate of
unemployment has been disguised by a cut in "workforce
participation rates."

<HEADLINE> China to Push Forward Education in Qualities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua)-- China has decided to push forward
education in qualities of students which encourage originality in
them and improve their practical abilities.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced earlier this week by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
In a special report, the CPC pointed out that education in
qualities should be available to all students, and a favorable
environment created for their development. The decision also
stresses that teachers should encourage independent thinking and a
creative spirit amongst students.
</P>
<P>
The decision was aimed at establishing a vigorous socialist
educational system with Chinese characteristics, and paving the
way for implementing the policy of revitalizing the nation with
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
All schools must carry out education of patriotism,
collectivism, socialism, and excellent cultural traditions of the
Chinese nation, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
A particularly important aspect of the decision is to create a
channel for nurturing qualified staff and workers in the future by
combining education with labor.
</P>
<P>
The CPC called for the society to provide conditions for
schools to promote and encourage laboring activities, scientific
research and a range of socially connected activities.

<HEADLINE> Russian, U.S. Defense Ministers Arrive in Helsinki for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived here
Wednesday for talks to solve a dispute between the two countries
over Russia's peacekeeping role in the war-battered Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Sergeyev told reporters that he had
instructions from Russian President Boris Yeltsin that all
unsettled issues involving the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo be
settled in line with the U.N. resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that all differences over Russia's advance troops in
Kosovo had been eliminated in negotiations between Russian and
NATO officers and it was unnecessary for the West to be worried
over the presence of the Russian troops in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of 200-300 Russian paratroopers and 50 armored
vehicles, including tanks, unexpectedly entered Pristina early
last Saturday ahead of NATO troops and controlled a military
airport southwest of Pristina, stunning the Western powers.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he believed that the Helsinki talks would be
constructive and all kinds of differences between the two sides
could be removed ahead of a meeting  between Yeltsin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton Sunday at the G-8 summit in Germany so that
they could focus their discussions on their two countries'
strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington for the Finnish capital, Cohen said
the talks on options on Russia's part in Kosovo peacekeeping had
made much headway and the United States would study the options in
line with the two basic principles: a unified command and no
separate sector for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers will meet Wednesday afternoon after a
meeting between Cohen and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who
met Sergeyev in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright are scheduled to arrive here Wednesday
afternoon and Thursday afternoon to join the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 China Light Industry
Exposition opened here today in the International Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
The five day exposition, sponsored by the State Administration
of Light Industry, displays to the outside world the great
achievements made by the sector since the founding of new China,
and especially the initiation of the reform and opening up in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The event has also attracted advanced equipment and
technologies from developed countries, and there are high
expectations that there will be significant signings of orders and
contracts for a range of light industry products.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition hall has a floor space of 14,000 sq.m, with more
than 600 booths manned by over 350 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of reform, China's light industry has scored
remarkable achievements and the country has become one of the
world's largest producers and exporters of products from the
sector in terms of variety, output and trade.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that to date the whole sector has made us
of overseas funding to the tune of 40 billion U.S. dollars, and
has set up more than 20,000 overseas funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year the industry realized a total industrial value of 1,
667 billion yuan, with exports hitting 54.96 billion U.S. dollars.
These two figures account for one third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
China now makes more than 300,000 different light industry

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Increase Six Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in May are
anticipated to increase at least six percent, reflecting a
promising prospect that the country's exports will meet the
targeted four percent growth this year, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that much progress had been seen in Thailand's
exports, with unofficial figures showing that exports to overseas
markets in May rose at least six to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The export growth in the past two months was a result of the
government's export promotional measures, which were divided into
those addressing export barriers and those speeding up export
procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry also issued certificates of good quality
products with internationally accepted standard to exporters to
help them expand existing overseas markets and penetrate new ones.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that additional measures to promote exports would
be introduced to help achieve the target, including the
establishment of a center for promoting new markets and a center
for export credit guarantee.
</P>
<P>
There have been speculations recently that the country's
exports may not achieve the targeted four percent growth after an
average 2.4 percent decline was recorded in the first four months
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the country's central bank, has
lowered its exports target from four percent to 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, exports began to pick up in April with a 4.7 percent
growth after declines in the first three months in 1999.
</P>
<P>
BOT experts believed that the Thai economy will succeed in
reaching the one percent growth target, prompted mainly by the
stimulated domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Warned Against Belgian Meat, Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government warned
the public Wednesday to refrain from consuming meat and dairy
products from Belgium as a precaution against the reported dioxin
contamination.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the presidential office said that
Filipinos should avoid eating meat and milk products from Belgium
as the European country has not issued a certification that its
products are safe from contamination.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Bureau of Food and Drug of the Philippines
ordered the recall from the country's supermarkets, duty-free
shops and drug outlets of all meat and dairy products manufactured
since January this year by European countries, such as Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"Since the issuance of the order last Friday, only three
countries -- France, Germany and the Netherlands -- have submitted
certifications from their respective governments that their
products are dioxin-free," the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Department of Agriculture has formed an ad hoc
committee to monitor developments and gather information related
to the dioxin contamination of feeds and other food products from
the four European countries.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, the Department of Agriculture suspended importation
of feeds, meat and dairy products, and all processed food from the
four countries.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Fire Threat Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- With the rainy season approaching a
three-month long fight against forest and grassland fire was
declared at an end today in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Most of the firefighters had withdrawn from their respective
watching posts this morning, while the armed police engaged in
fire-control activities are preparing to return to normal missions.
</P>
<P>
Fires broke out more than 60 times in the last three months in
the east part of Inner Mongolia, but all were put out within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Serious forest and grassland fires have occurred every year
during the past five years in Inner Mongolia and a forest fire
raged for nine days in the Greater Hinggan Mountains in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region last year.
</P>
<P>
This year Inner Mongolia has stepped up fire-control efforts
and adopted a responsibility system which requires officials to
stay on high alert for possible fires and holds them responsible
for the occurrence of fires.
</P>
<P>
The use of fire was also strictly banned in those fire-prone
areas this year and fire fighting squads were strengthened and
consolidated.

<HEADLINE> CCB Becomes Clearing Bank for Airfreight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that it has won a bid to become China's only
clearing bank for the Civil Cargo Accounting Settlement System (
CCASS).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CCB said that this is another breakthrough
in the bank's air transportation settlement business after its
access to the clearing business for Civil Aviation Billing and
Settlement Plan (BSP) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The CASS is an industrial clearing system established by the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) after the BSP to
report sales and settlement conditions between aviation companies
and their sales agents. It officially starts operations in China
this year.
</P>
<P>
The CCB is the 57th BSP clearing bank for IATA in the world,
and over the past three years the bank has cleared a total of 8.4
billion yuan for the BSP. So far 18 aviation companies and some
500 agents have opened sales income accounts in the CCB.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that as a clearing bank for CASS, the CCB
will undertake capital clearing and data processing businesses for
civil airfreight, some 20 aviation companies and several hundreds
of airfreight agents are expected to open capital clearing
accounts in the CCB.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's water environment is still
grim according to the latest situation report which highlights
major problems such as pollution, shortage of resources and floods.
</P>
<P>
The annual report released by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) says that although the total
release of sewage decreased in 1998, the country's water is still
seriously polluted. The surface water in some rural areas has been
contaminated by chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a total of 39.5 billion tons of sewage
was released into rivers, lakes and coastal waters last year, down
five percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, according to observers, the water quality of the
Yangtze, Huaihe and Pearl rivers has improved, compared with 1997,
while the Yellow, Haihe and Songhua rivers remained the same. But
the water quality of the Liaohe River deteriorated last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, all of China's large fresh-water lakes
and urban lakes suffered moderate contamination while the
pollution in Chaohu, Dianchi and Taihu lakes is still serious.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the treatment rate of China's industrial
sewage reached 87.4 percent in 1998, up 8.5 percentage points than
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Should Value Electronic Commerce: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's progress in developing
electronic commerce is hindered by the country's slow awareness of
its value, experts from the sector have warned.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Tuesday to promote a planned July
forum on electronic commerce, they all agreed that if the value of
electronic commerce is fully understood by Chinese enterprises and
people, the country will speed up its utilization and even catch
up with the western world in terms of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Guo Weiqiong, manager of Magic Media, a marketing company in
the high-tech industry, pointed out that technically China was
only behind most western countries by no more than two years in
electronic commerce development.
</P>
<P>
"Many western countries have not completed the infrastructure
for electronic commerce, which has given China time to catch up
and learn from their experience," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
However, others were on the opinion that it is non-technical
problems that are blocking progress.
</P>
<P>
Chen Libo, an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission's information center, said China has almost no laws and
regulations concerning electronic commerce. In this regard the gap
between China and the West is not so narrow.
</P>
<P>
Yang Baosheng, who works for China's largest computer network
Chinanet, said electronic commerce is a wonderful project which
should involve the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
"The government should let the public be aware of the coming
information age and enact related laws and regulations. But this
is not a quick process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang explained that in certain organizations people are
restrained from making full use of computers and the Internet for
security's sake.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the leaking of information is much less
likely via computer networks than via person-to-person
communication. The concept is yet to be accepted by many Chinese
organizations.

competitive offices in the process with a view to developing a
high quality service network in China.
</P>
<P>
China's accountancy offices have traditionally been attached to
government branches, which left them open to interference in terms
of official auditing figures.
</P>
<P>
So far, 117 accountant and audit offices have been separated
from government and further changes are under way.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Indian Allegation of Violating Geneva  Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday rejected the
Indian allegation that the Pakistani armed forces had violated the
Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Office said that Indian Deputy
High Commissioner Ruchi Chanashyam was summoned to the Foreign
Office Wednesday afternoon and was told that Pakistan
categorically rejects the Indian allegation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side has accused Pakistan of mutilating the dead
bodies of the Indian soldiers who were killed while, Pakistan
said, intruding into Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Chanashyam was reminded that the dead bodies of the Indian
pilot and Indian soldiers were returned to the Indian side with
fully military honors during flag meetings between military
officers of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
No charges of torture or mutilation were raised by the Indian
side at the time of these flag meetings, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It also said, "Pakistan was under no compulsion to return these
dead bodies and it did not stand to reason as to why the Pakistani
side would hand over self-incriminating evidence even if there was
an iota of truth to the Indian allegation."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Pakistan had returned the dead bodies as well
as the captured Indian pilot, Flight Lieutenant K. Nachiketa, in
good health, as verified by the International Committee of the Red
Cross, which underscored Pakistan's commitment to restraint and to
defuse prevailing tensions, said the press release.

PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) - South African outgoing president
Nelson Mandela formally handed power to Thabo Mbeki at the
government headquarters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, 56, was sworn in as the second all-race-elected
president by Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said, "I swear that I will be faithful to the republic
of South Africa and will obey, observe, uphold and maintain the
constitution and all other law of the republic."

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Sworn in As South Africa's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as South
Africa's second ever black president here Wednesday, assuming the
office of the 80- year-old Nelson Mandela, who is named as
"Africa's greatest son."
</P>
<P>
"I swear that I will be faithful to the Republic of South
Africa and will obey, observe, uphold and maintain the
constitution and all other law of the republic," 56-year-old Mbeki
pledged before Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson in
the amphitheater of the government headquarters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The second democratically-elected president since the country's
first all-race multi-party elections in 1994, with his voice rough
as a result of influenza, took the oath in several South African
languages including Zulu, English and the Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that what we will do will not only better our own
condition as a people, but will also make a contribution, however
small, to the success of Africa's renaissance, towards the
identification of the century ahead of us as the African century,"
Mbeki said later in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
This shows that foreign policy would figure highly in Mbeki's
first five years in the presidential seat, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the South African government policy will be driven by
economic considerations much more than under Mandela, the analysts
noted.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 guests including Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe witnessed the swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Mandela sat side by side while some 20,000 tribal
praise singers, dancers and spectators paid tribute.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 foreign heads of state and government and thousands of
other dignitaries attended the inauguration ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Pledges to Pull S. Africa Out of Nightmares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, june 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new president,
Thabo Mbeki pledged here Wednesday to pull South Africa out of
nightmares of poverty and crimes.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the promise in his acceptance speech at his
inauguration as the second ever black president since the county's
first all-race multi- party elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has just assumed the office of 80-year-old Nelson
Mandela, has pledged to speed the delivery of a better life to
millions of poor blacks denied basic rights for 300 years by the
ruling white minority.
</P>
<P>
"Our nights cannot but be nights of nightmares while millions
of our people live in conditions of degrading poverty," said the
56-year-old new president.
</P>
<P>
"No night can be restful when millions have no jobs, and some
are forced to beg, rob and murder to ensure that they and their
own do not perish from hunger," Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to fight against the rampant crimes which pose
threat to life of the people and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Our days will remain forever haunted when frightening numbers
of the women and children of our country fall victim to rape and
other crimes of violence," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Africa suffered a murder rate of 59
per 100, 000 people and 116 rapes per 100,000 in 1998 and is
believed to be one of the most violent countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
There won't be peace of mind "when the citizens of our country
feel they have neither safety nor security because of the terrible
deeds of criminals and their gangs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new president also called upon the people to cooperate with
the government to seek a safe environment for both life and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South African government is fully conscious of
the fact that it has entered into a contract with the people and
should work in partnership with them to build a winning nation.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A website supporting a training
and development project aimed at small and medium-sized Chinese
enterprises (SMEs) was set up recently by the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The website, the first of its kind in China, was jointly
created by the Training Department and SMEs Department of SETC and
China Hewlett-Packard Co.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to assist SMEs managers to learn about
government policies, study advanced management techniques and
solve problems in applying IT technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongming, director of the SETC Training Department, said
that he hoped the website will serve as a bridge between the
government and SMEs and will also enable all sectors to combine
their efforts in improving the IT awareness of SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The website (www.e-sme.com.cn) has a series of sections,
including an IT classroom, information about government and
successful management case studies.

<HEADLINE> Fair Polls Strengthened Indonesian Currency: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The fair and smooth election
coupled with the right economic policies have led to the recent
strengthening of the rupiah, Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before attending a limited cabinet
meeting here, Ginandjar said the government had never thought that
the rupiah would regain strength rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with this development and we hope that rupiah
would further strengthen gradually. It would be good if its value
remains at the 7,000 level but we are optimistic that it would
further improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was closing at 7,280/7,300 to the U.S. dollar here
on Wednesday, compared to 7,160/7,190 per dollar on Tuesday which
was the highest level since October last year.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government was expecting the rupiah to get
stronger if the June 7 election turned out to be fair and
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the positive trend to two main factors -- the
government's right economic policies and the gradual improvement
in the country's political stability.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the rupiah would improve to a level lower
than 7,000 until the general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly late this year.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar however noted that the government prefers a gradual
strengthening of the rupiah to a quick one which could hamper the
country's export activities.
</P>
<P>
Banking interest rates are also expected to fall following the
strengthening of the rupiah, he added.
</P>
<P>
A few months ahead of former president Soeharto's resignation
in May 1998, the rupiah plunged to 15,000 against the U.S. dollar.
Soeharto was replaced by B.J. Habibie on May 21 last year amid
mounting student demonstrations and bloody unrests hitting many
parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Welcomes Shas Leader's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua)-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday expressed welcome to Shas party leader Aryeh Deri's
decision to resign from the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend to involve in politics, but I want to express
my welcome to Deri's decision to resign as Shas party leader so
that the party could join the next new government," Weizman was
quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deri announced his resignation Tuesday night at Shas party
headquarters in Jerusalem. And the Council of Torah Sages of Shas
is scheduled to meet Wednesday afternoon to decided whether to
accept his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Deri has become a controversial political figure in Israel in
recent years. Just before the May 17 general elections, he was
sentenced by the Jerusalem District Court to a four-year prison
term for fraud and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the powerful Orthodox party, won 17 seats of the
120-seat Knesset (parliament) in the May elections and Deri gave
up his newly-elected Knesset seat just after the elections.
</P>
<P>
But as the coalition talks going on, political parties such as
Meretz refused to accept Shas into the coalition, citing the
crime that Deri had committed in the past.
</P>
<P>
Deri's resignation will pave the way for Shas to join the
coalition to be headed by Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he will visit Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef at his Jerusalem residence later Wednesday afternoon to
discuss with him the possibility of Shas's participation in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Whether Deri's resignation will satisfy or help Meretz change
its anti-Shas attitude remains unknown right now. Other parties
such as the Center and Yisrael Ba'aliya have already expressed
welcome to Deri's move.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Nuclear Waste in Caspian Sea: Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- No "reliable information" is yet
available on Azerbaijan's measure on dumping nuclear waste into
the Caspian Sea, said a senior Iranian official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Qiassinejad, an official at Iran's Atomic Energy
Organization, said that the allegation has neither been confirmed
by any official source nor the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA).
</P>
<P>
As the Caspian Sea water is flowing, if the amount of
radioactive substances it contains rises, it will be immediately
known with the sampling in the Iranian coastal water, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Baku-based Express daily reported recently that the
Republic of Azerbaijan reached agreements with foreign companies
on dumping atomic waste in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The report said that official representatives of foreign
companies in Azerbaijan have negotiated transfer of atomic waste
to the republic for dumping in the Caspian Sea in return for
260,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report raised grave concern of the Iranian public opinion
and mass media.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiassinejad said that usual sampling, which is
conducted for determining the amount of radiation at the Caspian
Sea coasts, has not confirmed the issue either.
</P>
<P>
The mere news coverage of the report does not put IAEA under
any obligation, he said, adding that the claim should be confirmed
or raised by a certain country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that dumping atomic waste requires
permission from IAEA, determining the exact radioactive rate and
informing countries on the way of transfer of substances.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, transfer of the atomic waste is considered as
contraband and no country will approve it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiassinejad noted that dumping atomic waste in the Caspian
Sea would inflict irreparable damage to the environment with
destructive impacts on living creatures.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Quality of Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to train groups of
senior teachers and academic advisors to act as role models in
primary and middle schools and colleges to form a backbone to help
push forward reforms to forge a system of education in qualities.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been drawn up by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council which
announced the moves earlier this week in a 10,000-word decision.
</P>
<P>
"Quality teachers can guarantee that education will itself be
quality oriented," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers should love the Party, love the socialist motherland,
and be loyal to the cause of educating the people," it said
</P>
<P>
They should be more conscientious in implementing a quality-
oriented education and be more professional, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers should constantly improve their ideological and
political awareness as well as the professional skills required
for being a teacher," the decision stressed.
</P>
<P>
"They should be able to use modern teaching technology and
methods while also being creative and participate actively in
scientific research activities," the document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, teachers from primary schools and
junior middle schools in particular areas should have received at
least a two-year or four-year college education by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
And most headmasters and teachers from high schools in
economically developed areas should hold master's degrees while
more teachers in colleges and universities will be required to
hold doctorates.
</P>
<P>
Specialized teachers in primary schools and middle schools, and
students at normal colleges and universities should receive
technical training in basic computer science.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim of the plan is to eventually re-train all
principal teachers and improve their professionalism.

<HEADLINE> Macao People Pin High Hopes on SAR Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents have shown high
expectations for the leading officials of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) which will be set up on December 20
this year.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive designate of the Macao SAR,
held four consultation meetings respectively on the nights of June
7, 8, 14 and 15 to solicit public opinions about his future
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will have five secretaries for
administrative and law affairs, economy and finance, security,
social and cultural affairs, and transportation and labor. Other
leading officials include anti-corruption commissioner, chief
auditor and head of customs.
</P>
<P>
At the consultation meetings which lasted for about two hours
each time, participants were active to put forward expectations
and suggestions on choosing the leading officials. Every night,
scores of people utter their opinions.
</P>
<P>
The general requirements for the officials are that they abide
by the Macao Basic Law, support the principle of "one country, two
systems", and dedicate themselves to serving the people of Macao
with high sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
With regard to personal quality, the major officials are
expected to be clean, honest and self-disciplined so that they can
start a fine image for the first Macao SAR government. They should
also have profound awareness and experience about the sectors of
which they take charge.
</P>
<P>
The officials should be pioneering in carrying out a series of
reforms to raise government efficiency, bring about more benefits
to the general public and reestablish people's confidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
They can be chosen from the civil servants of the present
Portuguese Macao government, and some can also be appointed from
other channels through fair competition. The most important
criterion is that they are competent at their work.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the participants to the meeting expressed the
belief that the chief executive is able to appoint people by
abilities and get rid of nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive designate listened to the opinions
attentively and took notes now and then.
</P>
<P>
"The consultation meetings are aimed at fulfilling my promises
I made while running for the post of chief executive," Edmund Ho
said."I'm ready to listen to public opinion on the criteria for
choosing the leading officials of the SAR."
</P>
<P>
As to those who did not get the chance to speak out, Edmund Ho
said that they are welcome to send written opinions to the office
of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that local residents continue to give counsel about
organizing the SAR government and contribute the new era of Macao
people governing Macao with a spirit of being the master of their
own affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he has no candidates for the leading officials at
the time being. The candidates may be decided at the end of July,
and then the names will be reported to the central government for
formal appointment.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive designate and the leading officials will
have about four months to make preparations for the smooth
operation of the SAR government as soon as the SAR is established.

<HEADLINE> China's Coca-Cola Products Unrelated to Belgian Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Belgium banned the sale of all soft drinks on Monday made by
the world famous firm after 100 young people became nauseous and
were hospitalized after drinking Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
"A study conducted by an independent Belgian research institute
indicated that the problem was caused by defective CO2 and wood
preservative used by local bottlers," said Zhai Mei, assistant
external affairs manager of Coca-Cola China.
</P>
<P>
No elements of dioxin were found in the Chinese made products,
which confirmed that the problem was merely Belgium based," Zhai
added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that all Coca-Cola China bottlers are equipped
with in-plant CO2 purification systems and the wood preservative
causing the problem is not used anywhere in China. Therefore, no
similar incident could happen here.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola produces dozens of beverages in China, taking up 30
percent of the Chinese soft drinks market.

kilometers to the south, for the first apartment building to be
constructed after the 11-week NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the foundation-laying ceremony attended by more than
1,000 residents, Milosevic attacked NATO for its wanton air raids
on April 5 against the defenseless town, where there were no
troops or military facilities. NATO committed heinous crime to the
city, killing innocent coal miners and their family members and
ruining their houses, he said. (Yugoslavia-Reconstruction)

UNITED NATIONS -- Britain has proposed the U.N. Security
Council conditionally suspend sanctions against Iraq, linking the
decision with Baghdad's record in disarmament, U.N. sources said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest draft resolution for the Security Council,
Britain recommended resuming inspections of arms of mass
destruction in Iraq and drawing up a set of "key remaining issues"
regarding arms destruction. It called on the heads of the
Commission of Inspection and Monitoring and the International
Atomic Energy Agency to report to the council in four months on
whether Iraq has resolved the "issues." If the council sees that
Iraq has cooperated fully, it could suspend sanctions for 120 days,
and it could continue the suspension every 120 days unless
inspectors report that Iraq is not cooperating. (UN-Iraq-UK)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China will send a 177-member

Spain, Chef de Mission Gao Jian said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 124 Chinese athletes will compete in nine of the 12
sports in agenda, namely athletics, basketball, diving, fencing,
gymnastics, judo, swimming, tennis and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Duo to conflicts with Olympic qualifiers in schedule, China
will skip the competitive sports of men's soccer, water polo and

The Chinese delegation is composed mainly of young athletes,
together with a string of veterans, including Olympic diving
champions Sun Shuwei and Fu Mingxia, World Cup champions Wang
Tianlin, Wang Rui and Yang Lan.

Asian Games swimming champions Deng Qingsong, Cao Na and Qian Min,
and gymnasts Liu Xuan, Kui Yuanyuan, Bi Wenjing who had all reaped
gold medals in previous major international meets.

<P>
Both Wang Haibin and Xiao Aihua are also strong bets for medals
in fencing as they had been crowned several times in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
"We also have strong potentials in some events in both
athletics and judo as well as the women's volleyball," said Gao
Jian.
</P>
<P>
"However, our goal is to tune up our young athletes to prepare
for the upcoming Olympics and to enhance friendship with athletes
from other countries and regions," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Palma Universiade is expected to attract some 6,600
athletes from 132 countries and regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Work on the Hada (Harbin --
Dalian) Railway, the first electrified railway in northeastern
China, is going well with increased funding from the state
government.
</P>
<P>
More than 5 billion yuan has been spent on the project during
the past five years and another 2.5 billion yuan is expected to be
allocated this year, according to Lu Junsheng, deputy director of
the Railway Bureau in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The increased spending was based on a state government pledge
to stimulate the economy through increased spending on
infrastructure and energy. The amount for railways between 1999
and 2003 is planned at 245 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Hada line runs more than 900 kilometers and links 25 major
cities in three provinces in northeastern China. It is expected to
cost 10 billion yuan in all and is designed to ease the
transportation bottleneck in the area.

<HEADLINE> Shas Leader's Resignation Brings Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The resignation announced
Tuesday night by Aryeh Deri from the leadership of Israel's
powerful religious Shas party has brought mixed reactions from the
country's political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing One Israel coalition, led by Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak, said it will take a 24-hour break to assess the
situation before resuming the talks over forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
Following his landslide victory in the May elections, Barak
has said he wanted to form a broad coalition, which may include
religious and right-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
However, since Deri was sentenced to four years in jail just
before the elections for bribery and fraud, Barak noted he might
not include Shas in the coalition government if Deri continues to
be the party leader.
</P>
<P>
Some of senior One Israel members have welcomed Deri's
resignation announcement.
</P>
<P>
"This practically brings Shas into the coalition (government),"
hailed One Israel Knesset (parliament) member Dalia Itzik.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset in the May general
elections, an amazing growth from 10 seats in the last Knesset,
and it became the third-largest party in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai and Natan
Sharansky, head of Yisrael Ba'aliya Party, also welcomed Deri's
decision and said it would facilitate Shas' entry into the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Meretz Party issued a statement Tuesday night, announcing
that while it was pleased with Deri's decision, "a cooling-off
period is needed" to ensure that the resignation is not a trick,
and that Deri has really stopped running the party's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz, which won 10 seats in the May elections,
had said that it would not sit in a coalition government with
Shas, if Deri remains to be the man at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's secular party Shinui insisted however it would not
join the new government if Shas entered the coalition, with or
without Deri as its leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shas Knesset members said they were "shocked" by
Deri's decision, and they would make efforts to persuade Deri to
change his mind. In a meeting of Shas party on Wednesday, Deri's
resignation will be reviewed.

<HEADLINE> Past Year Sees Less Laid-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- There were more than two and a
half million less people laid off work in 1998 in China compared
with that of the previous year, with the urban unemployment rate
running at 3.1 percent, according to sources from the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
A report on the development of labor and social security,
jointly issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and
the State Statistics Bureau, shows that there were 8.921 million
laid-off workers in 1998, 2.589 million less than 1997; among them
there were 6.1 million from state-owned enterprises, a reduction
of 243,000 or 3.8 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report also discloses that there were 5.71 million people
registered as unemployed by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
China has made great progress in employment and re-employment
work. In 1997, the country had 699 million employed workers, up 3.
57 million from that of 1997. The country's 35,000 job replacement
organizations helped eight million people to find jobs, as well as
offering training to five million more people.

<HEADLINE> Manila Intensifies Crackdown on Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
confiscated nearly 1 million U.S. dollars worth of pirated goods
in the first quarter of this year as it intensified enforcement of
laws on intellectual property rights, an official report said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) of the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) seized 36.4 million pesos (910,000
dollars) worth of "hot" goods, such as pirated computer hardware
and fake videocassette tapes, from January to March this year,
according to the report issued here by the IPO.
</P>
<P>
That amount was 464 percent higher than the figure of 6.4
million pesos (160,000 dollars) in the first quarter of last year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said government enforcement agencies monitored during the
period 3,292 companies, of which 92 percent complied with the
concerned laws.
</P>
<P>
This compliance rate is higher than the 86 percent recorded in
the same period of 1998, the IPO report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, corporate piracy remains the biggest threat
to the country's intellectual property rights and copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, eight of 10 software programs are pirated,
causing 31 million dollars in losses, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Ship Repair Industry Dim: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The ship repair industry in the
Middle East is projected to see a downturn of 30 to 40 percent in
1999, as compared to 1998, a ship repairs industry official has
stated.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see bright prospects for the current year, with a
dip in the overall business," said Viresh Chhabra, Director of the
Inter Ocean Ship Repairs was quoted by the Gulf News daily on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The tanker and bulk carrier rates are down, forcing ship and
large vessel owners to curtail their expenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for the expected downturn this year is
that most of the Greek vessel owners, who are major players in the
tanker market, are now carrying out most of their repair work in
China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the lull in the oil industry due to lower prices has
declined exploration and production activity, which seriously
affected the dry docking market, particularly those of barges and
supply boats.
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the Indian government's decision to reduce
imports of oil products from the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 50 and 60 vessels were used on the route from the
Middle East to India, but now these vessels will move to other
locations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said his country hopes to take an active part in the ongoing peace
keeping process in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks in a letter to the heads of state of
the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Spain, according
to local Milliyet (National) Daily here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Turkish president sent the letter as the
deployment of Turkish troops in Kosovo as part of the NATO
peacekeeping forces has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization also involved in the bloc's air attacks on
Yugoslavia, was shut out of the Kosovo peace process because of
Russian objections.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet quoted the displeased Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit as saying "Turkey can not be excluded in shaping the future
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some 987 Turkish troops were scheduled to be deployed in the
sector of Kosovo allocated to U.S. surveillance, said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations-sanctioned peace agreement,
Kosovo will be divided into five sectors, monitored respectively

<HEADLINE> Asian Recovery Should Be Balanced, Sustainable: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official Wednesday
called on Asian economies to look at how they can promote
conditions which will not only foster a full and speedy recovery,
but also ensure that the recovery is balanced, healthy and
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
Joseph Yam said the Asian financial crisis had encouraged
economies in the region to look more urgently and energetically at
issues affecting the success of a region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth Annual Far Eastern Economic Review
Conference in Hong Kong, Yam said domestic financial systems would
remain the basic building blocks of the international financial
system for the foreseeable future, regardless of the forms of
international monitoring and regulation that might arise out of
the discussions currently in progress.
</P>
<P>
"If the Asian financial crisis has taught us anything, then it
must surely be that the globalization and liberalization of
markets require stronger, not weaker, domestic systems," he told
the conference, whose theme is Hong Kong and Asia: Strategies for
Recovery.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, as a positive outcome of the Asian financial
crisis, economies all over the region were taking important steps
toward reforming their financial systems.
</P>
<P>
These reforms should leave Asia's financial systems in a much
healthier condition and make them more resilient in the face of
future financial crisis and more capable of exploiting new
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yam said there were also more fundamental longer-term forces
shaping and re-shaping the financial landscape, which would have
an important impact on how Hong Kong and other financial centers
in the region developed into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Having taken into account the impact of longer-term forces on
the banking industry, including globalization, technological
advance and changing customer needs, the HKMA commissioned the
Hong Kong Banking Sector Consultancy Study last year to look into
the strategic development of Hong Kong's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations in this study were now under consideration
by the government, according to Yam.
</P>
<P>
For the banks themselves, the forces of change mean that they
would have to work harder to identify and sustain business and to
succeed in an increasingly competitive environment, said Yam.
</P>
<P>
He called on banks in Hong Kong and in other parts of the
region to "seriously consider this option if they wish to continue
competing effectively."
</P>
<P>
Yam said the necessary counterpart of the reforms now being
vigorously pursued within the region was the reform at the global
level of an international financial architecture that had been
outgrown and outpaced by massive increases in the volume and speed
of cross-border fund flows.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this reform should be not to place barriers in the
way of these fund flows, but to provide a level of oversight and
transparency that will ensure that the excessive volatility we
have recently seen are kept within reasonable bounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategies for recovery in Asia must include this larger
international dimension, because whatever view one takes of the
exact causes of the Asian financial crisis, there is no doubt that
the activities of highly leveraged institutions played an
important role in provoking, spreading and deepening the crisis,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Economic stability, which is a necessary condition for full
recovery, and the future as a community of open and outward-
looking markets require decisive action at the international level,
he said.

<HEADLINE> E. African Countries Urged to Join Hands in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Three east African countries have
been urged to make concerted efforts in fighting cross-border
crime at the on- going meeting of police chiefs of the East Africa
Cooperation (EAC) in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border crime had increased due to the nature and
sophistication of crime in the east African sub-region, Kenya's
East African and Regional Co- operation Minister Nicholas Biwott
told police chiefs from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted Biwott as
saying that the member states of the EAC are expected to take
joint actions with a view to tackling crime.
</P>
<P>
Top on the meeting's agenda are theft of motor vehicles, drug
trafficking, cattle rustling and gun-running, the minister
revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The recommendations and resolutions of this meeting will no
doubt go a long way to address the problems of security," said
Biwott.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Commissioner of Police, Philemon Abong'o also warned
that unless stringent regional security, cross-border crime will
escalate in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first of two regional security meetings in
Nairobi this week. The second meeting scheduled for Thursday will
bring together police chiefs from east and central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli religious Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri Tuesday
night announced his resignation as the party leader, paving the
way for Shas to enter the new government.
</P>
<P>
After Deri's announcement, the left-wing coalition One Israel,
led by Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, said that it would take a
24-hour break to assess the situation before the negotiations with
all political parties over forming the government continue.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Ned Walker has assured Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak that next year's elections in the
United States will not keep the U.S. out of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Barak told a Labor parliament faction meeting last week that
the peace process needed to be advanced as much as possible by
next spring, since the U.S. will then become mired in its own
presidential elections. Walker's assurance is seen as a response to
Barak's concern.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli General Security Services head Ami Ayalon said on
Tuesday that he has no objection to the Arab lawmaker Ahmed Tibi,
a former adviser to Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, sitting on the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee. Ayalon said that as long as Tibi was
elected as the Knesset member through a proper democratic
process, he has the right to join the committee.

<HEADLINE> Australia Considers Giving Solomons Police Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia said Wednesday that it
is considering a request from the Solomons Islands to provide riot
shields, flak jackets and batons to help local authorities deal
with an outbreak of ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency has been declared in the South Pacific
islands following the murder of an elderly man and a small boy
last week.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have become refugees on the nation's main
island of Guadalcanal after being driven from their villages to
the capital of Honiara.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade (DFAT) said Wednesday that Australia had received a
request from the Solomons Islands for police equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We've been asked for a range of materials and we're looking
carefully at it," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Solomon Islands High Commission in
Canberra told Xinhua that aid is being sought to help the
government and the Red Cross in the country deal with around
10,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Islands Minister of State Alfred Sasako said the state
of emergency has been declared by the country's Governor-General
Moses Pitakaka and would allow police to take stronger action to
stop, question and detain fighting groups, the Australian
Associated Press said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Solomons Islands has no army and only a small police force.
</P>
<P>
Trouble escalated last weekend when militants from the
so-called Guadalcanal Liberation Army began forcing ethnic rivals,
who are originally from the neighboring island of Malaita, to
leave their villages, police said.
</P>
<P>
To the resentment of Guadalcanal's indigenous population,
Malaitan people who have migrated to Guadalcanal now dominate
government jobs and business in Honiara.
</P>
<P>
A Melanesian nation, the Solomon Islands has a population of
around 300,000, with 70 distinctive languages.

<HEADLINE> EU Becomes Lebanon's Biggest Donor: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union provided 152
million U.S. dollars of assistance to Lebanon in 1998, making it
the country's biggest donor, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 40 percent of the total international
assistance to Lebanon, said German Ambassador in Beirut Peter
Wittig as he presented the 1998 annual cooperation report between
Lebanon and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the EU has provided Lebanon with a total of 629
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 498.8 million dollars were in the form of loans
from the European Investment Bank and 131 million dollars in
non-refundable grants, said Wittig, whose country currently holds
the presidency of the union.
</P>
<P>
Among the individual member states, Italy was the largest donor
with 290 million dollars in assistance since 1992, France came
second with 238 million dollars and Spain 92 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
EU-funded projects concentrate mainly on the development of
rural areas, environment, health, education and Palestinian
refugee aid.
</P>
<P>
The EU is working to create a Euro-Mediterranean agreement,
which will bring 12 countries in the Mediterranean basin into a
close partnership with the 15 EU member states and eventually
encompass 600 million people in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Having signed agreements with Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan and
Israel, the EU is now engaged in talks with Lebanon, Egypt and
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Enterprises Sweep Up Listed Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- After years of failed attempts to
get listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the
Clever Software Company, one of the biggest firms of its kind in
China, has overcome the problems by becoming principal shareholder
in the already listed Acheng Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
This gives the company, which now holds 28 percent of the
latter's shares, access to the stock exchanges and many other
private companies in China are following Clever's example by
buying in the secondary market or purchasing state or corporate
shares.
</P>
<P>
Clever Software, a private Beijing firm, is a big name in China
's software industry essentially as the developer of the country's
first education software, the CSC school master office system,
which has been a huge success.
</P>
<P>
The company now has total assets worth nearly 500 million yuan
and is engaged in the development of network products, management
software and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jingyu, a manager from the firm's Marketing Department,
explained that Clever had experienced many difficulties and
barriers when trying to get listed hence the decision to buy into
the Heilongjiang-based company.
</P>
<P>
Research by the Shenzhen Dapeng Securities Ltd. shows that in
1998, 15 private enterprises became the main shareholders of
listed firms compared to seven for 1997 and very few in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here have commented that the buying of the "shells" of
listed firms has provided a new way for private firms to raise
funds.
</P>
<P>
They point out that China's stock market has been dominated by
state-owned enterprises, because under the reformed economic
system, the government is no longer directly providing funds to
state-owned firms. Thus the stock market becomes a major source of
funds for such enterprises, while private firms have been almost
entirely shut out of the sector.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned banks are also very cautious when lending
to private firms and most loans are merely short-term ones.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many private firms seeking to be listed are
high-tech enterprises, whose products often have good prospects in
the market place. But what they actually need is capital for
expansion.
</P>
<P>
China's private firms are often fast to adapt to the needs of
the market and flexible in management and operation, but their
family style management often becomes a bottle neck preventing, in
some cases, further development.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that becoming the significant shareholders of
listed firms forces private enterprises to improve their
management technique in accordance with the requirements for a
listed modern enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said, the listing of more private firms would
gradually shatter the dominance of state-owned enterprises, thus
injecting new vigor into the country's stock markets.

<HEADLINE> Fossilized Dinosaur Eggs Discovered in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Four fossilized dinosaur eggs
dating back some 60 million years were recently discovered by
farmers in the city of Heyuan in Guangdong Province, south China.
</P>
<P>
Huang Dong, the city's museum curator, said that 1,006
fossilized dinosaur eggs have been unearthed in Heyuan since March
1996 and there are many more around here. Heyuan, he said, may be
one of the world's largest repositories of fossilized dinosaur
eggs.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were mining along a river bank when they found the
fossils, one of which is complete and about 16.5 cm long and 6.5
cm wide.
</P>
<P>
These eggs have an unusual shape that is not quite like the
fossils previously found in China, which are usually roundish or
flat and oval, Huang said, and they will be very important for
research on the geology and climate of 60 million years ago.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Vice President Warns Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thirty percent of Kenyans will
still be living in absolute poverty by the year 2015 even if all
the targets of the National Poverty Eradication Plan are met,
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has said.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti made the remarks in his written speech read out at the
opening of the first regional assembly of the World Alliance for
Citizen Participation in capital Nairobi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in March this year initiated
the National Poverty Eradication Plan to improve the living
standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kenya has some 12 million people living below the
absolute poverty line, accounting for 40 percent of the country
total population,
</P>
<P>
Saitoti explained that poverty alleviation required a sustained
economic growth of above seven percent per year, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic growth of the east African country for
1998 was only 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day meeting focusing on civil society and
poverty reduction in Africa, he vice-president told the
participants in his written speech that civil society could play a
major role in poverty eradication by forging close partnerships
with the government and private sector.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti also noted that HIV/AIDS, growing population and global
reforms have been worsening the poverty problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the access to increasing resources by the sector
of non- governmental organizations (NGOs), the vice-president said
that the governments in the region are interested in seeing how
these NGOs would assist African countries to deal with challenges
in economic growth, food production and poverty reduction.

HAIKOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province

The island province has already spent 100 million yuan building
3 transformer substations of 35kv each.

Hainan is 90 percent rural, according to a provincial official,

in urban areas because of the antiquated rural power grids and
poor management.

The rural grid work will cut rural power prices down to urban

ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Two American and Israeli companies
have decided to join forces in the biggest ever Turkish defense
industry tender, a 7-billion-U.S.-dollar tank production and
modernization project.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News reported here Wednesday that in an attempt to
increase their chances of winning, the U.S. General Dynamics and
the Israeli IMI company have agreed to present a joint proposal
for the project.
</P>
<P>
The United States company will bid for the 5.5-billion-dollar
tank production part of the tender while IMI will compete for the
1.5-billion-dollar modernization project.
</P>
<P>
If the companies win their tenders, they will cooperate in the
implementation phase.

<P>
Defense experts commented that by taking this move, the two

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM To Make "W-Wagon" Mini-Van In 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Close on the heels of its much
heralded Buick sedan, which went into production in April, the US-
funded Shanghai General Motors (GM) Company has announced plans to
produce a new passenger mini-van for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Production of what GM calls the "W-Wagon" is expected to begin
next year, according to the company's president Hu Maoyuan at the
Auto Shanghai '99 event, China's top motor show which opened here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu revealed that no additional investment will be required to
refit the 1.52 billion U.S. dollars Shanghai plant to turn out the
"W-Wagon", which is based on a similar model made in North America
under the Pontiac brand.
</P>
<P>
"The plant's annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles would be
enough to cover both models," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The mini-van, fitted with a 2.98-litre engine, seats seven
passengers. While the seats are fully removable for flexible cargo
transport, the mini-van is intended essentially as a passenger
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Auto Shanghai '99, which has attracted more than 400 vehicle
and parts exhibitors from 22 countries, will run through Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Ethiopian Cooperation Fruitful: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said Tuesday that cooperation in the political and economic
fields between Ethiopia and China has been fruitful since the
Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front came to power.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks when he met with Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada Tuesday afternoon in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
1996 gave fresh impetus to bilateral relations of the two
countries, and that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to developing friendly relations with Ethiopia and
wishes to expand cooperation in various fields on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said China upholds justice in international affairs and
adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries. China, therefore, is an important
force to maintain world peace and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's robust economic growth has also
stimulated the economic growth of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said he is satisfied with the development of bilateral
relations and that he hoped the two sides would make more efforts
to fully explore the potential of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Negasso also briefed Qian on the border war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the war has caused the loss of lives and severe
material damage to both countries. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea face
the task of developing the economy and uplifting people's living
standards. He said China hopes the two sides could soon halt the
military clashes and find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts of the Organization of African Unity
in this regard and hopes that African countries could solve their
problems by themselves, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan and Ambassador to
South Africa Wang Xuexian were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and President Negasso are in South Africa for
Wednesday's inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as the new South African

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Calls For SEA Games Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar is holding out for
the government to provide insurance bonuses to medalists in the
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
"I will try hard to make the government provide the bonus as a
reward to the athletes. It will be more precious and prestigious
if the bonus comes from the government instead of KONI," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI has urged the government to provide 2.5 billion rupiah (
329,000 U.S. dollars) for bonuses. The government, through the
National development and Planning Board, has handed over 5.5
billion rupiah to finance the SEA Games training program, but
State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono said
there were no more funds.
</P>
<P>
KONI also received 4.5 billion rupiah in financial assistance
from the Gelora Senayan Management Board.
</P>
<P>
"I think Agung was talking about the preparation fund, not the
bonus. I will also try to find another way, perhaps by making
requests to state enterprises," Wismoyo said.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed the matter with State Minister of the
Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng and received a
favourable response.
</P>
<P>
"His response was very good. I think we can obtain about 2
billion rupiah from the state enterprises' profits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo said he was considering distributing about 25 million
rupiah in insurance bonuses for gold medalists, 2 million rupiah
for silver medalists and one million rupiah for bronze medalists.
The amounts are the same as were awarded to medalists two years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Warri Crisis, First Test for Obasanjo Regime  (by Song Li) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Only a day after the jubilant May 29
inauguration ceremony of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in
the capital Abuja, violence flared up in Nigeria's oil city Warri,
confronting the days' old civilian government with the first test.
</P>
<P>
The test starts when militant ethnic Ijaw youths set the entire
Itsekiri village of Aruton ablaze and killed more than 100
Itsekiris including many kids on the morning of May 30.
</P>
<P>
The accident rekindled a decades' old feud between the two
ethnic communities in the southern Nigerian city, which claimed
lives only several months ago. The Itsekiris waited no time in
fighting back, and this sucked in the Urhobos, who fought in
alignment with the Ijaws.
</P>
<P>
Death toll soon hit 300, with some areas of Warri city,
Nigeria's most important oil hub, virtually burnt to the ground.
The conflict also forced about 300,000 people to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The crisis also affected greatly the country's lifeline -- the
oil industry. Big oil companies like Shell, which has many of its
operations based in Warri, had warned of possible output
reductions.
</P>
<P>
Given Nigeria's total reliance on oil incomes and the new
government's ambitious plans on yet extremely tight fiscal
resources, the flare-ups in Niger delta, the country's oil tank,
are by no means a regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
To quench the flare-ups, Abuja urgently dispatched thousands of
soldiers into the region, who soon received order that they could
shoot on sight any rioters or violators of a curfew that Delta
state Governor James Ibori imposed on June 7.
</P>
<P>
In a quite unusual move, the new president, setting aside the
job of lobbying for his cabinet list, flew to Warri on June 11 to
meet leaders of major ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of the crisis was a 1997 decision by now
deceased dictator General Sani Abacha to relocate a local
government in Warri from a Ijaw dominant district to an Itsekeri
dominant area. The decision was originally to punish the Ijaw
community for its opposition to Abacha regime.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws' resentment on the relocation had been suppressed by
past military regimes until it boiled over at the beginning of
the new civilian rule when an Itsekeri was installed as the head
of the disputed local government. The morbid sentiment led to
the massacre in Aruton village.
</P>
<P>
But despite the apparent ethnic factors in the conflict, the
crisis is far from being just a tribal war and could find its
roots in the decades' long confrontation between local
communities and foreign oil companies as well as the federal
government. Poverty and a feeling of being neglected are actual
drives behind the bloody killings.
</P>
<P>
Warri, like other towns around the oil fields, presents a harsh
contrast of staggering wealth and appalling poverty. Heavily
guarded oil company compounds with swimming pools, satellite
telephones and supermarkets yards away from villages without
electricity, running water or a school. The western oil giants
like Shell, Chevron and Mobil siphoned back dollars that can only
be counted in astronomical terms, yet they feedback virtually
none.
</P>
<P>
Oil spills and decades of pollution and acid rain from gas
flaring have destroyed the livelihoods of the indigenous people.
Yet compensation for the devastating effects is always inadequate,
and often stolen by corrupt local traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Failure of the past military regimes to redress local
grievances and their deliberate manipulation of ethnic tensions
aggravated the sufferings of local people. These, along with the
excessive exploitation by the oil companies have driven the
indigenous peoples to the very edge of survival and fueled a
desperate competition among themselves for what little resources
are available.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian law, oil wealth belongs to the federal
government. For decades, Nigeria's ruling generals and the oil
companies have extracted billions of dollars a year from these
communities and returned only a nominal share in the form of
salaries and administration fees. That is why the controlling of
local governments has become a life-and-death issue for different
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that giving back a larger share of the oil wealth
both from the federal government and oil companies to assist the
development of the Niger delta is the key to prevent future
crisis in this region.
</P>
<P>
As a leader of Nigerian oil workers union has said recently,
only the immediate intervention of the Obasanjo government and the
establishment of a credible dialog among the communities, the
government and the oil companies on a fundamental restructuring of
economic and political institutions in the region can bring an end
to the bloody crisis in Nigeria's oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's government might have recognized the problems.
During a meeting with a foreign oil delegation on June 14, the
president urged the oil companies to do more for their host
communities either by way of financing local development programs
or providing more opportunities for the youths, who might
otherwise be idle or engaged in violence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier over the weekend, the president unveiled in Port
Harcourt, southern Nigeria, a government-assisted development
program for the Niger delta, which as some government officials
hailed, might hopefully put smiles back on to the lips of the
people in this region.
</P>
<P>
But given the overall tottering condition of its economy,
Nigeria still has a long way to go in bringing in real peace and
prosperity to the long-neglected region.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan soldier Lance Corporal
S. Rajapakse who first disclosed the existence of mass graves at
Chemmani in Jaffna peninsula in the Northern Province, will
identify the graves which the court has ordered to be exhumed.
</P>
<P>
Rajapakse made his disclosure after he was found guilty as
first accused for the rape and murder of a Tamil teenager in
1996, and was sentenced to death, informed sources here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rajapakse, who has been held in a prison in Kandy after his
trial, recently received death threats against himself and his
family if he gave evidence about the graves in the inquiry, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has initiated a move to investigate
the mass graves after Rajapakse revealed that hundreds of
civilians were murdered by government army personnel and buried in
mass graves at Chemmani.
</P>
<P>
The case has aroused great national and international interest
and several local and foreign observers are already in Jaffna for
the exhumation due to take place Wednesday afternoon and Thursday
and the inquiry to follow, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> More Prudence Called for in Flower Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- There is a need for more caution
in the development of China's fast growing flower industry which
is in danger of over stretching itself, according to the China
Floral Association.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the flower industry in China has been on a fast
track thanks to the ever improving living standards of Chinese
citizens. However, rash investment in the industry and reckless
construction of greenhouses have been rampant in many places,
experts claims.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Weixian, secretary general of the floral association,
said that because some investors have not carried out feasibility
studies they have incurred poor economic returns from their
projects.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that there are now 700 flowers
distribution centers and retailers in China, many newly
established.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the greenhouses in the country are
reported to be running at a loss.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed concern over the lack of research funds
into the study of flowers in contrast to the huge investment in
the construction of greenhouses and flower markets.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic to Increase Peacekeeping Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Czech House of Representatives
passed a bill Tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops to Kosovo
than the government proposed.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which was passed with 122 votes for, 25 against,
and 16 abstentions after intense debates, the Czech Republic will
send a brigade of 800 soldiers to Kosovo for a period of 18 months,
and their term can be extended in the light of the development.
</P>
<P>
At the House special session Tuesday, the Czech government
proposed to send only 150 troops to Kosovo because of its
financial difficulties. As the number is much lower than those
sent by Poland and Hungary, the proposal met objections from many
parliament members who said it would tarnish the image of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
Czech officials disclosed that the peacekeeping force will cost
2.5 billion krone (about 73.5 million U.S. dollars), which will
further aggravate the government's economic woes. They said that
up to now, the government does not know where the fund will come
from.

accommodation in their camps, The Australian daily said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 refugees Monday afternoon left a temporary
immigration center in Sydney for their camp named as Safe Haven in
the Hunter Valley, three hours drive from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
However, they refused to leave the three buses which carried
them there, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were quoted as saying their rooms were too cold
and had no running water and they had to walk hundreds of meters
to toilets.
</P>
<P>
Elvana Muqaj, a 19-year-old Kosovar Albanian, said, "When I
came here, it's just like Macedonia."
</P>
<P>
"It's like a jungle here and everything is kangaroos and
snakes," another refugee complained.
</P>
<P>
The Australian authorities held a tough stand against the
protesters, saying the protesters would not be supplied with food
until they get off the buses.
</P>
<P>
Late night on Monday, 10 of the refugees gave in to hunger and
cold and entered the camps.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, all but three of the refugees ended their
protest as temperatures dropped to around zero.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Lyndall Sachs, representative of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, called on the related Australian
officials to work out a way to restore the confidence of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"I think really what you have to do is to create an environment
which is going to give them confidence, not to make them feel any
more insecure than they feel already," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Overseas Debt Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The total overseas debt of New
Zealand increased by 2.4 billion NZ dollars (about 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars) during the past year to reach 101.9 billion NZ
dollars (about 55 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday that
the increase in total overseas debt arose from a 5 billion NZ
dollar rise in private sector debt, but was offset by a 2.6
billion NZ dollar fall in government debt.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the value of the New Zealand currency were estimated
 to contribute 1.8 billion NZ dollars to the total rise of the 2.4
 billion NZ dollars in overseas debt.
</P>
<P>
The debt level is more than the total economic production of
New Zealand for a year and three times larger than the country's
total annual exports.
</P>
<P>
The figure is in line with expectations of local economists and
 has caused no market reaction. The market has expected a debt
level of about 104 billion NZ dollars (about 56.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the current account deficit expected to remain at about
5.5 percent to 6.5 percent of GDP, there won't be any near-term
improvement in the level of the country's overseas debt.
</P>
<P>
But the Australia-New Zealand Bank (ANZ) said the gross debt
figures are somewhat misleading because they have ignored New
Zealand's corresponding holdings of assets overseas, so they do
not give a full picture of the national balance sheet.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is preparing to
send
tents, food and supplies to help people forced from their homes by

ethnic violence on the main island of Guadalcanal within the
Solomon
Islands.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

Trade said Wednesday that the New Zealand government has received
an
oral request from the Solomon Islands government to provide police

riot gear, including batons, to "allow its police force to control

gangs intimidating people on Guadalcanal."
</P>
<P>
But he said his country won't respond to that request until it

has been made in writing.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that violence has erupted on Guadalcanal as
militants have forced other islanders, particularly those from
Malaita Island, from their homes. Thousands of refugees are
expected
in Honiara, the Solomon Islands capital on Guadalcanal, as they
are
escaping the violence on the east and west coasts of the island.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Enterprises Encouraged for Overseas Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China will take measures to encourage more enterprises to operate
abroad this year, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
"We will organize more than 40 powerful enterprises to set up
plants overseas in a well-planned fashion," an official said.
</P>
<P>
Government departments concerned will render the best possible
services to these enterprises in terms of financing, project
approval and the handling of port exit procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The selected firms will set up 55 projects covering color TV
sets, air conditioners, plastic products, building materials, and
chemical products, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, known as a regional economic engine, has achieved
big progress in the development of an export-oriented economy and
many enterprises have developed the power to run operations
overseas to tap the world market.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that they believe the new operations will become a
new growth area in Guangdong's exports.
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of China's opening-up and market economy
reforms, Guangdong had 36 overseas-based enterprises dealing in
processing trade in the fields of textiles, light industrial
products, tobacco, electronics, telecommunications, and medicines
by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Guangdong unveiled a set of official
regulations to encourage more enterprises to establish operations
in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Mayflower Bank Opens 11th Branch in Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB)
Limited, one of the leading private banks in Myanmar, opened one
more branch on Tuesday in Yangon, bringing the total number of its
branches to 11.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the bank branch, Myanmar
Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein called on
private banks in the country to disburse loans to entrepreneurs
reclaiming large areas of vacant, virgin and fallow lands,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to strive for the progress of banking
services in the country under the supervision of the Myanmar Banks
Association founded in April this year.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, MMB Chairman U Kyaw Win also said banking
services are gaining development in Myanmar with assistance from
the state. He pointed out, "Though Asia was affected by global
financial turmoil, Myanmar never faced the consequences of the
turmoil to a considerable degree."
</P>
<P>
There are 17 private banks in Myanmar now providing domestic
commercial banking services along with three state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1998, nearly 60 private bank branches had been
 opened throughout the country to enhance the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Private banks in the country have been allowed to operate again
since 1990, 27 years after all private banks in the country were
nationalized in 1963.
</P>
<P>
The private banks hold 42.3 percent of saving deposits of the
banking sector and their loans account for 44.9 percent of the
sector's total to the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cuts Rates for Telephone Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to lower the rates for telephone calls in an effort to
attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's General Department of Posts and Telecommunications
has issued a list of new rates for telephone calls and leasing
international telecommunications channels, local press reports
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rates, prices for international calls from 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m. are cut by nearly 12 percent. The rates for calls to
the United States and Canada alone are reduced by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cost of installing a phone for foreigners is reduced to the
same level as the Vietnamese pay.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, monthly subscription charges for
foreign-invested enterprises and foreigners are set at 10 U.S.
dollars and charges for their domestic calls are cut to the same
level of payment as that of domestic customers.
</P>
<P>
Charges for international telecommunications services made from
Vietnam from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. and on holidays and Sundays are cut
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reductions are a practical move aimed at improving the
foreign investment environment in Vietnam and further wiping out
inadequacies in the fee-calculating system and imbalances among
the users of this service, said an official of Vietnam's Post and
Telecommunications Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts will come into effect in early July.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for Conditional Suspension of Iraq Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain has proposed the U.
N. Security Council conditionally suspend sanctions against Iraq,
linking the decision with Baghdad's record in disarmament, U.N.
sources said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest draft resolution for the Security Council,
Britain recommended resuming inspections of arms of mass
destruction in Iraq and drawing up a set of "key remaining issues"
regarding arms destruction.
</P>
<P>
It called on the heads of the Commission of Inspection and
Monitoring and the International Atomic Energy Agency to report to
the council in four months on whether Iraq has resolved the "
issues."
</P>
<P>
If the council sees that Iraq has cooperated fully, it could
suspend sanctions for 120 days, and it could continue the
suspension every 120 days unless inspectors report that Iraq is
not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
Britain also proposed allowing foreign investment to resume
four months after inspectors return to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The draft called for the creation of strict financial controls
aimed at preventing Iraq from buying weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the draft was still under discussion among the
five permanent members of the Security Council. China, Russia and
France are not content with the draft because it puts too many
strings on the suspension.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed stringent sanctions against Iraq
that include airline and oil embargoes following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Arms inspectors left Iraq before the U.S. and Britain launched
airstrikes against Iraq on December 16, 1998.

<HEADLINE> 7 Parties to Share Seats in Indonesian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Official and unofficial tallies
showed that the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
still maintains its lead in the June 7 elections and only seven
parties have so far secured parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The official tally from the General Elections Commission (KPU)
as well as unofficial versions from the Antara News Agency and the
Joint Operation Media Center (JOMC) Wednesday both placed PDI-P on
top.
</P>
<P>
The difference is that in the unofficial tallies, the ruling
Golkar Party is second, trailed by the National Awakening Party
(PKB). The three parties far outnumbered their closest rivals the
United Development Party (PPP) and the National Mandate Party
(PAN).
</P>
<P>
Official data collected by KPU, based on votes counted by
Wednesday morning, showed the PDI-P in the lead with 16.788
million votes, followed by the PKB (8.4 million votes), Golkar
(7.4 million), the PPP (4.29 million) and the PAN (3 million).
</P>
<P>
Antara's tally, based on data collected from the provincial and
overseas chapters of the National Election Committee (PPI), saw
the PDI-P leading with 29.2 million votes, or 33.91 percent of the
84.04 million votes counted out of 117.8 million registered votes.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party ran second with 18.8 million votes, followed by
the PKB with 12 million votes, the PPP with 8.9 million votes and
the PAN 6 million votes.
</P>
<P>
The other 41 political parties got less than 1 percent of
votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the JOMC released its version of provisional
parliamentary seat allocations based on its ongoing vote count.
</P>
<P>
The JOMC said the PDI-P has garnered 141 seats while Golkar
trailed with 99 seats. It put the PPP in the third position with
38 seats, followed by the PKB (37 seats) and the PAN (27 seats).
</P>
<P>
Seats are allocated on the basis of the population (eligible
voters). Thus in less populated areas, the number of votes needed
to obtain a seat in the House of Representatives will be
proportionally less than that needed in areas with larger numbers
of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the JOMC said, although the PKB may obtain more
votes than the PPP, the number of seats received will not reflect
this. One seat in the PKB stronghold of East Java may need many
more votes than one won by the PPP in one of Indonesia's more
remote and sparsely-populated regions.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties are vying for 462 seats in the
500-strong House of Representatives. The other 38 seats are
reserved for the military.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting chairman of the pro-government Indonesian
Muslim Intellectuals Association (ICMI), Achmad Tirtosudiro,
Tuesday said the Islamic groups will accept and support whichever
party ends up controlling the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the party that runs the next government must
take into consideration the fact that nearly 90 percent of
Indonesians follow Islam.
</P>
<P>
Achmad also read out a joint statement issued by 25 Muslim mass
organizations in reaction to the preliminary election results.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Muslim organizations call on all
Indonesians not to take excessive actions that could disturb the
improving economic, political, social, cultural and security
situation.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the national leadership meeting of the Muslim-based
PPP Tuesday also accepted the election results.
</P>
<P>
"The PPP accepts the polling results with the understanding
that the violations during the campaign period are clarified,"
party Secretary General Aliwarman Hanan said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the final results of the election will be
issued by the KPU on June 21.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Announces Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has announced that the
deficit of its state budget this year could reach 13,000 billion
Vietnamese dong (930 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Vietnam made public its state
budget balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News Wednesday quoted the
General Statistical Office (GSO) as saying this meant that in the
current financial year, the deficit would be 295 billion dong
(21.2 million dollars) higher than the budget deficit recorded in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The deficit has been caused by a low level of projected state
revenue of around 69,500 billion dong (4.96 billion dollars)
against a projected state expenditure of 82,500 billion dong (5.93
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However the deficit would be covered by both foreign and
domestic borrowings, GSO said, adding that the announcement of the
state budget would be an annual event.
</P>
<P>
GSO General Director Le Van Toan said GSO would coordinate with
the Finance Ministry in releasing the budget for the previous year
and projections for the current year.
</P>
<P>
This would make the financial status of the government
transparent at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of an overall effort of the Vietnamese
government to give the general public direct access in exercising
their democratic rights and in this case to allow the public to
have a greater knowledge of the country's budgetary situation,
Vietnam News added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Trade Minister Visits Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad
Mehdi Salah is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka Wednesday evening
for a five-day visit to promote bilateral trade, informed sources
here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two countries' trade delegations will hold
talks on bilateral trade and scientific and technical cooperation
from Thursday to next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to formulate fresh proposals to
improve the level of bilateral trade under the U.N.-monitored
food-for-oil program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. program allows Iraq to sell 5.26 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian needs for the Iraqi people reeling under stringent
U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka will push for more tea exports to Iraq under the
current phase (the sixth stage) of the U.N. program, the sources
said, adding Iraq allocated some 3 million kilograms of tea to
Colombo under the fifth stage of the program.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1990, Baghdad was among Colombo's top tea buyers,
taking about 20 percent of exports of Sri Lanka. Iraq used to buy
some 40 million-45 million kilograms of tea annually, of which
60-70 percent came from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Gulf crisis, Sri Lanka's trade with Iraq decreased.
Since 1996 Sri Lanka has been only able to sell tea to Iraq
through a third party.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The major port of Tianjin recorded
consecutive double-digit industrial growth in the first five
months of this year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's total industrial output value reached 87.9 billion

</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that Tianjin's May industrial output value
reached 5.56 billion yuan, up 16 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The commission attributed the growth mainly to the government
efforts to support the development of the city's top ten state-

<HEADLINE> Mercosur to Strengthen Ties with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of the member
countries of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) as well as
Chile and Bolivia decided Tuesday to strengthen their relations
with the European Union (EU) in Paraguay's capital city of
Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Asuncion said the presidents, attending the 16th
meeting of the Council and Presidential Summit of Mercosur,
endorsed a joint declaration that proposed convening the Latin
America, Caribbean and EU Summit from June 28 to 29 in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that agriculture will be the centerpiece of
their negotiations with Europe at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state also decided in the declaration to
facilitate the establishment of a common market based on the
principles enshrined in the Asuncion Treaty. They noted that
Mercosur will continue to serve as the right tool to cope with the
aftermath of the international financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was signed by presidents of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay which make up the regional block of
Mercosur, as well as the two nations of Bolivia and Chile, which
are associated to Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the presidents expressed their support
for the flight of Argentineans to the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
They warned that if communication and the transit of
Argentinean people to the Malvinas isn't allowed to continue, it
will be impossible to overcome the isolation the islands are
facing.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their commitment to the policy of continuing
communication and the transit of people without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The Presidents said that the present level of dialog between
Argentina and Britain is a reflection of the cooperation and
understanding that is being exercised in the region and has helped
facilitate the achievement of common goals.
</P>
<P>
The summit opened on Tuesday with Paraguay's President Lius
Macchi urging the restoration of trust in the Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
The economies of the four Mercosur member countries weakened
following the Brazilian currency devaluation in January, which
rocked markets and sent interest rates soaring. Most of the
countries are expected to show zero growth or a contraction in
1999.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Improving Beijing Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing goal of improving its
environment and ensuring residents to enjoy clean air by the year
2002 can be achieved, according to a high-ranking environmental
official.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's environmental pollution, especially air pollution,
has attracted the attention of both the government and general
public," according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA). Xie made the
comment during a Tuesday news conference held by the State Council
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the municipal government's plan calls for
significantly improving the city's air quality and environment
before October 1 this year, and achieving obvious improvements by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to raise the city's air quality to Type II by the
year 2002, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal government can achieve the goal if it strictly
abides by the plan and strengthens enforcement," according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the city's pollution sources include coal
burning, automobile emissions, construction sites and major
polluters such as steel and power plants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing burns some 28 million tons of coal annually, and leads
Chinese cities with more than 1.4 million automobiles. The city
also has more than 5,000 construction sites which create a large
volume of dust.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has banned the use of coal inside the Third Ring Road,
and has replaced coal with natural gas and electricity. Xie noted
that the city is considering a plan to extend the coal ban to the
Fourth Ring Road.
</P>
<P>
Strict standards for motor vehicle emissions were adopted on
January 1 this year. Over 600,000 vehicles have since be refitted
to meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles causing serious pollution will be banned.
Licenses for some 50,000 motor vehicles have already been revoked,
according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing's air quality has improved greatly due to
pollution control efforts since last year. Sulphur dioxide levels
have dropped 23 percent, and both suspended particles and
automobile emissions are under control.

<HEADLINE> WB Approves 2 Credits for Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Tuesday two loans totaling 57 million U.S. dollars which will be
used to improve health services, especially immunizations and
maternal health, and to support reform of public administration in
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The two zero-interest loans, worth 25 million dollars and 32
million dollars respectively, were approved as the Bolivian
government and the World Bank prepared to launch new efforts to
reduce poverty and promote development in the Latin American
country.
</P>
<P>
"The new framework is based on Bolivia's National Action Plan,
which emerged from a broad-based national dialogue held in La Paz
in late 1997," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The first credit will support the Health Sector Reform project,
which will increase the coverage and quality of health services
available to Bolivians.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be implemented over three years ending in 2002,
will establish a basic health insurance system, provide vaccines
to immunize children, and finance a program to reduce Bolivia's
high infant and maternal mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Reform Project will improve the effectiveness,
efficiency, and transparency of Bolivia's public administration
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is part of an ambitious program to improve governance in
Bolivia by reducing corruption and reforming the basic
institutional framework in the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture,
Housing, Sustainable Development and Education.
</P>
<P>
Both credits will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm,
with a maturity of 40 years and a grace period of 10 years, the
bank's standard terms for IDA multi-currency credits.

BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic laid a foundation stone Tuesday in Aleksinac, a coal-
mining town 200 kilometers to the south, for the first apartment
building to be constructed after the 11-week NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the foundation-laying ceremony attended by more than
1,000 residents, Milosevic attacked NATO for its wanton air raids
on April 5 against the defenseless town, where there were no
troops or military facilities.
</P>
<P>
NATO committed heinous crime to the city, killing innocent coal
miners and their family members and ruining their houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the Yugoslav people for their bravery and solidarity
when counterattacking the NATO aggression, Milosevic encouraged
them to keep and develop this spirit in national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the president conferred medals to a few senior
officials and commended 3,000 servicemen and civil servants for
their distinguished role in "safeguarding national sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the valiant fight against aggressors" who
were several times stronger than Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav Chief of General Staff Senior General
Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav armed forces shot down a total of
61 NATO aircraft, 30 pilotless jets, seven helicopters and
intercepted 238 cruise missiles.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Forms Divisional Fisheries Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has formed the Yangon
Division Aquaculture and Fisheries Federation (AFF) in an effort
to boost its fish production in the division following the
establishment of the Myanmar AFF at the national level last
December.
</P>
<P>
Yangon Division, with its rivers, creeks and lakes, is known as
a region possessing good conditions for fisheries. It is bordered
by sea in the south and is rich in marine resources to some
extent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 140 lakes in the division, granted to fishery lease,
produced 5,639 tons of fish in fiscal 1998-99, said Yangon
Military Region Commander Major-General Khin Maung Than at a
ceremony here Tuesday marking the formation of the Yangon Division
AFF.
</P>
<P>
For local consumption, more than 163 tons of fresh-water fish
was produced and 465 Yangon-based deep-sea trawlers had a catch of
more than 163 tons of sea-water fish per day, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998-99 fiscal year, 3,254 fish farmers produced
61,121 tons of fish from 10,124.5 hectares of fish ponds, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The commander urged the division's AFF to produce fishery
experts and skillful workers and disseminate modern knowledge
including that to improve breeding methods while making efforts to
acquire international standard technology.
</P>
<P>
After the country formed the Myanmar AFF at the national level
last December, it became a member of the AFF of the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Since then the Myanmar AFF has
been working in cooperation with other member countries in
conserving fishery resources and exchanging information on
fisheries, seeking more markets for marine products and boosting
production.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar produced 244,011 tons
of fresh-water fish and prawn and 671,723 tons of deep-sea fish
and prawn in fiscal 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The country exports more than 62,000 tons of fish and prawn
annually.

BUDAPEST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian parliament endorsed
a resolution on Tuesday giving the green light to the dispatch of
Hungarian peace-keeping forces to Kosovo. The resolution also
allows foreign forces involved in the peace mission to pass
through Hungary or station there, the Hungarian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the parliament passed the resolution with a
majority vote. Under the resolution, Hungary can send a peace-
keeping contingent made up of 350 soldiers to Kosovo as part of
the Kosovo peace-keeping forces (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
The resolution also allows participating KFOR foreign forces to
pass through Hungary or station there as they head for Yugoslavia.
It also permits them to transit Hungarian territory upon
withdrawal from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The detailed plan and steps regarding the transit of foreign
forces have yet to be worked out by the Hungarian government.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Defense Minister Szabo Janos said before the
parliamentary vote that Hungary will not only take part in the
KFOR operation but in the postwar reconstruction of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Defense Ministry spokesman said the Hungarian
peace-keeping camp, whose groundwork is scheduled to be completed
by July 15, has already started the site selection work.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian peace-keeping contingent is expected to move into
Kosovo's capital of Pristina in mid-July or early August. It will
be equipped with arms for self-defense, communications facilities
and armored vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Body Puts Players Through Night Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to improve sagging
player performance in international events, the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) has introduced training sessions
at night, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National training director Christian Hadinata said that the
measure, which began on Tuesday, was intended to put shuttlers
into a routine to compete at night.
</P>
<P>
"Like it or not, athletes often compete in the evening in a
tournament. They must get used to the conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said the night sessions would increase the frequency
of training. Three days a week athletes will undergo physical
training in the morning, stroke training in the afternoon and
technical training until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"This system will be applied continuously. We formerly used the
method but we had to change it because the training hall was so
windy," he said, adding that the hall was renovated two months ago
to limit the wind problem.
</P>
<P>
Some shuttlers complained about the new schedule.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles specialist Tony Gunawan said that its
introduction disrupted preparations for the Malaysia Open in
Kelantan from June 30 to July 4.
</P>
<P>
"We will compete in two weeks and we still have to adapt to the
new method. I think it's too close to the competition. But I don't
mind having the night training. Probably it's better for us to try
it first," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI also holds morning meetings every Monday and Thursday
before regular training.
</P>
<P>
Tony said he did not mind the meetings. "I don't have any
problems. It's the consequence of our failure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles Budi Santoso said: "It's good to give us
responsibility because we will be punished if we miss the meeting.
"
</P>
<P>
Women's singles Yuli Marfuah was less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
"Twice a week is too much. Those of who have families and don't
live in the dormitory often skip the meeting because they live far
from here," she said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Ban Food Imports From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Industry and Trade
Ministry will soon ban the import of food products from some
European countries as a follow-up to the Health Ministry's
regulation banning the import, distribution and sale of the
products in the country.
</P>
<P>
"If it is true (that the Health Ministry has issued the ban), I
will issue a ban on the import of the products," Industry and
Trade Minister Rahardi Ramelan was quoted by Antara News Agency
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry Monday banned the importation, distribution
and sale in Indonesia of any meat, chicken eggs, chickens, feed
and food products from Belgium as of June 14 on the ground that
the products carried dioxin, a chemical hazardous to human health.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Industry and Trade Ministry's Director General
of Foreign Trade Djoko Moeljono said he would cooperate with the
Health Ministry's Director General for Drugs and Food Monitoring
Sampurno in an effort to prevent the products from circulating in
Indonesia.

<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda, the former world number
two from the Czech Republic, confirmed Tuesday that he will quit
tennis after losing to Britain's Danny Sapsford in the Wimbledon
qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Czech has become a pariah in the game since
traces of the banned steroid nandrolene were found in a sample he
gave at Wimbledon 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Stripped by the International Tennis Federation of the ranking
points and prize money he earned in the tournament, Korda has
since been banished to the quiet corner of the locker-room.
</P>
<P>
"Something has been taken away from me -- my passion for the
game," said Korda after being beaten 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 by a Briton
ranked 590 in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't changed but trying to find the spirit to work every
day was just too much pressure in the end.
</P>
<P>
"Now the only match I have left is in July against the ITF and
I'm looking forward to it. But I don't have any regrets," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Give Up Bulgarian Refugee Status, Ready for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people who have
identified themselves as Kosovo Albanians and registered at the
National Bureau of Territorial Asylum and Refugees (NBTAR) have
given up their refugee status in Bulgaria and are getting ready to
return home in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They decided to renounce their refugee status shortly after the
peace agreement on Kosovo was announced, the Bulgarian news agency
BTA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs who registered at NBTAR, however, have not voiced so
far their willingness to return home. None of them has given up
the idea of receiving a refugee status in Bulgaria, the BTA said.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from NBTAR show the total number of applicants
for refugee status in Bulgaria since the beginning of the NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia increased to 372, of whom, 332 are
Albanians and 40 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Albanians who have applied for refugee
status since last autumn is 420, the BTA report said.
</P>
<P>
"I came to Bulgaria soon after the start of NATO's bombings in
March. My relatives died in the war and I am not planning to go
back at all. I do not believe there is any sense in returning,
because everything out there is destroyed and debased," a 25-year-
old Serb from Kosovo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had left his homeland because he did not want
to be recruited in the army. "I left because of NATO and because
they wanted to throw me into this senseless war which I did not
want to participate in. Before the war we used to live in some way
together with the Albanians. It might not have been perfect, but
the situation was not intolerable, while now I do not see how we
could live there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he feels all right in Bulgaria and is not planning
to leave for the West later. "I feel well here. I have no
language problems. I get on well with the people, no one has ever
offended me. On the contrary, people have been assisting me one
way or another. My most serious problem for now is to find a job,"
the Serb said.

<HEADLINE> Campaign for Use of Unleaded Gasoline Launched in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A national awareness campaign for
the use of unleaded gasoline was launched in Bulgaria on Tuesday
as part of the country's efforts to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The one-year campaign was designed to promote the awareness of
leaded gasoline's hazard for health and the necessity of gradually
stopping the use of it. Pamphlets on the campaign would be
released in petrol stations, garages and other similar places,
according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and sale of leaded gasoline will be
terminated in Bulgaria from 2004 under a national program adopted
by the government in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the quantity of lead in the air, around
half of which comes from vehicle pollution, goes beyond the
established standard by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the liquidation of the consequences from the
hazardous fuel on the human body is 3-4 times more costly than
simply getting rid of the production of leaded gasoline.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Petroleum Basket Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 15 (Xinhua)-- Venezuela's petroleum basket price
rose 45 cents per barrel between June 11 and 14, reaching 14.70 U.
S. dollars a barrel, the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources believed that the most important reason for
the strong rise is the strict implementation of the output cuts.
</P>
<P>
The bursting of an oil pipeline in Washington and troubles in
Nigeria's producing areas also affected oil prices, which has kept
strong since last week, with Venezuela's basket averaging 14.03
dollars, 1.07 dollars higher than the 12.96 dollars in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on March 12,
independent producers and the members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to cut back crude oil
production for one year, i.e., by 2.1 million barrels per day,
beginning from April 1.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Environment Remains Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Environmental conditions in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest China, remains good in general,
with its 1,000-odd lakes mostly unaffected by human activities,
according to a newly published gazette on local environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the quality of river water and spherical environment
was quite favorable with the main index COD complying with the
national standards, while the discharge of waste water increased
by 5.4 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tibet saw a discharge of industrial dust of 1.73
tons, down 21 percent year-on-year. There had been no report of
acid rain throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts over the past few years to build more
infrastructure in cities have largely improved the living
conditions of urbanites. The quality of surface water and
underground water was also good last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government document highlighted the importance of the
current integrated farming projects in Tibet, which include
transforming low-yielding cultivated land, planting trees and
improving power and water supply in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The projects have helped deal with the food and wear shortages
for some 63,000 poverty-stricken rural people and improve the
ecological environment, according to the report.

Qian made the remarks when he met with Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada Tuesday afternoon in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
1996 gave fresh impetus to bilateral relations of the two
countries, and that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to developing friendly relations with Ethiopia and
wishes to expand cooperation in various fields on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said China upholds justice in international affairs and
adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries. China, therefore, is an important
force to maintain world peace and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's robust economic growth has also
stimulated the economic growth of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said he is satisfied with the development of bilateral
relations and that he hoped the two sides would make more efforts
to fully explore the potential of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Negasso also briefed Qian on the border war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the war has caused the loss of lives and severe
material damage to both countries. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea face
the task of developing the economy and uplifting people's living
standards. He said China hopes the two sides could soon halt the
military clashes and find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts of the Organization of African Unity
in this regard and hopes that African countries could solve their
problems by themselves, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan and Ambassador to
South Africa Wang Xuexian were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and President Negasso are in South Africa for
Wednesday's inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as the new South African
president.

The Australian Financial Review:

<P>
BUCHAREST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Beginning this week, Romania's
under-21 soccer squad has a new coach -- Nicolae Manea, an expert
who assists Mircea Lucescu in coaching the Rapid Bucharest squad,
a winner of the national soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Manea replaced Tudorel Stoica, whose contract with the
Romanian Soccer Federation until June 1, 2000 has been canceled by
agreement of both sides, the official Rompres news agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mircea Sandu, president of the Romanian Soccer Federation,
thought that Tudorel Stoica has been replaced because of three
reasons: the squad's fluctuating play, a growing tension within
the squad and the requirement to change the tactics.
</P>
<P>
The new coach, Nicolae Manea is also allowed to keep his job
with the Rapid squad. He will sign a contract with the federation
until November and the extension of the contract will depend on
the results of the squad.
</P>
<P>
Manea's main goal is the qualification among the eight squads
that will play with the final tournament of the European
Championship.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves for Europe for G-8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
leaving here Tuesday night for Europe to launch a costly
rebuilding plan for war-torn Kosovo and other nations troubled by
the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to address the conference of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva on Wednesday and
pay a visit to France on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From Friday to Sunday, Clinton will join the G-8 summit in
Cologne, Germany, which is to be attended also by leaders of
Britain, France, Canada, Germany, Japan, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
A major task facing Clinton during his trip will be to work
together with leaders of the big powers and map out a
reconstruction plan for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"The coming months will be a period of return and
reconstruction," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday
at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
"As President Clinton consults with his colleagues this week,
he will do all he can to ensure that the effort is well launched,"
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The 78-day bombing campaign by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has destroyed a lot of infrastructure in
Yugoslavia, including its province of Kosovo, and displaced tens
of thousands of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rebuilding of Kosovo, Albright said that
European nations will bear the largest share of the financial
burden because the United States absorbed the heaviest cost of the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
departed for Finland for talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev over the controversial role of Russian peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will meet Sergeyev in Helsinki on Wednesday to try to
break a deadlock over Russian participation in the force, with
Russia balking at NATO insistence that its forces come under a
unified NATO-led command.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is traveling with Clinton, and Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov are also expected to join the defense
ministers on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday telephoned Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif "to
express his concern at the continued tense situation along the
Line of Control (LoC)".
</P>
<P>
Sharif thanked Clinton for his interest in peace and security
in the region and "his desire to prevent the situation from

</P>
<P>
Clinton appreciated Sharif's efforts for a peaceful solution
through negotiations and dialogue and expressed his willingness to
continue to support this process, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sharif assured Clinton that Pakistan "remained committed to the
Lahore Declaration and the dialogue process with India."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that the confrontation in the
Kargil sector was "one aspect of the larger issue of Kashmir,"
which cannot be isolated from the need for "a just and final
settlement of the Kashmir dispute."
</P>
<P>
Sharif informed Clinton of the various initiatives he had taken
to defuse the current tension including the visit of Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Aziz visited New Delhi on June 12 but his talks with his Indian
counterpart Jaswant Singh ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Sharif said, had always sought "a peaceful solution
of this dispute and would persevere in its efforts." In this
connection, he particularly recalled the historic Lahore summit.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee visited Lahore on
February 20 and held talks with Sharif and the two sides signed
the Lahore Declaration.

<HEADLINE> Ginger Proven to Be Able to Promote Joint Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Massive clinical trails have
proven that Ginger can promote joint health without side effects,
pharmacologists and patients said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zinaxin, developed by Danish biochemist and pharmacologist Dr.
Morten Weidner is one of the supplements containing ginger with
such effects, they said.
</P>
<P>
Zinaxin is based on a ginger extract and can treat rheumatic
disorders. Exploratory analyses revealed clinical improvement
after five weeks of treatment, according to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
Seven years and 4 million U.S. dollars research confirmed the
remedy, with the tests involving close to one thousand patients in
Demark, Singapore and the United States.
</P>
<P>
One of the patients is Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis who
told a press conference that he has taken Zinaxin every day and
witnessed "tremendous progress" in alleviating his knee and lower
back problems as a result of extensive exercises.
</P>
<P>
Zinaxin promoters see a big market in the United States and
elsewhere as the U.S. alone has more than 40 million inhabitants
with unhealthy joints.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Lower bond yields and an
Internet share recovery pushed Wall Street stocks higher Tuesday
ahead of a Consumer Price Index report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 31.66 at
10,594.99. The index rose 72.82 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 7.16 at 1,301.16 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 16.36 at 2,414.67.
</P>
<P>
Stocks moved higher as bonds rose for the second straight
day on the strength of U.S. dollar against Japanese yen.
The rise in bond prices pulled the bond yields down to 6.07 percent
from 6.09 percent Monday for the 30-year Treasury bond, making
stocks more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
Internet share recovery from Monday's losses helped
technology stocks move higher. Some of Internet stocks fell
by nearly half since April for fears about higher inflation and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government report on Wednesday's Consumer Prices Index
would give investors clues to inflation. After a report showing
a 0.9 percent CPI rise in April, the Federal Reserve warned last
month that it would raise interest rates to cool off the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 2.68 at 622.28 and the
American Stock Exchange index rose 1.23 at 763.92. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.48 at 434.01.
