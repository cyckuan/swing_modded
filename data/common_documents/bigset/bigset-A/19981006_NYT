`HEDGE FUND' LACKS A SIMPLE DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With HEDGEFUND-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the extent that the term ``hedge fund'' conjures up any image
in the public's mind these days, it is likely to be a picture of
financial calamity created by Long-Term Capital Management, the
Greenwich, Conn., investment pool that nearly went belly up.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier day and among a smaller group of people, a hedge
fund might have been personified by George Soros, the billionaire
investor who battered the British pound and tried to bankroll
democracy in Eastern Europe. Among an even smaller set, the phrase
might bring to mind investors like Michael Steinhardt, Julian
Robertson or Leon Cooperman, all known for being very quiet and
very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   But in point of fact, ``hedge fund'' does not really mean much
at all. ``There is no legal definition of hedge fund,'' said Lois
Pelz, editor of MAR/Hedge, a publication that tracks hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Her organization defines them generally as investment pools in
which the managers get a big share of the profits _ 20 percent, on
average. Mutual fund managers, by contrast, can charge only an
annual fee; regulators worry that awarding them a slice of the
profits will encourage them to take big risks.
</P>
<P>
   Other characteristics of hedge funds, Ms. Pelz said, are that
they tend to invest in more than one kind of market (not just
stocks, but also futures, for example), and that they often borrow
money to increase their bets.
</P>
<P>
   Some hedge funds speculate on corporate takeovers and mergers;
others bet on bankruptcies. Some focus on particular sectors of the
stock market, like technology, but the largest number are global
funds that may focus on particular countries or regions (Russia,
lately, has been a disaster). The big, famous ones, like Soros'
Quantum and Robertson's Tiger, invest all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The first hedge funds tried to hedge their bets, usually by
splitting their portfolios between stocks they expected to rise and
those they expected to fall. (That way, they could make some money,
no matter what happened.)
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that investing in hedge funds was only for the
superrich; now, the merely somewhat rich may invest in them.
Various federal laws require that hedge-fund investors have a net
worth of $1 million, or annual income of $200,000 for two
successive years, or a $5 million investment portfolio. The funds
cannot advertise or do anything that might make the government
suspect that they are trying to attract the financial hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of their air of exclusivity, hedge funds have
been attracting increasing numbers of amateur investors. James
O'Shaughnessy, who already manages private accounts and mutual
funds, said he was opening a hedge fund because his clients were
clamoring for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be everything Long-Term Capital was not,''
O'Shaughnessy said. But because of all the bad publicity hedge
funds are getting these days, he added, ``We may have to come up
with another clever name for it.''

NEW GOLISANO ADS ENLIVEN SLEEPY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a humorous bite that had been absent from the
gubernatorial campaign, a flurry of advertisements attacking Gov.
George Pataki went on the air Monday, courtesy of B. Thomas
Golisano, the wealthy third-party candidate who is trying to shake
up a contest that is shaping up as an easy stroll to re-election
for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, Golisano has blanketed the state with
millions of dollars' worth of sober television, radio and newspaper
advertisements criticizing the governor's handling of state
finances, to no apparent effect.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that Pataki still holds a wide lead over the
Democratic candidate, Peter Vallone, while Golisano and Lt. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party candidate, remain stuck in
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   But the new advertisements _ with the catch phrase ``that's a
Pataki,'' a reference to what Golisano says are fiscal foul-ups by
the Pataki administration _ are a departure, easily the liveliest
messages yet in this sleepy contest. Four advertisements were
broadcast for the first time Monday, and Golisano said eight more
are scheduled to be broadcast in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, said at a news
conference in midtown Manhattan Monday that he had committed $7
million to the new advertising effort, and that more money might
follow before the Nov. 3 election. He has said he would spend up to
$20 million of his own money on the campaign, a figure that puts
him in the league of the biggest spenders in New York politics this
year, Pataki and U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, declined to comment directly on the
advertisements or on Golisano, saying only, ``The state is doing
well, and I'm very proud of the changes we've made to give us a
better future.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's attacks could shrink the governor's commanding lead
over Vallone, the New York City council speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say the Independence candidate is most popular with
upstate conservatives, the core of Pataki's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golisano's carrying some of the heavy load right now for
Vallone, who doesn't have the money to do it himself,'' said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Somebody spending $15 million or more to
attack the governor could certainly hurt him if the message is
focused, but all that does is change the size of the margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's advertisements harp on the sharp increase in state
debt, up 30 percent in less than four years under Pataki, and this
year's 8 percent increase in state spending over last year. Vallone
has made similar points, but he does not have the money to
broadcast them the way Golisano has.
</P>
<P>
   In one advertisement, a man sitting on a brownstone stoop
regales three friends with a tale about someone who borrows from
one person to pay off another, then borrows again to pay the second
debt. Finally, the storyteller says, ``What are you trying to pull
on me here, a Pataki?''
</P>
<P>
   In two other advertisements, a cabdriver, asked about increasing
state debt, a low state credit rating and other problems,
repeatedly answers, ``That's a Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   But the harshest advertisement features a stand-in for the
governor, with his back to the camera, asking a bank officer for a
$20 billion loan, ``so I can say I'm showing a surplus even though
my business is billions of dollars in debt.'' The incredulous loan
officer asks the name of the business, and the faceless figure
replies, ``New York State,'' to which the bank man says, ``How nice
to meet you, Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that Golisano's appeal as a protest candidate is
limited. He ran for governor in 1994, never rising above a 10
percent share in voter preference polls and receiving just 4
percent of the vote, despite spending $6.6 million. His message is
almost entirely about matters fiscal, a subject likely to draw
yawns from voters in the absence of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano said Monday that he saw himself as the only real
alternative to the incumbent because Vallone's campaign is
flagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly with the weakness of the second candidate, Vallone,
this is an excellent opportunity for me to step up,'' Golisano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference outside City Hall, Vallone
shrugged off that assessment, saying he was also written off during
the primary campaign. Last week, his campaign reported having just
$248,000 left, compared with $9.2 million for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real poll is how the people feel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki Monday received the endorsement of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association and other New York City police unions, which
gave him some of the credit for the statewide drop in crime since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone protested that most of that decline has occurred in New
York City, and that he and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani deserve the
credit.
</P>
<P>
   And, as he has done almost daily during the general election
campaign, Vallone accused the governor of ducking debates, a charge
Golisano also made.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the Vallone campaign sent people
dressed as duck hunters to blow duck calls outside one of Pataki's
campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he wanted to debate and believed that debates would
take place. But he insisted that he had nothing to do with making
the arrangements, which he said would be done by the respective
campaign managers.

TWO OPINIONS ON A STREET NAME 
EAST COAST CRITIC, WEST COAST HOME  
 FREED FOR FLYING  
 GENERATION TRAP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY JAMES BARRON with ALAN FEUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apparently Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been learning
about Manhattan by riding around with out-of-town journalists like
the Washington-based columnist George F. Will.
</P>
<P>
   In a column that appeared in The Washington Post and The New
York Post on Sunday, Will praised the return of street signs that
say ``Sixth Avenue'' on the Avenue of the Americas. Will wrote that
the mayor had not noticed the signs before.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had Maria Smith, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Transportation. ``I checked, and yes, indeed, there are new signs
for Sixth Avenue,'' she said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting Will's argument that New Yorkers never call it
anything but Sixth Avenue, she said that she often referred to it
as Avenue of the Americas, sometimes even in taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting her, Mark Patterson, also with the Transportation
Department, called and said the signs were anything but new.
``They've been like that for the last 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His historicizing meshed with Ms. Smith's explanation for the
one-street, two-name situation. The City Council approved the dual
name _ Avenue of the Americas and Sixth Avenue _ in the 1980s, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done a major reconstruction project on Sixth Avenue,
and my guess is that some of the dual signs weren't replaced,'' she
said. ``They should have been.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   He is the new film critic for New York magazine, but he is not
moving to New York. Peter Rainer, the chief film critic for New
Times-Los Angeles and the chairman of the National Society of Film,
was named Monday to succeed David Denby, who is leaving New York
magazine to become a film critic for The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm based in LA,'' Rainer, 47, said, noting that a number of
critics for other New York-based publications live there.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Jeremy Gerard, a features editor at New York, said
that he would spend ``extended periods'' in New York. ``I'm
bicoastal,'' Rainer said.
</P>
<P>
   How will his approach differ from Denby's? ``I'm very simpatico
with the way he writes about movies,'' Rainer said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREED FOR FLYING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing hooky,'' Bill Maher said, explaining his presence
in New York on a weekday. His talk show, ``Politically Incorrect,''
originates in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But hooky was not the right word: He taped Monday night's show
on Friday. That freed him to fly east for a one-man show in Rhode
Island on Saturday and for lunch Monday at Rolling Stone magazine,
where he was asked about President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's out of the woods,'' Maher said. ``He has to
survive. That's as important as getting Nixon out in Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENERATION TRAP &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Friars Club, worried about its reputation as an outpost for
aging comedians like Alan King, Abe Vigoda and Freddie Roman, is
trying to attract a different crowd these days. But young bucks can
sometimes kick hard.
</P>
<P>
   Although the honoree at the annual roast on Friday was Drew
Carey, the 40-year-old sitcom star, a few young comedians took aim
at their counterparts in the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best wine to serve with Abe Vigoda?'' asked Joy
Behar, a host of the ABC talk show ``The View.'' ``Formaldehyde?''
</P>
<P>
   And the comic Jeffrey Ross, saying he had seen younger faces on
printed money, commented: ``It's not a roast. It's a rot.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan King had the best comeback _ or precomeback. In a
conversation the day before the roast, he said that nothing the
young comics could say would sting. ``Are you kidding? We invented
roasting.''

BOSTON CHICKEN'S $283 MILLION DEBT PROMPTS BANKRUPTCY FILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Boston Chicken Inc., once a restaurant industry
high flier, has hit some severe turbulence that forced it to file
Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday and close 178 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden, Colo., company took the action because it is
strapped for cash and is faced with about $283 million in debt that
is due Oct. 17. Chapter 11 permits a company to continue operating
while it works out a payment plan with creditors.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 100 Boston Market stores from Fresno to San
Diego franchised to Boston West L.L.C. They are unaffected by the
closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bankruptcy of Boston Chicken is not a bankruptcy of Boston
West. At the present time we will not be closing any (stores) in
Southern California,'' said Andrew Puzder, executive vice president
of Carl Karcher Enterprises of Anaheim, a stakeholder in Boston
West, a limited liability company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean that some restaurants might not be closed in
the future. You always evaluate which ones to keep open or
closed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing could have a financial impact on Boston
West because it has borrowed money from time to time from Boston
Chicken. Those loans will no longer be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to restructure out of court and gave it our best
effort. We have considerably improved restaurant operations,
significantly reduced overhead and have made progress with our
creditors toward a financial restructuring,'' Boston Chicken
Chairman J. Michael Jenkins said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Chicken and its Boston Market restaurants, which feature
home-style cooking, stormed Wall Street in 1993 with an initial
public offering priced at $20. The company's stock soon rocketed to
$50 a share and it split 2-for-1 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It has since tanked, closing Monday at 50 cents, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been downhill for some time now,'' said Janet Lowder, an
analyst at Restaurant Management Services in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company's ``replacement dinner'' meals -- that is,
full meals prepared as quickly as at a fast-food restaurant -- are
getting tough competition from similar restaurant chains and even
from the deli sections of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supermarkets have just done a tremendous job. I think they
are making their mark in this arena and we didn't think that they
could,'' Lowder said.

KARIYA IS HAUNTED BY NEXT BIG HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After Paul Kariya sustained another concussion
last Feb. 1, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks medical staff expected him to
be back in the lineup in a few days. The Canadian Olympic team was
counting on him to join it in Japan later that month. Young,
talented and charismatic, Kariya is important to the National
Hockey League on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   But when the aftereffects worsened, his prognosis for recovery
stretched from days to weeks to months. He missed the Olympics and
could not bear watching them much on television. He would wake up
with headaches and they would occasionally intensify, even when his
car bounced lightly over a bump in the road. Mature for his 23
years, Kariya found himself in an emotional valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having real problems,'' said Kariya, who missed the rest
of the season, 28 games. ``I didn't want to talk to anybody. I
didn't want to see anybody. The last thing I wanted to do was watch
hockey. My mind just couldn't operate. It was frustrating. I had no
clue what was going on. My memory was very poor, especially my
short-term memory. I didn't remember what I had just done. I'd have
three messages on my phone, I'd play them, and then I couldn't
remember who called.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people called, and among them were Eric Lindros and Pat
LaFontaine, fellow players who were also the victims of
concussions. Lindros recommended acupuncture. LaFontaine expressed
sympathy and encouragement. Kariya's symptoms finally dissipated in
May, when the best NHL teams were in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing better head protection and bearing a harsher attitude,
Kariya is preparing for the 1998-99 season, which begins on Friday
night. More than many stories, Kariya's comeback will be watched
closely by fellow players, league executives, fans, corporate
sponsors and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's concussion was one of an epidemic last season that
victimized players such as Lindros, one of the league's premier
players, and LaFontaine, a longtime star, who was finally forced to
retire in the off season after his sixth career concussion. For a
league trying to broaden its appeal and increase its attractiveness
as a marketing and television commodity, the loss of a young star
like Kariya was a source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   That concern spurred a crackdown by league authorities. On the
dressing room door of the Mighty Ducks practice rink is taped a
stern letter sent to all teams. It reads in part, ``The league
intends to apply a much stricter standard of supplementary
discipline for any deliberate action by a player that is either
directed to the head of an opponent or results in an injury to the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, too, was apprehensive. He admitted that there were times
he thought about doing something else and not playing hockey,
though he acknowledged: ``I don't know what I would have done. It's
basically been my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that he may now be ``more at risk'' than other
players, Kariya added: ``If it happens, it happens. I'll have to
deal with it at that time.'' So far, through training camp and the
exhibition season, he said, ``I've taken some good shots to the
head and I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   His attitude is certainly upbeat. Passing through the doorway of
the Ducks' dressing room last week after a brisk practice, a
visitor could hear the loud banter, raucous joking and cursing
common to the environment as the athletes untied their skates, hung
up their pads and tossed sweat-soaked clothing into laundry bins.
Over the din blared a television tuned to a baseball playoff game.
Among the voices surrounding it was that of Kariya, who shouted
encouragement to the Boston Red Sox against the Cleveland Indians.
A native of Vancouver, British Columbia, Kariya played in college
at Maine and grew to like the Red Sox on visits to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   In his first few seasons, Kariya was often portrayed as an
overly serious professional. ``Paul's having more fun these days
than when I first got here,'' said Stu Grimson, a former teammate
who has rejoined Kariya and the Ducks this season. ``He understands
now that it's a long season and he's going to have a long career
and he's got to be able to enjoy himself while he's at it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the optimistic scenario. In the worst-case scenario, it
may already be too late. Although post-concussion syndrome is still
not fully understood, doctors believe the risk of concussion, the
damage and the recovery time all can increase with the frequency of
the injury. Kariya's last concussion was his fourth. Although
LaFontaine recovered from a fifth concussion to play last season
with the Rangers, his career ended after he suffered a sixth in an
accidental collision with a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's most recent concussion last season was less accidental.
After scoring against the Chicago Blackhawks, he was cross-checked
in the jaw by defenseman Gary Suter. Kariya didn't lose
consciousness. His head never hit the ice. He remembered the score
of the game, the team's record, the details. Suter was suspended
for four games, but some thought that was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if a crackdown on head-hunting is necessary, Kariya
replied: ``Oh, absolutely, it's a serious problem. You want your
best players playing and performing to make the league the best
league possible. They have to do something. Guys intentionally
going after someone's head have to be punished and punished
severely. You start handing out five- and 10-game suspensions, guys
will start thinking `Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.' They've put
a mandate out that they are going to crack down. It will be
interesting to see if they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In case they don't, Kariya and his team might intensify the
vigilante justice that is part of hockey's unwritten code. During
the off season, the Ducks added Grimson and Jim McKenzie, veterans
known for fighting. Kariya, a two-time winner of the Lady Byng
trophy for gentlemanly play and good sportsmanship, has said he
will be more willing to raise his stick in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to protect myself,'' said Kariya, listed as 5 feet 11
inches and 180 pounds. ``Sometimes, I've just let people hit me
instead of either avoiding it or getting your stick up. Hopefully,
you never have to do that. But, if guys are coming at my head, I
mean I've got to start protecting myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Suter now plays for the San Jose Sharks, Anaheim's divisional
rival. Suter and Kariya share the same business agent. According to
Kariya, Suter asked the agent if he should call Kariya. The agent
passed on the query, but it ended there. ``I said, `What's the
point?''' Kariya said. ``What's done is done. Go forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Kariya was cleared to play by Dr. James Kelly,
the director of the brain-injury program at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago, who has been consulted by other hockey
players for post-concussion diagnoses. Like LaFontaine last season,
Kariya is wearing extra padding in his helmet, a tighter strap
around his chin and a mouth guard between his teeth that works as a
shock absorber.
</P>
<P>
   Should he reach his potential, Kariya's career could define an
era. In only 220 games over four seasons as a professional, he has
129 goals and 148 assists for what has been, at best, a mediocre
team. He played in only 22 games last season, missing the first 32
in a contract dispute. A Canadian of Japanese and Scottish descent,
Kariya has the good looks, poise and verbal skills that appeal to
television producers and sports magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Should Kariya's Ducks contend, they could be the sort of team
that helps edge hockey more into the sports mainstream. The Ducks
are owned by the Walt Disney Co. and named after a Disney film.
Even on a bad team, Kariya is the kind of star who attracts fans
and television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   He works particularly well with Teemu Selanne, the other ace
wing on the Ducks' first line. Kariya plays the left side and
Selanne the right. But they crisscross, swirl and find each other
with soft touch passes while speeding up and down the ice with the
grace of dancers. In an exhibition last week against Los Angeles,
Kariya had two assists, and he has three goals and four assists in
four games. But Selanne said Kariya is not yet in top form.
</P>
<P>
   More than Kariya, Selanne is vocal in the campaign against dirty
checking. ``The players have to start to respect each other more,''
Selanne said. ``It's just ridiculous if, on the ice, it's not a
safe place anymore. You know when somebody is trying to hurt you.
All the hits these days, especially last year, they always get your
head first. The players have to realize it is dangerous. We can't
lose any more star players with stupid concussions.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kariya still says hockey is ``the best game in the
world,'' he also said the incident caused him to think more
seriously when people rationalize setbacks with the expression,
``Well, at least you've got your health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would always say: `What are you talking about? There's so
much more to life than that,''' Kariya said. ``But it really caused
me to simplify things and say, `If you don't have your health,
especially in your head area, you can't operate and you can't live
a normal life.' It made me appreciate that, and now I'm very
pleased and grateful that I've got it and want to continue.'' &QL;

PURCHASE OF LENDER PACIFICAMERICA AMBIGUOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The purchase of mortgage lender PacificAmerica
Money Center by a large insurer has hit a bump in the road, sending
its stock price plunging 37 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, Fremont General Corp. of Santa Monica, has changed
the terms of the deal by setting performance standards for
PacificAmerica to meet before it will pay the agreed-upon $10 per
share, or $55 million, announced in September.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica shares dropped $2.6875 to $4.50, giving back some
of the 49 percent gain on Sept. 11 when both companies announced
news of the purchase. Fremont lost $5.125, or 10 percent, to close
at $44.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street ``does not like uncertainty,'' said Walter
Fitzgerald, an analyst at Brean Murray in New York. ``The final
payout is unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Fremont said it would pay $10 a share, with a
quarter of the payment in stock and the rest in cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Fremont has revised the terms, making a lower purchase price
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont now is offering $6 a share in cash at the close of the
deal. Fremont also would pay up to $4 a share within two years if
PacificAmerica meets certain targets in the sale of its loans,
without identifying those target levels.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sale of PacificAmerica's interest-only strip
receivables are less than the amount they both agreed upon, then
the difference will be subtracted from the $6 a share purchase
price.
</P>
<P>
   The strips are assets that represent the spread between the
interest on loans homeowners pay PacificAmerica and the amount it
pays to investors who buy bonds and notes collateralized by these
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Bailey, chief executive officer of Fremont, said the
insurer sought to buy PacificAmerica because of its distribution
channels.
</P>
<P>
   However, the volatile subprime residential mortgage market and
capital markets have made it riskier for Fremont to take over
certain assets of PacificAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are risks we're not willing to assume,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long day that veered from sober
constitutional discourse to bitter partisan scrapping, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Monday night to
recommend that Congress open a formal impeachment investigation of
a president for only the third time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the investigative counsel for the Republicans
outline 15 possible grounds for impeachment of President Clinton,
the committee, on a vote of 21 to 16, sent to the House a
resolution modeled after the language used in the Watergate
inquiry. It authorizes the committee ``to investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of
Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats tried and failed, on another party line vote, to
substitute a plan for a more limited, two-phase inquiry. It would
have required the committee first to define an impeachable offense
before deciding whether to open a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal put them as well as the Republicans on record in
support of further inquiry into the president. Many Democrats
sharply condemned Clinton's behavior but said it fell short of
warranting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is set to vote on the impeachment inquiry as
early as Thursday, as one of its last acts before recessing for the
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee, Rep. Henry Hyde, opened the
nearly 11 hours of deliberations by reminding everyone that on
Monday the committee was not considering the impeachment of the
president but simply deciding whether to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to pass judgment on anyone,'' the Illinois
Republican said. ``We are here to ask and answer this one single
question _ based on what we now know _ do we have a duty to look
further or to look away?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the memories of Watergate were summoned
repeatedly as Republicans and Democrats presented sharply different
views of the severity of the president's evasions over his affair
with Monica Lewinsky in two legal forums. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
even revived the infamous Watergate phrase about a ``cancer'' in
the presidency to describe Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case for an impeachment inquiry before the final
vote, David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel for the
Republicans, told the committee that ``substantial and credible
evidence'' existed of 15 possibly impeachable offenses by Clinton,
more than the 11 such charges made by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The core of his argument concerned the sanctity of the nation's
judicial system and the president's role as the nation's chief law
enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that every witness in every case must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is the foundation
of the American system of justice which is the envy of every
civilized nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lying under oath is tolerated and when exposed, is not
visited with immediate and substantial adverse consequences,''
Schippers said, ``the integrity of this country's entire judicial
process is fatally compromised and that process will inevitably
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers recast Starr's own charges somewhat. He dropped what
many lawyers considered to be Starr's two weakest accusations,
including abuse of power, stemming from claims of White House
privilege and from Clinton's refusal to voluntarily testify while
misleading potential witnesses. And on the possible charges of
perjury, Schippers chose to refer to those acts as making false
statements, which some committee members said would be easier to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   He divided some of Starr's charges and added several new ones
including a failure to disclose Ms. Lewinsky's filing of a false
affidavit and a ``conspiracy'' to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of a conspiracy, he highlighted three days of
constant phone calls to and from the White House showing Clinton
reaching out to his friend Vernon Jordan and his secretary, Betty
Currie, after he denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
during a deposition in the sexual harassment case of Paula Jones in
January. The calls then show Mrs. Currie trying repeatedly to find
Ms. Lewinsky, instructing her in code to ``Call Kay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending his testimony with a touch of drama, Schippers asked to
speak not as a committee staff member, but as a citizen, a father
and a grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing Sir Thomas More in the play ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' he said, ``The laws of this country are the great
barriers that protect the citizen from the winds of evil and
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing the committee, the Chicago lawyer, who is a lifelong
Democrat, added, ``Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow
Americans, many of whom are reposing in military cemeteries
throughout the world are looking down on and judging what you do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats objected and Hyde, the committee chairman who had
selected Schippers as his counsel, had the final remarks removed
from the record.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats,
countered that impeachment is reserved only for high crimes against
the state and that no matter how the Republicans had recast Starr's
case, ``one basic allegation _ the president was engaged in an
improper relationship which he did not want disclosed _ is the core
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Schippers, he contested the legal significance of
Clinton's original denial of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said that Judge Susan Webber Wright of Federal District
Court in Little Rock, Ark., called evidence about Ms. Lewinsky
unessential to the sexual harassment case against the president.
Judge Wright decided, after a motion by Starr, that his criminal
investigation overrode the Jones lawyers' need to continue their
pursuit of evidence involving Ms. Lewinsky. She ultimately
dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit last April, ruling that Mrs. Jones
had not proved that she had suffered any harm after her alleged
encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was giving the committee the ability to determine
that the president's statements, whether truthful or not, were not
of the legal importance suggested by Starr,'' Lowell said, ``let
alone grave constitutional significance to support impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Starr of overreaching and showing bias when he
cast the president's claims of executive privilege as an abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an attempt to organize his staff to spread
misinformation about the progress of the war in Vietnam,'' Lowell
said, returning to the Watergate era. ``Or about a break-in of the
Democratic headquarters at the Watergate, or even about how funds
from arms sales in Iran were diverted to aid the Contras in
Nicaragua. This was a president repeating to his staff the same
denial of an inappropriate and extremely embarrassing relationship
that he had already denied to the public directly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The committee met in the same cavernous hearing room where
Richard Nixon's own fate was debated 24 years ago. Behind the dais
of lawmakers stared down oil paintings of Hyde and of former Rep.
Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., who presided over the Watergate
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Democrats sought to turn attention as much on
Starr as on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to have prosecutors with unlimited powers
accountable to no one, who will spend millions of dollars
investigating a person's sex life?'' asked Rep. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee. ``Who then haul
before grand juries every person of the opposite sex the person has
had contact with? Who then record and release videos to the public
of the grand jury questioning of the most private aspects of one's
sex life?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, by contrast, cast Mrs. Jones as a victim who had
been denied her day in court through Clinton's evasions. ``Bill
Clinton, first as governor and then as president, using the power
entrusted to him coarsely demanded personal favors from individual
citizens,'' said Barr, a longtime critic of the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Jones refused, Barr said, ``Bill Clinton continued to
abuse his office to smear that citizen's name and block her access
to justice.'' He added, ``We are witnessing nothing less than the
symptoms of a cancer on the American presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the committee departed from party lines to look
for a middle ground. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., chastised both
parties alike. Republicans, he said, have ``an obligation to
recognize that high crimes and misdemeanors has a meaning. All
felonies are not high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Democrats that they had to recognize that it was a
Democratic Congress, at the urging of Clinton, which passed the law
that allowed the naming of an independent counsel. And it was
Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, who approved Starr's
inquiry into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
said, ``I have no idea what I am going to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, one of the conservative rebels who had once tried to
topple House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said, ``I don't know if censure
is appropriate. We should just drop it or we should throw him out
of office. Nobody knows yet in my opinion who has really got an
open mind about this thing. Is this Watergate or Peyton Place? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one lawmaker drew applause on Monday, and only from the
Democratic sideof the aisle. ``The president had an affair,''
shouted Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. ``He lied about it. He didn't
want anyone to know about it. Does anyone reasonably believe that
this amounts to a subversion of government? Does anybody reasonably
believe this amounts to subversion of government?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's committee vote marked only the third time that Congress
has begun a formal impeachment process against a president. The
first time was against Andrew Johnson. But it is far from a
foregone conclusion that Clinton will be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes as expected later this week to authorize an
impeachment inquiry, the Judiciary Committee then begins the
process of holding hearings and weighing the evidence against
Clinton. It then decides whether to recommend that the full House
impeach the president, the equivalent of an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   If the House impeaches, the Senate then tries the president with
the chief justice of the United States presiding. It takes a
two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove a president from office.

BRADLEY REMEMBERED AS MENTOR, CITY BUILDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles said farewell to former Mayor Tom
Bradley on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Political foes and allies alike eulogized Bradley, who died last
week at 80, as a man with simple tastes and grand dreams, as a
coalition builder and as the architect of the city's growth during
his historic 20 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of Bradley's determination, demonstrated by his rise
from poverty as the son of a Texas sharecropper to become the first
African-American mayor of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been no Tom Bradley there would be no Police
Chief Bernard Parks,'' Parks told the overflow crowd of more than
2,000 mourners gathered in and around the First AME Church in the
West Adams district.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour ceremony was televised live across the city.
Following the service, Bradley was interred at Inglewood Park
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, who counted Bradley as one of his mentors, was among some
two dozen people who praised the mayor for what he had accomplished
during his five terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley changed the face of Los Angeles government, bringing in
minorities and women to posts previously unavailable. He also
opened up city business to minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley oversaw the development of downtown
Los Angeles, shepherding projects that changed the skyline and gave
the city something to boast about to rival the storied profiles of
San Francisco and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and the city hosted the world during the Summer Olympics
of 1984, the most successful run this century.
</P>
<P>
   The First AME choir and singer Stevie Wonder were among
performers who moved the crowd to their feet, with songs including
``My Way,'' ``The Impossible Dream'' and ``Wind Beneath My Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Gov. Pete Wilson, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis,
Mayor Richard Riordan and Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke were among the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore entered the church shortly before the ceremony began and
stood momentarily looking at Bradley's body, lying in a black
casket decorated with white lilies and red roses. The vice
president hugged Bradley's widow, Ethel, and two daughters,
Lorraine and Phyllis.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this day, as we gather round our fallen brother, we do so
not to recite his many titles: mayor, healer, husband, father,
leader, but to testify of those lives grown out of his life,'' Gore
told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Bradley's whole life was a testament to justice, hope and
an audacious view of the future. Los Angeles may have lost an
angel. But an angel is now with other angels.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral also drew George Deukmejian, who defeated Bradley
twice in his runs for governor; former U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; attorney Johnnie
Cochran Jr.; San Francisco Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr.; District
Attorney Gil Garcetti and Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's storied rise began when his family moved to Los
Angeles from Texas when he was 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley excelled in sports and ran track at the University of
California, Los Angeles. From there, he joined the Los Angeles
Police Department, where he worked for more than 20 years,
eventually achieving lieutenant, the highest rank then earned by an
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the department, Bradley went to law school
and became active in local politics, winning a City Council seat in
1963 _ the first African-American elected to the council. In 1973,
after a bitter defeat four years earlier, Bradley became the city's
mayor and the first minority mayor of a major white-majority city.
</P>
<P>
   It was that victory that inspired many young African-Americans
to get involved in politics, said Robert T. Moore, a deputy to Sen.
Dianne Watson, D-Los Angeles, who was in the crowd of mourners
gathered outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the reason so many people got involved in politics,''
Moore said. ``He became the model. He was an icon to the black
community.''

LOS ANGELES: black community.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Williams of Los Angeles wiped away tears when asked what
Bradley meant to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest,'' Williams said. ``Everyone knew him in
the community. He never forgot where he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that ability that struck ``Sweet'' Alice Harris of
Parents of Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Tom Bradley, we couldn't get anyone at City Hall to
answer our calls,'' Harris said. ``But, I had his private number.
When we called, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Bradley understood poor folks. I don't know about you rich
ones, but he understood us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. also was one of those
who was not able to make it inside the 1,200-seat sanctuary and he
described the former mayor ``as a dear, dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could talk to him and he understood the issues,'' Begley
said. ``In his final years in office he became a real friend to the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled that he first met Bradley when Wilson was mayor
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to accept that Tom is gone from us,'' Wilson
said. ``Divine nature gave us Tom Bradley. It was more our good
fortune than Tom's that God put this extraordinary man, this
grandson of slaves, on a path that led him to this great city that
he would one day lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor, said he first met
Bradley when he worked in his 1973 mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first mentor was Tom Bradley, and you never forget the
lessons of your first mentor,'' Davis said. ``You keep them dear
for the rest of your life and you pass them on to the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who succeeded Bradley as mayor in 1993, called the
funeral one of the most emotional events in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was a giant,'' Riordan said. ``He turned the city
around and made it a world-class city.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's political mentor, the Rev. H.H. Brookins, recalled how
community leaders gathered behind Bradley in his first City Council
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from zero to hero,'' Brookins said, adding the changes
made by Bradley will never be lost to the African-American
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened the door and it will not be closed again,'' Brookins
said. ``We went from the back of the bus to the front of the bus
and we aren't going back. Now, we're buying the bus company.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday urged a select group of
the world's top financial officials to develop a unified attack on
the global economic crisis, after nearly three days of debate here
have produced a near stalemate over immediate cures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on Monday night at the beginning of a five-hour,
closed session with finance ministers and central bankers from the
largest industrial economies and 15 emerging markets nations that
have been striken by currency devaluations, plummeting stock
markets and growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But the session on Monday night focused chiefly on long-term
ideas for making the global economy less vulnerable to shocks,
proposed by the United States and others, despite widespread
criticism here that those meeting are spending too little attention
on coordinated immediate action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returns to the arena on Tuesday morning, when he
addresses the International Monetary Fund. It is holding its annual
meeting here along with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday night echoed a lament heard often these days
by politicians who feel whiplashed by the markets, saying that
global capital markets ``can react swiftly and harshly when
countries stray from sound policies.'' He added, `` the markets
also can overreact, subjecting even countries following good
policies to severe pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Clinton opened the talks, the markets proved
his point, continuing their fall around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   While the reasons varied, from heightened fears about Japan's
banks to concern that it is taking too long to put together a huge
package of aid for Brazil, the declines appeared set off by fears
that the first few days of meetings here contained more
finger-pointing than plans for action.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's stock market closed below 13,000 on Monday for the first
time in 12 years _ further undercutting the financial viability of
its banks _ and the Dow Jones industrial average also plunged,
before recovering much of the day's loss.
</P>
<P>
   A participant in the meeting on Monday night at a hotel along
Washington's Embassy Row said the president stayed for 90 minutes
of the discussion, and at various points drew 15 ministers and bank
governors into the conversation. Much of the discussion centered on
contrasting views of what set off the instability.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's finance minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, a favorite of the
IMF because he has embraced Western-style reforms, told Clinton the
problem was not that the world's early-warning system failed, but
that countries refused to listen to the alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Another proponent of IMF-style austerity programs, Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda of Thailand, made the case that his
nation _ the epicenter of the Asian crisis _ was slowly beginning
to recover. But that was the only real note of optimism, and
outside experts differ on whether Thailand is in recovery or simply
not getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the
United States would begin publishing more data about its foreign
currency reserves _ a key statistic _ in hopes that other countries
would follow suit. But the only action taken by the group, however,
was to pass on a series of reports about reform measures to
governments around the world, for their perusal.
</P>
<P>
   While officials seem to be reaching some consensus about
preventing future turmoil, more fissures opened at Monday's meeting
over how the world should respond, at a moment when the United
States, the Europeans and the emerging-market nations all have
different prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin directly
confronted Southeast Asian nations that have been pressing for _
and in a few cases enacting _ rules that would restrict the rights
of investors to move money freely across national borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misguided exchange and capital controls are not the answer for
dealing with the effects of this crisis,'' Rubin insisted in a
speech to the leading advisory panel to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the loss of confidence and resulting flight of capital
from many emerging market economies has carried with it a heavy
cost, measures that would effectively prevent the return of this
capital will only postpone recovery and the restoration of economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly referring most directly to Malaysia, which has
not only imposed such controls, but also arrested and imprisoned
the country's former finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, an ally of
Rubin's. Malaysia announced on Monday that it would suspend Anwar's
trial, on charges of revealing state secrets and sodomy, until just
after Clinton visits Malaysia next month for the next major meeting
on the global crisis, involving leaders from around the Pacific
Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also delivered a rare public rebuke to both the World Bank
and the IMF, institutions created 53 years ago to stabilize the
world economy, for their troubles in coming up with common
solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is past time to put aside institutional rivalries
unbefitting public institutions with the same shareholders,'' he
said. ``The IMF and World Bank must evolve to meet the new demands
of the global economy. All of us must work together.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the thousands of delegates who moved through the
meetings, wending their way from seminars on debt restructuring to
glittering embassy receptions, criticism grew that Rubin and
leaders of the other major economies should move more quickly to
show they have a short-term plan.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said in a
forum sponsored by Foreign Policy magazine on Monday that ``the G-7
should be shut in a room and not allowed to come out until they
have reached a decision'' to extend loan guarantees and other
backup financing to countries like Brazil that are ``essentially
following the right policies.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Soros was blamed by many at the IMF and World Bank
meetings in Hong Kong for accentuating Asia's troubles by betting
against its currencies _ an accusation he denied. But on Monday, he
pressed his argument that countries have increasingly become slaves
to the notion that markets are always right and self-correcting,
declaring, ``Right now, market fundamentalism is a greater threat
to open society than any totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments at least, Clinton has stepped around the
sensitive issue of how much governments should intervene to contain
market excesses. It is a territory where he is likely to bow to
Rubin, a former Wall Street trader who is extraordinarily cautious
about any moves that might smack of government efforts to restrict
the free flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rubin has pressed an agenda of long-term fixes to make
the way countries handle their resources more transparent and to
establish uniform rules when countries or companies cannot pay
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, several of those were endorsed in three reports
issued by the G-22 _ a group of 22 countries that has turned into a
think-tank about future economic crises. One called for the release
of far more economic data by countries and companies alike, noting
that the lack of such information ``exacerbated'' the panic that
began in Asia last year. Thailand and South Korea, for example,
both hid the depths of their problems last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another report endorsed changes in IMF strategy so that
countries that could be hit by economic contagion _ a phrase that
was rarely heard at these meetings until the Mexican peso crisis of
1995 _ can ``seek early assistance.'' That is the essence of a
proposal Clinton made on Friday, but its success depends on the
approval by Congress of $18 billion in additional funds for the
agency. Republicans in the House of Representatives are
overwhelmingly opposed, and there was no action Monday on resolving
the House's differences with the Senate, which approved the
commitment to the Fund more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A final report on strengthening weak financial systems in
countries around the world calls for a series of regulatory
changes, including bankruptcy laws and established procedures to
govern the restructuring of a nation's debt. In the present crisis
that has been done on a case by case basis _ and in the case of
Russia, the debt restructuring so far has been done largely by
Russian decree.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ideas have been in circulation for long enough now
that they have begun to develop a momentum of their own. But they
do not address the current crisis, and many of the officials here
are complaining that Rubin and the IMF are focusing on rebuilding
the hospital before they have treated some critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   But coordinated action is in short supply. The markets have been
waiting to hear word of some kind of pre-emptive financial
assistance for Brazil, totaling $30 billion or more, but while the
details have largely been negotiated the Brazilian government is
loathe to announce it until President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
apparent victory in a Sunday election is secured.
</P>
<P>
   And representatives of virtually all the major countries here,
especially Asian nations, say they are still waiting for most signs
that Japan is ready to deal with its banking crisis. The market
drop in Tokyo today, just days after the lower house of Parliament
passed the latest bill over dealing with the banks, suggested that
investors believe Japan is still not doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's straightforward,'' said Kenneth Courtis, the chief
economist for Deutche Bank's Asia operations. ``We've gotten from
Japan all that we are going to get.''

EDITORIAL: A DEBATE ON ALLOWABLE LIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 4th graf for change of wording) (fb)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press summary of the House Judiciary Committee
hearing on Monday was admirable for its simple, concentrated
statement of Washington's political mood and the constitutional
quandary presented by a chief executive who has squandered public
respect. ``No one _ no Republican, no Democrat _ defended Clinton's
conduct with Ms. Lewinsky or his testimony while under oath,'' the
AP said. ``The issue was whether the president's behavior
constituted events worthy of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue was crisply aired in presentations by David P.
Schippers, the counsel for the Republican majority, and by Abbe
Lowell, the minority counsel. Schippers said that Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, had documented that Clinton lied under
oath. He also said that in his view Clinton had worked
energetically to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses and
suppress evidence sought. As for the argument that he was only
lying about sexual conduct, not affairs of state, Schippers pointed
out that under his constitutional oath the president cannot pick
those legal proceedings in which his word is good and give himself
a license to lie in others. The details of the underlying case
``are of no significance whatever,'' Schippers said. ``It is the
oath itself that is sacred and must be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell put the opposing view as cogently as possible. Congress
should regard Clinton's testimony as ``misstatements'' about a case
that came to naught. The president's testimony, ``whether truthful
or not,'' does not have the constitutional gravity that warrants
impeachment or removal. Such steps require ``a far higher
threshold'' than has been reached in falsehoods designed to cover a
sexual escapade. Starr, he asserted, had tried to ``usurp the
constitutional role of the House'' by declaring President Clinton
impeachable instead of making a neutral presentation of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   From our point of view, these arguments, taken together, show
yet again how essential it is to reach a negotiated settlement that
involves heavy censure and an unqualified admission of lying by
Clinton. It would be disruptive to remove him unless more serious
crimes are proved. But great damage to the American political and
legal system would ensue from adopting Lowell's argument that the
nation's chief law enforcement officer can swear to tell the truth
and then lie for political convenience, to cover affronts to the
dignity of his office or to protect his family from knowledge about
his personal conduct. All are understandable human impulses, but
the rule of law is too important for this country to grant an
exemption for presidential foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of movement toward an acceptable resolution.
Former President Gerald Ford's proposal for condemning the
president in the well of the House spurred discussion of truncating
the impeachment process. This past weekend, the White House held
back its talk-show attack squad. The House Judiciary Committee
chairman, Henry Hyde, declared a willingness to conclude his
committee's deliberations by the end of the year. Sooner would be
better, but the Democrats have to shop harder for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' stinging recitation of the flurry of phone calls
among Clinton, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan should have convinced
the president's lawyers that the last thing they want is
impeachment proceedings or a Senate trial on obstruction of
justice. Monday's hearing should likewise have convinced House
Democrats that the Republican majority will never buy Lowell's
theory on the acceptability of miniature lies. But they can
probably move the Republicans toward a deal that allows this
presidency to run its full if inevitably disappointing course.

SONICS RUNNING ON IDLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A day earmarked for the swapping of vacation stories
has been overtaken by lockout lingo.
</P>
<P>
   NBA training camps, once scheduled to begin Tuesday, have been
postponed indefinitely because there is no collective bargaining
agreement between the league and its players.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the NBA canceled all preseason games. Meanwhile, players
planned to show up at practice facilities and arenas in NBA cities
Tuesday to talk about the lockout with fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just life in the NBA,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said. ``That's why it's an interesting business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA might miss regular-season games for the first
time, Westphal and his staff are preparing as though the lockout
will end Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are meeting about twice a week in order to crystallize
offensive and defensive strategies. They are watching film and
evaluating free agents. With only six players under contract, they
are trying to make something out of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we'd have all those things clear-cut by now,'' Sonics
assistant Dwane Casey said. ``We're just doing what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal and his assistants _ Casey, Bob Weiss and Nate McMillan
_ cannot do much during a lockout. They are prohibited from
communicating with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent a lot of time talking through various scenarios,''
Sonic president Wally Walker said. ``You don't know what the system
is going to be. It's guess work. . . . You're doing evaluations
without getting too charged up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the NBA and the players union are scheduled to
meet on Thursday. It will be only the second formal negotiation
since owners locked out players July 1. NBA commissioner David
Stern told The Rocky Mountain News in Denver recently that a
60-game schedule is the minimum required to play a season.
</P>
<P>
   A decision about the cancellation of regular-season games will
be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't play a partial season that doesn't give the regular
season an integrity of sorts,'' Stern said. ``My view is you should
be playing a minimum of 60 games. If you lose more than that, I
think you're really taking a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 180 NBA players without contracts, the Sonics are
not risking their stake in free agency. During the next two weeks,
each member of the coaching staff plans to visit various cities to
watch pickup games among NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go out and beat the bushes,'' Casey said. ``You
can't talk to them (free agents) and interact, but you can
observe.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta are among the target cities to
see premium pick-up games. Westpahl said that whenever the lockout
ends, the free-agent signing period will move swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   The league has said it will need about three weeks to conduct
training camps and a free-agent signing period.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things will depend on what happens immediately after
the lockout ends,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there isn't much to do but wait.

HUSKIES, SEAHAWKS TAP IRON MEN FOR NEEDED HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Jarzynka has never seen a punt or kickoff he did
not think he could take all the way for a touchdown. That is why
the Husky junior is constitutionally unable to lift up that right
arm and signal a fair catch.
</P>
<P>
   Jarzynka is the kind of gritty gridiron player who leaves no
doubt what he would have been doing during the Battle of Gettysburg
or the storming of the Normandy beaches on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the answer,'' Jarzynka said Monday. ``That one
fair catch might be the one you take to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarzynka might be the only player on the University of
Washington roster who could make you believe he can single-footedly
cure the Husky program's Achilles' heel of these past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no problem. I played soccer all during high school. I
kicked for my high school football team. I want to be part of
everything I can to help this program,'' the confident and now
neatly shorn Jarzynka said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jarzynka gave what amounted to be the only happy,
positive, upbeat, confident and encouraging interview of anyone
associated with a Seattle football team, college or pro. The
Huskies are 2-2 for the first time since 1989, but they are not the
only football team in town looking for answers in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were beaten Sunday by the Chiefs in the Arrowhead
Rain Bowl, 17-6. The loss dropped the Hawks to 3-2 and, more
important, it makes Sunday's AFC West matchup against Denver in the
Kingdome feel a lot more like a must-win deal than it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave Seattle football fans, who might be
more plentiful this fall now that the Mariners are dead and the NBA
season is likely to be, too?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it has them wondering if answers will come _ and when.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks and Huskies together went 5-0 over the first three
weeks (the UW had a bye week in there), but the home teams are 0-4
since then and running into problems in key areas.
</P>
<P>
   For the Huskies, it is a kicking game that needs someone who can
stick a field goal or extra point through the uprights with some
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   For the Seahawks, it is another receiver besides Joey Galloway
who can get the football to stay in his hands long enough to count
as a completion.
</P>
<P>
   So, wouldn't you know it, just as the Huskies will look to see
if their jack-of-all-trades Iron Man, Jarzynka, can make a
contribution in their kicking game, the Seahawks are calling on the
services of their most veteran and prolific pass catcher, Brian
Blades.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jarzynka is a man who knows no danger during Husky
games, Blades has never found a pass pattern too frightening to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Over the middle, into triple coverage? No sweat. Blades will run
it, offering himself up for all hard-hitting linebackers and
safeties if that's what it takes to get the job done. His 570
catches make him second only to Hall of Famer Steve Largent in the
Seahawks' record book. But the man who set the Seahawks'
single-season mark with 81 receptions in 1994 has logged 77, 43 and
30 catches the past three seasons, and just four in this season's
first five games.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jarzynka and his steadfast (and sometimes dangerous)
refusal to call for a fair catch, Blades has given up his body over
the past 11 seasons to make any catch his coach, offensive
coordinator or quarterback called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we kept him on the team,'' Seahawks coach Dennis
Erickson said Monday, fresh off a film session in which it was
clear that not even the Bermuda Triangle weather in Kansas City
could explain all the balls dropped by Mike Pritchard and James
McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   Those two guys were great playmakers last season. But so far in
1998, the Hawks offense has lacked the reliability it needs even
more, now that there is a commitment to the running game and,
therefore, each pass attempt becomes more selective and critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a chance to make a catch, we have to make a
catch,'' said Erickson. ``Not necessarily a touchdown or a big
play, but just making a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades barely caught on with the team this season, since his
body has been broken, whipped and pureed for all the times he has
gone fearlessly over the middle to catch a ball and move the
chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our fourth receiver right now, and our fourth receiver
hasn't played much,'' Erickson said. ``But he'll play a lot more.
Brian's made a lot of plays over the years, and the best thing to
do is take a guy that's done it and put him out there. We knew this
time might come for one reason or another, whether it's injuries or
the productivity isn't what we want, which happens to be the case
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the time to trot out the old pro. Like the
gritty kid named Jarzynka on the Huskies who believes he can help
his program, Blades might have the hands and the heart to make a
difference, too.

DUCKS MOVE TO SHORE UP DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ With the beginning of the 1998-99 season around the
corner, the Mighty Ducks made two moves Monday in hopes of plugging
gaps in their suspect defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the fifth pick in the 1998 NHL waiver draft, Anaheim
selected defenseman Pascal Trepanier from Colorado. Later in the
afternoon, with starting goalie Guy Hebert diagnosed with a Grade 1
right shoulder separation, the Ducks acquired goalie Dominic
Roussel from Nashville in exchange for defenseman Mark Moro and
goalie Chris Mason.
</P>
<P>
   With no established goaltenders to play behind Hebert, even
before he was slammed into the crossbar by teammate Kevin Haller,
the acquisition of a veteran backup was being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we wanted to improve that position,'' general manager
Pierre Gauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need two good goalies,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said.
``You can't rely on one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert's availability for Saturday's opener in Washington is
questionable, but he says he will play on the opening trip.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel, 28, who played for the Canadian national team last
year, is scheduled to play in tonight's exhibition finale at
Phoenix and could get the nod Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable with Dominic in net,'' Hartsburg said. ``He
has always been talented and he'll relish the second chance (in the
NHL).''
</P>
<P>
   Roussel, 61-65-5 with a 3.19 goals-against average in 146 NHL
games, was 18-9-3 with a 2.66 GAA for Philadelphia in 1996. When
the Flyers opted to go with Sean Burke and Ron Hextall last year,
however, he became the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lalime, who set an NHL rookie record in '96-97 by going
unbeaten in his first 16 games for Pittsburgh, figures to be the
odd man out for the Ducks once Hebert is completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick is another guy on the way back,'' said Gauthier of
Lalime, who played in only 31 games in the minors last year after a
contract dispute with the Penguins. ``He's got to build himself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were doing their best to build up Trepanier, after
they passed on veterans Terry Carkner and Kevin Dahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know two or three other teams were going to take him, so
it's lucky we had a top pick,'' said Gauthier of Trepanier, who has
only 15 games of NHL experience. ``You want a comer, somebody with
space for improvement.''

KINGS LOSE GOALIE CHABOT IN WAIVER DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Kings lost minor-league goalie Frederic Chabot
in Monday's NHL waiver draft and didn't claim any players.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, 30, was chosen by the Montreal Canadiens. His departure
leaves Manny Legace as the third goalie in the Kings organization,
behind Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr. Legace was assigned to the
Long Beach Ice Dogs last week.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings losing no forwards in the waiver draft, Kings
coach Larry Robinson faces the task of deciding, perhaps as soon as
today, whether rookies Olli Jokinen and Josh Green will make the
24-man roster that will travel to Edmonton for Saturday's
regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Berg update: The countdown continues for unsigned defenseman Aki
Berg, who is playing in his native Finland. If not signed by
Friday, the 21-year-old Berg will be gone for the year, because
after the season begins, he would have to clear waivers before
returning to the NHL, and it's highly unlikely that he would.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's agent, Larry Kelly of Ottawa, said he did not hear from
Kings general manager Dave Taylor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the youngster fully expects to play the whole
year in Finland,'' Kelly said. ``If that happens, I think it's in
everybody's interest that he gets (traded).''

   PHOENIX _ It's a typical Friday morning and KFYI radio talk show
host Barry Young is introducing the topic of the day: Is the first
lady of the United States of America a homosexual?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said we were going to do this yesterday,'' Young tells his
listeners. ``I have no firsthand information about the personal
life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. But I'm going to ask you this: Do
you think she's gay _ or bi _ and does it make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Young has chosen this particular subject, he says, because of an
article he read in the ``National Enquirer,'' which he describes as
a ``legitimate'' newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   KFYI is a successful radio station. Its daily lineup features
the nationally syndicated programs of Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura
Schlessinger. It was purchased recently by Chancellor Media Inc. of
Dallas, the largest radio station operator in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the lunatic fringe.
</P>
<P>
   This is the lunatic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   And here is Young, with no facts, speculating on a woman whose
only apparent crime is being married to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jim from New River is upset. He calls to accuse Young of
engaging in a form of ``hate radio.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't true. &QL; 
Proof in the talk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To call Young's program ``hate radio'' elevates it to a higher
level than it deserves. As he is about to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think (begin itals) this (end itals) is hate radio,''
Young tells Jim, ``If you think that merely asking the question is
hate radio. If you think that having a legitimate discussion about
politics in America is hate radio, you're going to (begin itals)
love (end itals) this one.''
</P>
<P>
   A song begins playing in the background. It's a parody of an
Elton John hit called ``Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.'' The play
on words centers around the relationship between Bill Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Young takes a call from Don in Phoenix, who's
convinced Hillary is gay based on information he supposedly got
from a cousin, who supposedly has a friend, who supposedly is in
the Secret Service, who supposedly told the cousin that he
supposedly once stood outside the door of a hotel room in which
Hillary Clinton supposedly was meeting with other women.
</P>
<P>
   I'm shocked that this kind irrefutable evidence _ of nothing _
isn't in the Starr report. Or, is it?
</P>
<P>
   If you've never tuned in to KFYI, the station is easy to find.
Just spin your radio dial to the very bottom, then go lower.
</P>
<P>
   And lower.
</P>
<P>
   And lower.
</P>
<P>
   Steve on a car phone says it matters to him if the first lady is
gay,``another relationship that this person (the president)
displays in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna in Phoenix says her ``intuition'' tells her Hillary is gay
because of the Clintons' political affinity for supporting gay
causes and gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, each of us says something cruel or stupid,
something we regret the moment it comes out of our mouths and
quickly apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   This show wasn't like that. It was planned. It was advertised.
If you have a wife, a daughter, a mother, you don't need me to tell
you what you should think about it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a molecule of human decency and a single active
brain cell, you already know.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't, you're a Republican member of the House Judiciary
Committee. Or, you buy radio time for CompUSA, AT&AMP;T, Chicago First
Mortgage, West Valley Nissan, Home Base, Goodyear tires, Fort
McDowell Casino, Scottsdale Cellular and the other sponsors of
Young's show.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you're George from Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   He telephones Young to complain about the Clintons and to say he
has no problem using the ``Enquirer'' as a reliable information
source. If it weren't for the ``Enquirer,'' George says, he'd have
never seen that picture of a bandaged President John F. Kennedy
leaving a Dallas hospital in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   After he was assassinated. &QL;

RED INK FILLS MOTOROLA'S 3RD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Motorola Inc., the world's largest maker of mobile
phones, pagers and telecommunications equipment and a longtime
bellwether for the high-tech industry, announced a third-quarter
loss Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The news underscores observers' forecasts that the semiconductor
industry, which employs 31,900 workers in Arizona, will wrap up the
year with a drop in sales of about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's earnings have been widely seen as an early indicator
of how much the Asian economic crisis has affected profits for the
entire high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call (Motorola) a bellwether of the industry because
they have a very broad product line,'' said Jim Feldhan, president
of Semico Research Corp. in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The lower earnings follow Motorola's decision to slash its
workforce 10 percent, delay construction of plants and cut costs.
About 20,000 people work for Motorola in Arizona, making it the
state's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   Other semiconductor companies and their vendors in Arizona have
made similar layoffs. Intel, which employs about 9,200 workers in
Arizona, has cut its worldwide workforce 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Motorola's drop in profits, experts say the industry
should recover, growing 10 percent to 16 percent next year, as
older manufacturing plants shut down worldwide and companies cut
workers to reach an equilibrium between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended Sept. 26, Schaumburg, Ill.-based
Motorola reported sales of $7.2 billion, down 3 percent from $7.4
billion &UR; last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months, the company reported a loss of $42
million, or 7 cents a diluted share. Motorola earned $266 million,
or 44 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The current quarter included a charge of $117 million, or 14
cents a diluted share. Excluding those charges, the company would
have reported a third-quarter profit of $40 million, or 7 cents a
diluted share, which beat Wall Street expectations of 1 cent a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, computer chip sales tumbled 14 percent to $1.8
billion from $2.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's stock, which closed Monday before earnings were
released, fell $1.4375, or 3.6 percent, to $38.5625.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much of a mixed picture for the chip industry right
now,'' said Jeff Weir, a spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Financial troubles in Asia, where American companies sell 30
percent of their products, have caused dramatic drops in sales.
Also, competitors in the region have slashed prices as they
struggle to weather the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has tied its woes to the Asian economic crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, the Asian economy and slowing of global economic
growth have impacted Motorola since earlier this year, just as
those factors are now readily apparent and affecting many other
global corporations,'' Chief Executive Christopher Galvin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the financial pressure are prices for memory chips,
which store the information on a computer, which have fallen more
than 70 percent over the past year. While an oversupply of the
chips means good news for consumers, it's bad news for
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony for all the memory companies is that the demand for
memory products continues to grow, but as long as there's so many
on the market the price won't grow,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   While it's uncertain whether many factors plaguing the
semiconductor industry will persist next year, observers remain
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners In-Stat Group, a Scottsdale semiconductor research
organization, expects the industry to grow 10 percent, despite all
the dire warnings issued by companies about lower sales and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas of growth that will buoy semiconductor growth
rates for a period of time beginning with fourth quarter of this
year,'' Cahners In-Stat wrote in its September report.
</P>
<P>
   While problems will continue for Japan, South Korea and other
Asian countries, In-Stat noted that U.S. high-tech exports to China
through the first half of 1998 grew 50 percent compared with the
same period last year. Exports to Mexico, Costa Rica and Venezuela
also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Weir shrugged off Motorola's drop in profits, saying what
happened in its third quarter doesn't dictate what will happen next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation for a strong growth market is shared by all
the companies. The only question is when it will happen, not if it
will happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the forecasts, it will be six to eight months before
Arizona suppliers like SpeedFam International Inc. and others feel
relief, Feldhan said. &QL;

HMO DRUG DEAL HAS SIDE-EFFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Two California legislators have asked the state
Department of Corporations to investigate a deal in which a New
York pharmaceutical firm would pay managed care giant Foundation
Health Systems Inc. $1 million a month to give preference to its
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The call for action stems from a proposed deal in which Health
Net, Foundation's main HMO, would instruct doctors to select
Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs when prescribing medicine for patients
in five therapeutic categories. The categories range from high
cholesterol to bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the drug maker would pay a Foundation subsidiary
that manages pharmaceutical purchases a fee of $1 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan were enacted, physicians treating Health Net members
still could prescribe nonpreferred drugs, but the medicine would be
paid for by the health plan only if approved by appeals group
within the managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   In separate letters, California state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal,
D-Van Nuys, and Assemblywoman Liz Figueroa, D-Fremont, criticized
the Department of Corporations for statements made by its staff
that the department has no authority to look into such matters.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Rosenthal said the department was ``turning its
back'' on existing law in its failure to ``remedy and investigate
this violation'' of the state Health and Safety Code, which
stipulates that medical decisions must be unhampered by economic
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said in her letter that deals such as the one proposed
between Squibb and Foundation are ``precisely the kind of thing the
DOC is supposed to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no clearer example of a deal in which the
economic incentives that benefit individual companies work to the
express disadvantage of patients,'' Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial arrangement, which has not been enacted, is
the latest version of a practice known as rebating, in which
pharmaceutical companies compensate health care groups for making
high-volume purchases of their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Corporations spokeswoman said the agency is
studying deals like the Squibb-Foundation arrangement, but must
wait until those companies submit their proposal for government
approval to take action on it specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Yukelson, a spokesman for Foundation, said terms of the
proposed deal have changed significantly since the draft outline
was written in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal in the draft is not the deal that will be executed,''
Yukelson said. Among changes made is that while Squibb drugs will
remain the preferred product in their categories, they will not be
the only drugs available to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yukelson said Foundation expected the proposed deal to raise
eyebrows but has moved forward because ultimately the arrangement
should benefit patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it'd be controversial,'' Yukelson said. ``But dollars
aside, we think we're doing the right thing.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Randy Moss may not be Deion Sanders, but the
Minnesota Vikings' magnificent rookie receiver proved Monday night
that he is a prime-time player extraordinaire.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a battle of NFC Central unbeatens, Minnesota quarterback
Randall Cunningham outplayed Green Bay's Brett Favre as the Vikings
shocked the Packers 37-24 to end Green Bay's 25-game winning streak
at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   In a thunderstorm before 59,849 rain-soaked fans, Cunningham and
Moss showed the NFL something old and something new by putting on
one of the great shows in the history of Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham continues to excel in place of injured starter Brad
Johnson, completing 20 of 32 passes for 442 yards and four
touchdowns. Cunningham's passing yards were the most ever against
Green Bay, surpassing the 411 put up by San Francisco's Joe Montana
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Stars are born on Monday nights in the NFL, and few will shine
brighter in their prime-time debut than Moss, the controversial No.
1 draft choice who caught five passes for 190 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 205-pound Moss exasperated Green Bay's defensive backs,
especially cornerback Travis Williams. When Williams was able to
cover Moss, he couldn't jump with him and he wasn't strong enough
to take the ball away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot of criticism, and lot of people want me to
fail, but I think I turned a lot of heads tonight,'' Moss said.
``There's no room on this bandwagon for all the people who want to
climb on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going deep was in our plan. I was hungry for the ball, and
when it was in my vicinity, I'm going to get my hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (4-1) goes only as far as Favre can take it. In this
game, he couldn't take the Packers far enough, turning in one of
the worst games of his career. He was 13-of-23 passing for just 114
yards.
</P>
<P>
   This night belonged to Cunningham, who has resurrected his
career and who ignited the Vikings (5-0) to 542 yards total offense
against one of the NFL's best defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall was outstanding,'' Minnesota coach Dennis Green said.
``He throws a great deep ball. It cuts through the wind. He can
beat a deep zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to take advantage of their man coverage. Randall got
great pass protection. He didn't even have to scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half alone, Cunningham was 13-of-19 for 282 yards
and three touchdowns, connecting on touchdown passes of 56 yards to
Jake Reed, 52 to Moss and 24 to running back Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an incredible number of passing yards,'' Packers coach
Mike Holmgren said. ``We just couldn't stop them. Their wide
receivers did a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers didn't score an offensive touchdown in the first two
quarters. Ryan Longwell kicked a 40-yard field goal, and Roell
Preston returned a kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and Moss entertained the national television audience
and frustrated the Packers' defensive backs, who for the most part
provided good coverage and still got embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Moss had three catches for 100 yards and a 52-yard touchdown
catch in the first half. He also had a 75-yard touchdown reception
called back because of a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Moss' touchdown _ his fifth of the season _ he was covered
well by Williams, but Moss outjumped the defender to make the
catch. Then, he pulled away from safety Darren Sharper to score the
touchdown that made it 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   With five minutes left in the first half, Moss caught a 41-yard
bomb down the left sideline. Two plays later, Cunningham threw a
short screen pass to Smith over the middle. Smith evaded the
Packers and turned it into a 24-yard touchdown and a 24-10 halftime
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings shut down Green Bay's running game. The only way the
Packers gained any yards on the ground was on draw plays to Travis
Jervey, their special-teams standout.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-10, the Packers reached Minnesota's 34. On first
down, Favre was hit as he threw, and his floater over the middle
was intercepted by Orlando Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham returned the favor by fumbling at the Minnesota 44,
but the Vikings stuffed Green Bay's running game three times for
less than a yard and Minnesota responded when Smith scored on a
screen pass to make it 24-10 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Two Gary Anderson field goals around a Robert Griffith
interception of a Favre pass in the end zone pushed the Vikings
safely out front 30-10.
</P>
<P>
   On the Packers' next series, Favre threw his third interception,
this one also going to Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got outplayed,'' Favre said. ``The conditions were
terrible, but they handled it and we didn't. That's kind of
frustrating. We have no one to blame but ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 37-10, Favre was replaced by Doug Pederson, who threw an
11-yard touchdown pass to Tyrone Davis. After the Packers got the
onside kick, Pederson passed 16 yards to Bill Schroeder to finish
the scoring in the final minute.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A day of reflection, soul-searching and wondering what might have
been didn't change the reality of the Astros' situation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their season is still over, and the mere thought of it is just
as painful as it was Sunday night when they watched the San Diego
Padres celebrate the Division Series victory that sent the Astros
into what figures to be a gut-wrenching offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a man, they said their team was good enough to reach
the World Series. But if they want to go this year, they'll need
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it so tough is that this wasn't a mediocre team,''
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez said. ``Getting knocked out the way we
did would be like the (Chicago) Bulls getting knocked out in the
first round of the playoffs. I guess you could say we choked; you
could call it anything you want to call it, because we lost. I
really feel like we had the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the reference to the Bulls was a bit much. When last we
checked, the Astros had not won six championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're like the Bulls in the beginning,'' left fielder
Moises Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell. But a second straight fast break from the
playoffs had some of the Astros feeling like also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're no different than the Florida Marlins,'' said
pitcher Jose Lima, who won 16 games during the regular season but
never took the mound during the playoffs. ``The Marlins lost 100
games, and we won 100 games, but right now we're the same. We're
both going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was devastating. I know there's no crying in baseball,
but last night was only the second time I've ever cried because of
baseball (the other time was when he pitched a no-hitter at the
Class AAA level). I feel like we went all the way to San Diego for
nothing _ to get beat. This will stay with us for a while. We had
the best club in the league, but we failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros needed a victory Sunday to force a decisive fifth
game at the Astrodome on Monday night. Most of the players dropped
by the Dome on Monday, but it wasn't to get ready for one of the
biggest games in franchise history. It was to clean out their
lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real disappointing to come into this clubhouse and see
everything so empty,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   Added second baseman Craig Biggio: ``I really wish we could have
brought the series back to our fans in Houston, because I really
think they would have been fired up for this one. These guys
(people in San Diego) were kind of down on our fans in Houston, but
I really think it would have been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Astros who don't live in Houston during the
offseason won't be able to leave town until the end of the week
because they have so many loose ends to tie up. Forgive them if
they didn't expect their season to end so abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock,'' reliever Doug Henry said as he cleared
out his locker. ``I didn't even consider this (getting knocked out
in the first round) a possibility. This might have been easier to
take if we had made it to the second round, but this is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Making things even more difficult to accept was the Astros'
belief that they were better than the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be embarrassed,'' center fielder Carl Everett said.
``We got beat by a team that was a lot older and a lot slower.
Their bones are breaking. They basically crawled onto the field and
beat us. It's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much talent. We were the feared team, and no one
wanted to play us. The way we played, we deserved to go home. What
you do in the regular season means nothing in the playoffs. It
comes down to whichever team wants it the most. They wanted it
more, and that's why they're going on and we're packing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though they were packing to go their separate ways _
only to see each other again at spring training in Kissimmee, Fla.,
come February _ it still was hard for the Astros to believe their
season was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't hit me until I woke up this morning and there
was no game to go to,'' Alou said. ``If we keep this team together,
I think we have a chance to do it again next season. But for now,
we just have to accept the fact that we didn't make it. We don't
like it, but we have to accept it.''

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ As several of its members
observed, Monday's debate and votes in the House Judiciary
Committee marked only the third time in the nation's history that
impeachment of a President has been formally considered on Capitol
Hill. In that limited sense, the approval of a full-scale
impeachment process was historic. But it was by no means decisive,
no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed. It was only a
first short step along a rocky road whose length is not known. By
R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-WATERGATE (Washington) _ On Jan. 31, 1974, at the end of
a session similar to the one Monday, the House Judiciary Committee
voted unanimously to recommend to the full House that an
impeachment inquiry against President Richard M. Nixon be
authorized. At first blush, this looks like a paragon of
bipartisanship. And that is the way many Judiciary Committee
members Monday referred to the Nixon proceedings. But the truth is
that although the Judiciary Committee back then may have been a bit
more temperate than the panel was Monday, its deliberations in 1974
were frequently angry and highly partisan. By David E. Rosenbaum.

<P>
   EMBASSY-BOMBER (Moroni, Comoros Islands) _ Nearly two months
after the bombings of the American embassy in Kenya and Tanzania, a
picture of those charged in the case is slowly emerging. They
hailed from different countries, labored in various professions but
shared a devotion to radical Islam and a striking ability to keep
family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors
charge were their true activities. Comoran officials are
embarrassed that Abdallah Mohammed Fazul (who was indicted in the
United States under the name ``Haroun Fazil,'' an alias he
apparently used in Kenya) has turned the world's eyes on them. But
they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his
tropical nation -- poverty, Islam, racism, and French colonialism.

   RUSSIA-HUMOR (Moscow) _ It's drive time, and Muscovites are
heading home after another day of crisis. After the news, all of it
bad, an ad comes on the radio. ``The ruble is falling,'' says the
cheerful voice from a private dental clinic, ``but with us, at
least your teeth will stay in place.'' The next ad urges
crisis-weary listeners to get away from it all and book a Turkish
vacation, now just a dream for what was once Moscow's middle class.
The music starts again. The first song, sponsored by a cellular
phone company now battling to hold on to its newly poor clientele,
is ``Sacrifice'' by Elton John. So goes another crisis in Russia, a
time when people dip into deep national reserves of fatalism and
retrieve a special mix of resolve and self-deprecating humor that
thrives best when things go wrong. By Celestine Bohlen.

it is important to preserve as many species as possible. But the

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
GERRY Hunsicker stood in a place just down the hallway from where
the San Diego Padres were enjoying spontaneous champagne baths and
tried so hard not to linger over the taste of sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the man who so shrewdly built the
Astros into NL Central champs had watched them come apart like a
paper kite in a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a special offensive talent this club demonstrated all
year, to come into this series and get shut down, not just by Kevin
Brown but by every other pitcher on their staff, that's, well,
ironic,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic. Anemic. Lethargic. Pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your insult, heave it into the crowd like a hand grenade,
and you will surely hit a deserving target:
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Derek Bell _ the Killer Breeze _
who've come up with a collective eight hits in 78 official at-bats
in two playoff seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou, who hit his last home run Aug. 24 and failed to
deliver a single RBI in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus, who couldn't get the tying run home from third base
in the top of the seventh inning Sunday, thereby forcing manager
Larry Dierker to lift ace Randy Johnson for a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, for staying with Ausmus in that situation after two
previous whiffs in the game and then seeing him take a called
strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Berry, for his throwing error in the bottom of the sixth
that opened the door for the Padres to take a 2-1 lead and
eventually the series.
</P>
<P>
   There are, indeed, more goats than at a tin-can buffet. But it
says here that these Astros are not incapable of winning in the
playoffs. They just don't know how, and the failure is more in
their personal makeup than in any lack of skills.
</P>
<P>
   This is a collection of individuals _ led by Biggio and Bagwell
_ who spend so much of their time trying to keep their emotions
bottled up on and off the field that when playoff time arrives, the
cork remains stuck in their bottle. The addition of Alou from the
1997 world champion Marlins was supposed to change that, but he
instead became simply one more part of the bland Astros recipe
rather than stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must decide,'' Hunsicker said, ``whether it was just one of
those things and chalk it up to their great pitching and our
untimely slump. Or are there flaws, and it took the postseason to
bring them out? Do we have the right mix?''
</P>
<P>
   Proper chemistry, in the lab and on the playing fields, is
everything. Look no further in this town than the years immediately
preceding the Rockets' championships of 1994 and 1995, when many
dissatisfied customers wanted management to trade Hakeem Olajuwon
and start anew.
</P>
<P>
   But shooting the horse doesn't make him run faster. You change
the jockey, or you employ a new tactic. In the case of the Rockets,
they found young spark plugs in Robert Horry and Sam Cassell and a
veteran in Mario Elie to supplement the core of a contender, and
confetti soon rained down from the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   For a parallel in baseball, go back two decades to the
Philadelphia Phillies, who had an every-day lineup that included
Mike Schmidt, Greg Luzinski, Garry Maddox, Larry Bowa and Bob
Boone. That team lost three straight years in the National League
Championship Series from 1976 to 1978 before finally winning a
World Series title in 1980. Schmidt, now a Hall of Famer, openly
admitted ``choking'' in the heat of the playoffs. That team was
never gutted but eventually added a firebrand named Pete Rose, who
showed it the path to the top.
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros this offseason, Hunsicker says, ``Priority No. 1,
priority No. 2 and priority No. 3 are re-signing Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   It's different from a year ago, when the hard decision was how
much to invest in Darryl Kile. Johnson is a proven commodity with a
10-1 regular-season record for the Astros and two playoff outings
that were belied by an undeserving 0-2 record. His return would
give the Astros the swagger they'll need to repeat their 102-win
season.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who can request a trade, says he wants to stay and finish
the job. The Astros must tell him that job is to do more than live
in a quiet corner of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Make a regular place in the lineup for Richard Hidalgo. Settle
on an every-day third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Try to get Bagwell and Biggio to open up and embrace the
situation and stop trying to keep their own celebrity and
leadership responsibilities at an arm's length. Then stay the
course.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after, when you're surrounded by smoldering
ashes, it's easy to recall the fire but more prudent to remember
what you've built in the first place.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The season ended Sunday night for the Astros' players, but the work
is just beginning for general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His list of offseason chores includes:
</P>
<P>
   Trying to convince free-agent-to-be Randy Johnson to re-sign
with the Astros. Hunsicker already has told the Big Unit and his
agent that the Astros are interested in discussing a new contract,
but Johnson intends to sort out his options with his wife over the
next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, Cleveland, Anaheim, Arizona, San Francisco and
Colorado also are expected to pursue Johnson, but the Astros have
exclusive negotiating rights with him until 15 days after the
completion of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is in their court,'' Hunsicker said of Johnson's
status. ``They know how we feel. I suspect that in the coming days,
I'll make a call to them if I haven't heard from them before
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Moises Alou and discussing whether the All-Star
left fielder intends to return to the Astros next season or
exercise an option in his contract that allows him to demand a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Alou has said his first season in Houston was a happy one, but
there are indications he might asked to be traded to Los Angeles if
his father, Felipe, is hired to manage the Dodgers. The Astros are
not obligated to trade Alou, but if they deny his request, he could
become a free agent March 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel like I (want to return to the Astros),''
Alou said. ``That's just a gut feeling I had (Sunday) night. I
couldn't leave this place losing. I want to leave winning. I told
Gerry that there are a few delicate issues that I'd like to talk
about, and he said he'd be willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not a main topic. If I use my option to leave, money
won't be the reason. Sure, everyone wants to get paid, but my
decision won't be based on getting a better salary. Hopefully, they
want me to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou would not elaborate on the ``delicate issues,'' although he
has said in the past that he wants to be sure the Astros are
committed to being competitive over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker seems optimistic Alou will be wearing an Astros
uniform next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's signed for the next three years,'' Hunsicker said. ``Mo
has indicated to me that he wants to talk about a few things _
things we can do to make it better around here. He hasn't given me
any indication that he's unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Formulating an alternative plan in the event Johnson decides to
play elsewhere. Without Johnson, the Astros are right where they
were before they traded for him July 31 _ a team with good pitching
but no bona fide ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to try to put a competitive team on the
field,'' Hunsicker said. ``Even if we don't re-sign Randy, we don't
feel pressure to sign someone like him, because we feel like we
have a quality product on the field even if we don't re-sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson isn't re-signed, expect the Astros to at least
inquire about potential free agents Kevin Brown, Al Leiter and Todd
Stottlemyre. And don't rule out Roger Clemens, who might ask to be
traded from Toronto if he isn't convinced the Blue Jays have a
chance to compete for a championship next season. The Astros and
Rangers are at the top of Clemens' wish list.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays likely would want three or four front-line players
in exchange for Clemens. Nevertheless, you can bet the Astros would
explore the possibility of acquiring him if he became available.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the budget with owner Drayton McLane Jr. The Astros
spent close to $42 million on players this season, and that figure
will increase significantly if they keep the nucleus of the team
together. Center fielder Carl Everett, shortstop Ricky Gutierrez
and pitchers Jose Lima, Sean Bergman and Jay Powell are
arbitration-eligible, and each figures to get a nice raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be meeting in the next week or so on the
budget,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an every-day spot in the outfield for Richard Hidalgo,
who split time with Everett for most of the season. Everett and
Hidalgo will come cheaper than Alou and Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Astros have financial constraints, it's likely the
1999 starting outfield will consist of Everett, Hidalgo and either
Alou or Bell. Of course, that won't be an issue if Alou demands a
trade and the Astros grant his request.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, this is going to be the most challenging offseason
we've had since I've been here,'' said Hunsicker, who joined the
Astros before the 1996 season. ``There are certainly more issues to
begin the offseason. Major issues.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Football season can begin now.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros team that captured this city's imagination showed
none. The bats that for six months split the air with sharp cracks
broke. The smart management and managerial moves that made the
Astros look like World Series material were left in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had high expectations for us. Sure, they should have
had those expectations,'' Astros ace Randy Johnson said. ``We were
good enough to go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros went home, quickly. And the worst thing about
their collapse in the Division Series loss to the San Diego Padres
might not have been that it happened.
</P>
<P>
   We are, after all, Houston. We know playoff disappointments the
way we know highway construction _ it's always there, always
irritating, always testing our nerves. And just when it looks like
we finally can step on the pedal and go places, some numbskull cuts
us off. We knew this could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Brad Ausmus willingly pointed the finger, so to
speak, at himself for Sunday's series-deciding loss. Ausmus did
everything but call himself a numbskull after a poor at-bat and
strikeout in a critical bases-loaded situation in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Give the man credit for one thing. Ausmus struck out three
times, knew he messed up with the game on the line and stood there
and took the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one argued with him, but know this: The worst thing about
this collapse was not one at-bat, one decision or one game. The
worst thing was that it all happened with such a wicked fury and
spirited team futility.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a slow slide from the top of the mountain, a subtle
slip here or an unlucky misstep there. It was a headlong leap. It
was chin up, chest out, the Astros standing arm-in-arm at the top
of the world, then jumping and crashing to the ground together.
</P>
<P>
   All for one, Padres in four.
</P>
<P>
   If it were football, the Astros' regular season was like Oilers
35, Bills 3. And you remember what happened in the rest of that
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that we do everything big in Texas. We win big. We
build up big hopes. We swing big and miss big. We make big trades
and have big seasons. We lose the ball in the lights big. We crash
big.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost it. Big. Arm-in-arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this team was good enough to go to the World
Series,'' Ausmus said. ``We didn't get any breaks and never made
the plays at the crucial times. We didn't come through at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of a game-winning single by Bill Spiers in Game 2,
Ausmus was right. He merely missed one opportunity in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   For the series, how many did Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and
Derek Bell miss? The 8-for-78 at the plate by the Killer B's over
the past two postseasons will be a staggering statistic that hangs
over their heads until they drastically change their playoff fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou _ Mo Baseball _ was less than himself, too, winding
up in the middle of a pair of critical plays in this series. Alou
missed a blooper in Game 4 that led to the Padres' go-ahead run. He
also got rung up at third base on a great throw from Tony Gwynn in
Game 3, helping quash a potential big inning in that loss.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson was good, very good, but not The Difference
everyone expected. The defense was average, which rarely is enough
in the playoffs, and the throwing error by Sean Berry on Sunday
helped seal the Astros' fate.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen, so often the team's salvation during the regular
season, was more Salvation Army _ in a giving mood _ against the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Even the gut-feeling decisions of manager Larry Dierker that had
been so reliable throughout the year left an empty feeling in
everyone's stomach, especially his own, this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker will replay this series over and over again in his mind,
second-guessing himself. He will wonder why he didn't pinch-hit for
Ausmus in Game 4. He will wonder about lineups and pitching
rotations and if there was anything he could have done that might
have taken some pressure off the B's or helped them find a playoff
groove.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing Dierker or the Astros do now will change what
happened in 1998. It was a great season for the team but a great
team collapse in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This year is over. We can move on now to our usual rites of
autumn _ tailgating, Friday-night football, wondering what the
Cowboys will do next, wondering when the Longhorns will find a
defense and the Aggies an offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe we're done,'' Ausmus said. ``It would be
good if we can keep this team together. Not only will it make us
better in terms of experience but because of what we went through
in this series. Because of the way we didn't play the way we were
capable of playing, we'll be a lot hungrier next year. We could be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Another rite of autumn _ maybe next year.

CLINTON-LEWINSKY SCANDAL MAY AID STATE GOP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal is likely to have a
profound effect on close election races in California _ and
Republicans are poised to reap the benefits, according to a new
Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll predicts that 44 percent of eligible adults will vote
in the November general election, in which close margins could
decide contests for governor, U.S. Senate and at least eight
congressional seats. But Democrats appear more likely to sit the
election out, while Republicans appear more fired up about voting
because of the Lewinsky revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican anger translates into a greater intensity and
intention to vote than the Democrats, who are hoping for the best
and trying to hang on for the next two years,'' Field Poll Director
Mark DiCamillo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll marks the first detailed look at the most tantalizing
question about the crucial November election _ how the
scandal-saturated atmosphere in Washington will affect voters 3,000
miles away in the nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   For months, both Republicans and Democrats have been gathering
thousands of volunteers for get-out-the-vote efforts to counter
anticipated fallout from the Clinton affair. Those efforts have
been more difficult because there is no hot-button issue this year
that is likely to swell voter interest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the poll predicts that 9.1 million voters out of a
total 20.7 eligible will cast ballots in California on November 3.
Four years ago, 47 percent _ or 8.9 million voters out of 18.9
million eligible _ voted.
</P>
<P>
   But because there is a greater likelihood that Republicans will
turn out at the polls, ``it looks like (California) Republicans
have a chance to carve into the present 29-to-23 (Democratic)
advantage in the House,'' DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans on the voter rolls, 45 percent
to 37 percent. But with the election less than a month away,
Republicans gain about 3 percentage points among those who say they
plan to vote, DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Among demographic groups, the most likely voters are white,
college-educated and over 60, the survey found. Least likely voter
groups include Latinos, those with high school educations or less
and 18-to-29-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 in 5 likely voters said the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
will be a factor. Statewide, 31 percent said it has made them more
likely to vote for Republican congressional candidates; 28 percent
said they are more likely to vote Democratic _ a three-point
Republican advantage. But 41 percent still say it will not affect
their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted September 27 through October 4 among a
statewide sample of 916 registered voters, of whom 644 were
determined likely to vote in November. The margin of error for the
survey ranges from plus or minus 3 to 7 percentage points. The
findings reflect some of the same trends in voter turnout elsewhere
in the nation, said Curtis Gans of the Center for the Study of the
American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   He said California enjoyed an upswing in voter participation in
June _ much of it largely attributed to two controversial ballot
measures, Propositions 226 and 227. But there's no guarantee that
activism seen particularly among California labor and Latino voters
will hold in November, especially now that the Lewinsky scandal has
blown up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (voters) will say, `A pox on all your houses,''' and will
sit the election out, disgusted by the antics in Washington, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in these uncharted waters, there's also possibility of
backfire, that if ``Republicans may keep making pronouncements''
and are perceived as partisan bullies, voters will get fired up and
send them a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see about 70 percent chance of the former happening and
about 30 percent of the latter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the last day for voters to register for the November
election, ending the intensive search by both parties for new
members.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find new Latino Republicans, GOP volunteers
looked through county records for house purchases showing Hispanic
names, said Mike Madrid, the party's political director.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid said these voters he dubbed ``Volvo Latinos'' tend to
become Republicans because they are newly concerned about issues
like taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the effort largely focused in the San Fernando, San
Gabriel and Southbay regions of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid said the GOP was losing the registration war with
Democrats until mid-August, when Clinton made his confession speech
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only at that point did we see increases in Republican numbers
in the 20 largest counties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have sought new members at federal ceremonies to
swear in new citizens. Madrid said Republicans are getting about 40
percent of the new voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, helped by absentee ballot drives by organized labor,
have also done door-to-door registration to target likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thousands of people out this weekend to get out the
vote,'' said Democratic campaign strategist Bob Mulholland. ``We've
already called 700,000 households. We're working on the people who
vote Democratic in the base areas to make sure they vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland said the Lewinsky scandal hasn't changed the major
efforts. ``We always worry,'' he said. ``That's why we're
working.''

PANEL OKS IMPEACHMENT PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee voted along party
lines Monday to recommend a presidential impeachment inquiry for
only the third time in U.S. history, after a daylong debate over
the intentions of the Founding Fathers, the lessons of Watergate
and the significance of extramarital sex.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 21 Republican members of the committee voted in
favor of the resolution to begin open-ended impeachment hearings
modeled after the proceedings that drove President Richard Nixon
from office a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   All 16 Democrats voted against the measure. A pair of amendments
offered by Democrats to limit the length and scope of the inquiry
were defeated, also on party-line votes. The full House is expected
to vote on the resolution as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that the debate would be marred by partisan
bickering, the nine-hour session was marked by sober comments from
Republicans and Democrats regarding the historic task before the
committee and their near-unanimous declaration that Clinton
committed a grave error by concealing a sexual affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debate revealed a deep partisan divide over the
seriousness of Clinton's wrongdoings and provided a preview of the
arguments that are certain to be heard repeatedly over the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we now know, do we have a duty to look further
or to look away?'' Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., asked as he gaveled
the committee to order in the same ornate committee room where
articles of impeachment were approved against Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Republican after Republican chastised Clinton for the gravity of
his deception and his betrayal of the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer
on the American presidency,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., evoking
images of presidential aide John Dean's famous line about the Nixon
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than defend Clinton's behavior, Democrats insisted that
his transgressions, though wrong, do not warrant the first
impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson's in 1868. Johnson was
impeached by the House for firing a Cabinet official, but was
acquitted by the Senate. Nixon, who was charged with obstruction of
justice and conspiracy following the break-in at the Watergate
office complex, resigned before the House had a chance to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate; it is an extramarital affair,'' said
Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the committee's ranking Democrat. ``The
drafters (of the Constitution) might shake their heads in
puzzlement at the action that is proposed by the majority that we
take here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention the committee's proceedings in a brief
appearance before reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.
He was accompanied by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., whose
support will be critical as the White House tries to counter the
impeachment push in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even as polls suggest that Americans are tiring of the
9-month-old scandal, the committee hearing was high drama in
Washington, which is normally consumed at this time of year with
last-minute budget deals as lawmakers race home to campaign for
re-election. The hallway outside the packed committee room was
crowded with reporters, camera crews and curiosity seekers hoping
for a glimpse of the proceedings, which were broadcast live on
several cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's 37 members sat through the entire
proceedings. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, glanced through a copy
of the ``Federalist Papers,'' while others read briefing papers and
fought off yawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be better off if we spent more time reading what
George Mason and James Madison said to each other than what Ms.
Lewinsky and (Linda) Tripp said to each other,'' Lofgren said when
it was her turn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered a pair of amendments _ one that would have
provided a November 25 deadline for the impeachment inquiry and
another that would have limited its scope to the matters contained
in the report submitted by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Both
were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after a scathing assessment of Clinton's behavior
by the GOP's chief counsel, David Schippers, who cited
``substantial and credible evidence'' of 15 grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The counts closely parallel the counts in the Starr report,
although they dropped what most legal experts had said were Starr's
weakest contentions: that Clinton had obstructed justice by
asserting executive privilege and by refusing to testify before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the counts relate to giving ``false testimony under
oath'' in the Paula Jones civil case and before Starr's federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers argued that ``the subject matter of the underlying
case, whether civil or criminal, and the circumstances under which
the testimony is given, are of no significance whatsoever. It is
the oath itself that is sacred and must be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that every witness in every case must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is the foundation
of the American system of justice which is the envy of every
civilized nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' chief attorney, Abbe Lowell, said the GOP was
working under the mistaken impression ``that there is some kind of
equal sign between a violation by a president of any of a number of
laws in statute books on one side, and the impeachment provisions
of Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the precedents differently and see that initiation of
an impeachment process for only the third time in American history
takes a far higher threshold than simply making a laundry list of
laws a president might have violated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is known for its partisan differences,
and a straight party-line vote is unlikely before the full House,
where it is expected that between 15 and 50 Democrats will join
Republicans later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their partisan reputations, members of the committee
avoided the acrimony that had been evident during news conferences
in the days leading up to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, chairman Hyde defended his sense of due process by
saying: ``It's like pornography; you know it when you see it, but
you have trouble defining it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure I knew pornography when I saw it until I got a
chance to read the (Starr) report,'' interrupted Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., to laughter from both sides.

CLINTON PLEADS FOR IMF ACTION TO STOP CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual appearance before a group of finance
ministers from 22 industrialized and developing nations, President
Clinton pressed for action Monday to arrest what could be the most
dangerous global economic slide since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also released a study showing that California
has been hit hard by the crisis, with exports to Asia falling 11
percent from the first quarter of last year to the first three
months of this year. California is the nation's biggest exporter to
Asia, accounting for more than one-fourth of U.S. shipments to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is urging world leaders to adopt a U.S.
proposal for an emergency lending fund to stop the financial storm
from toppling Brazil and the rest of South America _ an even bigger
market for U.S. exports _ and threatening the long-running U.S.
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But while limousines clog the streets around the IMF's
headquarters and the world's finance ministers and central bankers
float competing ideas about reforming the world's ``financial
architecture,'' no consensus on concrete action has emerged from
the top-level IMF meetings now under way in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``every leading industrial economy has a role to
play,'' Clinton touched on two big stumbling blocks: Congress'
refusal to approve more money for the IMF, and Japan's inability to
stimulate its economy, now in its worst postwar recession, and to
shore up its banking system, which is staggering under at least $1
trillion in bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   After saying nothing all summer as the world economic turmoil
spread, Clinton is now trying to seize the initiative, speaking out
three times in the past three weeks. Clinton plans to address the
entire 182-member-nation IMF tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Washington itself seemed caught up in a surreal split between
domestic political upheaval at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue and
global economic meltdown at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Congress appears oblivious to the economic chaos _ very few
members, Democrat or Republican, have addressed the crisis _ and a
House coalition of conservatives and liberals is trying to block
IMF funding, saying the fund helped cause the chaos and is deaf to
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's inability to get House approval for an additional
$14.5 billion U.S. contribution _ which, combined with money from
181 other nations, would bolster IMF reserves by $90 billion _ has
undercut U.S. credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials from Japan and Europe said Clinton's proposed
emergency fund cannot get off the ground if the United States does
not bolster current IMF loan programs. The U.S. plan has so far
received only a promise from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations to ``explore'' the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plan would provide a preapproved line of
international credit, operated by the IMF, to help countries stave
off investor panics before their economies come under severe
stress. The proposed fund would be run by the IMF but would have
none of the conditions that the IMF attaches to its emergency loans
to countries such as Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia, which
are requested by countries only after they have run out of reserves
and are on the verge of default.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the fund would lend to countries such as Brazil that
run generally sound economic policies but have been hit by a sudden
withdrawal of funds from frightened investors since Russia's Aug.
17 default.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the foreign-exchange value of Brazil's currency, the
real, has been key to killing Brazil's once roaring hyperinflation.
Authorities there fear that its collapse would trigger a severe
investor panic and an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But defending the real in the face of unprecedented capital
flight has severely depleted Brazil's dollar reserves and forced
interest rates up to nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials Monday reiterated their commitment to providing
emergency loans to Brazil _ investors are expecting a $30 billion
package _ as soon as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announces
a package of budget cuts to address Brazil's huge fiscal deficit.
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said private creditors would
also have to take part in any rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is considered a linchpin because of South America's close
trade ties to the United States. U.S. exporters, from Silicon
Valley to the Midwest farm belt, have already been hit hard by a
steep falloff in demand for their products in Asia. If the
Brazilian economy buckles under withdrawals of investor funds, the
contagion would likely spread quickly to its neighbors and then
north to U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, events in Asia, Russia and Latin America are having a
direct impact on the prosperity of America's farmers, workers and
businesses,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration released the state-by-state impact of the
economic crisis Monday to pressure Congress to approve the IMF
funding. The study said 30 percent of total U.S. exports go to
Asia, including 40 percent of farm exports.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is already slowing sharply, hit by lower
corporate earnings, downturns in business and consumer confidence
and an emerging credit crunch as investors everywhere, including
U.S. banks, become more risk averse.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that a recession in the United States, the world's
biggest economy, would pull down Europe as well, igniting a
full-blown world recession. Without any economic engine left to
restart global growth, countries would find it extremely difficult
to regenerate domestic growth.

 &HT;    BOOK IS PREQUEL AND SEQUEL TO CASABLANCA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The Lisbon plane soared away from the dense,
swirling fog of Casablanca, up and into the night. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins what author Michael Walsh jokingly calls his
``literary suicide mission'' _ a novel that surrounds the events of
the 1942 classic film, ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``As Times Goes By'' (Warner Books, $25), is
both a sequel and a prequel to the film _ telling the story of what
happened both after and before the fateful three days when Rick and
Ilsa are so dramatically reunited and so sadly parted on the edge
of World War II. It will be published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was music critic for Time Magazine from 1981 through
1997, knows he now faces tough critics among the millions of movie
buffs who know by heart the film starring Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows `Casablanca.' Everybody loves `Casablanca,'''
said Walsh. So withering comparative reviews ``are a chance you
take when you get involved in a project like this. I expect my
former colleagues to be fair and accurate. You obviously take a
chance with a shared cultural myth like this. I hope the book
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who teaches journalism at Boston University, was
recruited to write the novel by Maureen Egen, the president of
Warner Books, which owns the rights to the film characters and to
any subsequent film to be made from ``As Time Goes By.'' Walsh said
Egen saw something in his earlier novel, ``Exchange Alley,'' that
``made her think I could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his book is destined to be a movie that will
inspire even more comparisons, the author said ``that's not my
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much harder row to hoe to make a movie 55 years later''
with the original characters still so set in the audience's mind,
said Walsh, 49, in a telephone interview. ``I had the easier job.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lingering intrigue of ``Casablanca'' involves the
film's unanswered questions: What are the ties between Rick, the
tough saloon keeper, and Sam, his enigmatic piano player? Does Ilsa
love Victor Laszlo, her husband and a Czech patriot dedicated to
freeing his homeland from Nazi occupation? And, of course, do Rick
and Ilsa ever see each other again after the plane disappears into
the foggy night, leaving Rick on the runway in Casablanca?
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Walsh has decided that Rick is a wanted, former
gangster from East Harlem whose real name is Yitzik Baline. The
East Harlem background explains why Sam, his best friend, is a
black man and the gangster past suggests why Rick can't return to
New York. Bogart played a lot of gangsters in other movies, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   And Laszlo's mission must be the assassination of Nazi Reinhard
Hydrich in Prague, the most significant act of the Czech resistance
during World War II. And who better than a streetwise gangster to
help plan a major ``hit?'' So naturally all the film's major
characters must be reunited in this dramatic conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   After being approached to write the book, Walsh said his initial
reaction was: ``What do I have to bring to the party?''
</P>
<P>
   He began to spin out ideas from the period and setting _ World
War II, Europe, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have an `Oh-my-God' reaction. I had a `Can I do
this?' reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a `Casablanca' cultist,'' he said. So he rented
the movie and decided there was enough material pointing in both
directions to do the book.
</P>
<P>
   Having the main characters already established made the writing
harder, he said. ``When you invent your own characters, ... you
have an initial rapport whith them. Taking other characters,
especially from a movie where their physical appearace was
determined by actors rather than imagined by the author, was a real
challenge. You're not only taking Rick and Ilsa but also Bogart and
Bergman and incorporating them into characters on the page.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay for ``Casablanca'' was a collaborative effort of
seven writers and was based on a 1940 play entitled ``Everybody
Comes to Rick's.'' Walsh resurrected one character, an American
named Lois Meridith, who was in the play but not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book is clearly evocative of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he hopes ``Casablanca'' fans ``will feel that I have
honored the integrity of the movie, taken care of the characters
while they were in my possession'' and that reading the book makes
them want to watch the movie yet again.

 &HT;    BOOK IS PREQUEL AND SEQUEL TO CASABLANCA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

   WASHINGTON _ ``The Lisbon plane soared away from the dense,
swirling fog of Casablanca, up and into the night. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins what author Michael Walsh jokingly calls his
``literary suicide mission'' _ a novel that surrounds the events of
the 1942 classic film, ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``As Times Goes By'' (Warner Books, $25), is
both a sequel and a prequel to the film _ telling the story of what
happened both after and before the fateful three days when Rick and
Ilsa are so dramatically reunited and so sadly parted on the edge
of World War II. It will be published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was music critic for Time Magazine from 1981 through
1997, knows he now faces tough critics among the millions of movie
buffs who know by heart the film starring Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows `Casablanca.' Everybody loves `Casablanca,'''
said Walsh. So withering comparative reviews ``are a chance you
take when you get involved in a project like this. I expect my
former colleagues to be fair and accurate. You obviously take a
chance with a shared cultural myth like this. I hope the book
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who teaches journalism at Boston University, was
recruited to write the novel by Maureen Egen, the president of
Warner Books, which owns the rights to the film characters and to
any subsequent film to be made from ``As Time Goes By.'' Walsh said
Egen saw something in his earlier novel, ``Exchange Alley,'' that
``made her think I could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his book is destined to be a movie that will
inspire even more comparisons, the author said ``that's not my
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much harder row to hoe to make a movie 55 years later''
with the original characters still so set in the audience's mind,
said Walsh, 49, in a telephone interview. ``I had the easier job.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lingering intrigue of ``Casablanca'' involves the
film's unanswered questions: What are the ties between Rick, the
tough saloon keeper, and Sam, his enigmatic piano player? Does Ilsa
love Victor Laszlo, her husband and a Czech patriot dedicated to
freeing his homeland from Nazi occupation? And, of course, do Rick
and Ilsa ever see each other again after the plane disappears into
the foggy night, leaving Rick on the runway in Casablanca?
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Walsh has decided that Rick is a wanted, former
gangster from East Harlem whose real name is Yitzik Baline. The
East Harlem background explains why Sam, his best friend, is a
black man and the gangster past suggests why Rick can't return to
New York. Bogart played a lot of gangsters in other movies, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   And Laszlo's mission must be the assassination of Nazi Reinhard
Hydrich in Prague, the most significant act of the Czech resistance
during World War II. And who better than a streetwise gangster to
help plan a major ``hit?'' So naturally all the film's major
characters must be reunited in this dramatic conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   After being approached to write the book, Walsh said his initial
reaction was: ``What do I have to bring to the party?''
</P>
<P>
   He began to spin out ideas from the period and setting _ World
War II, Europe, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have an `Oh-my-God' reaction. I had a `Can I do
this?' reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a `Casablanca' cultist,'' he said. So he rented
the movie and decided there was enough material pointing in both
directions to do the book.
</P>
<P>
   Having the main characters already established made the writing
harder, he said. ``When you invent your own characters, ... you
have an initial rapport whith them. Taking other characters,
especially from a movie where their physical appearace was
determined by actors rather than imagined by the author, was a real
challenge. You're not only taking Rick and Ilsa but also Bogart and
Bergman and incorporating them into characters on the page.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay for ``Casablanca'' was a collaborative effort of
seven writers and was based on a 1940 play entitled ``Everybody
Comes to Rick's.'' Walsh resurrected one character, an American
named Lois Meridith, who was in the play but not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book is clearly evocative of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he hopes ``Casablanca'' fans ``will feel that I have
honored the integrity of the movie, taken care of the characters
while they were in my possession'' and that reading the book makes
them want to watch the movie yet again.

ANTI-ENVIRO CONGRESS ON COLLISION COURSE WITH PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is playing ``chicken'' with the president and the
American public. The federal government is now running on borrowed
time. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. There would have
been a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 1, except that
Congress voted for a ``continuing resolution'' that supplies
emergency funding until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president submits his budget requests to
Congress in January and February. Congress has until mid-September
to consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   But this Congress is playing special-interest politics with
appropriations bills. As of Oct. 2, only four of 13 appropriations
bills had been passed. And at least three of the bills yet to be
voted into law have been threatened with a presidential veto
because of the anti-environmental riders attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, but
unless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, the
public can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995
_ with the closure of national parks, national monuments, public
buildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and the
federal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can pass
another continuing resolution so that the federal government
doesn't shut down on Oct. 10. More borrowed time. More political
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congress
realizes it might lose in its collision course with the president
and the American people. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip off
some of the anti-environmental riders he wrote that impact his
state.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, echoed Stevens, but
predicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be even
stronger and Republicans will get what they want then. Presumably,
the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping and
scraping the public lands after this election.
</P>
<P>
   But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collision
in this session? A number of powerful special-interest groups have
forked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: the
fishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companies
and agricultural interests. Approximately 50 anti-environmental
riders remain attached to various appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office of
the Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's public
relations offices and its congressional relations offices.
Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, didn't
like what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston received more than $100,000 in political campaign
contributions from oil and gas, construction and agricultural
industries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department of
Transportation appropriations bill contains a provision that would
allow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas,
national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Helicopters
are now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergency
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
sent a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the
Subcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee on
Appropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill and
promising a recommendation for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: ``This provision would
change fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlife
protections and visitor enjoyment in our `last frontier.' It
clearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent for
wilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the ``whopp, whopp, whopp'' of copter blades somewhere
just above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautiful
silence of the great wilderness areas. In cold, dense air the sound
of helicopter blades carries a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife _
disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds during
winter when they need to conserve their energy.
</P>
<P>
   And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?
Extractive industries searching for geological formations that
promise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters;
wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at key
locations; and those intrepid sightseers who want to view the
Denali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge
from the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to put
their feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whopp
away. And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exit
a quick and useful tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences of
the wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience _ the
Omnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains a
provision to sell off the people's park lands.
</P>
<P>
   Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of the
Interior to sell, lease, or issue use-permits for parcels of land
or structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with the
Cumberland Island National Seashore. The bill also would also allow
vehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interior
appropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because they
didn't want Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Max Baucus, D-Mont., to be successful in adding an amendment
that would remove a number of anti-environmental riders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill in
with several other appropriations measures to create a gigantic
funding bill that President Clinton could not veto without serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the political games continue.

   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials conceded Monday that they had
trusted private mental health centers to police themselves in a
Medicare program that ballooned from $60 million to $350 million in
five years, with rates of fraud and abuse as high as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built it, and they came,'' said Penny Thompson, a
government overseer, of the benefit program that spawned a network
of community health centers, especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who works for the Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency in charge of Medicare, told a
congressional hearing that after Medicare began offering outpatient
mental health benefits for the elderly, private providers rushed to
set up services and bill the federal government for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When government investigators began looking into a sample of
programs this year, they found that the mental health services
often amounted to no more than bingo, arts and crafts or other
social events that were billed to Medicare as intensive psychiatric
services.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes to bilk the government are especially prevalent in
Texas and Florida, which together account for more than half the
total billings in the outpatient mental health program, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just stunned that we've got another program that was able
to grow like a weed,'' said Rep. Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, who called
the House Commerce subcommittee hearing after two government
investigations discovered rampant abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black eye to the federal government to have a program
like this that's just grown totally out of control,'' said Barton.
He displayed a posted invitation from a Washington state retirement
home saying, ``Come join us for coffee, cookies, and conversation
... in the rec center'' with the word ``Free'' prominently
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The event was not free for the government, however. The facility
billed Medicare $1,300 for psychiatric services for the 35 to 40
attendees. Although that company has been assessed $45,000 in
penalties, few of the others involved in the practice have been
caught until now.
</P>
<P>
   Under lax procedures uncovered by the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services, the mental health centers
merely signed a form attesting that their services were eligible
for Medicare reimbursement and that their facility met local
certification requirements. Often, the doctors who diagnosed the
need for psychiatric treatment were employed by the centers that
offered the services.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department last week notified 20
centers in Texas, Florida and Louisiana that they are ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could say we'll terminate all of the offenders,''
said Thompson, but she said the department did not want to cause
disruption for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Barton, Thompson predicted that most of the 1,000
community mental health programs would be excluded from Medicare
funding by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thompson conceded that her department has known about
abuses in the mental health centers as far back as 1994. ``I think
it wasn't acted upon,'' she said, because other problems loomed so
much bigger in Medicare, whose overall spending for the year just
ended was $218 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much the outpatient mental health program will cost
after new safeguards are added, Thompson said ``much less'' than it
does now.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But she offered no specific amount, saying that her agency was
instituting a 10-point plan for better oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is not to develop estimates,'' she said. ``Our plan
is to implement the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Community mental health centers that were notified last week
that they do not qualify for Medicare participation include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Florida: Quality Care Mental Health Management in St.
Petersburg; Daylight of East Pasco, Inc. in Zephyrhills; Serenity
House of Volusia, Inc. in Daytona Beach, Advanced Counseling
Services, Advanced Counseling Services, Inc., in Coral Gables; and

Center, Ultimate Medical Center, Inc., Cutler Ridge Community
Health Center, Mutual Behavioral Health Care Center, Professional

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Every morning for four years, Debra Smith
swallowed two tiny pills, hoping they would help shield her from
the breast cancer that took her mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old thought she was taking tamoxifen, the drug being
tracked nationally in more than 13,000 women considered at high
risk for developing the disease. She was sure of it, because she
was experiencing hot flashes and other symptoms associated with the
medication.
</P>
<P>
   But last spring, amid the buzz about promising results, Smith
learned that she was among the half left holding a sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Smith said, shaking her head. ``Shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Weatherford resident plans to take part in the next
national trial designed to examine whether medication can help
prevent breast cancer. This time, tamoxifen will be measured
against raloxifene, a medication already used to combat
osteoporosis, the thinning and weakening of bones.

site for the tamoxifen study, will begin screening post-menopausal
women this month.
</P>
<P>
   Initial tamoxifen results showed that the drug reduced the risk
of developing breast cancer by 45 percent in 13,388 women. The
malignancy is the second-leading killer of American women, behind
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't understand how breast cancer develops, but the
recent medications build on one theory that estrogen plays an
underlying role.
</P>
<P>
   V. Craig Jordan, director of the Lynn Sage breast cancer
research program at Northwestern University Medical School,
predicts that one day a battery of prevention drugs will be
available, similar to today's arsenal of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of decreasing breast cancer incidence by
50 percent,'' said Jordan, who began studying tamoxifen in the late
1960s. ``That's huge. We go forward now to fine-tune this concept _
to be able to establish a standard prevention maintenance therapy
for women over the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Marino, chief of oncology at the University of North
Texas Health Science Center, takes a more cautious view.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, raloxifene research has primarily been focused
on osteoporosis, with breast cancer almost an afterthought. And
it's too early to know whether tamoxifen prevents breast cancer or
merely delays its onset, Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he would advise women at high risk to consider the drug.
``I think (researchers) are on to something,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Because osteoporosis also runs in Smith's family, she seized on
the news of the upcoming trial, which will enroll 22,000 women for
at least five years. She would not have qualified if her sugar pill
had been tamoxifen, because participants cannot have taken either
drug previously.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Leeper, a 52-year-old Hurst woman, has lost track of the
number of biopsies she has undergone since college. She has endured
so many, she said, ``It's like somebody else going in for a throat
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer has been diagnosed in Leeper's mother and two
aunts. But Leeper volunteers for drug trials _ first tamoxifen and
now raloxifene _ more in the hope that research will ease the path
for her 13-year-old daughter, Caitlin.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the initial tamoxifen results, the study was halted
14 months early; researchers didn't consider it ethical to continue
to keep half of the women from the promising findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news came with a catch. The women, ages 35 and
older, developed twice as many cases as the placebo group of
endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the uterus. Jordan
counters that the elevated risk is small.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes described as designer estrogens, the new medications
must serve a dual purpose. Ideally, they promote the good effects
of estrogen, such as strengthening bones, and reduce the potential
harm in other tissues such as breast and endometrial.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen is far from an unknown drug; it has been used for more
than two decades to treat breast cancer. Raloxifene has been
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Studies tracking more than 10,000 post-menopausal women taking
raloxifene for osteoporosis have shown a 54 percent reduction in
new breast cancers after an average of 33 months, according to drug
manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company. No increased endometrial cancer
risk has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollees at Tarrant County's site aren't charged for the drug
or related screening checkups, local M.D. Anderson officials said.
Minority enrollment is a priority; non-Anglo participants totaled
fewer than 4 percent nationwide in the tamoxifen trial.
</P>
<P>
   The women benefit from sharp-eyed medical care, said Smith, who
was sent several times straight from a checkup to get a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spring, Smith has also solved the question of her
mysterious side effects. She was entering early menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I felt like I had wasted my time,'' Smith said. ``I
know I didn't. They had to have some on the placebo to know whether
it works or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But she wouldn't have thrown her hat into this trial, she said,
if sugar pills were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky for 4 1/2 years,'' she said. ``I don't want to
push it any longer.''

TWO PROMISING DRUGS FOCUS OF BREAST CANCER STUDY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Every morning for four years, Debra Smith
swallowed two tiny pills, hoping they would help shield her from
the breast cancer that took her mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old thought she was taking tamoxifen, the drug being
tracked nationally in more than 13,000 women considered at high
risk for developing the disease. She was sure of it, because she
was experiencing hot flashes and other symptoms associated with the
medication.
</P>
<P>
   But last spring, amid the buzz about promising results, Smith
learned that she was among the half left holding a sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Smith said, shaking her head. ``Shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Weatherford resident plans to take part in the next
national trial designed to examine whether medication can help
prevent breast cancer. This time, tamoxifen will be measured
against raloxifene, a medication already used to combat
osteoporosis, the thinning and weakening of bones.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at M.D. Anderson Cancer Network-Tarrant County, also a
site for the tamoxifen study, will begin screening post-menopausal
women this month.
</P>
<P>
   Initial tamoxifen results showed that the drug reduced the risk

WHOLESOME IMAGE OF BUSH POSITIONS HIM AS THE ANTI-CLINTON FOR YEAR
2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Gov. George W. Bush, dressed in a blue denim shirt,
speaking conversationally in a softly lit room of brown paneling.
His topic is a visit to a Texas boot camp for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them about gangs and guns and drugs,'' Bush says of
his visits with the young offenders. A look of sadness passes
across his face. ``The most compelling story of all was a young man
who looked at me after all the discussion and said, `What do you
think of me?' It broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age when cynicism and politics are nearly synonymous, it
seemed the rarest of all things _ a genuinely poignant moment in a
political advertisement. Indeed, that ad in Bush's campaign for
re-election _ along with others that feature home-movielike images
of the popular Republican among the people _ almost positioned him
as the anti-Clinton, the personification of bedrock values at a
time when the president is chasing interns.
</P>
<P>
   It is that wholesome aura, as much as anything, that may have
vaulted Bush to a large lead in this year's race against Democrat
Garry Mauro, and into early front-runner status in the Republican
race for president two years hence. George W. Bush, the good guy,
the solid citizen, the real Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look as if it's the result of any particular
training. It just seems to be his personality,'' says George
Christian, former press secretary to Lyndon Johnson, whose
involvement in state politics spans 50 years. ``He doesn't take
himself seriously. He doesn't pontificate. He doesn't demagogue. I
mean, good Lord. Politicians everywhere would kill to have those
particular traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers, while insisting that he is now running for
governor alone, nonetheless smile at what Bush media consultant
Mark McKinnon calls ``the unusual collision of coincidence and
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on the night of Aug. 17, when Clinton gave his
disastrous address on the Monica Lewinsky matter, Bush ads running
almost simultaneously featured the governor in another casual
setting, speaking of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether for government or individuals,'' Bush said in the ad,
``I believe in accountability and responsibility. For too long
we've encouraged a culture that says if it feels good, do it, and
blame somebody else if you've got a problem. We've got to change
our culture to one based upon responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon says many assumed the responsibility ad was filmed that
morning to capitalize on Clinton's woes. In fact, McKinnon says,
the ad had been shot the previous April.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, all we were trying to do was strip away the
filters, instead of add them on, like you would with most other
politicians; to just show the human being,'' says McKinnon, the
architect of the Bush campaign ads in his race for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is so enamored. Mauro and his aides
challenge Bush on issues such as law and order, and HMOs, saying
Mauro's platform _ a patient's right to choose a physician, for
instance _ is more in tune with the average Texas voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's benefited from his family. The most popular person in
Texas is Barbara Bush,'' says Mauro campaign manager Billy Rogers.
``There's no doubt he's been fortunate to have this strong economy
that Clinton gave us, but Bush had nothing to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former State Republican Chairman Tom Pauken is one who predicts
Bush will win the Republican nomination for president in 2000. But
Pauken says he will choose to support either Republican millionaire
Steve Forbes, Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, or former Vice President
Dan Quayle, who come with stronger conservative credentials and a
better grasp of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the times I've been around him, I've never sensed a deep
interest in the issues, per se,'' Pauken says. ``It's more the
politics of personality, and that's where his strength is.''
</P>
<P>
   In any assessment of Bush's popularity, the governor's prominent
parents inevitably come up. President George Bush was often called
to task for political weaknesses, rarely for his integrity. Barbara
Bush ranks among history's most popular first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family is one of the premier families in America,''
Christian says. ``People like and respect his father and mother,
which certainly helps.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's grittier edge has often demonstrated itself in
his allegiance to family. While in the White House, President Bush
often called on his eldest son as a political trouble-shooter. In
that regard, George W. Bush has also been described as a ``pit
bull.'' In 1991, in the most commonly cited example, it was George
W. Bush who suggested that beleaguered White House chief of staff
John Sununu resign, a suggestion that Sununu quickly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   That edge has done little to dent Bush's popularity, even on
controversial political decisions. This year, despite an
international clamor for mercy, the governor declined to block the
execution of Texas Death Row inmate Karla Faye Tucker, a born-again
Christian. A few months later, Bush commuted the death sentence of
another notorious criminal, Henry Lee Lucas, when doubts surfaced
about his guilt. That decision angered many in law enforcement, but
the governor's march to re-election rolled on.
</P>
<P>
   And as speculation mounts about a Bush run for president two
years hence, the former president's son has become a darling of the
national media, as well.
</P>
<P>
   National radio personality Don Imus says George W. Bush is his
choice for president in two years. The Washington Post recently
published a glowing if brief profile, calling Bush ``gracious and
talkative'' and saying he ``truly seems to relish the
flesh-pressing part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's life and career are scrutinized much more closely in a
long cover story in the Sept. 13 New York Times Magazine. The
article chronicles George W.'s abrasiveness while defending his
father, and tells in some depth about Bush's rootlessness and heavy
drinking in his 20s and 30s. (He quit alcohol more than a decade
ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the story concludes, the biggest questions
surrounding George W. Bush and a national candidacy are those of
politics, not character. i.e., his moderate views on issues such as
abortion and homosexuality could antagonize Republicans on the far
right.
</P>
<P>
   Much more intense national scrutiny is to come. But so far
little has surfaced about the man with which to mount a credible
personal attack.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers President Tom Schieffer, a longtime political
activist who served several terms in the state Legislature, says
simply that Bush is ``at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been around politics and politicians for a long time,
and having reflected on that, that is a very, very rare
occurrence,'' Schieffer says. ``The less he worries about what he's
going to do in the future, the more popular he becomes.''

   And as speculation mounts about a Bush run for president two
years hence, the former president's son has become a darling of the
national media, as well.
</P>
<P>
   National radio personality Don Imus says George W. Bush is his
choice for president in two years. The Washington Post recently
published a glowing if brief profile, calling Bush ``gracious and
talkative'' and saying he ``truly seems to relish the
flesh-pressing part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's life and career are scrutinized much more closely in a
long cover story in the Sept. 13 New York Times Magazine. The
article chronicles George W.'s abrasiveness while defending his
father, and tells in some depth about Bush's rootlessness and heavy
drinking in his 20s and 30s. (He quit alcohol more than a decade
ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the story concludes, the biggest questions
surrounding George W. Bush and a national candidacy are those of
politics, not character. i.e., his moderate views on issues such as
abortion and homosexuality could antagonize Republicans on the far
right.
</P>
<P>
   Much more intense national scrutiny is to come. But so far
little has surfaced about the man with which to mount a credible
personal attack.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers President Tom Schieffer, a longtime political
activist who served several terms in the state Legislature, says
simply that Bush is ``at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been around politics and politicians for a long time,
and having reflected on that, that is a very, very rare
occurrence,'' Schieffer says. ``The less he worries about what he's
going to do in the future, the more popular he becomes.''

AIKMAN SAYS SHOULDER HAS NOT HEALED ENOUGH FOR RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys will make a change in the
starting lineup for the Sunday's game against Carolina, but it
won't be the return of quarterback Troy Aikman, who has missed the
past three games with a fractured collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed rookie Flozell Adams will start at right guard in
place of Everett McIver, who is expected to be out six to eight
weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, however, was put on hold for at least another week.
Though X-rays of Aikman's shoulder taken Monday showed positive
signs, Aikman, who's still experiencing pain and soreness in his
left shoulder, said the healing progress was not as substantial as
he hoped when he targeted the Carolina game for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not play this week,'' Aikman said. ``And with that
being the case, the question is whether it's worth the risk to come
back for one game. More than likely the decision will be made that
it's not. So I would guess that my first game back would be
following the bye against Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said the Cowboys will re-examine Aikman's
situation before they play Chicago on Oct. 18. But considering the
Cowboys have a bye the following week, Gailey admitted that he
would prefer that Aikman not come back until the Nov. 2 matchup
against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   While Aikman and Gailey admitted that the Cowboys' success with
Jason Garrett as the starter gives them a good feeling about what
the team has accomplished during Aikman's absence, they said it has
no bearing on when he would return.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, 2-1 as a starter since Aikman was injured, is coming
off his best game this season. He completed 14 of 17 passes for 169
yards and a touchdown to lead the Cowboys (3-2) to a 31-10 victory
against the Washington Redskins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Aikman said, is how the shoulder feels and
``whether I feel I can go out and get hit and be taken to the
ground and not be at a considerable risk of re-breaking the
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't think that's the case,'' Aikman said. ``I
don't feel like it's strong enough to withstand any kind of
punishment. I don't want to come back one or two games early and
jeopardize the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said he supports a decision to wait
until after the bye week _ considering that the original prognosis
was four to eight weeks and the Philadelphia game would be seven
weeks from when he broke it against Denver on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week you wait, you hope the bone gets that much more
solidified,'' Maurer said. The X-ray, Maurer said, showed some
positive things about the way the bone was healing. ``He has a
higher chance of refracturing it today than two weeks from now. The
Philadelphia game would give him an optimal amount of healing
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though guard Mike Kiselak replaced McIver against the
Redskins and had a strong performance against defensive tackle Dan
Wilkinson, the move to start Adams was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys indicated the 6-foot-7, 335-pound Adams had the most
impressive training camp of any rookie since all-pro tackle Larry
Allen debuted in 1994. As a result, Gailey created formations to
get Adams on the field, including using him as a blocking tight
end.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey praised Kiselak's play, but said Adams, who replaced
McIver when he was sidelined with a cut on his neck during the
preseason, was the obvious choice in place of McIver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Flozell deserved it,'' Gailey said. ``He earned it. He
played well when we put him in there in the preseason. He's done a
good job. It's not like we're giving it away indiscriminantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak, who is in his first year with the Cowboys and played in
the Canadian Football League last year, will continue be the
Cowboys' top reserve on the offensive line.

COWBOYS BUILD POINTS WITH WARREN'S LATE RUNS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The site of Dallas Cowboys running back Chris
Warren high-stepping into the end zone with 1:06 to go in a
14-point ball game may have offended some Redskins fans.
</P>
<P>
   But running up the score was not what Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
was thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Points in the division _ that can determine if you make the
playoffs,'' Gailey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final scoring drive began on the Cowboys' 4-yard line.
Trying to run out the clock, Gailey ran Warren up the middle on
nine consecutive plays. The Redskins knew what was coming, but
couldn't stop him from gaining 90 yards on the nine plays.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith spelled Warren for one play after the last of
Warren's nine consecutive carries, a 49-yarder. Then Warren, a
native of nearby Burke, Va., came back in to score on a 1-yard run,
giving him two touchdowns and 104 yards on the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looked like Chris was running faster than everyone
else,'' Cowboys center Clay Shiver said. ``We wore them down late.
Obviously, you could see the Redskins were discouraged. You could
see it on their faces.'' REVIEWING THE FILM
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE: Tight end David LaFleur has been ignored for much of
the season. On passing downs, he has usually been replaced by third
wide receiver Ernie Mills. And on some running downs, he has been
replaced by offensive lineman Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   But LaFleur finally had a breakout game against the Redskins,
recording a career-high four receptions. And although he netted
only 29 yards, the catches came at crucial times. Two were for
first downs. And his last one, an 8-yarder, set up Warren's first
touchdown run, giving the Cowboys a 24-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE: Defensive end Kavika Pittman continues his swift
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led 10-7 when the Redskins faced third-and-one.
Quarterback Trent Green faked a pitch left and rolled right. He had
wide receiver Leslie Shepherd running free down the field. But
Pittman, who was not fooled by Green's fake, dropped the Redskins
quarterback for his third sack of the season. The sack forced the
Redskins to punt, and two plays later, the Cowboys increased the
lead to 17-7 on Jason Garrett's 43-yard pass to Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he was pleased with the Cowboys' defensive pressure.
But the defensive unit still allows several big plays a game, a
concern for defensive coordinator Dave Campo. The Redskins
converted a 42-yard pass, a 40-yard pass, and a 24-yard run against
the Cowboys. The three plays netted 106 yards, or nearly 40 percent
of the Redskins' total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like giving up big plays,'' Campo said, ``but we can
fix those. We'd have more of a problem if a team kept getting the
5-, 6-, and 7-yard plays on us, pounding it on us. That hasn't
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS: Safety Charlie Williams committed two penalties
on special teams, including a holding penalty that wiped out Deion
Sanders' 71-yard punt return for a touchdown. But because the unit
has played well this year, Gailey said he does not feel as though
Sunday's performance is a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be smarter, but \Rthe penalties\S have not been a
persistent thing,'' Gailey said. ``I'm sure it will be a one-time
deal.'' Gailey's corner
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go out and do something consistent before we get too
high on ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Gailey, cautioning the local media not to make too much of the
club's 3-0 record against the NFC East. Outside the East, the
Cowboys are 0-2. INJURY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   _ Guard Everett McIver will be out six to eight weeks with a
sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterback Troy Aikman is out with a fractured collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive tackle Antonio Anderson is out with a torn lateral
meniscus in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linebacker Nate Hemsley in on injured reserve with a
dislocated ankle and fractured fibula. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys signed defensive lineman Nathan Davis, who was a
second-round draft choice of the Falcons last year. To make room on
the roster, the club placed Hemsley on injured reserve. Hemsley was
injured Sept. 21 at New York.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys also released wide receiver Anthony Eubanks from
the practice squad and replaced him with defensive back Terry
Billups.

WRIGHT'S STYLE HAS YANKEES IN FOUL MOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL C.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Jaret Wright, the Cleveland Indians'
scheduled starter Tuesday night for Game 1 of the best-of-seven
American League Championship Series, emerged as the unsuspecting
center for mild controversy Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Yankees do not care much for the 22-year-old
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   New York's ``Daily News'' referred to Wright as a pitcher the
Yankees ``generally consider a punk.''
</P>
<P>
   That view does not stem from Wright's two victories against the
Yankees in their 1997 AL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   It instead stems from a March 2 exhibition game during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Wright hit Luis Sojo with a pitch that resulted in a fracture of
the reserve infielder's left hand. The injury kept Sojo on the
15-day disabled list until April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander David Wells, the Yankees' scheduled starter Tuesday,
supplied the catalyst for this subject when asked about his
ballclub wanting revenge for the Indians' 1997 playoff triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the fans as well as the media because of all the
hype that's brought into it, but sometimes,'' Wells said, ``it can
be personal through the course of the year when things go on in a
game . ...''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wright, would you care to respond to the Yankees' dislike
for you?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I can say about that,'' Wright said. ``I'm
out there to do my job, and I don't think we need to turn this into
anything more than it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the third time I've been asked about whether I'm
hitting people (intentionally) or not. I'm out there trying to get
outs. I'm out there trying to keep my team in the ballgame, and it
is baseball. People get hit sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, though, kept his comments veiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not personal for me, but it can be personal for other
people and for other reasons,'' Wells said. ``I think when you get
two teams that are very competitive, it can go as far back as
spring training with that situation with Luis Sojo. That was a long
time ago, and sometimes you've just got to let bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been situations where guys ... are a little more
aggressive and you have to pitch inside. I understand that, but you
don't have to pitch up and in and head hunt. That's one thing I
don't believe in. I don't think it's right because you can really
hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wright: ``Pitching inside is part of my game, and I'm not
trying to hurt anybody or hit anybody. That's just the way I was
taught to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove again defended his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got those questions from you guys in spring training when
that happened,'' Hargrove said. ``First of all, there is no reason
to throw at anybody in spring training _ much less at that point of
spring training. Jaret was not throwing at anybody. Jaret is a
power pitcher, and occasionally the ball will move and get away
from him. That's what happened in Luis' situation. Jaret is not a
headhunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, though, would prefer that the Yankees serve as another
big-game trophy for his collection after victories in Games 2 and 5
of the '97 AL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat this team when I happened to be on the mound,'' Wright
said. ``My job stays the same, to keep it close and hopefully put
up some zeroes until we can score against a guy like David Wells.''

ADVICE TO COLTS: DON'T MESS UP A GOOD THING IN MANNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Indianapolis Colts,
</P>
<P>
   Please don't do it. Please don't mess up Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, your No. 1 choice in April's NFL draft, finally
registered his first pro victory on Sunday. It should be the first
of many, many wins. Peyton's stats aren't big; in the 17-12 victory
over fellow rookie Ryan Leaf and the Chargers, Manning was 12-of-23
for 137 yards. And he threw another pick, so he leads the NFL with
12 interceptions. Peyton's progress is slow; some of your critics
are suggesting he's being asked to do too much, others suggesting
he's being asked to do too little.
</P>
<P>
   Please, Colts. Don't mishandle this kid.
</P>
<P>
   It happens often. And it usually means not only the death of the
quarterback's career, but also the death of the head coach's
career. And the long-term need for a life-support system for the
entire franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Hey Colts, ask the Eagles. Do you realize that Ray Rhodes has
fired or benched every QB he has ever started? Or ask the
Cardinals. Is it just a coincidence they haven't won big since Jim
Hart was their signal-caller? Or ask the Redskins. After five years
of playing the quarterback domino game that has left him with
somebody named Trent Green as his starter, wanna bet that Norv
Turner sometimes, late at night, when he's all by himself, wonders
if he gave up too early on Heath Shuler?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, Colts, you don't have to examine how other teams have
messed up this development-of-quarterbacks thing. Maybe you can
just look at yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16 years since Bob Irsay's ownership caused you to draft
and then trade John Elway to Denver, you've started 17 different
quarterbacks! Isn't that astounding? For 16 years, the Broncos' QB
has been Elway. For 16 years, your QB has been Mike Pagel (83-85),
Art Schlichter (84-85), Mark Herrmann (83-84), Matt Kofler (85),
Gary Hogeboom (86-88), Jack Trudeau (86-93), Blair Kiel (86-87),
Chris Chandler (88-89), Tom Ramsey (89), Jeff George (90-93), Don
Majkowski (93-94), Jim Harbaugh (94-97), Browning Nagle (94), Craig
Erickson (95), Paul Justin (95-97), Kelly Holcomb (97) and Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Given their backgrounds _ coach Jim Mora's resume doesn't
include QB development, and your first-time-ever QB coach is Bruce
Arians, whose greatest NFL accomplishment is having served as New
Orleans' tight ends coach _ I hope your coaching staff is up to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Colts, I don't have the how-to answer for avoiding
mistakes. When it comes to the care and feeding of your QBs, nobody
does.
</P>
<P>
   But this kid has the goods. So it's your job to find a way.
Don't mess up, or it might be another 16 years of Herrmanns and
Hogebooms and Holcombs.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Colts. NFL BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Bonehead coaching decision of the year: Five seconds left.
Arizona trails Oakland, 23-20. Arizona can try a 56-yard field
goal, but instead calls one more play, a 2-yard pass. It's
complete, but of course, time runs out. Attention, Vince Tobin: Is
a 54-yard kick so much easier than a 56-yarder that you would risk
eating up all remaining five seconds? ... Yes, coach Steve Mariucci
actually blamed his 49ers' record-tying 22 penalties in Buffalo on
overzealous officials. Reality check, please. ... In beating the
Giants, Tampa Bay scored its first TD in a first quarter.
Naturally, it was scored by the Bucs defense ... Weird numbers out
of the Detroit loss to Chicago, where Barry Sanders rushed for 28
yards while teammate Charlie Batch, the QB, rushed for 58. Hey, Joe
Theismann: Shhhh. ... Atlanta's three TDs in 48 seconds vs.
Carolina is a since-the-merger record. ... Detroit blew a 27-10
fourth-quarter lead in allowing the Bears' first win. ... Seahawks
runner Ricky Watters insists he isn't such a bad guy. ``I resent
all this because it isn't a fair label,'' says Watters of his
reputation for immaturity. ``If I went out and robbed a bank. ...
then, OK, criticize me.'' That's OK, Ricky. We'll just criticize
you for two costly fumbles in Sunday night's sloppy loss at Kansas
City. ... The irony in Chicago and Washington: When Dave Wannstedt
and Norv Turner were Dallas coordinators, ``halftime adjustments''
were a specialty. This year, the Bears and Redskins have been
outscored in third quarters by a combined 124-10. ... Too bad for
the Chiefs the Super Bowl is in Miami. Under coach Marty
Schottenheimer, as they established against Seattle, Kansas City is
a good mudder. But check back with me in January: the Chiefs are
0-6 in the Sunshine State.

Don't mess up, or it might be another 16 years of Herrmanns and
Hogebooms and Holcombs.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Colts. NFL BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Bonehead coaching decision of the year: Five seconds left.
Arizona trails Oakland, 23-20. Arizona can try a 56-yard field
goal, but instead calls one more play, a 2-yard pass. It's
complete, but of course, time runs out. Attention, Vince Tobin: Is
a 54-yard kick so much easier than a 56-yarder that you would risk
eating up all remaining five seconds? ... Yes, coach Steve Mariucci
actually blamed his 49ers' record-tying 22 penalties in Buffalo on
overzealous officials. Reality check, please. ... In beating the
Giants, Tampa Bay scored its first TD in a first quarter.
Naturally, it was scored by the Bucs defense ... Weird numbers out
of the Detroit loss to Chicago, where Barry Sanders rushed for 28
yards while teammate Charlie Batch, the QB, rushed for 58. Hey, Joe
Theismann: Shhhh. ... Atlanta's three TDs in 48 seconds vs.
Carolina is a since-the-merger record. ... Detroit blew a 27-10
fourth-quarter lead in allowing the Bears' first win. ... Seahawks
runner Ricky Watters insists he isn't such a bad guy. ``I resent
all this because it isn't a fair label,'' says Watters of his
reputation for immaturity. ``If I went out and robbed a bank. ...
then, OK, criticize me.'' That's OK, Ricky. We'll just criticize
you for two costly fumbles in Sunday night's sloppy loss at Kansas
City. ... The irony in Chicago and Washington: When Dave Wannstedt
and Norv Turner were Dallas coordinators, ``halftime adjustments''
were a specialty. This year, the Bears and Redskins have been
outscored in third quarters by a combined 124-10. ... Too bad for
the Chiefs the Super Bowl is in Miami. Under coach Marty
Schottenheimer, as they established against Seattle, Kansas City is
a good mudder. But check back with me in January: the Chiefs are
0-6 in the Sunshine State.

CLEVELAND CALMLY APPROACHES RECORD-SETTING NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The most unintentionally funny question posed to an
Indians player after Cleveland's playoff victory over the Boston
Red Sox on Saturday went to David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel, the left fielder was asked, that your team has any
advantage against the New York Yankees in the American League
Championship Series?
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pause, Justice gave the only possible answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone would have trouble giving the Indians an edge entering
their best-of-seven rematch with New York. The Yankees, after all,
``edged'' the Indians by 25 games in the American League standings
this season. There were years the old Washington Senators didn't
finish that far behind New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Indians have shown no signs of intimidation as they
prepare for Tuesday's opener at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees won 114 games; their record speaks for itself,''
Justice said of the team that broke the AL record for victories set
by the 1954 Indians. ``But our team has enough talent and character
to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is drawing confidence from the fact that it beat a
superior New York team in the division playoff series last season,
and from its regular-season play this year against the Yankees.
Although New York beat the Indians in the season series, 7-4, three
of the New York victories came in the last week of the season when
neither club was especially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Indians players and management are also aware that they have
some pitching history to support their confidence. Game 1 starter
Jaret Wright is 4-1 lifetime against New York. Bartolo Colon
stifled Yankees hitters in a game against them this year. Charles
Nagy was 1-0 with a 1.72 ERA in two starts against New York. And
Dwight Gooden should be especially motivated to start against his
old teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There is a flip side, however. Wright has been wildly
inconsistent this season and was bombed out of his start against
Boston in Game 1 of the Division Series. Colon pitched well in Game
4 against the Red Sox but had a poor second half. Nagy was
atrocious against New York last year and in the 1997 postseason.
And Gooden didn't look sharp before being ejected in Game 2 of the
Red Sox series last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pitching will be the key, too, by any assessment,
because Indians' hitters, like the Rangers' batters, appear
unlikely to score much against the likes of David Wells, David
Cone, Andy Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and the rest of the Yankees'
staff.
</P>
<P>
   That realization has Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove realistic,
if still positive, about his team's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees won 114 games this year and they didn't do that by
being lucky,'' Hargrove said. ``They have terrific players, a
wonderful manager and they are a first-class organization. But we
feel very good about ourselves and that we can match up with
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Indians were widely regarded to have underachieved
throughout the 1998 regular season, they managed in the Boston
series to play their best when it counted the most, as they
appeared to do in last year's postseason run to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Indians closer Mike Jackson had an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through lots of ups downs over the course of a
season,'' he said. In the playoffs, he noted, ``Guys stepped up. We
have a lot of veteran players who have been in the postseason
several years. They don't panic. They stay focused. They don't try
to do things they can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether one of the things the Indians can't do is beat the
invincible Yankees is the next big question to be answered.

RANGERS WILL START ON 1999 PLANS NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton likely ranks high among the Rangers'
list of priorities this month, but it appears general manager Doug
Melvin will wait until next week to put in motion the
organization's plan of attack for the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plans to sit down and talk about our club next week,''
Melvin said Monday. ``We're going to review strategy as to how we
go about some of the things we're going to do. I think we know what
we have to do, and I think I have a pretty good idea of how we're
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin declined to discuss specifics, but the general manager
will begin to retool the roster for 1999 upon return from his
three-day trip to the organization's Florida Instructional League
site.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and right-hander Todd Stottlemyre _ whom the Rangers
acquired in the July 31 trade that sent third baseman Fernando
Tatis, left-hander Darren Oliver and minor-league outfielder Mark
Little to the Cardinals _ can become free agents after the
conclusion of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even talked to them yet,'' Melvin said. McLEMORE HAS
SURGERY
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect second baseman Mark McLemore to be ready for
spring training after the 34-year-old infielder underwent
arthroscopic surgery to repair the patella in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. John Conway and James Montgomery performed the surgery
Monday at HealthSouth Surgery Center in Dallas, and the Rangers
expect McLemore to begin rehabilitation this week. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers scheduled left-hander Scott Bailes to undergo
arthroscopic surgery Friday to repair the torn rotator cuff in his
left shoulder. Conway is scheduled to perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left-hander Tony Fossas also plans to undergo arthroscopic
surgery within the next couple of weeks to repair torn cartilage in
his right knee.

BRAVES' LIGTENBERG ISN'T JUST COMIC RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The San Diego Padres closer is a Cy Young Award
candidate who saved 53 out of 54 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves closer is a former replacement player who was
acquired from the Minneapolis Loons for six dozen baseballs and two
dozen bats.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves look at second-year right-hander Kerry Ligtenberg
and don't see a disadvantage when he's matched against Padres
reliever Trevor Hoffman in the National League Championship Series,
which begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the story of the century for me,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said. ``He's a chemical engineer who came out of an independent
league and he's closing for a team that's won more games than any
other team the last seven or eight years. This guy is a pretty
well-kept secret in the league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no secrets in the playoffs however. The assumption all
year with the Braves was that their bullpen would be their weak
spot in the postseason. But Ligtenberg has come close to matching
Hoffman's terrific numbers, even though he didn't become the closer
until June.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman led the league in save percentage, but Ligtenberg was
successful in 30 of 34 opportunities. Hoffman allowed 7.8
baserunners per nine innings, the best of any National League
reliever. Ligtenberg, who features a 94 mile-per-hour fastball and
above-average slider, was fifth best, allowing 9.2 baserunners per
nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job,'' former Marlins manager Jim Leyland
said after watching Ligtenberg shut his team down last month.
``When you're saving games for the Atlanta Braves, you've got
pressure. Not only because you're saving the game, but because
you're saving it for a Cy Young winner every night. He has done
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would be in deep trouble without Ligtenberg. Mark
Wohlers saved a club-record 39 games in 1996 and 33 more last
season, but injuries and a lack of control brought him down this
year. Two trips to the minor leagues failed to solve his problems,
which led to speculation the Braves would be in trouble during the
playoffs. When Wohlers was sent down, the reason listed was
``inability to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for me to say now that October isn't any different,
but every game matters in the postseason,'' said Ligtenberg, who
made two appearances in the playoffs last season. ``I don't get
rattled and I think I'm more focused at playoff time. I'm just kind
of proving my case that I can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves weren't expecting Ligtenberg to be this good when
they first signed him. They were just hoping to get lucky in middle
relief when they signed him from the independent Prairie League in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was recommended by former Braves catcher Greg Olson, who was
managing the Loons at the time. There was actually no trade
involved, but the Braves sent Olson the badly needed equipment out
of gratitude for recommending Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are not his first major-league organization.
Ligtenberg pitched in a couple of games as a replacement player for
the Seattle Mariners in spring training 1995 and, like Mets pitcher
Rick Reed, has been stuck with that label ever since. It keeps him
out of the Players Association and away from an extra $30,000 in
licensing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making a big deal out of it,'' Ligtenberg said. ``They
have to do what they think is right. At the time I didn't know what
I was doing. I wasn't out to take anybody's job. I was fighting to
make an `A' ball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg hurt his shoulder in the Mariners camp and turned
down a high-paying job with 3M to keep pitching in the Prairie
League. His tenacity has been rewarded. So have the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever take this for granted,'' Ligtenberg
said. ``From where I was three or four years ago, this is about as
far away as you can get.''

STARS BUNCH KNOWS THEIR LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The third- and fourth-line forwards of a hockey
team are kind of like the Jan Bradys of the hockey world.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Brady has the prettiest smile, the long blond hair, all
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   And Jan? She's Marcia's younger sister, always hidden in the
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   While third- and fourth-line players rarely get the glamorous
roles of a Mike Modano or Brett Hull, they are hardly the weak
sisters. They are the workhorses of the team, the muscle, the ones
who fans remember when they score a big goal in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth line is where the Stars have worked hard
the past year to improve, adding, among others, Brian Skrudland,
Mike Keane, Brent Severyn and Jamie Wright _ not exactly Marcia
Bradys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a No. 1 and No. 2 line, but what's going to win
you a Cup is your No. 3 and No. 4,'' said Mike Krushelnyski, an
assistant coach on Detroit's 1996-97 Stanley Cup-winning team and
Red Wings forward in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Stars general manager Bob Gainey: ``They're valuable
players. They're hard to find and hard to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey trusts he has put the finishing touches on the Stars
third and fourth lines. And if you missed the transactions
involving these precious players, it's not hard to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Golden'' precedes none of their nicknames, none of
their fathers were mega-NHL superstars, and none of them will score
anywhere near 50 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars third- and fourth-line depth charges include a faceoff
master in Guy Carbonneau, experienced grinders like Keane,
Skrudland, Grant Marshall and Dave Reid, and a young, speedy rookie
in Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since our team has had a solid third and
fourth line like we do now,'' Modano said. ``Lines that contributes
on a consistent basis, every night, chipping in a goal or two on
the odd night that puts us over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   A third- or fourth-line player's job is very specialized, with
duties that include killing penalties, checking and fighting, all
while not being a defensive liability. The player must pair those
skills with hockey smarts and one or more of the following: size,
good hands or above-average skating ability, Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the GMs have their work cut out for them,''
Krushelnyski said. ``And it's not just going out and spending
money. It's finding the right role player to play the position.
It's a tactful chess game you have to meticulously plan out to put
the team together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey began to execute his plan by acquiring Skrudland and
Keane at the trading deadline last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance to add two experienced bodies, two players who
have playoff experience and some size,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Those two players mixed in nicely with young forwards Marshall
and Juha Lind. Add in veterans Carbonneau and Bob Bassen, and
sometimes Reid, and that made for a solid group of six.
</P>
<P>
   Against every team but Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference finals, the fourth-line heroes played
for the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't score, Grant Marshall didn't score and Bob Bassen
scored one goal,'' said Skrudland, then the fourth-line center.
``One goal from Grant, one goal from me, at some point, could have
changed the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's fourth line, which usually consisted of Kris Draper,
Martin Lapointe and Joey Kocur, combined for 14 goals in the
playoffs, including one game-winner from Lapointe against the Stars
in the six-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the Stars third and fourth liners were incapable
of making a similar offensive contribution? Quite the opposite,
says Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities were there. The finish was not.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what aggravates Hitchcock the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have people getting opportunities offensively, they
have to bury it,'' Hitchcock said. ``They have to accept that
responsibility, and it doesn't matter if it's Brian Skrudland,
Brent Severyn or Grant Marshall. ... Those are the details we need
in this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey did a little more juggling in the offseason, subtracting
Lind and Bassen and adding Wright and Severyn. Wright brings speed
and a good touch while Severyn delivers size and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just look at it as we're one of four lines that play,''
Marshall said. ``Modano's line can't play our role, and we can't
play their role. They're the No. 1 line for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're the No. 1 line for what we do.''

BAYLOR'S ALFRED EARNS STARTING QUARTERBACK SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 12 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jermaine Alfred, who has come off the bench to trigger
fourth-quarter rallies in Baylor's past two games, will replace
Odell James as the Bears' starting quarterback in Saturday's game
against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine has played well and earned the right to start,''
Baylor coach Dave Roberts said Monday. ``But we'll keep playing
both quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, a junior, passed for 225 yards and directed two
touchdown drives in the final 17 minutes of the Bears' 31-29 loss
to Texas Tech. A week earlier, he led Baylor (1-3, 0-2) to a
go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter of an eventual 18-16 loss
to No. 14 Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tech and Colorado are 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Against Tech, Alfred was involved in the game's most pivotal
play: a two-point conversion pass to wide receiver Derrius Thompson
with 1:10 remaining that did not count because game officials ruled
Alfred stepped out of bounds before releasing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Several Baylor players, including Alfred and Thompson, disagreed
with the call. Roberts declined comment Monday, but confirmed he
had reviewed the play and forwarded a report to the conference
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the mail,'' Roberts said. ``I can't comment on any of
that. We've done what we're supposed to do.'' Aggies lose RB Eric
Bernard, Texas A&AMP;M's third-team tailback, tore knee ligaments
during a non-contact drill Sunday night and will be lost for the
season, coach R.C. Slocum said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard, who missed the 1997 season because of reconstructive
knee surgery, will needs surgical repairs on the other knee, Slocum
said. A junior who rushed for 598 yards in 1996, Bernard carried
nine times for 40 yards (4.4 average) this season in relief of
Dante Hall and Sirr Parker. TV DECISION DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, ABC officials have exercised
the right to wait until Sunday before selecting a Big 12 game to
telecast at 2:30 p.m. on Oct. 17, putting kickoff times for two
games in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials said Monday they will select either Texas
Tech-Colorado or Oklahoma State-Kansas State as ABC's Oct. 17 game.
The unselected contest will begin at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 17 Nebraska-Kansas game will begin at 6 p.m. as a Fox
Sports Southwest telecast. MISSOURI'S JONES QUESTIONABLE
</P>
<P>
   Missouri quarterback Corby Jones is questionable for Saturday's
game against Iowa State because of a sprained toe. Coach Larry
Smith said the injury caused excessive swelling after Saturday's
35-14 victory against Northwestern (La.) State and will keep Jones
out of practice until tomorrow, if not all week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was ``concerned'' that Jones, a first-team
all-conference selection in 1997, would not be available when the
21st-ranked Tigers (3-1, 1-0) meet the Cyclones (2-3, 0-2). Jones'
replacement, if necessary, would be sophomore Ryan Douglass, son of
former Chicago Bears' quarterback Bobby Douglass. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Oklahoma State coach Bob Simmons, on the challenge of getting
his team to rebound emotionally from a last-second, 24-17 loss to
No. 2 Nebraska: ``I don't think it will be a problem. Our kids feel
good about what's going on. Good teams, in my opinion, tend to
bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes dismissed playing on artificial
surface as a reason why six players, including starting offensive
linemen Curtis Lowery (knee) and Steve McFadden (ankle), are not
expected to play against Oklahoma State: ``The surface had nothing
to do with that. Our guys just got hit hard. As big and fast as
guys are these days, you've got to be fortunate to dodge that
bullet for any length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nebraska starting quarterback Bobby Newcombe is not at 100
percent and is considered ``a little questionable'' by coach Frank
Solich for Saturday's game at Texas A&AMP;M. Newcombe is expected to
see limited practice time this week.

TEXAS' RICKY WILLIAMS TO WEAR NO. 37 IN HONOR OF DOAK WALKER
</HEADLINE>
 WILLIAMS-TEX By WENDELL BARNHOUSE c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Chalk up another (unofficial) record for Ricky
Williams _ most uniform numbers in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams received the OK Monday to wear No. 37 to honor Doak
Walker when the Longhorns play Oklahoma Saturday in the Cotton
Bowl. Williams, who wore No. 11 his first three seasons, will
return to wearing No. 34 after the game with the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be great,'' Williams said Monday. ``I'm
wearing it because we're playing in the Cotton Bowl. I thought it
would be neat to wear 37 in the house that Doak built. I'm playing
with him in my heart. It's a special thing that I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials had to clear the number change with the NCAA,
the Big 12 Conference and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make sure everyone knows about it so nobody would
think we're trying to trick anyone,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams became friends with Walker, the former SMU star who won
the Heisman Trophy in 1948, last winter when Williams won the
running back award named for Walker. When Walker died Sept. 27,
Williams said he was dedicating the rest of his season to Walker's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday against Iowa State, Williams wore a No. 37 decal
on his helmet. He rushed for a Texas single-game record 350 yards.
That total, following the 318 yards Williams gained against Rice
the weekend that Walker died, made the Texas standout the first
back in NCAA history to gain 300 yards in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while reading stories about Walker's career, Williams
learned that the Cotton Bowl was expanded to accommodate the crowds
that flocked to see SMU and Walker play. Even though Williams had
played Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl three times, he was unaware the
facility was known as The House That Doak Built.
</P>
<P>
   After honoring Walker with the decal, Williams asked coach Mack
Brown if he could enhance it by wearing Walker's number. Williams
will switch numbers with Chris Robertson, who will wear 34 against
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a freshman, there's not much he can really say about
it,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time where race is such an issue, here's a young black
man who is so appreciative and has a role model who was so much
older, it's just a phenomenal story,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said.
``It's just a phenomenal story. It's totally sincere and it's not a
publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Ricky to do what Ricky wants to do.''

   DALLAS _ Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wanted a dress
rehearsal for Saturday's opening night, so he sent out his best
lineup Monday night for a 7-2 preseason victory against the Tampa
Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he'll be able to get even closer. The Stars yesterday
signed restricted free agent Jamie Langenbrunner to a two-year
contract for $1.8 million, giving Hitchcock access to every lineup
regular except injured centers Joe Nieuwendyk and Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, 24, missed all of training camp while his agent
Steve Bartlett tried to hammer out a contract _ and the deal
finally came together yesterday. Langenbrunner will earn $750,000
this season, up from $300,000 last season, and will jump to $1.15
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations were at times difficult, Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said he was happy to have them completed before
the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of become the norm, there are still several other
players who aren't in camp throughout the league,'' he said. ``That
said, to have all our players available will be an advantage
against those teams that do not have theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, 24, is a definite advantage. He was tied for
third in goal-scoring last season for the Stars with 23. The winger
added 29 assists for 59 points _ the most of any second-year player
in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   He also was selected to play for the United States Olympic Team
and had a goal and four assists in 16 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland hurt his knee in Monday night's game and could be
either ``day-to-day,'' Hitchcock said, or in need of arthroscopic
surgery and possibly out 10-14 days. If Skrudland can't play in
Saturday's season opener, Hitchcock said he expects to use
Langenbrunner as a center instead of a left wing. STRONG SHOWING
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull had his second two-goal game of the preseason and the
Stars' top line of Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen had three
goals and five assists for an eight-point night against the
Lightning. Hull finished with five goals and three assists in six
preseason games. Modano had three goals and six assists in seven
games. Lehtinen had three goals and four assists in seven games.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars finished 5-2-1 in the preseason and outscored
opponents, 32-16.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have made available an additional 300 tickets for
Saturday's season opener against the Buffalo Sabres. Call
214-GO-STARS for information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stars defenseman Dan Keczmer is out two weeks with viral
meningitis. Hitchcock said yesterday he expected to keep only seven
defensemen instead of calling up a replacement. Hitchcock said the
Stars likely will use less than their 24 available healthy roster
spots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Stars winger Benoit Hogue served as the Lightning
captain Monday night. Hogue, who signed with the Lightning as a
free agent, received a small cheer when he assisted on Tampa Bay's
second goal.

 &HT;    Panel OKs probe of Clinton
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ghost of Watergate hung over the House
Judiciary Committee chambers Monday as a divided panel approved an
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-16 party-line vote sets the stage for the full House to
act on the measure later this week before members head home for
elections. Given the Republican majority, the House is expected to
approve what would be the third presidential impeachment inquiry in
the nation's history and the second within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry would allow investigators to explore 15 grounds of
potentially impeachable offenses that range from lying under oath
to obstructing justice to tampering with witnesses. The charges are
somewhat broader than those independent counsel Kenneth Starr
delivered to the committee four weeks ago but lack some of Starr's
more far-reaching allegations, such as the charge that the
president obstructed justice by refusing to testify for seven
months during his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman of the committee, Henry Hyde of
Illinois, opened the proceedings with a plea that his colleagues
put aside their partisan differences and a pledge to do their
constitutional duty in the same way members investigating President
Nixon did in the very same room in the summer of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to ask and answer this one simple question: based
upon what we know now, do we have a duty to look further, or to
look away?'' Hyde asked in a solemn tone.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde then became the first in a string of lawmakers to invoke
the name of former New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, the chairman of
the Nixon impeachment hearings. Quoting Rodino, as he sat
underneath life-size portraits of himself and his predecessor from
the Watergate hearings, Hyde said: ``We cannot turn away, out of
partisanship or convenience, from problems that are now our
responsibility, our inescapable responsibility to consider.'' Rep.
John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the panel and the
only member left on the committee from the Watergate days, said the
Republicans are out to embarrass the Democrats by ``conjuring up
the ghost of Watergate'' whenever they can. In reality, he said,
the charges amount only to the president lying about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate, it's an extramarital affair,'' Conyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario replayed itself again and again throughout the
daylong hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans portrayed the president as a liar who obstructed
justice and engaged in a conspiracy to conceal an adulterous affair
with Monica Lewinsky, a former employee half his age.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats see it, Clinton lied about the relationship, but to
shield himself from public humiliation and to protect his family
from the pain that accompanies exposure of such affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, given the 21 to 16 split of the committee,
Republicans defeated two Democratic efforts to limit the duration
and scope of the impeachment inquiry. The majority insisted the
inquiry should not be restricted and investigators should be
allowed to follow the truth wherever it takes them.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Republican investigator David Schippers unveiled 15
charges, four more than set forth by Starr in his 445-page report.
The accusations allege there ``is substantial and credible
evidence'' that the president committed perjury, obstructed justice
and abused his presidential powers in trying to conceal his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the minority's chief counsel, quoted historians
such as George Mason and Alexander Hamilton in arguing that
impeachment is an offense reserved for the most serious of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 1974 impeachment hearings of former President Richard
Nixon, Lowell said President Clinton was not lying about breaking
into the Democratic Party's headquarters, nor was he using the CIA
for personal benefit. He was lying about an adulterous affair and
therefore should be judged in that context, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The 37 members of the committee delivered their individual takes
on the evidence amassed by Starr since January. Starr has spent
four years and $40 million investigating a series of allegations
against the president, but nothing materialized from any of the
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the members clearly had made up their minds about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this president is allowed to use the presidency to gratify
his personal desires, in the same way a corrupt county or parish
boss solicits money for votes, future occupants will, sadly, do the
same,'' said Georgia Republican Bob Barr, a member of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Barr had pushed for impeachment of the president even before the
Lewinsky affair surfaced, citing campaign fund-raising abuses and
allegations that the White House improperly obtained FBI files on
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's fiery speech Monday starkly contrasted with Florida
Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler, who drew a burst of applause from
members on his side of the aisle for condemning Republicans for
taking the process so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is not about adultery; it is rooted in a
constitutional standard that has met the test of time,'' Wexler
said. ``It is about subversion of government. The president had an
affair. He lied about it. He didn't want anyone to know about it.
Does anyone reasonably believe that this amounts to subversion of
government?''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the mood was more amicable, even light-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?'' asked Lindsey Graham
(R-S.C.), one of the few members on the committee who appears not
to have made up his mind about whether the president should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   If the charges amount only to the president lying about a sexual
affair, Graham said, he would not support impeachment. But if the
evidence shows the president ran a criminal enterprise from the
Oval Office, then he would have no other choice but to support
impeachment. ``It would be Richard Nixon times 10,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the elegant three-story high Judiciary Committee
chambers, reporters and camera crews started lining up for position
early Monday morning. Inside, the speeches were passionate at times
and off course at other moments. James Madison and Thomas Paine
were among the favorites to quote. There was even a comparison
between the current scandal and Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Three White House aides monitored the hearing from the third row
of the audience, sitting right next to Republican investigators. At
the close of the day, both sides were attempting to control the
outcome of the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears what (David) Schippers has done is to replace the
most serious of Starr's allegations and replace them with a
multiplicity of less serious charges that while perhaps easier to
prove are less serious in nature,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for
the Democrats on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican staffers countered by saying the sheer number of
charges indicated the gravity of the position faced by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of nearly 11 hours of fiesty debate, Hyde brought the
proceedings to a surprising close when he told his committee
members that he had a very important announcement: Please, he said,
do not miss the committee's photo session on Wednesday morning.

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the century
is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians at the
end of the 19th century, with their seances and their interest in
the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very strange
stuff.
 &HT;    Witness the current and future spate of movies dealing with
death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
 &HT;    Just out is Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a
romantic drama complete with special effects, set in the afterlife.
Williams literally goes through hell to be reunited with his former
wife and soulmate (Annabella Sciorra).
 &HT;    He's in heaven after dying in a car crash. His wife, however, is
down below _ after killing herself from grief at losing her husband
and family. Robin makes the journey from paradise to the underworld
to rescue his true love.
 &HT;    In November, Brad Pitt plays the Grim Reaper himself in the very
offbeat ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the l934 Frederic March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death assumes the face of the
recently killed Pitt, who while vacationing from his gruesome
duties falls madly in love with businessman Anthony Hopkins'
daughter (Claire Forlani) and discovers there's more to life than
death.
 &HT;    ``There was much talk of death on the set and how we would like
to die,'' recalls Hopkins, who last worked with Pitt in the movie
``Legends of the Fall.''
 &HT;    Pitt may seem rather unlikely casting for a fellow usually
depicted in a hooded robe carrying a scythe, but Hollywood seems to
have a penchant for turning death into a pretty face. Remember
Robert Redford as the unwelcome visitor to a very old lady played
by Gladys Cooper in an early episode of ``The Twilight Zone''?.
 &HT;    Director Martin Brest says they chose Pitt to avoid being
gruesome and heavy handed about the topic. ``I thought Brad had
that slightly otherworldly presence we needed,'' he told
Entertainment Weekly.
 &HT;    Nicole Kidman also takes a foray into the realm of the
supernatural, teaming up with Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic,'' a spiritual tale about two women who happen to be New
England witches. The film, which opens Oct. 9, is based on Alice
Hoffman's novel.
 &HT;    Also upcoming (Nov. 6) is ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as
a musician who dies in a Christmas car crash and comes back to life
... as a snowman. ``He's a funny, hip guy,'' says Keaton, ``who's
been transferred to a new body and finds cool things to do with
it.'' (That's cool as in snow, presumably). Keaton stepped into
this role after George Clooney, who took over from Keaton as
Batman, dropped out.
 &HT;    Earlier this year Nicholas Cage stepped out of the afterlife in
``City of Angels,'' as the angelic being who falls in love with
surgeon Meg Ryan and decides he wants to enjoy earthly joys with
her. He makes it back in the land of living _ just as Meg
unfortunately exits. The weepy romance was quite a hit among teens.
 &HT;    Woody Allen, for whom a preoccupation with dying is nothing new,
this past year gave us ``Deconstructing Harry,'' which included his
rather hilarious descent by elevator into hell, accompanied by Old
Nick himself, played by Billy Crystal.
 &HT;    Of course, Hollywood long ago learned that movies about dying
can be very profitable. Films like ``Ordinary People'' (1980),
``Terms of Endearment'' (1983) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993) all told
stories in which key characters died.
 &HT;    In the same vein, Meryl Streep plays a mother dying of cancer in
``One True Thing,'' based on Anna Quindlan's l995 novel. The
performance will certainly earn Streep another Oscar nomination for
best actress.
 &HT;    In the tearjerker ``Stepmom'' (opening in December), Susan
Sarandon is a wife and mother who discovers she's dying and
reluctantly coaches her ex's new wife Julia Roberts to step into
her shoes.
 &HT;    And in ``The Theory of Flight'' (opening, believe it or not, on
Christmas Day) Helena Bonham Carter is dying of a neurological
disease and must use a wheelchair. She wants to lose her virginity
before she dies _ and asks Kenneth Branagh to help her achieve her
goal. (This is the couple's first on screen pairing since their
offscreen romance went public.)
 &HT;    In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams is back as a doctor who tries
to treat his terminally ill patients with humor, ``looking at death
lightheartedly,'' as the actor puts it. In l999 Williams will show
up in ``Jakob The Liar,'' this time a cheery story about death and
the Warsaw ghetto. ``Yeah--that was a nice double bill,'' he muses,
``to go from 'Dreams' to 'Jakob the Liar.'''
 &HT;    How are we expected to take all this dwelling on the dark side
without running from the theater in panic? Meryl Streep for one
thinks the answer is perfectly natural. ``We need to feel something
when we go to movies,'' she says. ``We need to cry ... It's OK.''
 &HT;    She cites ``Titanic'' as the ideal death movie. ``Leonardo
DiCaprio goes down in the depths and the kids cry and they put down
their money to go again and again.''

<P>
   Drive down most residential streets on a Saturday morning and
you're likely to see perfectly ordinary people hawking lava lamps,
end tables, bicycles and books.
</P>
<P>
   Done well, a garage sale can rack up $500 to $1,300 in profits
over a weekend and just about anything can sell, says Peggy
Hitchcock of Lantana, Fla., author of ``The Garage Sale Handbook''
(Pilot Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman who held a garage sale in her upscale neighborhood
advertised a blue toilet,'' says Hitchcock. ``People came just to
see that blue toilet and someone bought it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more than the unusual changes hands at garage sales,
though, says Hitchcock. ``Approach having a garage sale like you
would any other business transaction and you will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The secrets to a profitable garage sale are simple, but
critical, says Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   First have enough merchandise to offer; at least 100 items are
needed to make a sale worthwhile, as about half of them will only
be worth $1 or less. If you don't have enough items on your own,
talk to friends and neighbors to see if they will donate things or
at least give them to you on consignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take some time cleaning items up and you'll easily double your
sales,'' says Hitchcock. ``No one wants to buy a mixer with pancake
batter on the side no matter how well it's priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Says 30-year veteran garage-saler, Yvonne Ray of Santa Ana,
Calif.: ``If I walk up to a garage sale and there's clothes laying
all over the ground, mud caked on the bicycles and dust on the
dishes, I just leave. Things need to be neat and clean.'' At her
most recent sale she earned over $700, not including the sale of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being clean, things should be well displayed. ``No one
wants to stoop down and rifle through boxes of junk,'' says
Hitchcock. ``Borrow card tables so that you can get things up off
the ground, or get sturdy boxes from the grocery store, which can
be taped together to create disposable tables. Don't dump clothes
in a box. Rig up a clothesline. The idea is to make things easy to
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Also provide shoppers with a way to test mechanical merchandise,
says Richard Harris, co-owner of Harris &AMP; Small Antiques in Mission
Viejo, Calif., who has gone garage-saling just about every weekend
for the last 20 years. He also recently held a garage sale where he
sold all but two items and made $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run an extension cord out to the driveway so that people can
test things like radios and kitchen appliances, or provide
batteries,'' he says. ``Just telling people something works isn't
very effective, because they will tend to doubt you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most challenging aspects of setting up a garage sale
is pricing the items. Although some people skip this step, most
experts advise against it. ``Many shoppers won't ask how much
something is,'' says Hitchcock. ``They'll just assume it's too
expensive and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray agrees. ``I won't buy anything unless it's marked, because I
don't like the fact that people could decide how much I should pay
by the car I'm driving or what I'm wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   When pricing items, remember your customers are thrifty souls in
search of the ultimate deal. ``The whole purpose of going to garage
sales is to find really great deals, and it can be addicting,''
says Ray. ``This past summer I wanted an iced tea maker, but I
didn't want to pay full price, so I looked at garage sales and
found one for $5.00, but I didn't stop there. I found two more at
other garages sales for the same price and ending up buying them
all and giving two away.''
</P>
<P>
   When pricing merchandise, Hitchcock suggests employing the 20
percent rule. ``If you bought an item like an electric knife for
$15 and it's brand new and never been used, then 20 percent of $15
is $3, she says. ``If it's still in the cellophane, you may be able
to go to $5, and if it's used, but still clean and in good shape,
then it will probably sell for $2. If you're not sure on some
items, look up what they would cost new in a catalogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20 percent rule doesn't work for all items, including
clothing, which should be priced very low, often for 50 cents to $1
or $2 a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that garage-salers like to bargain. ``If you want
$5 for something, ask $7,'' says Harris. ``Virtually no one will
want to give you what you ask, because they want to believe that
they're getting a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When you price items, also think about how far you're willing to
go down in price, says Hitchcock. ``If someone says something isn't
worth $2 and they offer 25 cents, decide if you'll accept that,''
she says. ``Sometimes I suggest telling customers to come back
later and if the item is still there, you'll sell it to them for
the reduced price.''
</P>
<P>
   For a more expensive item, offer to take the person's number and
call if it doesn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   In order to attract a crowd to your sale, it's a good idea to
advertise in the local newspaper, says Hitchcock. When you
advertise, highlight items that people might find of interest such
as children's toys, baby items, kitchen appliances, furniture and
unusual, hard-to-find things. You can also advertise for free at
grocery stores. When possible, instead of using index cards, make
your own flier announcing the sale. If you must use cards, opt for
neon colored ones rather than white.
</P>
<P>
   Good signs placed within a mile radius of your home can also
make or break a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better the sign, the easier it is to find the sale and the
more intrigued your customers will be,'' says Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Take some time making the signs, because they will serve as the
first impression you give potential customers. A brightly colored,
easy-to-read sign made on poster board with black magic marker is
much more impressive than a scribbled scrap of cardboard or a paper
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rise early the day of the sale because serious garage-salers
will be out as soon as it's light, and the first two hours is when
you'll make most of your money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you say 8 a.m., people will pound on your door at 6,''
warns Harris. Also make sure there are at least two of you working,
so that one person can answer questions while the other collects
money. And have a lot of change on hand, because most people will
have $20 bills.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids and sex? You've got to be kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! It takes a lot of years to develop a healthy attitude
about sex as well as a healthy sexual life. This process starts at
birth, so right from the beginning you need to help your child
build good feelings about the enjoyment he can get from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're not talking about sexual intercourse here. You
need a mature body (and, one hopes, a mature mind) to participate
in intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   But sexuality includes much more than just the sex act. It is
built upon all the kisses and caresses, sensuality and
satisfaction, and attachment and affection that you and your child
experience in your relationship with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see what's going on in your child's sexual development as
he matures, age by age.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Birth to 1 1/2 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Babies link pleasure with physical attention. All of the
sensitive physical attention you give to your little one (feeding
her, holding her, stroking her skin, washing her) helps her to
develop good feelings about her body and teaches her to associate
these good feelings with someone she loves.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that most of a baby's happiness and desire centers on
sucking, whether she is breast-fed or bottle-fed with formula.
(Many women report enjoyable sensual feelings when they
breast-feed. These feelings are completely normal and attest to the
fact that mothers and their children are connected through
pleasure.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all babies have an easy beginning. So don't be worried if
your little one is colicky and it takes some time for her
gastrointestinal system to settle down. As soon as she gets
comfortable, her pleasant feelings will grow and she'll begin to
make all of the right connections.
</P>
<P>
   And fathers, don't forget that by holding, caressing and
diapering your child you are strengthening her bond to you, as well
as your bond to her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 1/2 to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now he can use his hands to explore his own body and _ if he's
not given limits _ other people's bodies as well. Bottoms become
particularly fascinating to a toddler because toilet training is a
developmental goal and bottoms receive a lot of family attention.
</P>
<P>
   Kids this age are interested in all kinds of bodily functions.
Their explorations are a normal expression of their increased
intellectual curiosity and greater physical capabilities. So this
is the time to let your child know that he's in control of his body
and that it's OK to explore it.
</P>
<P>
   But you also need to begin to discuss some appropriate limits.
(``We call them private parts because we show and touch them only
when we're in private.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's important, also, to be matter-of- fact about the bodily
sensations you observe your toddler enjoying. (``I know it feels
good, but you can't touch yourself at the dinner table. That is
something you can do when you're alone.'')
</P>
<P>
   Too shocked or severe a reaction (``Stop it right now!'')
interferes with your toddler's ability to feel good about his body
and makes sexuality ``bad'' and guilt-ridden. On the other hand,
too indulgent a response or no response at all doesn't help your
child learn acceptable and civilized behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now, your child has a fairly good idea about the anatomical
distinction between girls' and boys' bodies. Children from 3 to 6
years old often try to supplement their knowledge with mutual sex
play, so keep your eye on kids who disappear into a bathroom or
closet together on play-dates since they may be playing doctor.
</P>
<P>
   While this play is normal, children are frequently interested in
inserting a pencil or crayon into a vagina or rectum and can hurt
each other with their prying and poking.
</P>
<P>
   It's rarely the case that this kind of sex play is fully
consensual. Rather, one bolder, more curious or more aggressive
child often initiates the activity and/or dominates the other child
_ a potentially anxiety-producing scenario. If you catch your kids
``in the act,'' set a firm but matter-of-fact limit (``You can
pretend to be a doctor, but actually touching each others' private
parts is not allowed'').
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers also become aware now that there is a certain kind
of relationship between their parents from which they are excluded,
and they are very curious about what this relationship entails.
Most children will raise questions on their own, but if your child
hasn't begun asking by age 7, a book can help you jump-start a
conversation. Try ``How Babies Are Made'' by Andrew Andry and
Steven Schepp (Little, Brown, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6 to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the age of pals and best friends, a stage that serves as
a precursor to the more intimate puppylove relationships of the
preteen years and to the passions of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes girls seem to become more ``girly'' and boys more
``boyish'' at this stage, as each gender begins to learn more about
social expectations and to adopt social roles.
</P>
<P>
   Identification with family members becomes more important, and
girls and boys this age are likely to show increased interest in
your work, your life when you were a child, and your family's
history. This helps them to develop a firmer sense of their own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Because some anxieties are already beginning to build around
sexuality, sexual topics may inspire a lot of silliness, innuendo,
or even vulgarity from children this age. This can be unpleasant,
but it's pretty normal. Some 8- to 10-year-old girls pointedly
reject boys (``We hate boys'') and vice versa (``Girls are
stupid''), but other boys and girls seem to be comfortable with
opposite-sex friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time to expand your discussion of sexual basics
with your child because he's likely to have been exposed through
friends and the media to information be doesn't understand.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all seen the studies on the number of murders a child will
see on television before he turns 18. We've heard how today's kids
are out of shape because they spend too much time on the couch. And
_ most telling _ we've seen the effects of too much television
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   One mom calls it ``the zombie stare'' _ the look that comes over
her 7-year-old when he watches Saturday-morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, too, that TV, just like chocolate (thank heavens!),
isn't all bad. As with most things, moderation is the key. In fact,
if we use it wisely, television can open up exciting new worlds for
our kids.
</P>
<P>
   How? Marguerite Kelly, mother of four grown children and
coauthor of ``The Mother's Almanac'' (Doubleday, 1975), has some
helpful words on this subject that concerns many parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear so much about how TV is bad for kids. What's the best
thing about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Television can inspire. It can make a kid curious. It can
also be a great bonding time for parents and kids. But parents have
to make sure that happens. Watch with your kids. In a subtle way,
you can use a show as a springboard for family discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much TV should children watch?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think five to seven hours per week is plenty for kids under
7. For older kids, eight to 10 hours seems about right. Have your
kids look through the television schedule and mark their shows for
the week. It certainly helps build their negotiation skills!
</P>
<P>
   Q: How important is it for parents to set a good example when it
comes to TV viewing?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very important. Kids pay much more attention to what we
do than to what we say. Make sure your kids see you doing lots of
enjoyable things other than watching TV _ reading books, enjoying
hobbies, even just getting out of the house for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My child is afraid of some of the things on the 6 o'clock
news. Frankly, so am I! How do I handle this?
</P>
<P>
   A: More and more parents are not allowing their 6-, 7- and
8-year-olds to watch television news, and I think that's wise. The
murder rate in this country is way down, but you wouldn't know it
from watching the news. If you feel your kids are mature enough,
watch it with them and emphasize that murders, etc. are shown
because they're unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the ``arsenic hour'' o when everyone is tired and
cranky and parents are trying to get dinner on the table?
</P>
<P>
   A: Beware of prime-time shows that are shown during the dinner
hour as reruns. For example, ``Seinfeld'' is a terrific show, but
obviously it's not appropriate for young children. The problem is,
it appears all over the country now in dinner-hour reruns. As
always, you have to monitor what your kids are watching.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, borrow videos from the library _ ``Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,'' ``Harriet the Spy,'' ``Beauty
and the Beast'' _ and watch one for 20 or 30 minutes each night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we make our kids more critical viewers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Laugh at TV! Make fun of it. Make your child feel like he's
in on the joke when you explain how dumb some shows are. Parents
don't realize how much influence they have with their children.
Make your child feel accepted on your intellectual level when
you're discussing the merits of a show. Ask her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your strongest piece of advice to parents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Never have a television in a child's bedroom. This tears the
fabric of the family, because it puts parents and children on a
different track. And it separates the family. Everyone goes into
their cells after feeding hour!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's a good way to turn TV viewing into an ongoing family
experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: Have a weekly ``Family Hang-Out Night.'' Parents can
designate one night each week when the family sits down to watch a
show that everyone's agreed on. Watch the same show each week. Make
popcorn or a snack the kids can prepare on their own or with your
help. Don't answer the phone. Afterwards, families can read
together or play a game or take a walk. Everyone will look forward
to the ritual and the shared time together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to judge a TV show?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the characters on the show came to your front door, would
you let them in? If not, change the channel!

   THE RATINGS:
</P>
<P>
   Confused about the ``Educational/Informational'' rating on kids'
TV shows? You're not alone. Here are a few tips to help make sense
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed a small ``E/I'' symbol in your TV
listing and at the beginning of some of your kids' favorite shows.
According to the FCC, network broadcasters must now provide _ and
use this symbol to identify _ at least three hours per week of
programming that ``educates and informs'' children under age 16.
Cable services are not included.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's move is good news, says Alice Cahn, director of
children's programming for PBS. But parents still need to be
watchful, she adds. ``It's like when my nephew comes to my house
and I ask him to wash his hands before dinner and he comes to the
table with only the ``front'' of his hands washed. Then he says
'But I only use the front of my hands when I eat!'''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to broadcasters' compliance with the FCC's ruling,
``There's the spirit of the law and then there's the letter of the
law,'' says Cahn. ``We need to hold all broadcasters to a higher
standard of product safety, just as we would for toy safety or
anything else that affects our children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So looking for the E/I symbol is a good beginning. But don't
stop there. Here are some other suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the E/I symbol as a starting point in helping your child
choose appropriate shows. ``Then check out the show for yourself,''
says Cahn. ``Say to yourself, 'Here's my library of shows. Now I'm
going to pick three.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for shows that make learning fun. ``Every good teacher
you ever had proved that good education is entertaining,'' says
Cahn. ``The same holds true for TV It shouldn't have to be boring
to be informative.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Use TV as a springboard. ``After a kid watches a show on PBS,
for example, he should have a great idea for an activity to do.
That's what TV should offer kids. They should want to turn off the
TV and go *do* something!'' _ Kathy Sena

London 
 By JACOB WEISBERG 
 c.1998 Slate 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Since plans for Britain's Millennium Dome began to take shape
last year, condemnation has poured in from all sides. Left-wing
critics are appalled at the waste of $1.3 billion that could have
gone toward housing and the National Health Service. Conservatives
object to the Blair government's attempt to present England as a
modern, multicultural nation instead of a tradition-bound,
Christian one. With the help of constant attacks from all sides,
the dome's approval rating fell to 8 percent in one recent
poll--lower than Monica's, Ken's, or even Linda's. The only people
in London who don't heap scorn on it are those who complain they're
too tired of the topic to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the chance that something so despised might deserve
defending, I put on a hard hat and rubber boots and went to look at
the construction site in Greenwich, just outside London, this week.
(Sept. 21) (Because the world's clocks are fixed to Greenwich Mean
Time, this is the spot where the millennium can be argued to
officially debut.)
</P>
<P>
   As I half suspected, the dome is better than advertised. As a
building, it is stunning. As the site of the main international
event of the Year 2000, it may or may not succeed. But the dome has
at least a chance to follow in the path of its illustrious English
ancestors, the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851 and the Festival
of Britain of 1951. Those events, too, were derided in advance as
wasteful and stupid. But they are remembered now as monumental
expressions of British identity and historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   As a feat of architecture, engineering, and urban renewal, the
dome is already close to being a success. John Major's Tory
government first conceived of the project, and Labor was officially
opposed before it took power, so until 1997, no one knew what would
happen. Once Tony Blair decided to make the dome a kind of
signature for ``New Labor,'' there were just three years to plan
and build one of the largest structures on earth--on a contaminated
gasworks site. Before construction could begin, the ground below
literally had to be washed to remove cyanide and arsenic. Engineers
then went about raising a room of nearly a million square feet.
This is a structure so huge that, according to Anthony Day, the
retired architect who gave me a tour, weather systems would form
inside if not for the high-tech fiberglass and Teflon double skin.
Day suggests that winter visitors will want to bring overcoats and
brandy flasks, because the building is simply too big to heat
(though I suspect the Brits like it that way).
</P>
<P>
   Even if the exhibition fails to draw the hoped-for 15 million
visitors, it will be responsible for turning hundreds of acres of
industrial wasteland into a lovely spot on the Thames linked to the
rest of the metropolis by the Underground.
</P>
<P>
   This follows the urban planning ideas of Britain's most famous
architect, Richard Rogers, who is responsible for the dome. Rogers
believes that London, like many of the world's great cities, is
being undone by traffic and unplanned sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   He argues in a recent book, ``Cities for a Small Planet''
(Westview Press, 1998), that the way to rescue London is to reduce
car traffic; develop new neighborhoods for mixed use; and convert
the city's greatest natural asset, the Thames riverbank, into
public space. If successful, the dome will make the case for
pursuing Rogers' grander vision--turning the Thames Embankment, now
a highway along the river, into a grand park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rogers' best-known building, the Pompidou Center in Paris,
the dome is drawn in brilliant color, which jumps out against the
London drab like a brightly frosted cake. The Italian-born
architect's other hallmark, of which the Lloyd's of London
headquarters is the leading example, is for a building to show how
it works, exposing its elevators, ventilation pipes, and structural
girders.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, at a glance from the outside, how the dome stands
up. Its huge tent is sustained by brilliant yellow tent poles,
nearly 300 feet high and stitched together with steel cables. From
the overlooking hill of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, the
structure looks like a whimsical sea monster that crawled out of
the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   The chief fault of Rogers' other buildings is that they don't
age well--many of the better known ones have an early '80s, ``new
wave'' look. But the dome has the advantage of being temporary. The
millennium exhibition will last a year, and though the structure
may be converted to another use, it's only supposed to last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The tent is beautiful empty--David Hockney, the painter, was
recently quoted proposing that it be left that way. And members of
the planning committee may privately share that wish. Almost every
decision about how to fill the space has aroused controversy. The
most ridiculed proposal is ``Body,'' a gargantuan naked human
people can walk through, observing the operation of the internal
organs as in a Rogers building. Leaving Dome Person unsexed on the
exterior seems overly prudish. But the alternative of
Brobdingnagian genitalia and python-size pubic hairs could be hard
to stomach, even after the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge may be the least futuristic part of the
exhibition--the ``National Identity'' section, for which the
committee has yet to announce any kind of plan. In deciding what to
put here, Britain will be describing itself to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In previous great exhibitions, this was a less complicated
issue. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1851, Britain
was an imperial power with a unitary culture. A great exhibition
was a chance to dazzle with what it could make and build, beginning
with the glass and iron Crystal Palace itself, a marvel of early
Victorian engineering. The 1951 Festival of Britain (organized by
the grandfather of the Labor minister now in charge of the
Millennium Dome) still represented a culturally homogenous,
industrial country. It displayed thousands of British-made things,
heralding the emergence from wartime rationing into postwar
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Britain is increasingly an immigrant nation with an
emerging postindustrial economy. It depends far more on the export
of services and its culture than it does on its goods. The Blair
government has invested its prestige in the dome because it sees it
as an opportunity to convey this new social and economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the Cabinet member in charge of the millennium
project, was lampooned for traveling to Disney World in search of
ideas. But an excess of popular appeal is less likely than an
overinfusion of centrist political ideology. Blair loves to say
that he sees Britain as a dynamic, forward-looking and
multicultural society. Laborites talk unblushingly about
``re-branding'' the country. To New Labor, the dome is a great
marketing opportunity. Which makes it, in a way, an authentic
expression of the spirit of the age.

HILLERMAN MYSTERY DOESN'T MATCH INTENSITY OF ORIGINAL NAVAJO
TALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
THE FIRST EAGLE 
Tony Hillerman (HarperCollins, $25) 
 
 By BETTY REID  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The First Eagle,'' Tony Hillerman's latest mystery novel,
doesn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal fleas, eagle poaching, a missing woman and murder are
blended in the mystery story that stretches from a place called
Yells Back Butte near Black Mesa, to Kaibeto, Cedar Ridge and
Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   They're familiar sites throughout the land where my relatives
have herded sheep for decades. I wanted to like this story.
</P>
<P>
   And the story line is interesting at times. Jim Chee, now acting
lieutenant with the Tuba City Police Department, seems to have a
perfect murder case. He nabs a Hopi eagle poacher hunched over the
body of a tribal police officer. The poacher's blood is mixed with
the officer's.
</P>
<P>
   The missing woman is Catherine Pollard, a ``flea catcher''
biologist with the Arizona Health Department who is collecting
bubonic plague-carrying fleas from desert rodents. She vanishes in
the area where Chee arrested the Hopi.
</P>
<P>
   As with Hillerman's ``Skinwalkers,'' the book failed to grab me
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to read ``Skinwalkers'' on a cold winter Fort Defiance
night in the late 1980s, ready for a good scare. For traditional
Navajos, skinwalkers are terrible creatures bent on harm. His book
should have kept me awake, jumping at noises in the night.
</P>
<P>
   It failed to turn my legs to jelly or send tingly goose bumps
down my spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Eagle'' similarly falls short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I stopped reading ``The First Eagle'' at first, finding
it a slow and pondering story without enough ``whodunit'' intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of when I was an adolescent living near the
western edge of the Navajo Reservation. As a young shepherd, I
dreaded herding sheep through endless gnarled twists and turns of
plunging rocky canyons and washes. By the time I chased my mother's
sheep and goats home, my stiff legs ached.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a month to finish ``The First Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, I give credit to Hillerman for heightening public
awareness of the Navajo people during the past two decades. Many of
his novels portray a humane account of the ``Dine,'' the people,
who thrive on a remote landscape with awesome scenery, wash-boarded
dirt roads and sometimes blinding windstorms.
</P>
<P>
   And it's noble of Hillerman to dedicate ``The First Eagle'' to
seven fallen Navajo police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But the book jumps around so much you sometimes feel you're
riding on one of those reservation roads.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer raised on a dose of traditional Navajo religion
south of Cedar Ridge and west of Black Mesa, the dark side of
Navajo belief was etched into my brain. Much of that was eclipsed
by a modern education, yet I'm always curious about English
descriptions of my childhood fears about werewolves and
skinwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of those fears are fairly rare _ the works of cultural
anthropologists and Hillerman's novels _ and often fail to capture
the essence of our beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm a closet Stephen King fan, but when I read about my
childhood fears, I expect it to draw a ``Yiya!'' out of me.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The First Eagle,'' a reference is made to the sighting of a
skinwalker that glints like a flashbulb during the day. We find out
later that it is the glare off a spacesuitlike protective cover
that flea catchers wear in the field.
</P>
<P>
   No ``Yiya'' there.
</P>
<P>
   I compare that to the bone-chilling stories from my aunt and
mother, who still tend sheep on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about skinwalkers in our native Navajo language,
we don't wait for the end before hunting down a medicine man to
restore harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Language, I believe, is key to writing bone-chilling Navajo
skinwalker stories. Hillerman just does not capture it in his books
and I'm not sure if any writer ever will. &QL;

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN AMERICAN KILLING &QL; 
 &UR; Mary-Ann Tirone Smith (Holt, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and kinky sex co-exist in the first chapter of this
suspense novel, but they have nothing more in common than the man
who knew them both: womanizing Congressman Owen Allen Hall, who has
turned up dead under embarrassing circumstances. At his memorial
service, we meet Hall's former lover and our narrator, Denise
Burke, who is a bestselling true-crime writer and wife of one of
Clinton's close advisers. The book works backward from there, with
Denise telling the story of her relationship with Hall, which
begins when he asks her to look into a triple murder in his Rhode
Island hometown. The man convicted of the killings might be
innocent, Hall tells her, and Denise is off on an investigation
that will transform the image of a harmonious, racially diverse
community into one of violence, corruption and deceit. The plot is
sometimes too involved, and Denise has a tendency to be slow on the
uptake. But her narration is witty and appealing enough to carry
the day if Smith does the obvious and brings her back for a
sequel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CINDERELLA &AMP; COMPANY &QL; 
 &UR; Manuela Hoelterhoff (Knopf, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book of fiction, but it does have characters. One
is the sultry-eyed superstar you see on the cover. Another is the
author, whose unsparing, wickedly funny voice is a presence in
itself, delectable and not altogether unkind. She harbors, in fact,
a considerable amount of sympathy for the young opera singers of
today, who are judged as much for their looks and personality as
for the notes they sing. Cecilia Bartoli allowed Hoelterhoff to
follow her around through two seasons between ``Cenerentola'' in
Houston in 1995 and ``Cenerentola'' at the Metropolitan Opera in
1997. The result is this flamboyant behind-the-scenes look at a
competitive world of big money, big marketing, big egos and big
pressure that is often difficult for young singers to handle.
Hoelterhoff is irreverent about most of it _ she even includes the
``typical diva diet,'' which begins in the morning with half a
grapefruit and builds crescendolike to an entire Sara Lee
cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer at night. It's great fun
and would have been even better if it had an index so we'd have a
direct route to the gossip. Hoelterhoff won a Pulitzer Prize for
her opera reviews for the ``Wall Street Journal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE POISONWOOD BIBLE &QL; 
 &UR; Barbara Kingsolver (HarperFlamingo, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver's fans will be astonished by this, her biggest and
most ambitious novel, one that takes us far from the Southwestern
settings of her other books (``Pigs in Heaven,'' ``Animal Dreams'')
into the political and moral ramifications of the American presence
on another continent. It is 1959, and evangelical Baptist Nathan
Price has taken his family _ his wife and four daughters ranging
from 5 to 15 _ from their home in Georgia to the African Congo,
where they serve as missionaries in a village that does not welcome
their coming. Nathan's bold and irrational act is set against
political upheaval in the Congo, but he is so driven by
righteousness that he will not back down. His wife and daughters
have the grace to be less sure of what they've done, and it is
their voices that tell the story. Kingsolver does a masterful job
of moving from one daughter to another, establishing in their
narrations their differing temperaments, rivalries and reactions to
the village and its culture. But the best chapters belong to the
mother, Orleanna, who is vulnerable in her love for her daughters
and bears grief with breathtaking grace. As are all of Kingsolver's
novels, this one is thick with social conscience, perhaps too much
so in a few chapters when her characters seem like temporary props
in a retelling of the Congo's tragedy. Kingsolver would never
apologize for this, but it is not her strength. That lies in her
lovely renderings of universal experiences _ the daunting duties of
a mother to her children, the charged ambivalence between one
sibling and another, the faltering esteem between a husband and a
wife. It's not new territory for Kingsolver, but nowhere has she
portrayed it so well. She will read and discuss her book at 2 p.m.
Oct. 25 at Changing Hands Bookstore, 6430 S. McClintock Drive,
Tempe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE NOT SO BIG HOUSE &QL; 
 &UR; Sarah Susanka (Taunton, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Susanka, an architect based in Minnesota, is here with a
soothing and persuasive message: Your house does not have to be big
to make you happy. It is possible, in fact, to be miserable in a
big house if it is full of wasted space and does not suit your
lifestyle. Spend your money on quality, not quantity, she says, and
build a home that accommodates your habits. How long has it been
since you used your formal dining room? Do you live in your living
room or in your family room? Why spend so much square footage on
rooms that see so little use? She suggests making a list of the
rooms in your house, their size and what happens in each, and then
ranking them from most-used to least-used. You'll probably find
many of the biggest rooms at the end of the list. And here's a
shocking suggestion: Cut back on bathrooms. They're expensive,
given the amount of time we spend in them each day. All of this, of
course, is especially appealing because Susanka is arguing that
less _ if it's well considered _ is more. And easier on the budget
too. &QL;

IT TAKES SOME EFFORT TO MAKE YOGA WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Relaxing isn't as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Try sitting still for 10 minutes and emptying your mind. It's
tough. You'll find yourself twitching, itching and looking at the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I did two weeks ago at my first yoga class. I was so
impatient during the meditation that my instructor had to signal me
to lie down again. ``It does get easier,'' Lenore Reinhard said.
</P>
<P>
   She's been practicing yoga for five years and knows how
difficult it is to let go of stress and schedules in a busy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an adult, it takes so long to quiet the mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga has long had the reputation of being a spiritual exercise,
a path to enlightenment, serenity and bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's no longer so esoteric. Browse through the magazines
in the supermarket line or turn on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and
you'll see yoga being touted as an age-old solution to modern-day
problems and the key to good health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Even Oprah has demonstrated the postures of yoga on her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks to a need that has been overlooked,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Holt, an Albany psychiatrist who has been practicing yoga
for almost 25 years. ``If it's done correctly, it helps de-stress
the body and has beneficial effects on practically all the
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommends it to his patients as part of a stress management
program.
</P>
<P>
   Stress has been linked to a host of health problems, including
heart attacks, high blood pressure and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that yoga, with its focus on breathing and
meditation, does have immediate, measurable health benefits, such
as lowering blood pressure, heart rate and metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   The physical postures also are helpful in promoting strength and
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoga will give good flexibility, toning and make you feel very
rejuvenated,'' said Dr. Kumuda Reddy, a former anesthesiologist at
Albany Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   On a cautionary note, she warns against forcing the body into
certain yoga postures. ``You should never push yourself,'' she
said. ``The important thing is to listen to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Reddy practices Maharishi Ayur-Veda, a holistic approach to
health care that integrates yoga into a daily regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the union of mind, body and spirit,'' she said. ``There
is a peacefulness that grows as one does yoga on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the key.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga requires a commitment to the moment, not what you did
during the day or have to do when you finish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an aerobics class, you won't get the full health benefits
if you let yourself be distracted by the pressures of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to just simply be there and let it happen,'' Reddy
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, that's easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very stress-ridden society,'' said Mehlli Bhagalia,
who teaches yoga at the Ayurveda Yoga Institute in Schenectady,
N.Y. ``Very few people are able to uncomplicate their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoga, however, seems like a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it almost daily,'' Reinhard, 55, said. ``I certainly can
see that added flexibility and the strength, and you do get the
tone and definition.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Reinhard believes yoga has given her an
effective way of handling stress. In tense moments, she breathes a
little deeper and always feels a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very calming,'' Reinhard said.

VIAGRA CRAZE PROMPTS NEW INTEREST IN SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All the talk about Viagra and male impotence may
be overshadowing the emerging reality that sexual dysfunction in
women appears to be more widespread and just as treatable.
</P>
<P>
   Once chalked up to psychological problems or dismissed as an
unavoidable result of menopause, female sexual dysfunction is
getting increased attention from the medical establishment.
Researchers are finding that it often has a physical basis, and
drug companies are right behind them, developing therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Some treatments, such as the use of testosterone for menopausal
women, have been around for years and were discussed Monday at the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in San
Francisco. Others are in development, based on the recent
recognition that obstruction of blood flow to the pelvic area may
be the root of some women's lack of sexual arousal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question used to be `Does it hurt?' and `Can you do
it?''' said Jennifer Berman, a sex therapist at the Women's Sexual
Health Clinic at Boston University Medical Center. ``Now it's `Are
you enjoying it?' and `Are you reaching orgasm?' We're at the dawn
of a new era in female sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   A large national survey in 1992 found a third of women
respondents lacked interest in sex. Newer figures compiled by Yale
University found that 60 percent of menopausal women were
dissatisfied with their sexual functioning. Especially distressed
were women who were accustomed to having active, satisfying sex
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many women who opt for hormone replacement therapy during and
after menopause receive only the female sex hormone estrogen. But
menopausal women also suffer diminished production of androgens
(male sex hormones) such as testosterone, known to play a key role
in sexual desire. Androgens are not routinely included in hormone
replacement therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria A. Bachmann, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J.,
said many of her patients had not wanted to take testosterone
because they were worried about masculinizing effects and did not
think their bodies produced it in the first place. Many women do
not realize that they normally have twice as much testosterone as
estrogen in their bloodstream, although still significantly less
than what is found in men.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that women who received estrogen and
testosterone reported feeling much better sexually than those who
received only estrogen. And because the dosages are low _ just
enough to replace the normal amount of testosterone lost with
menopause _ side effects are virtually nonexistent, according to
Morrie Gelfan, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at McGill
University in Montreal. He has been using androgens like
testosterone with his menopausal patients for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone also could be given to younger women who take birth
control pills or have other conditions leading to lower-than-normal
levels of the sex hormone, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other scientists are looking into whether Viagra, the
male impotence pill, might also help with female arousal problems.
It works by allowing more blood to flow to the genital area, but
has been tested only in men.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have shown a link between hardening of the
arteries in female animals and inhibited sexual arousal. And many
women who want help have the same profile as men who seek treatment
for impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptoms increase with risk factors like cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, obesity, smoking _ just the same as men's,''
said Laura Berman, Jennifer Berman's sister and a urologist at the
Women's Sexual Health Clinic in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic, more than 200 volunteers have signed up for the
first clinical trials of Viagra in women, she said. Coming up are
trials of other similar drugs administered either under the tongue,
or via topical treatments to the vaginal area. All are being
developed by drug companies because they have begun to see a large
potential market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant problem that affects the quality of life of
many women,'' Jennifer Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among young women with no history of sexual abuse or
identifiable physical problems, the chief complaint is an inability
to climax, or a prolonged time to climax, she said. For those
women, there isn't much that medicine can offer now, nor any
promising treatments on the horizon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Female sexual dysfunction was once considered the province of
psychology and attracted few medical researchers. But it has
recently blossomed enough to justify the first international
medical meeting on the subject later this month in Boston, Jennifer
Berman said. And another group is convening a task force to begin
to develop medical standards for treating, measuring and evaluating
women with sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical profession is just now getting on board with
this,'' Laura Berman said. ``In many ways, it's all brand new.''

A GREAT WOMAN, LOST IN THE PRIME OF HER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever since a tearful colleague phoned to tell me
that Caroline Drewes was dead, I've been hearing her gorgeous voice
in my head and seeing the honest-to-God light of vitality that
always surrounded her.
</P>
<P>
   That sound and vision do not jibe with a woman who goes out into
the setting sun to walk her dog and gets struck and killed by a car
_ which is what happened to Caroline in San Francisco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When she retired from the San Francisco Examiner in March 1992,
I wrote in Caroline's commemorative goodbye issue that she was
``quite simply, my idol.'' That declaration was based on several
aspects of her existence, not the least of which were her voice and
her light.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline's voice was pitched just low enough to be sexy,
intriguing and confidential, but not so low as to hint of too much
of anything _ whiskey, smoke-filled rooms, long nights, loud fights
or reckless living. Nothing about Caroline was ever excessive. As
I've replayed her voice in my head _ she seems always to be asking
a question that begins with my name _ I've heard music. Sensual yet
controlled music, precise but with a sway. Intelligent but earthy
music, unfailingly elegant but filled with desire.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Drewes had a voice like a tango.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that voice enhanced her already-keen abilities as an
interviewer. In the half-century that Caroline made her living as a
newspaper reporter (she took seven years off in the '40s to marry
and start a family), she interviewed everybody from Joe DiMaggio to
the Dalai Lama. They all trusted her and told her their secrets.
Somehow I believe they sensed that she would take care of their
words, wouldn't think of using them for cheap gain. They felt she
wouldn't betray them, and she never did.
</P>
<P>
   We who were fortunate enough to call Caroline ``colleague'' talk
about the ``poetry'' of her prose. (That we even use a term like
poetry in describing the stories of a daily journalist says as much
as anything about the special regard in which we held her work.)
Rereading some of my favorite pieces now, I think that Caroline
sounds like E.M. Forster at his very best: Straightforward, but
rich, evocative and wise.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sample from a story about a woman she met while living
in Vienna, a woman ``of reserve and an occasional disarming candor,
who always seemed hovering on the brink of something.'' It is
vintage Caroline: ``One late afternoon as a melancholy blue dusk
began to dim the great baroque city, at that hour when confidences
come unbidden, she related this vignette while we shared a glass of
wine and a conversation that had turned to love affairs: those we
remember with pleasure and no regrets, no pain. And the other
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about Caroline's light.
</P>
<P>
   Some might toss it off as ``beauty,'' for Caroline was, most
assuredly, a knockout. Until the day she died, she had the power to
do something every woman dreams of, whether we admit it or not: She
could walk into a room and people's heads would turn in her
direction. All people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   Usually draped in long, clingy, feminine fabrics of subdued
color or tasteful print, she swung oh-so-gracefully when she
walked. I cannot remember her in a pair of pants or all black. Her
posture was superb, like that of a queen or princess. Except
Caroline would be fun royalty, like Audrey Hepburn in ``Roman
Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   I once had dinner with a man who'd known Caroline since her
college years. He still called her by her childhood nickname,
Pommie. A big man, inclined toward cigars, brandy and all-men's
clubs, he recounted an evening, nearly five decades past, in which
a bunch of friends had gone skinny dipping in Lake Tahoe. With a
mesmerized, far-off look in his eyes, the man described following _
from a respectful 10 yards _ a naked and wet Caroline up a hill in
the moonlight. The reverence in his voice was of the quality most
of us reserve for the great pyramids or Renaissance art.
</P>
<P>
   She and her light had that effect on people. They will go on
having that effect. Caroline's brand of inner and exterior beauty,
her sophistication and impeccable taste, her pure heart and
insatiable curiosity about people and places, her passion for life
and her fierce loyalty to family and friends, was an exclusive.
I've never met anybody like her and I expect I never will.
</P>
<P>
   As my colleague and I were trying via telephone to comprehend
the news of Caroline's death, I said: ``Do you realize that we are
talking about an 81-year-old woman? Everything we are saying is
what you say when someone who's 30 gets taken out. We are talking
as though Caroline was cut down in the prime of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is exactly what happened. That's why none of
us who knew her can believe it quite yet. Until I no longer can
hear her voice or see her light, I simply refuse to believe it.
</P>
<P>

BRITAIN'S MARYLEBONE ADMITS WOMEN

<P>
   LONDON _ Tradition, under siege in tradition-bound England like
never before, took another one on the chin last week when the
venerable Marylebone Cricket Club lifted its 211-year-old ban
against women.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists thundered, sniffed and ordered another gin and
tonic, lamenting that yet another institution that defined a
time-honored vision of Englishness had been consumed by what
conservatives here call the madness of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary people, meanwhile, thought it was about time women
got in, or wondered why in the world anyone would want to join a
cricket club in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Marylebone, however, is not just any cricket club. It is the
guardian of cricket heritage around the world. It is to cricket
what Wimbledon is to tennis, what Cooperstown is to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to let women in ends a seven-year battle of the
sexes that was played out against the backdrop of Marylebone's
pristine pitch at Lord's Cricket Ground. Even Prime Minister Tony
Blair, always anxious to hype his Cool Britannia image, got
involved, urging the club to change its old fogey ways.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous attempts to admit women failed to get a two-thirds
majority of the club's 17,500 members _ average age 57 _ needed to
amend club rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's motion to let women in carried easily with
almost 70 percent voting in favor, club president Colin
Ingleby-Mackenzie diplomatically described the debate that preceded
it as ``acrimonious.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was Ingleby-Mackenzie's swan song. He retired the day
after succeeding in his campaign to get women in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for MCC and for cricket generally,'' he said.
``It's going to create a better atmosphere in the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ingleby-Mackenzie isn't exactly a model of political
correctness. In applauding the decision to end the all-male
bastion, he said, ``Women are a very fine species.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingleby-Mackenzie said there will be one concession to the
traditionalists: a small male-only bar at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael Heyhoe Flint, the former England women's captain,
triggered the controversy in 1991 when she applied for membership.
After the vote, Heyhoe Flint cried tears of joy. Others were crying
in their beer, or, more precisely, gin, which is the spirit of
choice at MCC.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters clamored around Heyhoe Flint, a middle-aged man
walked by and mumbled, ``Life as we know it is now over.''
</P>
<P>
   MCC got religion in a hurry. In 1991, only 33 percent voted to
let women in. By last February, it was up to 56 percent. Faced with
the loss of corporate sponsorship and lottery funds, the club spent
more than $100,000 to convince its members that it was time for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rea, the club's marketing director, candidly admitted,
``No sponsors want to be involved with an organization whose image
is elitist, fuddy-duddy and old-fartish.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of history being made, the victory seemed a
rather hollow one. While as many as 10 honorary women members will
be admitted over the next few months, and up to 60 female
cricketeers let in over the next few years, the rest will have to
get on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The average wait: 18 years.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi dropped a fashion bombshell on Oct. 1:
He said his 10-year-old business is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, a designer whose ebullient personality matched his
colorful clothing, said his partnership with Chanel was being
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, which has backed the business since 1992, is said to
have become increasingly impatient with its mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no spring 1999 Isaac Mizrahi Collection, and the
Isaac Mizrahi &AMP; Co. headquarters on Wooster Street in SoHo soon
will go dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little shocking, but that's life,'' an
uncharacteristically rueful Mizrahi told WWD just hours after he
broke the news to about 55 employees. ``It's all for the best. It's
a good decision, as painful as it was to make. I'm taking a break
and observing what fate has to offer me now. I feel very excited
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said it was a ``joint decision'' with Chanel to shut
down his fashion business. He said initially he plans to
concentrate on a multitude of ``promising'' entertainment ventures,
including film production and screenwriting. He's working on a
movie optioned by Dreamworks based on his comic book, ``The
Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also writing the third draft of a screenplay entitled
``Wild About Harry'' that has been optioned by Barry Sonnenfeld and
Disney; Mizrahi said he might star in it. He did not say
definitively if or when he would get back into the fashion
business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was searching for new financial backers to relaunch
a fashion business, he said he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, my first commitment has been to fashion, but
now I don't know,'' he said, sitting at the desk where he has done
dozens of interviews and where he was filmed for the 1995 movie
``Unzipped'' that catapulted him to fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always have a great love of fashion,'' he said. ``I
will always be a fashion designer, but I don't know what form it's
going to take. I'm really at this crossroads, and I'm going to
allow fate to take over. I can't fight fate. It's been the driving
force of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly as bewildered by his shocking announcement as the
fashion world, Mizrahi declined to predict what his future will
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a psychic. I don't know what I'm going to come back
as,'' he said. ``I don't envision myself six months from now or six
years from now. I just do. I solve creative problems. Right now,
what I want to do has to be culturally sound, whatever I do next.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the shutdown comes less than nine months after Mizrahi
closed his two-year-old Isaac bridge line, a venture initially
heralded as an enormous growth opportunity for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about 65 workers were laid off at Mizrahi's SoHo
headquarters and its warehouse in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel said on Oct. 1 that it is withdrawing its financial
backing because the Mizrahi's business volume was not large enough
to warrant Chanel's stake, which is believed to be approximately 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dissolving the partnership,'' said Michael Rena,
executive vice president of Chanel Inc. ``The volume was not big
enough to make it interesting for us or him to continue. He doesn't
need us. He doesn't need backers to have the kind of
entrepreneurial business he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chanel and Mizrahi declined to reveal Mizrahi's volume,
market sources said the business generated annual sales of roughly
$50 million before the Isaac bridge line was closed last year.
Isaac was believed to have accounted for less than half of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rena declined to say how much Chanel had invested in the Mizrahi
business in the last six years, but confirmed Chanel had ``lost
money'' on its overall investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Mizrahi business was profitable in the early years of the
partnership, he added, but it has lost money every year since the
launch of the bridge line in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rena said the dissolution of the partnership, which also
involves several minority investors, will take several weeks to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Isaac Mizrahi name is owned by the partnership,
but Rena said Chanel plans to divest itself of that property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not use his name,'' he said. ``I'm sure some
arrangement will be made so he's going to be able to use it. It's
all being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rena said Chanel had high hopes the Isaac bridge business would
pump up volume for the brand, but it did not achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaac was shut down, ``it was down to the collection line,
which is a fairly small business, and it didn't make sense for us
to go on,'' he added. ``It's really too small for a company like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the designer said an Isaac Mizrahi fragrance
had been in development, but was stopped because Chanel did not
want to make the necessary investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think the Isaac Mizrahi business was given a
fair shake,'' the source said. ``The clothes were great. The
personality was great. It's pitiful that one couldn't capitalize on
those assets and make it a viable company. The timing was not right
to support the company at a critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mizrahi's deepening interest in entertainment projects
was a distraction that irritated Chanel, Rena said the company
always understood Mizrahi had such leanings. ``They were part of
his mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi has been a darling of the media and the fashion press
ever since he burst onto the fashion scene as a precocious
26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, he had been a student at Parsons, then worked at
Perry Ellis, Jeffrey Banks and Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for his theatrical, high-energy fashion shows and for
clothes as ebullient and colorful as his personality, Mizrahi
brought zing and glamour to fashion. His sense of humor and levity
was infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unzipped,'' a documentary, was probably the first fashion film
to become a mainstream hit, thanks to Mizrahi's razor-sharp wit and
campy humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's interests in entertainment have intensified ever
since. He recently formed a new production company called Baby with
his friend and colleague Nina Santisi, who has been vice president
of public relations and advertising at his company since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   Santisi was executive producer of _ and featured prominently in
_ ``Unzipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, who currently can be seen in the new Woody Allen film
``Celebrity,'' said on Oct. 1 that he has missed opportunities in
the entertainment field because of his commitments to the fashion
house. He said these included starring roles in motion pictures,
but declined to name them. He said he had been offered a cameo
appearance ``in a movie that has since become a major hit. It had
actresses I really would have loved to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mizrahi said he had to pass because the movie would have
required a commitment of three weeks to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm just so open to any kind of offers,'' he said. ``As I
see my life, I can't imagine what it would have been like not to do
these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was becoming tired of fashion, Mizrahi said he has
been ``more and more in love with it'' lately. ``The ironic thing
is, it was really working. This fall and this past spring,
everything was really working and really selling well. It's a
roller coaster of a business. Sometimes it stinks; sometimes it's
great. This past year has been a red-letter year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did hint at some frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a very funny thing, because it has so much to do
with sales. In fact, it's a greater art form. It hits you right in
the face with the moment. I feel like it's influencing art so much.
I don't think you could have had Jeff Koons in the Fifties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now art is supposed to be so much about a reflection. Before
it was a prediction. Now fashion is a prediction, and art is a
reflection. That's a bold thing to say, but it's very, very true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rector, president of Isaac Mizrahi, said he would continue
to be employed by Mizrahi and Chanel to help wind down the
business. He said he and a small team of employees would remain
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Mizrahi has five licensing partners: Eyeota for
eyewear, FJ Benjamin Holdings Ltd. for handbags and leather
accessories, Lazare Kaplan for fine jewelry, Fairbrooke Enterprises
for coats and GFW Footwear for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in conversations with the licensees regarding the
future of those businesses, and those plans will be announced when
they're finalized,'' Rector said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they were shocked at Mizrahi's news. For
the most part, buyers reported, the signature collection was doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, pointed out Mizrahi's creative designs might
have been a little too out of sync with what consumers really
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally surprised,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president of fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, noting the store
had just brought back the label for fall at its flagship, after a
hiatus of a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small parting of ways,'' he explained. ``A couple of
seasons ago, we moved the location, but it wasn't working. We
decided that until we came up with the right location, we would
take a little breather.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bloomingdale's expanded Mizrahi's real estate to 700
square feet from 500 square feet, and moved it to a more visible
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said the Mizrahi collection was doing well this
season, particularly the camel group of peajackets, long skirts and
cashmere sweaters. He added that Mizrahi's bridge label, which
closed last year, had done just ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big mover and shaker in the industry,'' Ruttenstein
said. ``He brought back a fresh insouciance and a fresh, casual
elegance. He looked back to the movie stars, but he brought an
American contemporary feeling to the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said Bloomingdale's was the first store to buy
Mizrahi's collection when the designer started back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he had just left Perry Ellis, and he called me,''
he recalled. ``I went to see him. He did these velveteen powder
blue jump suits, and I immediately placed an order. We even
showcased the line in our windows. He was a big fan ever since. He
was one of the great showmen when it came to putting on a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my lord, I can't believe it,'' said Joan Weinstein,
president of Chicago-based Ultimo, which carries the Mizrahi
merchandise in its three designer stores. ``I have to say that our
selection of (Mizrahi) has always done well,'' she added. ``We have
always had a consistent presence in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mizrahi's bestsellers this season have been sleeveless
cashmere pastel sweaters with scarves to match, inverted
front-pleated skirts and midcalf skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a fabulous person,'' Weinstein said.``He used to make
personal appearances at the store about twice a year. Everyone
loved him. He stopped doing it last year.'' She added, ``Knowing
Isaac, he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally shocked,'' said Joseph Boitano, executive vice
president at Bergdorf Goodman, which had sold the collection since
Mizrahi came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The store devoted a 400-square-foot area to it. Boitano admitted
the store had some problems with the Isaac bridge line, but the
signature collection has done well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a nice business,'' he said. ``He had a great
following in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman has done especially well with Mizrahi's simple
short cocktail dresses this season. But one buyer from a designer
boutique, who wanted to remain anonymous, said her Mizrahi business
has been difficult in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did really well, but then business got tough,'' she said.
``I think what happened was he did what he wanted, and the
consumers just didn't get it. That was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, who also did not want to be named, said he had to
drop the line last year after poor sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very creative and had such a great personality,'' he
said. ``But his collection was too outside the box for our
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac danced to the beat of his own drummer,'' said Sherry
Cassin, executive fashion director at the Doneger Group, a buying
office here. ``He was clearly not for the masses. He was very
special and did his own thing. He never wanted to sell out to mass
commercialism, but that, I guess, may have not been a good
long-term decision in the end.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi dropped a fashion bombshell on Oct. 1:
He said his 10-year-old business is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, a designer whose ebullient personality matched his
colorful clothing, said his partnership with Chanel was being
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, which has backed the business since 1992, is said to
have become increasingly impatient with its mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no spring 1999 Isaac Mizrahi Collection, and the
Isaac Mizrahi &AMP; Co. headquarters on Wooster Street in SoHo soon
will go dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little shocking, but that's life,'' an
uncharacteristically rueful Mizrahi told WWD just hours after he
broke the news to about 55 employees. ``It's all for the best. It's
a good decision, as painful as it was to make. I'm taking a break
and observing what fate has to offer me now. I feel very excited
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said it was a ``joint decision'' with Chanel to shut
down his fashion business. He said initially he plans to
concentrate on a multitude of ``promising'' entertainment ventures,
including film production and screenwriting. He's working on a
movie optioned by Dreamworks based on his comic book, ``The
Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also writing the third draft of a screenplay entitled
``Wild About Harry'' that has been optioned by Barry Sonnenfeld and
Disney; Mizrahi said he might star in it. He did not say
definitively if or when he would get back into the fashion
business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was searching for new financial backers to relaunch
a fashion business, he said he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, my first commitment has been to fashion, but
now I don't know,'' he said, sitting at the desk where he has done

``Unzipped'' that catapulted him to fashion fame.

allow fate to take over. I can't fight fate. It's been the driving
force of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly as bewildered by his shocking announcement as the
fashion world, Mizrahi declined to predict what his future will
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a psychic. I don't know what I'm going to come back

years from now. I just do. I solve creative problems. Right now,
what I want to do has to be culturally sound, whatever I do next.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the shutdown comes less than nine months after Mizrahi
closed his two-year-old Isaac bridge line, a venture initially
heralded as an enormous growth opportunity for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about 65 workers were laid off at Mizrahi's SoHo
headquarters and its warehouse in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel said on Oct. 1 that it is withdrawing its financial
backing because the Mizrahi's business volume was not large enough
to warrant Chanel's stake, which is believed to be approximately 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dissolving the partnership,'' said Michael Rena,
executive vice president of Chanel Inc. ``The volume was not big
enough to make it interesting for us or him to continue. He doesn't
need us. He doesn't need backers to have the kind of
entrepreneurial business he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chanel and Mizrahi declined to reveal Mizrahi's volume,
market sources said the business generated annual sales of roughly
$50 million before the Isaac bridge line was closed last year.
Isaac was believed to have accounted for less than half of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rena declined to say how much Chanel had invested in the Mizrahi
business in the last six years, but confirmed Chanel had ``lost
money'' on its overall investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Mizrahi business was profitable in the early years of the
partnership, he added, but it has lost money every year since the
launch of the bridge line in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rena said the dissolution of the partnership, which also
involves several minority investors, will take several weeks to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Isaac Mizrahi name is owned by the partnership,
but Rena said Chanel plans to divest itself of that property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not use his name,'' he said. ``I'm sure some
arrangement will be made so he's going to be able to use it. It's
all being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rena said Chanel had high hopes the Isaac bridge business would
pump up volume for the brand, but it did not achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaac was shut down, ``it was down to the collection line,
which is a fairly small business, and it didn't make sense for us
to go on,'' he added. ``It's really too small for a company like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the designer said an Isaac Mizrahi fragrance
had been in development, but was stopped because Chanel did not
want to make the necessary investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think the Isaac Mizrahi business was given a
fair shake,'' the source said. ``The clothes were great. The
personality was great. It's pitiful that one couldn't capitalize on
those assets and make it a viable company. The timing was not right
to support the company at a critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mizrahi's deepening interest in entertainment projects
was a distraction that irritated Chanel, Rena said the company
always understood Mizrahi had such leanings. ``They were part of
his mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi has been a darling of the media and the fashion press
ever since he burst onto the fashion scene as a precocious
26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, he had been a student at Parsons, then worked at
Perry Ellis, Jeffrey Banks and Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for his theatrical, high-energy fashion shows and for
clothes as ebullient and colorful as his personality, Mizrahi
brought zing and glamour to fashion. His sense of humor and levity
was infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unzipped,'' a documentary, was probably the first fashion film
to become a mainstream hit, thanks to Mizrahi's razor-sharp wit and
campy humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's interests in entertainment have intensified ever
since. He recently formed a new production company called Baby with
his friend and colleague Nina Santisi, who has been vice president
of public relations and advertising at his company since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   Santisi was executive producer of _ and featured prominently in
_ ``Unzipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, who currently can be seen in the new Woody Allen film
``Celebrity,'' said on Oct. 1 that he has missed opportunities in
the entertainment field because of his commitments to the fashion
house. He said these included starring roles in motion pictures,
but declined to name them. He said he had been offered a cameo
appearance ``in a movie that has since become a major hit. It had
actresses I really would have loved to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mizrahi said he had to pass because the movie would have
required a commitment of three weeks to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm just so open to any kind of offers,'' he said. ``As I
see my life, I can't imagine what it would have been like not to do
these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was becoming tired of fashion, Mizrahi said he has
been ``more and more in love with it'' lately. ``The ironic thing
is, it was really working. This fall and this past spring,
everything was really working and really selling well. It's a
roller coaster of a business. Sometimes it stinks; sometimes it's
great. This past year has been a red-letter year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did hint at some frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a very funny thing, because it has so much to do
with sales. In fact, it's a greater art form. It hits you right in
the face with the moment. I feel like it's influencing art so much.
I don't think you could have had Jeff Koons in the Fifties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now art is supposed to be so much about a reflection. Before
it was a prediction. Now fashion is a prediction, and art is a
reflection. That's a bold thing to say, but it's very, very true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rector, president of Isaac Mizrahi, said he would continue
to be employed by Mizrahi and Chanel to help wind down the
business. He said he and a small team of employees would remain
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Mizrahi has five licensing partners: Eyeota for
eyewear, FJ Benjamin Holdings Ltd. for handbags and leather
accessories, Lazare Kaplan for fine jewelry, Fairbrooke Enterprises
for coats and GFW Footwear for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in conversations with the licensees regarding the
future of those businesses, and those plans will be announced when
they're finalized,'' Rector said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they were shocked at Mizrahi's news. For
the most part, buyers reported, the signature collection was doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, pointed out Mizrahi's creative designs might
have been a little too out of sync with what consumers really
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally surprised,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president of fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, noting the store
had just brought back the label for fall at its flagship, after a
hiatus of a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small parting of ways,'' he explained. ``A couple of
seasons ago, we moved the location, but it wasn't working. We
decided that until we came up with the right location, we would
take a little breather.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bloomingdale's expanded Mizrahi's real estate to 700
square feet from 500 square feet, and moved it to a more visible
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said the Mizrahi collection was doing well this
season, particularly the camel group of peajackets, long skirts and
cashmere sweaters. He added that Mizrahi's bridge label, which
closed last year, had done just ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big mover and shaker in the industry,'' Ruttenstein
said. ``He brought back a fresh insouciance and a fresh, casual
elegance. He looked back to the movie stars, but he brought an
American contemporary feeling to the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said Bloomingdale's was the first store to buy
Mizrahi's collection when the designer started back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he had just left Perry Ellis, and he called me,''
he recalled. ``I went to see him. He did these velveteen powder
blue jump suits, and I immediately placed an order. We even
showcased the line in our windows. He was a big fan ever since. He
was one of the great showmen when it came to putting on a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my lord, I can't believe it,'' said Joan Weinstein,
president of Chicago-based Ultimo, which carries the Mizrahi
merchandise in its three designer stores. ``I have to say that our
selection of (Mizrahi) has always done well,'' she added. ``We have
always had a consistent presence in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mizrahi's bestsellers this season have been sleeveless
cashmere pastel sweaters with scarves to match, inverted
front-pleated skirts and midcalf skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a fabulous person,'' Weinstein said.``He used to make
personal appearances at the store about twice a year. Everyone
loved him. He stopped doing it last year.'' She added, ``Knowing
Isaac, he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally shocked,'' said Joseph Boitano, executive vice
president at Bergdorf Goodman, which had sold the collection since
Mizrahi came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The store devoted a 400-square-foot area to it. Boitano admitted
the store had some problems with the Isaac bridge line, but the
signature collection has done well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a nice business,'' he said. ``He had a great
following in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman has done especially well with Mizrahi's simple
short cocktail dresses this season. But one buyer from a designer
boutique, who wanted to remain anonymous, said her Mizrahi business
has been difficult in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did really well, but then business got tough,'' she said.
``I think what happened was he did what he wanted, and the
consumers just didn't get it. That was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, who also did not want to be named, said he had to
drop the line last year after poor sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very creative and had such a great personality,'' he
said. ``But his collection was too outside the box for our
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac danced to the beat of his own drummer,'' said Sherry
Cassin, executive fashion director at the Doneger Group, a buying
office here. ``He was clearly not for the masses. He was very
special and did his own thing. He never wanted to sell out to mass
commercialism, but that, I guess, may have not been a good
long-term decision in the end.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BARNET, Vt. _ When Reeve Lindbergh was a child, she dreamed that
her father was ``God.'' After all, she rationalized, she and her
brothers and sisters ``called him `father,' when all of our friends
called their fathers `daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, she could find him in the ``Encyclopedia
Britannica'' as Charles A. Lindbergh, the all-American hero, the
man who, over the course of a lonely 33 1/2 hours in May 1927,
became the first to fly solo across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 71 years after that still awe-inspiring &UR;  &LR; flight (which
took place 18 years before her birth), Lindbergh smiles and tosses
her head back at a question about that childhood dream which she
relates in her just-published memoir, ``Under A Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he was like that,'' she said. ``He was big and he had an
amazing presence. Piercing blue eyes. And everything he said was
right.'' But then, ``He was also different from that. He could
relax and be quite silly, tumbling with us on the floor, carrying
me piggy-back around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, she thought, ``an inside view and an outside view.''
Outside, in public, ``I had the feeling that my father would put on
a uniform, the Lindbergh uniform,'' she said, ``but then at other
times, he would dissolve into a warm human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lindbergh, now 53, it is an extraordinary legend to carry
through life. While she dealt with some aspects of it in her 1993
novel, ``The Names of Mountains,'' the memoir is her first effort
to deal with it directly.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents rarely spoke to their children about the public
events which made their lives so legendary. For the flight to
Paris, Lindbergh would refer the children to his book about it,
telling them ``It's all in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the kidnapping and death of her parents' first-born
in March 1932, was a closed subject. And, Reeve Lindbergh says now,
``The things they didn't talk about are still painful. They hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling parallel to her parents' tragedy, Reeve Lindbergh
lost her son from her first marriage, Jonathan, to infantile
encephalitis in 1985. He was the same age that her brother had been
when he was kidnapped. Her mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, now 92,
was with her the night her son died, Lindbergh said, and insisted
they sit with Jonathan's body until the medical examiner came. ``I
never saw my son's body,'' she told her daughter. ``I never sat
with my son this way.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The intertwined triumph and tragedy of the Lindbergh legend is
well known, particularly among those of a certain age. She said
that people constantly want to tell her their connection to the
legend. At a children's book event _ Lindbergh has written 13 books
for children _ author and illustrator Maurice Sendak told her that
his nightmare memory of the kidnapping, which occurred when he was
4, is the psychological basis for his classic children's tale,
``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nightmare for people of that age,'' said Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   But for younger generations, the legend is dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs about the reaction of Eli and Sam, the teenage sons
of her second husband, Nathaniel Tripp, whom she married in 1987.
``They knew it was a big deal,'' she said, referring to the
Lindbergh legend. ``But not what kind of a big deal. I think they
were more excited about my teenage daughters _ Elizabeth and
Susannah _ moving in with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For herself, whatever burden the Lindbergh legend may be, it
appears one she has learned to live with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After 30 years in Vermont _ she moved there after graduating
from Radcliffe in 1968 with her first husband, Richard Brown, a
Harvard classmate _ she has the outdoorsy appearance that comes
with too-short summers and snow-laden winters.
</P>
<P>
   She has graying-blonde, tousled hair which becomes moreso as she
runs her fingers through it when she pauses to recollect during
several hours of conversation. She is often described as slight of
build, but it is a slightness that resembles that of her mother in
the memorable photograph in which, dressed in aviator's flight
gear, she is standing next to her husband. The smile is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh lives now in far up-country Vermont with Tripp and
their son, 11-year-old Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, a mile-and-a-half in from the state highway at the end
of a dirt road, is not in gentrified country. It is the kind of
back-country farm where you might find derelict cars behind the
barn and broken appliances on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as Tripp says, what local people would call,
disparagingly, ``a 12-cow farm.'' There are chickens and a small
herd of 16 sheep. There is also an old cow and an old horse that
``don't serve any purpose,'' Lindbergh said. ``Just hang out.''
Tripp figures ``the maximum this farm could produce is $3,000 to
$4,000 a year _ gross.'' Which is why, he said, ``we produce
books,'' Lindbergh's children's books and a novel before the
current memoir, and Tripp's own, ``Father, Soldier, Son; A Memoir
of a Platoon Leader in Vietnam,'' published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As for their 1840s farmhouse, it has the rumpled look of one
whose occupants care more about the living than the appearances.
</P>
<P>
   While Tripp's two sons and Lindbergh's two daughters from
earlier marriages are grown and gone _ the only one still at home
is Benjamin _ a visitor might think the house is full of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen is a large, hand-drawn poster looking much like
an illustration from one of Lindbergh's children's books, setting
out various rules of the house: no more than three in the bathtub
at a time, including animals; no using the washing machine when
someone is taking a shower; and no racoons or peacocks allowed
inside the house. A World War II board game that Ben is playing
sprawls across the living room table.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh works in a small room off the kitchen, where the
clutter, extraordinary even by the usual standards of authors'
offices, swamps her computer. But there is a idyllic view up a
hillside meadow where several bluebird houses have been set out on
poles. Occasionally, deer appear out of the early morning fog at
the edge of the nearby woods. Their visits are rare enough,
Lindbergh said, ``that there is still a kind of magic in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly absent from the house is any noticeable Lindbergh
memorabilia. The only things she has, Lindbergh says, are personal
items _ like a little green eraser of her father's, a wooden ruler
on which her mother had written her initials, ``and the little
glasses case my father gave my mother to hold when she was in
labor'' and in which he had written the names of all the children
as they came along, from the kidnapped Charles through Jon, Land
and Scott to Anne and then Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a family like ours,'' she said, ``it's the personal things
that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But with her memoir and with ``Lindbergh,'' a biography of her
father by A. Scott Berg also published this fall, it's the family
legend that's drawing new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who began working on the biography in 1990, spent
considerable time with all surviving family members, but
particularly with Reeve, whom he saw as the gatekeeper of the
family's extensive _ and never before opened _ archives. ``We had a
symbiotic relationship,'' he said. ``She'd send me chapters of her
memoir as she finished them. I don't think I used anything from
them, but I got a lot of attitudes from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Lindbergh worked on her memoir, originally begun as a
memorial to her sister Anne who died in 1993, Berg became a source.
``I'd call him for dates,'' she said. ```Scott,' I'd say, `what was
I doing in 1953?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when Berg came up to Vermont around
Christmas in 1992, a time chosen, Lindbergh said, because the
family, including Anne Morrow Lindbergh and all the children, would
be gathered for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   One night after dinner, she said, Berg sat down at the piano and
started playing Cole Porter tunes. After a bit, he came to
``Anything Goes'' and when he did, ``All of a sudden, my mother got
up from where she was sitting, all curled up, and walked over
toward the piano. And every time he got to the chorus, she would
sing in a tiny voice, `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Morrow Lindbergh was 86 that year and, as her daughter
said, ``she was pretty frail and lots had gone for her, but she
still remembered `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   From her childhood, Lindbergh remembers the lists of misdeeds
that her father would confront his children with on his return from
extended trips overseas or around the country: ``rake left out in
the rain,'' ``reading comics,'' or lapses in the ``freedom and
responsibility'' category.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back now, what she remembers is ``knowing him at a
good period in his life'' when he would come up to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Lindbergh the aviator _ including some 50 World War II
missions in the South Pacific as a civilian _ had become Lindbergh
the conservationist. And, she said, he was ``more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much the country meant to him,'' she
said. ``But he would come up and reminisce about varities of corn
and ways of raising sheep. These were things that were clearly in
his heart.''

PATRIOTS' EXAM DAY IS COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big dog is coming Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs are five days away, but it is not too
early to say this. So let's say it again.
</P>
<P>
   The big dog is coming.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain games by which a team and a season are
measured in the NFL. The first has already come and gone for the
Patriots. It was Opening Day in Denver and it did not go well. Not
even as well as the final score (Broncos, 27-21) might lead you to
think.
</P>
<P>
   But that is history, as is Sunday's rather bizarre but oddly
impressive 30-27 victory over the previously undefeated New Orleans
Saints at the Superdome. Both are on the scrap heap and of no use
to the Patriots this morning or, more importantly, Sunday
afternoon, because a big dog is coming, and if you can't run with
the big dogs, then lie on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice the Patriots face this week. Who are they
really? Are they elite or not yet complete? Are they among the top
four teams in the AFC or are they back in the pack, as they were a
year ago and proved it about this time of the season with losses to
Denver and Green Bay?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots think they know the answer, and if they are
correct, the Chiefs are in trouble. But knowing the answer and
giving the right answer when your name is called are two different
things, as no talented team has proven more often than the Patriots
the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe has said quite rightly that his team
cannot consider itself among the elite until it beats the Denvers,
Green Bays, and yes, Kansas Citys. That is something these Patriots
have seldom done.
</P>
<P>
   So this is another chance to make a statement, because the team
that is coming to Foxborough is 4-1 and elite but also incomplete
itself. It has a defense that can squeeze the life out of your
offense and the breath out of your quarterback because it loves to
throw the latter on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, in the kind of rainstorm Noah must have been
anticipating, the Chiefs shut down Seattle's running game, limiting
Ricky Watters to 59 yards on 22 carries and forcing him to fumble
twice in the sloppy conditions. They also sacked the quarterback
four times.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, theirs is a defense that can do great damage to an
opponent and it will come after Bledsoe with one of the best rushes
in the league. It will come after him with a defense that has
allowed an average of only 128.8 passing yards and 12.6 points a
game. In other words, it will make life difficult not only on New
England's offense but also on its defense because that defense must
match play-for-play one of the soundest in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   Most critical is that while the Chiefs' defense is solid across
the board, the Patriots' remains flawed. Defensive coordinator
Steve Sidwell has done a masterful job the past two seasons of
disguising a glaring hole in his secondary, and all the talk about
the improvement of Chris Canty cannot mask the fact that if New
England's assortment of blitzes don't finish off the quarterback,
problems invaribly follow. Often big problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite seven sacks against the Saints Sunday, New England's
rush got close without getting the quarterback far too often, and
when Danny Wuerffel escaped, he did serious damage. The Patriots
allowed a guy who is arm-challenged to pass for nearly 300 yards
and convert 9 of 18 third-down situations, including a
third-and-17, a third-and-14, a third-and-10, and a third-and-9.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way an elite defense plays, and that is
certainly not all Canty's fault. But he is the cornerback teams are
aiming at, and all the mock flexing when he makes a sack cannot
alter that reality. Only tighter coverage can and this, it seems
clear, he cannot supply regardless of how many public pep talks
Pete Carroll aims in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints gashed New England several times on seam routes when
Canty trailed too far behind while the safeties were so concerned
with protecting deep that they didn't close down over the top,
leaving a huge gap in the middle of the defense. Hence tight end
Cam Cleeland ends up with eight catches and Andre Hastings with six
and an upset nearly ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City will surely try to exploit that, while Sidwell will
lecture on team defense and try to correct it. But no amount of
correction can help him if his gambling rushes don't finish off the
quarterback, because given reasonable time, guys like Andre Rison
and tight end Tony Gonzalez will do the same kind of damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rushed well and we crushed their run,'' said Sidwell,
putting the best face on things. ``Our problem was in coverage but
we also played well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Saints that was true. It was not true against the
Broncos, however, as his defense was gashed for long receptions by
Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a powerful passing game, possibly an emerging
running game, and a ball-hawking defense that plays well together
and is scrappy. But they lack a game-breaking defender on which
opponents must concentrate. There is no Derrick Thomas here. No
Reggie White. No Deion Sanders. No John Randle. No Warren Sapp. No
Levon Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   To survive without such a player makes a coach's life difficult
and a defense's precarious, especially when one glaring weakness
exists.

   Such a defense will be tested again Sunday. Sidwell's schemes
will be tested as well. Canty and the safeties will be tested most
of all. If their team is to run with the big dogs, they will have
to pass those tests because a lot of questions remain about these
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   They are the kind of questions that can be answered only in
games like this, when the big dogs are barking and you either bark
back or curl up on the porch and wait for them to pass by.

INNS AT PEAK CAPACITY AS VISITORS HEAD NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Northern Vermont, where sugar maples, sumacs, birches, and
oaks are changing the lush green environs to scarlet, gold, violet,
and orange, La Toscana Country Inn in Stowe is booked solid until
late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out six months ago,'' said Tony DeVito, who owns the
small inn with his family. ``Foliage is our biggest time of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had to turn away dozens of callers, some from as far away
as Italy, Germany, and England. And because of the big demand,
DeVito has to insist: pay upfront, no refunds, no cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they book I tell them it's not refundable,'' Devito said.
``It's feast or famine. Everybody wants the same 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout New England, where the variety of trees helps create
breathtaking scenes for a few precious weeks, many inns have had
their fall weekends booked for weeks, at a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   And many innkeepers keep a strict &UR;  &LR; no-refund policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn a lot of people away,'' said Cynthia Barber, the &UR;  &LR; owner
of the Smugglers' Notch Resort in Jeffersonville, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   She said sometimes callers want to pick the weekend where colors
are at 100 percent change, or ``peak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants peak and they will say, `Now when will that
be?' I give them a range. Sometimes they try to push you for a
date. One person said, `You haven't picked the date yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barber said she stresses to callers that the the foliage _
whether it be 30 percent or 80 percent at its peak, is beautiful
all season. And if it isn't peak in Jeffersonville, there's likely
an area not far away where you can see the colors at their peak.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, about 6.1 million people visited last year
during leaf-peeping season _ September, October, and November,
according to Wyndham Lewis, a spokesman for the state tourism
office.
</P>
<P>
   Boston hotels are also booked by those who make day trips up
north during the day and enjoy the city at night.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that though the season started a little early _ with
oaks and hickory trees showing off red and purple tints _ the
season should extend throughout the next few weeks. Changes in the
leaves will start first in higher elevations and in northern parts
of the state, gradually changing in southern parts and on the Cape
and Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hammerle, a housekeeper at the Birchwood Inn in Lenox, in
the Berkshires, said the leaves started to change colors a couple
of weeks earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when the peak is going to be,'' she said. ``Our
Berkshire weather does what it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Northampton, where the rolling hills are still green, people
calling the The Autumn Inn are asking, ``When should I come?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pelis, the hotel's desk clerk, tells callers leaf peeping
is best around October and November, ``and, even then, it
depends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask when the peak season is, and we say we can't predict
that,'' Pelis said. ``We're not Mother Nature.''

IN THE HEYDAY OF THE CASUAL GREETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' a colleague said as we met in the hallway last week,
``how come everyone says `Hey' now instead of `Hi'?''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been overstating the case _ hi, hello, and how are
ya are by no means dying out _ but clearly, hey has been extending
its reach. And I wondered how the greeting hey was related to the
other hey that's been spreading in written English, a kind of
folksy aside to the reader adopted in the past few decades. Is this
one new usage, or two ways to make hey?
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything new about hey itself; its first
citation in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated 1225, centuries
ahead of its near-twin hi. And hey has done yeoman work through the
centuries, filling out all those extra syllables in old songs and
poems (with a hey nonny nonny) and in 20th-century political chants
(Hey, hey, LBJ ...). In the 16th century came a dance called
Hey-diddle-diddle (presumably accompanied by a cat playing the
fiddle). Hey serves as a yell of alarm (Hey, bring my car back!)
and a magician's exclamation (Hey presto!).
</P>
<P>
   But our latest variants are comparatively recent. Random House's
slang dictionary (1997) notes the aside-to-the-listener use of hey
(``Used affectedly for emphasis within a sentence, esp. after
but,'' it says); its samples run from 1974 (``But hey, that's the
kind of guy I am'') to 1994 (a Dewar's Scotch ad). HarperCollins's
slang guide also notes the usage, calling it ``Increasingly ...
placative or apologetic.''
</P>
<P>
   This hey seems like a descendant of the 20th-century hey we get
in popular songs, from ``Hey there, you with the stars in your
eyes'' to ``Hey hey, we're the Monkees.'' It's a friendly, casual
form of address, implying a certain intimacy and saying, at the
same time, ``We're making a little joke here_ don't take us too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey as a solo salutation has much of the same flavor. It's more
cordial, less neutral, than hi or hello _ not a greeting to someone
you don't know or don't like. I'd also bet _ a small amount, at
least _ that it's a guy thing, which may be why my colleague hears
it more than I do. (That could change fast, though _ a friend
reports that his toddler daughter is using hey, not hi.) You
probably wouldn't greet your grandmother with hey, and some bosses
would surely consider it too casual. But you never know: After all,
it was a very big boss in a very fancy office who recently uttered
the hey heard 'round the world: ``Oh, hey, Monica ... come on in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Just one of those things
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Perry of Boston writes that she and her friend are
``desperate'' to have their argument settled, and I hope this
answer comes in time. Which verb, they want to know, is correct in
the sentence, ``He is one of those boys who (is/are) always
boasting''?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky construction, because it sounds as if the verb
should agree with he or one: He is only one boy, after all. Perry
herself would parse the sentence that way, reading it ``He is one
(of those boys) who is always boasting.'' And she could find plenty
of printed examples to support that version, because one of those
fools many of the people much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the plural verb is the right one: ``He is one of those boys
who are always boasting.'' The point is that our boy is one of a
larger group that shares certain characteristics; if the verb is
made singular, those boys have no role to play in the sentence at
all. You may not want them around, but without them you're reduced
to ``He is always boasting.'' And maybe, after all, that's all you
wanted to say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mud in your eye
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gin and tonic season (no hyphens, please) is just about
finished, but Joe Galeota of West Roxbury would still like to know
how to order when he's having more than one. ``Friends advised me
that the answer is `gins and tonic,' because alcohol is the main
ingredient,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But friends are wrong, in this case. Galeota's other examples _
mothers-in-law, attorneys general _ do have a ``main ingredient'';
when they turn plural, that's the word that changes. But neither
gin nor tonic is ``the main ingredient''; unless you have both,
there's no such drink. So the plural is gin and tonics, no matter
how strong you mix them.
</P>

EACH RAY COUNTS BEFORE DAYLIGHT FADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With less than three weeks to go before our return to
standard time, I'm trying desperately to save some daylight. But
most days lately seem to end with a race between the stock market
and actual daylight, trying to see which one can close down faster.
</P>
<P>
   After carping that I'd used my hammock on only three brief
occasions this summer, I took a colleague's advice and stretched
out to enjoy one of our last sunny afternoons on the back deck.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang five times in 90 minutes, and I hung the darn
hammock and the phone back on the wall. With daylight and dry
weather vanishing, the 10 gallons of deck sealer probably won't be
applied until the next clear warm day . . . next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight-saving time seems like a good idea to kids who want
summer days to last longer, and to middle-age columnists who can't
seem to read all the newspapers out on the porch swing before the
sun goes down. When I was a kid, during World War II,
daylight-saving time went all year. And some cities and states
continued to shift back and forth onto daylight-saving time in the
summer even though the railroads operated on their own clock, which
created a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time, whether 24 hours or a phase of your life,
is a matter of perspective. The rest of the world is worried about
whether their computers will make it into the next millennium. I'm
trying not to worry about making it through the La Ni &UR; gftilde &LR; na
winter.
</P>
<P>
   With the warm, dry summer, I finally have managed to grow some
ripe red tomatoes. But I barely have enough time to pick and eat
them. I would seize the day, except that most of it seems already
to have flown while I am bent down tying my shoes. And if I stop to
smell the roses, sometimes I forget where I was going.
</P>
<P>
   I was poring through Sunday's paper for the best prices on snow
tires and discovered that Gene Autry and Roddy McDowall had died.
And I wondered if there was any point in getting a 70,000-mile
warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of you, I have that ``organ donor'' thing on my
driver's license, but if they parted me out tomorrow, there
wouldn't be a whole lot anyone could use again.
</P>
<P>
   This is a state of mind, this realization that the autumn of
your life is not a long-play CD. As you get older, everything seems
to be on fast forward. Everything, that is, except you.
</P>
<P>
   By what might generously be termed the far side of middle age,
most folks should learn to take things a bit slower. And some
things actually seem better when slowed down. Of course, you know
that I am referring here to hot showers and teeth-flossing.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past several years have I truly appreciated what my
late father used to say about how a certain biological function was
a sure sign of a good day. Parents _ most usually mothers _ have a
way of bringing up certain subjects in everyday conversation as
though everyone subscribes to the importance of bran cereal and
prunes. But it's taken me this long to appreciate that my dad was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Fading daylight-saving time and creeping middle age alter your
perspective as well as affect your eyesight. Not only do street
signs and road maps become more difficult to read, but police
officers, doctors and movie stars all appear to have just graduated
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Car and real estate salesmen look incredulous when you tell them
that the vehicle they're trying to sell you costs more than your
first house, or that the house they're trying to peddle costs more
than you could pay in your lifetime. Like, who cares about that
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time to readjust the clock to standard time, I
remember the old adage about ``spring ahead and fall behind,'' and
I'm happy it's fall because I don't think I've got the oomph to
spring anywhere.

SPRINTER DREAMS OF OLYMPCI GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 By RONALD TILLERY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ She was talking with a common-cold accent. Her nasal
passages were feeling the kind of pressure Cheryl Taplin obviously
puts on herself.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin had just returned from the IAAF World Cup in
Johannesburg, South Africa. There, she captured first place in the
women's 400-meter relay, along with that annoying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, though, was summed up with two letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Taplin said, explaining her recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that is exactly how Taplin portrayed her track career
last season. It was all right, nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run anything spectacular,'' Taplin said. ``I just
seemed to run well when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, timely hits are priceless. In basketball, timely
scores are astonishing. In the world of track and field, either you
are on time or you are not.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Taplin if she is feeling a little off at the moment. Her
best time in the 100 meters this year is 11.15 seconds. She has run
22.79 in the 200. Those times in her premier events are below the
top 10 in the world, and Taplin is taking four weeks off to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run a lot faster,'' said Taplin, a 1990 graduate of
Cleveland High School in Seattle. ``I've just got to put everything
together. I'm anxious to see what I'm going to be running next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Taplin expects vindication.
</P>
<P>
   She is a former gold-medal winner at the Goodwill Games and
track's World Cup. Taplin runs well enough to earn thousands of
dollars on the circuit and maintain Nike as her sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Taplin will try hard to run better in 1999 than she did
in 1998 for one big reason: the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to shoot for the 2000 Olympics, and so next season
will tell her a lot,'' said Donald Cufrie, Taplin's coach and
former 200 gold medalist in the 1972 Olympics. ``She has the
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Taplin even walks into Azusa Pacific University _ a
southern California school where she trains in the offseason _ she
will have worked on the essentials. When she returned to Seattle
recently, Taplin did not bring any sweat suits or sprinter's garb.
She was attempting to re-group.
</P>
<P>
   Cufrie is helping Taplin to realize that running is more a test
of mental toughness than physical skill. Even though Taplin has
qualified for the finals of nearly every meet she has run the past
summer, her confidence has been shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a mental block. I was doubting myself,
which I had never done before,'' Taplin said. ``For some reason, I
was beating myself up before I ran a race. I had to put it behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin said her ensuing workouts will be critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things she can add to her training,'' Cufrie
said. ``I am confident she will do what it takes. You never know
what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin has come a long way from when she won individual Class AA
state titles all four years at Cleveland and led the Eagles to the
team championship in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   She moved into high gear in college, helping Louisiana State to
an NCAA track and field championship in 1994. At LSU, Taplin was a
16-time All-American. Throughout her professional career, she has
ranked among the national leaders in the sprint events.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin has run with the world's best, including Marion Jones,
Gale Devers, Christie Gaines and Inga Miller _ her training
partner. Now, she believes, it is time to be placed among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived this year,'' Taplin said. ``I'm not going to put
too much pressure on myself, but I've got to mentally prepare.
(Next year) is a big year for me.''

BOSTON IS FULL OF GREAT LITTLE MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a quiet hour or so, for free and nearly alone, you
can pretend you're Frederick Law Olmsted, the famed landscape
architect who created New York's Central Park and Boston's Emerald
Necklace.
</P>
<P>
   You can sit in the rugged, gray and green sunken garden that he
built at his home in Brookline, or stand over the desk in his
office, which looks as if he had just gotten up, leaving a park
plan unrolled on the top, along with his drafting pens and an
ink-blotted cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Or instead of playing Olmsted, you could _ again, for free and
without the hint of a crowd _ wander through exhibits of
archeological artifacts, antique fire equipment, ship models,
historic scientific instruments, or New England antiquities _ each
time as if you were in your own personal museum.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Boston are some fine and often-crowded museums
that charge admission, including the Museum of Fine Arts, the
Museum of Science, the Fogg and Sackler museums at Harvard
University. But there are also dozens of interesting smaller
museums that cost nothing and are so underattended that visitors
often will find themselves alone, except for an unobtrusive guide.
</P>
<P>
   Among those worth a peek are the Com- &QC; 
 &UR; el0.5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   monwealth Museum, the Boston Fire Museum, the gallery of the
Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, and
permanent collections at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden treasure may be the Olmsted home and office on a
winding side street in Brookline, now a national historic site
owned and maintained _ cherished would not be too strong a word _
by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday _ the Olmsted home is open to the public only
on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays _ Park Service Ranger C. Sue
Rigney led the morning's two visitors through the warren of rooms
where Olmsted and his landscape design firm drafted plans for
hundreds of parks and estates.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted bought the old farmhouse in 1883 after he had been hired
to design the Emerald Necklace and immediately began adding rooms
in a somewhat haphazard fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The rustic feeling of the offices and workrooms, achieved by the
use of stained tongue-and-groove and ``washboard'' paneling, evokes
the natural-appearing landscapes that Olmsted and his firm were
creating.
</P>
<P>
   And surrounding the house is an Olmsted parkland on a small
scale. From a rugged sunken garden, a brief passage through a rock
garden leads onto a rolling lawn that suggests the spaciousness of
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly loved this place,'' Rigney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service acquired the site, Rigney said, mainly to have
access to the hundreds of thousands of plans, drawings, and
photographs that constitute an irreplaceable resource for landscape
architects engaged in restoring Olmsted parklands.
</P>
<P>
   Weekdays, the site is open only for research. But Rigney said
the staff is always happy to pull out a plan for a park in a
visitor's hometown. ``We can almost always find a park or a
landscape that out-of-town visitors know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A more traditional museum _ but just as undervisited _ is the
Commonwealth Museum in the State Archives building, a granite
fortresslike building on Columbia Point in Dorchester standing
between the University of Massachusetts's Harbor Campus and the
John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   While the archives' major treasures _ including the royal
charter of Massachusetts Bay Colony and several Indian treaties _
are not on display, there is always an exhibit or two of historical
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the museum has an intriguing display of Big Dig
artifacts uncovered during construction of the new Central Artery.
Some came from a privy in the back lot of a late-17th-century house
on Cross Street in the North End. The house belonged to Katherine
Nanny Naylor, who supported herself as a seamstress after winning a
divorce _ rare for those days _ from an abusive husband. Thrown
into the privy _ and on display now _ were such items as a sewing
kit, pieces of fabric, and broken household utensils.
</P>
<P>
   The major exhibit, ``Toward a Better Life: Massachusetts Workers
and their Unions,'' chronicles the history of the labor movement in
the state, from the 1820s to the present, complete with the mockup
of a union hall, a mannequin dressed in a police uniform from the
time of the 1919 Boston Police strike, and a soundtrack of union
songs to accompany a video of workers on a picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the Boston Fire Museum on Congress Street downtown
takes a visitor into a working fire station when the firefighters
are out of sight upstairs in the dormitory, awaiting a call to
slide down the brass poles and jump onto the engines.
</P>
<P>
   The museum occupies a firehouse built in 1891 and home to two
engine companies until 1977. Behind the double overhead doors, two
deactivated engines are poised for a call that will never come
again for them. The cubicle where the station's dispatcher worked
stands as if he had just left it just for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is manned by knowledgeable _ and enthusiastic _
members of the Boston Sparks Association headed by Ted Gerber, a
fire buff since he served on a volunteer department while attending
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the basement of Harvard's Science Center is a
collection of historic scientific instruments. There is an
18th-century model of the solar system that curator William
Andrewes says is ``as beautiful in its design'' as it is
functional. But there is also a worn seat cushion, which was part
of an 1896 experiment in acoustical engineering conducted in
Harvard's Sanders Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   And along one of MIT's ``infinite corridors'' is a collection of
ship models, representing a small portion of the university's
extensive nautical collection, which also includes the plans and
designs of several thousand yachts and ships. Here, along with the
models of famed sailing ships like the Boston-built clipper Flying
Cloud and naval vessels from World War II, is the gleaming white
model of MIT alumnus William Koch's America3, which won the
America's Cup in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The tiniest of Boston's small and undervisited museums _ but as
interesting as any _ is the gallery operated by the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities at its Bowdoin Square
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 9, an eclectic display shows samples of
18th-century wallpaper, photographs of a tennis match being played
in the 1880s on the grounds of a now-demolished mansion on
Dorchester's Bellevue Street, a Hoodsie lid with a picture of
actress Myrna Loy, and a 1945 Brownie uniform. Coming in November
will be an exhibit devoted to the region's shoe industry.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit area has been dubbed ``Waiting for a Gallery,''
reflecting the society's hopes that it will acquire a larger space
to house and display its collection of 100,000 objects and more
than a million documents, prints, and photographs that depict the
history and material culture of New England.
</P>
<P>
   There might even eventually be a small museum building, society
staffers hope _ but that probably wouldn't be free, or undervisited
either.

AID CREWS UNABLE TO SEND SUPPLIES TO DOMINICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While many victims of Hurricane Georges in the
Dominican Republic live without shelter, wearing whatever was on
their backs when the storm struck, three sites in Massachusetts
fill with supplies collected by the local Dominican community _
medicines, canned goods, even 500 beds donated by a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Monday, the piles of donations continued to rise, with
little immediate hope of reaching the hundreds of thousands of
victims in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   While organizers have gathered enough goods to fill more than a
dozen 45-foot-long containers, they've raised only $64,000. And the
donation of cargo space they had hoped would come from the US
government or a commercial airline have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, relief for hurricane victims in Puerto Rico speeds to
victims on federally funded planes, as mainland Americans rush to
help victims in the US territory President Clinton declared a
disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very frustrated,'' said Carlos Veras, assistant to the
Dominican Consulate in Boston, and an organizer of the Dominican
relief effort. ``We're hoping to get the help of the US government,
which has already helped our country with relief equipment like
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two containers of medicine and food have been
shipped by sea to the Dominican Republic from Massachusetts, thanks
to cargo space donated by a local shipping company. Several
containers at an Army base in Worcester wait for offical approval
before being flown to Santo Domingo. The rest of the goods wait in
a school in Lawrence and a warehouse in Boston's Hyde Park section.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, questions have been raised about the level of
organization among the Boston Dominican relief committee, as
community members grow increasingly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the merchandise, but we can't ship it,'' said
Maria Contreras, a committee member who has repeatedly questioned
Veras and the consulate about the delay. ``It's very painful for
us, because every time we talk to someone on the island, we know
the needs over there. And we have these things sitting here and
there's nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some volunteers, who asked that their names not be used, said
that they had been told by Veras's office that their donations had
been shipped when in fact they had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say the consulate's office was not prepared,''
said Ramona Hernandez, a professor of Latin American studies at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston and author of several books
on Dominicans in America. ``Let's say they were caught up in the
tragedy and did not think about certain logistics instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Veras claimed relief efforts in New York City were having
similar problems, emphasizing the difference between Puerto Rican
and Dominican efforts. Organizers in New York, however, said they
have had no such problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of any effort here that has had a hard time
shipping items,'' said Silvio Torres-Saillant, director of the
Dominican Studies Institute and City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sent seven containers, the size of a semi-truck,
already,'' added Gilsia Pujadas, human resources director of
Alianza Dominicana, one of several New York City agencies leading
relief efforts there. ``We'll be sending two more this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent disparity between aid efforts for the Dominican
Republic and Puerto Rico may ultimately serve to highlight
longstanding tensions and resentments between the Latino ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the hurricane has brought the traditionally feuding
Dominicans and Puerto Ricans together in places such as New York
and Chicago, according to Torres-Saillant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have several big differences in Boston,'' he said. ``Here
in New York, you've had many different relief efforts, with many
non-governmental organizations involved. In Massachusetts, the
Dominican consulate has headed your efforts. No one from the
Dominican Republic trusts the government to get things done
efficiently....
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, here in New York you have Dominicans who have
acheived some level of economic and political power. In Boston
that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York relief efforts were pushed through by assemblyman
Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican American elected to the
state assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Massachusetts is home to the fourth-largest
Dominican-American population in the nation, Latinos in general
here have the highest poverty rates in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And Latinos in Massachusetts lack political clout. Veras said
his office has contacted several public officials, asking for their
assistance, but had gotten no reply yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Dominicans in Massachusetts argue among themselves
and with others, needs in the Dominican Republic remain accute,
said Maria del Carmen Luperon, an official with the Gordo de la
Semana Foundation in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need water,'' she said. ``We need medicine. We need food,
we need clothes, we need wheelchairs, walkers, we need beds. Here,
there is need for everything.''

FAITHFUL CONVERTED TO BIBLE CLASS FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; UNION, W.Va. _ The Bible already had a place at James Monroe
High School. It nestled among the textbooks in Leah Comer's
backpack, available for comfort and guidance whenever the
pony-tailed senior had a spare moment.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough; Comer wanted her gilt-edged Bible to be
counted as one of those textbooks. So the preacher's daughter
rallied her fellow students in hope of joining a national trend
toward Bible-as-literature classes in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But when the county school board moved in August to make Comer's
dream a reality, it set off an unlikely revolt, in an unlikely
place, with unlikely players.
</P>
<P>
   Similar battles elsewhere have been marked by opposition from
big-city civil libertarians, First Amendment lawyers and committed
atheists. But here in this bucolic Appalachian town, the main
obstacles to teaching the Bible in public schools are some of the
Good Book's biggest boosters: four respected local clergy members
from three mainstream denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Among their chief concerns is the fear that teaching the Bible
as purely a literary gem _ severed, as constitutional practice
demands, from its full spiritual and religious context _ could
debase the meaning and power of its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scripture, in the wrong hands and read the wrong way, can
be used to justify slavery, male bigotry, all kinds of oppressive
acts,'' said the Rev. Charles Miller, a United Methodist minister
whose daughter attends the high school. ``And what happens if the
teacher is someone who sees the Bible as totally wrong? They might
be able to teach it as literature, but it wouldn't be the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after having devoted their lives to spreading the Gospel,
the clergy members are hearing themselves being described by some
as ``agents of the devil'' and ``anti-Bible.'' One wonders if he
might lose his pulpit, and two others are concerned for their jobs
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, their concerns are parallel to those of
ultra-Orthodox Jews who refuse to speak Hebrew in conversation,
saying it should be saved for prayer, and to some traditional
Catholics who prefer the Latin Mass to preserve the mystery of the
Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the clergy members say, they agree with
opponents who worry that a Bible class would unconstitutionally
promote one set of beliefs over others, isolating students of
different faiths and those with no faith. In this wellspring of
Christian Coalition strength, they fear that evangelical doctrine
will seep into classrooms _ the class probably would use the King
James Bible, the preferred text of fundamentalist Christians _ to
the exclusion of other Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   All those arguments are lost on Ed Pell, vice chairman of the
school board. Pell moved to create the class after reading a
student newspaper story about a survey by Comer that found
overwhelming student interest in a Bible-as-literature course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well established that we can do this,'' said Pell, who
hopes the course can be offered as early as January. ``If you teach
it as history and literature, and you make it elective, it's not a
violation of the separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Pell is legally correct, but this is all a bit new for Monroe
County, a rural area with 12,000 residents, nearly all white and
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mountainous, beautiful county, tucked against the
Virginia border. Lacking coal, a rarity among West Virginia
counties, its economy is built on cattle, sheep and turkey farms;
its saltpeter mines served both sides during the Civil War.
Unemployment is low, and crime barely warrants counting.
</P>
<P>
   Though isolated, Monroe County is on the verge of joining an
accelerating number of school districts returning Bibles to their
classrooms, particularly in the South. No one keeps exact numbers,
but the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools
boasts that it has helped create classes in 26 states, involving
more than 75 school districts, said executive director Elizabeth
Ridenour.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts hope it will be a salve, considering the
problem with school shootings nationwide. Others have sought a
return to the days when religion was the fourth ``R'' _ after
reading, writing and 'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although teacher-led prayer has been banned from public schools,
the Supreme Court welcomes the Bible, writing in 1963 that
``nothing we have said here indicates that ... study of the Bible
or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular
program of education, may not be effected consistently with the
First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, however, is figuring out how to satisfy that
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A true Bible course that is constitutional and educational
would make sure that there are a number of different perspectives
on how to read the text,'' said Charles Haynes, senior First
Amendment scholar at the Freedom Forum in Arlington, Va. ``You can
teach Noah's ark, and should, but you'd have to say, according to
the liberal Protestant tradition, and the Roman Catholic tradition,
etc., this is how we understand the flood story.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the safest route is to focus on the Bible's literary
qualities. ``Biblical literacy is essential for becoming an
educated person. One can't read Lincoln or Washington or many other
American leaders without it,'' Haynes added.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County opponents recognize the literary merit, but
Miller and the others _ his wife, the Rev. Sharon Miller; Rev.
Mikel Pugh a Presbyterian; and Rev. Lynwood Wells, an Episcopalian
_ say the risks of misuse are too great. A student Bible club would
make more sense, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like what's taught in a particular church, you
can go to a different church. But with one high school in the
county, there's nowhere else to go,'' said Pugh, who said he is
concerned about losing his job for speaking out against the class.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who retired last year but still serves as a fill-in, or
supply, priest, said he doubted it was possible to separate the
Bible's poetic qualities from the doctrine steeped in every line.
``You can't just say the words are beautiful. There is meaning
there, and it comes through. It needs to be interpreted through
faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The least strident is Sharon Miller, who said she sorely wants
students to know the gospel and wishes there was a way to reach
more of them. But, she said, it would be ``next to impossible'' to
find a teacher who could satisfy constitutional concerns about
keeping doctrine out of class.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Hansbarger, a school board member opposed to the class
who invited the ministers into the fray, said the effort is
misguided: ``Some people think putting in a Bible class will solve
all our discipline problems. That's not going to happen.'' But
Hansbarger is outnumbered; the four other board members favor the
class.
</P>
<P>
   Though they collectively pastor at 11 area churches, the
opponents are also a minority in a county with 70 or more active
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible should be taught anywhere, anytime, anyplace,'' said
the Rev. James C. Finley, pastor of Victory Pentecostal Church,
where Comer worships.
</P>
<P>
   As for the concerns of people with different beliefs, Finley is
blunt: ``I don't believe their doctrine, and I don't believe their
teaching. I don't care if theirs are taught. But I do believe our
Bible, our King James, should have a right to be taught in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Comer, 17, says simply: ``I'm a Christian and I hate the fact
that the Bible is taken out of the schools. I thought if enough of
us could get together, we could get it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the controversy has thus far been local _ confined mostly
to letters in an area newspaper, which editorialized against the
class _ the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is
watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstream religious leaders have been publicly silent but
privately supportive for a long time, so I am thrilled they have
decided to stand up against a dangerous incursion of religious
fanaticism into public life,'' said Hilary Chiz, executive director
of the West Virginia ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the class now rests with the school board and
Superintendent Lyn Guy, who supports the idea. She said she will
propose a curriculum by the end of the year, after studying a
neighboring county's 59-year-old Bible-in-schools program. If
Monroe County does go ahead, the cost _ estimated by Guy at just
$2,000 a year for one class daily _ would be paid by donations.
</P>
<P>
   As to why Monroe County has drawn opposition from ministers when
so many other districts have created Bible classes without fuss,
the superintendent said with a sigh: ``There's a long tradition and
history here of being quickly and vocally opposed. We're used to
it. I don't know if it's in the water, or what.''

STARR'S CONNING OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Kenneth Starr, rogue prosecutor, has now managed
to do to the House Judiciary Committee what he did to Attorney
General Janet Reno last January _ a classic con to avoid the
inspection of tainted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Starr hoodwinked Reno with what we now know to
be at best spurious tape recordings into expanding his jurisdiction
to include a possible crime that, in fact, had not been committed,
on the basis of his probing of a similar possible crime that, in
fact, had also not been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the sting was completed as Starr got the engine of
presidential impeachment _ just the third in our history _ running
on the basis of a ``referral'' and thousands of pages of grand jury
testimony and other documents, not one of which has been examined,
cross-examined, or otherwise subjected to anything remotely
resembling scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he seems to have told the committee things that are
demonstrably not true, especially about the infamous Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Starr conned the passive attorney general into
performing a rubber stamp role. Monday, he completed an astonishing
con that transformed the Judiciary Committee into a willing
transmission belt for Starr's highly argumentative submission.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, the committee has done nothing more than any
self-abusive citizen could have done over the last several weeks _
read a giant batch of material based on someone else's work.
</P>
<P>
   What both ends of the process have in common is Linda Tripp and
her tapes. Starr played a few snippets at the Justice Department in
January, he claims, not to get a soap opera about sex and lies
about sex going, but to launch a probe of a possibly imminent
effort to obstruct justice in Paula Jones's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   His alleged link was Monica Lewinsky's statements to her
presumed friend about Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan's effort to
get her to lie about her dalliances with the president in exchange
for a job in New York; and those taped snippets, Starr also
claimed, were ``similar'' to what he said was Jordan's involvement
in previous effort to find work for former Justice Department
higher-up and Clinton friend Webster Hubbell in alleged exchange
for his Whitewater silence.
</P>
<P>
   It was all, we now know, baloney. No evidence of any wrongdoing
has ever been presented about the Hubbell matter; Starr's
insinuations about Jordan in both instances turned out to be
unsupported smears, and so, therefore, even a perfunctory inquiry
by Reno would have given a thorough official reason to pause.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Henry Hyde's staff guy, David Schippers, put up a giant
smoke screen around his fellow prosecutor's conduct, essentially
rewriting the Starr referral's charges to make new-sounding
allegations (conspiracy, misprison of Lewinsky's felonies) that
have lower standards of proof and to make ``lying'' equally
culpable with ``perjury'' as an impeachable high crime or
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr did, Schippers presented a pure prosecutor's brief that
consistently omitted or hid exculpatory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he ignored the patent untruths in Starr's referral to
the effect that his involvement in the Lewinsky case began with
Tripp's call to his office on Jan. 12 and a subsequent visit. But
from several sources, and most recently a detailed account last
weekend in The New York Times, there is information that
Tripp-Starr contacts began at least a week before that _ more than
enough time to prepare a strategy to snare the president in perjury
in his Paula Jones case deposition.
</P>
<P>
   And there is evidence that contact between Tripp and the Jones
camp went back at least another two months.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of an ordinary person, prepackaged evidence and
entrapment are real defenses and often get a case tossed out; in
this case, that would be a legitimate result even before we get to
questions of fact, credibility of witnesses, or whether certain
conduct comes near standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That is why independent-minded Judiciary Committee Democrats
like Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts were opposed to the route
insisted upon by the GOP majority Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, a veteran prosecutor himself, felt that to avoid being
a rubber stamp, his colleagues had to conduct at least a
preliminary investigation to see if Starr's referral was sufficient
for a full-blown inquiry _ in short, to see if probable cause
really exists.
</P>
<P>
   By not doing so, Delahunt said it had turned the independent
counsel statute into an automatic trigger and the Congress into a
rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   He was absolutely right, just as Janet Reno was turned into a
robot last January by Starr, and on the basis initially of the
same, tainted evidence.

 &HT;    The restroom watch
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time hovering outside men's restrooms. No,
this isn't a confession. It's a fact of life for any mother of
small boys.
</P>
<P>
   When my sons were infants, I thought the day would never come
when they'd be able to go to the restroom by themselves when we
were out in public.
</P>
<P>
   The years of diaper changing at the mall and potty training take
their toll. Potty training, of course, merits its own column.
Several of them.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit right up front, I bribed my toddlers with M&AMP;Ms. Every
time they successfully accomplished their mission, they got five
M&AMP;Ms and I got five handfuls. We all grew from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children are potty trained, however, we moms still have
a grace period when they usually will concede to accompany us to
the women's restroom _ that is, unless they have older brothers who
promptly inform them they're going into a ``La-a-dies Bathroom!
Eeewww!''
</P>
<P>
   That usually elicits a wail of anguish from the younger brother,
although he has no idea why. It just seems to be the expected
response. The mother then has to resort to dragging her youngster
into the facility.
</P>
<P>
   This routine helps moms become expert at creating a scene. We
get so used to it, we no longer notice the outraged looks of
bystanders. You think you can do better, buster? Here, be my guest.
</P>
<P>
   The day does come, though, when it just doesn't seem appropriate
to take the little tyke into the women's restroom. Not that you
mind, but he certainly does. A lot. So, fearing we're about to do
permanent psychological damage, we take the plunge and begin
hovering.
</P>
<P>
   We do not, however, send our sons into this potential minefield
without detailed instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you go in there and find an empty stall. Be sure it's
empty. Do NOT crawl under the door. Make sure there's paper in
there if you have to do Number 2. Don't put anything else into the
potty. Give me that G.I. Joe. Flush when you're done. Give me that
other G.I. Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember to wash your hands. Don't talk to anybody. Don't look
at anybody. If anybody looks at you, scream for Mommy. Then come
RIGHT back out here. I'll be waiting right here. If you need me,
just holler. OK? ``
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overwhelmed by the responsibility suddenly cast upon him,
the little fellow manfully hitches his britches and ventures in.
</P>
<P>
   That's when we hover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right in there?'' we call in through the door.
</P>
<P>
   No answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK?'' we holler again.
</P>
<P>
   No answer.
</P>
<P>
   Passersby stare at us as we stand shouting into the doorway of
the men's bathroom. We glare back at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished yet?'' we call in.
</P>
<P>
   At just this moment, a burly man walks out the door. ``Yeah,
lady, I am. Happy?''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes that moment of truth when we can bear the anxiety no
longer. Do we cover our eyes, open the door just a crack and call
his name? Do we ask a male store clerk to go in and check on him?
The seconds drag on like hours.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, out walks the little guy, toilet paper stuck to his
shoe, the waist of his shorts folded twice over, his hands dripping
wet, and a big smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it Mommy, all by myself!''
</P>
<P>
   You smile encouragement even though you know otherwise. No, son,
you didn't. You had moment-by-moment verbal instructions. Never
mind that I was ready to call in the National Guard, not to mention
your platoon of G.I. Joes.
</P>
<P>
   We survived it, though. With any luck, it'll be another 30
minutes before you have to go again. Vicki Marsh Kabat writes for

BIOGRAPHER HAD ACCESS TO FAMILY ARCHIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major challenge for A. Scott Berg in writing his
just-published biography of hero-aviator Charles A. Lindbergh was
retelling the story of the incredible 33 1/2-hour solo flight
across the Atlantic in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston to promote ``Lindbergh,'' Berg said, ``I had a lot to
compete with, including Lindbergh himself who did it so well'' in
his 1954 Pulitzer-Prize-winning account, ``The Spirit of St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to recapture the atmosphere and excitement that
surrounded the event, Berg had the good fortune of hearing an
account from actor Jimmy Stewart who played Lindbergh in the 1957
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the loveliest account I had,'' said Berg. The flight
occurred on Stewart's 17th birthday, Berg said, and he had stayed
up most of the night waiting for news. ``He talked about it to me
as if it as if it was just the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, 49, lives in Los Angeles. He began work on the Lindbergh
biography in 1990. His biography of editor Maxwell Perkins won the
National Book Award in 1979. Following that, he wrote a biography
of film mogul Samuel Goldwyn.
</P>
<P>
   An equally great challenge, Berg said, was providing a
definitive account of the kidnapping of Lindbergh's infant son _
the ``crime of the century'' when it occurred in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Having secured permission from Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, Berg had access to previously unexamined family
archives, including letters that family members had written to each
other during the three years between the kidnapping and the murder
trial and conviction of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

UNREPENTANT ROOTS-ROCKER MELLENCAMP BACK TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' says John Mellencamp. ``People who love rock
'n' roll are kind of like smokers. It's a case of, `Hey, you guys
go smoke outside, will you? We don't want you in here.''' He has a
point, since rock 'n' roll has lost commercial ground to other
forms of popular music such as rap, techno, and pop in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll is just another music now,'' he adds with a
sigh. ``When we were kids, it was the music.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mellencamp, of course, it still is the music. He's back to
affirm that on his new album, ``John Mellencamp,'' which hits the
stores today. It's his first disc for Columbia Records after 20
years with PolyGram _ and it marks a return to hard-hitting,
guitar-dominated roots-rock, after a trendy, techno-dabbling side
trip on his last album, ``Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky,'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If you liked his popular '80s albums ``Scarecrow'' and ``The
Lonesome Jubilee,'' then you'll like this new one, which not only
rocks, but reflects the honesty that is at the root of Mellencamp's
best music. It also reflects the blessing of just being able to
make music at all, since Mellencamp has recovered from the heart
attack he suffered a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be grateful for what you've got,'' he sings in the
closing tune, ``Days of Farewell.'' That makes a nice book-end to
the first track on the record, ``Your Life is Now,'' which
declares, ``Lift your head up above the crowd/Your father's days
are lost to you/This is your time here to do what you will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, now 46, is doing quite well, thank you. ``I'm
happier and more content than I've ever been,'' says the Indiana
native. ``I don't get bored or lonely these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he feels a new lease on life thanks to his switch to
Columbia Records, whose president, Tommy Mottola, managed
Mellencamp's career back in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inspired by the new record label,'' Mellencamp admits.
``I also owe a great deal of thanks to PolyGram for letting me
out,'' he adds, though somewhat sarcastically, since he feels
PolyGram was more interested in supporting the teen-idol group
Hanson than in promoting his records.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mellencamp, formerly one of rock's angry young lions,
is more sanguine and accepting on his new record, which is another
of its strengths. ``I'm not the young kid that I used to be,'' he
sings on the percussive ``I'm Not Running Anymore.'' He knows his
place and limits, which many veteran rockers aren't always willing
to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's stopped his social commentary, mind you. In fact,
there's a lot of it on the new record. The song ``Eden Is Burning''
is a metaphor for a failing love affair, but also for societal
decay. The hard-rocking ``Fruit Trader'' points up the futility of
some '90s cynics: ``Ain't got no morals/Ain't got no politics/Ain't
go no particular point of view,'' he sings, mimicking them. But,
without sounding preachy, the rejuvenated Mellencamp concludes with
the verse, ``Better let a little bit of this goodness get in.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the new Mellencamp is facing the millennium with a
positive attitude. In the funky ``Summer of Love,'' which has a
recitative, Tom Waits-style vocal, he even notes, ``It's the summer
of love/Leastways, I'm hopin' it is.'' Never for a moment do you
doubt him.

WASHINGTON POLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans can't agree on whether President
Clinton should be impeached, but there is one subject on which the
leaders of both parties are in perpetual harmony: that campaign
finance is a game whose rules were made to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of rules were broken, or at least bent, during the 1996
election, a depressing spectacle that gets the ``Frontline''
treatment this week on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   You should watch ``Washington's Other Scandal'' if you care
about democracy, though you should probably avoid it if you care
about preserving any illusion that democracy is on the level in our
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though a bipartisan stench emanated from the '96 campaign, at
$2.2 billion the most expensive in history, there is little doubt
whom ``Frontline'' considers the Miscreant-in-Chief. Host Bill
Moyers puts the case succinctly: ``In 1996, a `For Sale' sign was
hung on the White House.'' Indeed, despite his periodic prating
about campaign finance reform, such niceties did not get in
Clinton's way as he geared up for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising stories can be confusing and labyrinthine, and are
usually not long on visuals. But this ``Frontline'' largely
achieves the elusive goal of clarity because it makes copious use
of White House videos of the notorious fund-raising ``coffees'' and
Clinton dinners with fat-cat contributors.
</P>
<P>
   So again we see our president doing some slick talking on
videotape, but this time it's to boast to some assembled moneybags
of the ``brilliant thing'' they are helping to finance. What
Clinton was so proud of, Moyers says, was an end run around
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton agreed to accept public money and the spending
limits thereby required, his campaign also orchestrated, with the
Democratic National Committee, an effort to raise millions of
dollars of so-called ``soft money'' _ money used to pay for
``issues ads'' that amounted to thinly disguised Clinton campaign
ads. Soft money can't legally be used to promote a specific
candidate, and some have charged that Clinton and perhaps Vice
President Gore both knowingly flouted that rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tells donors on one videotape that ``it means that we
can finance this campaign in 1995, so I don't have to worry about
it in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were matters any more fragrant over on the Republican side.
According to ``Frontline,'' the GOP employed ``shells and shams''
to conceal the identity of rich donors who secretly gave tens of
millions of dollars to Republican candidates. The money funded
attack ads on Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Senate launched its investigative hearings, both
parties had so much to hide that the hearings turned into ``a
mutual protection racket,'' Moyers says, with senators determined
to cover up the ``sordid truth'' of what happened in 1996.
Eventually, Senate Republicans killed a campaign-finance reform
bill that would have eliminated soft money from campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics will see this as politics-as-usual, and maybe they're
right. But ``Frontline'' reminds us that politics-as-usual carries
a price by examining what happened to a poverty-stricken Oklahoma
Indian tribe that got caught up in the Washington money game.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get any action in Washington on their bid to regain
land taken by the federal government, the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe
scraped together its meager savings and gave almost $100,000 to the
Democratic National Committee. Lo and behold, tribal leaders were
then invited to a White House lunch with Clinton. Soon enough, a
Washington lobbying firm descended on the tribe, demanding tens of
thousands more dollars to further grease the skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheyenne-Arapaho still do not have their land,'' Moyers
says. ``What they do have is an understanding of the rules in
Washington's greed-driven game.'' And so, thanks to ``Frontline,''
do the rest of us.
</P>

SAGAMIX MAY BE IN BREEDER'S MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sagamix, an undefeated 3-year-old, won the $1.2 million Prix de
l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris Sunday and may come to the
Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Jean-Luc Lagardere, trained by Andre Fabre, and ridden
by Olivier Peslier, Sagamix ran his record to 4 for 4 with a wide
rally in deep stretch, catching the fine filly Leggera and Richard
Quinn at the wire to win by a neck. The time for the 1 1/2-mile
race over soft going was 2:34 2/5 and, at 2-1, Sagamix was one of
the favorites in the 14-horse field. It was a milestone victory for
both Fabre, who saddled his fifth Arc winner (Trampolino, '87;
Subotica, '92; Carnegie, '94, and Peintre Celebre, '97), and
Peslier, who won his third straight Arc (Hellissio in '96 and
Peintre Celebre).
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the fifth time I've trained the winner, but every
time is something special, really great,'' said Fabre. ``I could
see from Sagamix's beautiful action that he was going well as they
ran downhill and I was always confident that he would catch
Leggara. The soft ground didn't matter, as Sagamix goes well on any
ground. This is a great achievement for Monsieur Lagardere as he
bred Sagamix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' said Peslier. ``There was a big question
mark early in the straight because Sagamix is a lazy horse and I
was pushing and pushing him. But he fought all the way, and, when I
smaked him, he ran on.''
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million Breeders' Cup Turf is enriched when the winner of
the Arc, Europe's greatest race, comes to challenge the best in
North America and there is a 50-50 chance that will happen this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for France,'' said Lagardere, president of
GALOP, the ruling body of French racing. ``The horse is still
undefeated, and you can't get any better than that. Andre told me
before the race that this was his best horse. We may run him in
either the Breeders' Cup or the Japan Cup. But this is a very
emotional occasion and we never make hasty decisions.''

   A broadcast for fans
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Downs opened its gates at 9:15 a.m. Sunday and offered
simulcasting wagering on the Arc, and three stakes that followed on
the undercard, at the request of its most ardent patrons. About 300
devotees were on hand for the Arc, which carried a 9:50 a.m. post,
and a total of $7,132 was wagered on the four races from Longchamp.
``We consider these simulcasts more of a service to our customers
than anthing else,'' said Suffolk publicist T.D. Thornton.
``Bringing in racing from Europe at 9:50 a.m. on an NFL Sunday is
hardly a big money-maker. But enough fans follow the worldwide
racing scene that we though it would be a good idea to follow
through on their requests to show the Arc.'' ... Pat Day, a true
gentleman and one of the top ambassadors for racing, was unable to
ride Keene Dancer in the Virginia Derby at Colonial Downs Saturday
after he was denied a Virginia permit because of a technicality
stemming from a 1975 conviction for marijuana possession in
Chicago. Day has long since had a religious conversion, about which
he speaks openly and often. Trainer David Carroll scratched Keene
Dancer from the race in protest. ``Pat's turned his life around and
he's a spokesman of the highest order in racing,'' said Carroll.
``If God can forgive you, how come the state of Virginia can't? I
think it's terrible.''

   Skip Away looks ready
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away continues to look sharp training for Saturday's $1
million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont. Certain to be Horse of the
Year, Skip Away will be seeking his third straight Jockey Club
victory, and he showed he is ready with a five-furlong drill in
1:00 2/5 under Jerry Bailey Sunday. ``The work was just fine, and
he came out of it beautifully,'' said trainer Sonny Hine. ``Jerry
told me after the work that Skip Away is ready and everything is
perfect. We're really glad that Gentlemen (who ran second to Skip
Away in the Woodward at Belmont Sept. 19) is in because he'll keep
Skippy on his toes. You can't let a horse like Gentlemen get an
edge on you, and you can't take him lightly. But the better the
competition Skippy has to go against, the better he is.'' ...
Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old who won the Haskell and Travers
but was run off his feet by Skip Away when fifth and last in the
Woodward, worked five furlongs in 1:01 4/5 at Belmont Sunday.
Coronado's Quest will be retired to stud after one more race,
either the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic or the $300,000 Cigar
Mile at Aqueduct Nov. 28. Frankly, the later spot would make more
sense as a showcase for a triumphant curtain call, since Skip Away
is going to the Classic. ... Free House, fourth in the Woodward,
has been working well since returning to California, and went five
furlongs in :58 4/5 at Santa Anita last Friday. ``He looked very
good and he did it easily,'' said trainer Paco Gonzalez. Free
House, who just had a bad day when the second choice in the
Woodward, will start next in the Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita
Oct. 17 ... Richard Mandella, who trains Gentlemen, hopes to have
his other two crack handicap horses, Malek and Puerto Madero, back
in training within five weeks. Malek, who won the Santa Anita
Handciap, has been out with an ankle problem since finishing fourth
in the Dubai World Cup, won by Silver Charm, March 28. Puerto
Madero, who finished second to Skip Away in the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk, has been sidelined with strained back muscles
since finishing sixth in the Pacific Classic, won by Free House, at
Del Mar Aug. 15.

SOX MANAGER STANDS BY HIS PLAYOFF MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jimy Williams's plans for the immediate future?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to dinner in about 10 minutes,'' said the Red Sox
manager, who stopped by Fenway Park early Monday morning and said
Monday night by phone that he planned to spend a few more days in
the Boston area before heading home to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he won't do, Williams said, is dwell on the deciding
Game 4 of the Division Series, a 2-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians
in which he brought in closer Tom Gordon to start the eighth, only
to have the Indians score both of their runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, when asked if he'd replayed the game, one in
which he was villified in advance for starting Pete Schourek, only
to have the lefty deliver 5 1/3 scoreless innings. ``I have no
reason to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd gotten it right the first time, he said: ``In my
estimation, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions during the regular season, Williams had used
Gordon to record six outs, though this was the first time all year
he'd started the eighth inning. On both of those occasions, he
recorded a save, but Saturday night, Gordon blew a save for the
first time since April 14, ending a string of 43 consecutive saves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been on the bench in Atlanta as the Braves'
third-base coach in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series, when Braves
manager Bobby Cox brought in closer Mark Wohlers for the first time
to start the eighth inning. Wohlers gave up a three-run home run to
Jim Leyritz that is widely credited for swinging that Series in the
Yankees' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Williams noted the Red Sox outscored the Indians in the series
(20-18), outhit them (.252 to .206) and outpitched them (4.63 to
5.00).
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors? I don't think we made one (they didn't), and yet we
lost the series, three games to one,'' Williams said. ``Timely
hitting, timely pitching came into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last part of our lineup didn't hit at an inopportune time,
but basically they hit all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he spoke briefly with Mo Vaughn after the final
game. ``Just for a second,'' he said, ``to compliment him on the
year he had. I look forward to seeing him in Fort Myers. If I
didn't say it loud enough, I said it to myself. He's an integral
part of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to having him on the Red Sox next spring,
but the organization has to handle that. I'm sure they'll handle it
the best way they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams echoed the comments of CEO John Harrington, who said
the team plans to seek a top-line starting pitcher in the
off-season. ``A lot depends on who you're talking about, who's
available?'' he said. ``Do you get that pitcher from your system,
in a trade, as a free agent? Those clubs that have good starters,
like we do, aren't going to give any up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams defended left fielder Troy O'Leary, who hit just .238
after the All-Star break, .218 on the road, and was just 1 for 16
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the kid had a good year,'' Williams said. ``He had some
big hits for us. He really played well defensively. I think it
helped him that he played right field last year, had to roam those
big spaces, because he became a very good left-fielder in Fenway
Park. He was consistent all year long, and hit his home runs (23).
</P>
<P>
   ``The last part of the lineup just didn't hit in the playoffs,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he hopes that center-fielder Darren Lewis elects
to return next season. Because he played at least 100 games, Lewis'
contract stipulated that he has the right to declare free agency,
rather than accept the club option for a modest $1 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him back, very much so,'' Williams said. ``You really
can't say enough about him. He was a tremendous asset, and what an
outstanding person this guy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams hinted that the Red Sox might be in the market for a
right fielder, rather than go with the platoon of Darren Bragg and
Damon Buford, though he said that ``if we were to saddle up
tomorrow, I'd utilize their skills the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox right fielders batted a combined .297 last season, which
ranked third in the league, but their home runs (13) ranked last in
the league and their RBIs (74) were more than just one team, the
expansion Devil Rays (65).
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there an absolute way to have a perfect team?'' Williams
said. ``Maybe we could have Nomar (Garciaparra) play right field.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams praised his young catching tandem of Scott Hatteberg
and Jason Varitek (``People don't talk about what they gave to this
team, with their combined three years of experience'') and said he
liked rookies Donnie Sadler and Trot Nixon, though he expects
second baseman Jeff Frye to reclaim his position.
</P>
<P>
   Among the young pitchers, he talked of the great improvement
shown by Derek Lowe, whom he believes has found his niche as a
reliever. ``I really believe that's his forte with the club as we
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   His coaches have yet to be rehired, but Williams said he doesn't
anticipate any changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a group of kids that really wanted to do something,''
he said. ``And they seemed to be more focused as the season went
on. It was very easy for them to come play every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do the best we could to play them all. They all
got in there, they all had their opportunity to do something. Every
one of them had at least one day in the sun.''

PATRIOTS OFFENSE WELL-CONNECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Patriots need to solve their third-down
problems on defense in a hurry. The Kansas City Chiefs, a team
chosen by many to be the AFC representative in the Super Bowl, will
be in town this Sunday. It will be the biggest game for the
Patriots since Denver on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chiefs, likewise, have to be a bit worried about the
Patriots' offense. The Ernie Zampese system has taken hold quite
nicely, despite four turnovers by Drew Bledsoe in Sunday's victory
over New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bledsoe will not be doing that every week. He had
some bad luck, with a ball deflected at the line of scrimmage being
intercepted by a lineman. And most of the time, Ben Coates will
catch the ball that went right between his hands into the arms of a
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Four very good things happened with the Patriots offense Sunday,
after a bye week to boot.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bledsoe overcame his mistakes and led the team downfield for
a win.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rookie Robert Edwards ran with authority and is quickly
shaking the first-year nerves.
</P>
<P>
   3. The offensive line and fullback Tony Carter were able to
run-block very well.
</P>
<P>
   4. Coates resurfaced with seven receptions after being a virtual
nonfactor in the first three weeks, missing one game because of
ankle injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best we've felt about our offense,'' said coach
Pete Carroll. ``Ernie was really free-wheeling out there, calling a
lot of different types of plays. I thought the guys really
responded well and we were moving the ball in the air and on the
ground against a very good defensive team. It was just great to see
how we came out of the bye week with so much fire. I was worried
about that. But we wanted this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates, who would have been a big star in the silent movie
industry, is beginning to do his talking on the field, where he's
always done it. During the bye week, the Patriots staff realized
that it wasn't using one of the greatest tight ends of all time in
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben was hurt in Denver and then couldn't play against
Indianapolis,'' said Carroll. ``We really weren't even planning for
him to be back for Tennessee, but he was. This was the first week
that Ben was really a part of our game plan after the first week.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bledsoe, who has thrown 37 touchdown passes to Coates in
their five-plus years together, had been looking away from him.
Reportedly, Coates wondered what was going on, but attention
quickly was refocused on him. He has shaken off several personal
problems and is again a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much respect for that man,'' said Shawn Jefferson.
``All that he's had to overcome. But if anyone can overcome it,
it's Ben Coates. He's amazing. After he hurt both ankles in Denver,
he insisted on going out on a pass play just so he could be a
decoy. That enabled me to go out there and catch a long pass in the
game. That showed me right there what Ben would do to help win a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the old Coates traits reappeared. He fought off
linebackers and safeties by swatting at them throughout the game.
Nobody has been beaten up more in his career than Coates, who
usually dishes it back out.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were trying to hammer him, but Coates got the best of
the battles.Bledsoe's first pass of the game was an 11-yarder that
Coates muscled forward another 4 yards. Three of his catches were
on third down, helping drives continue. He gained 78 yards on the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards gained more than 90 yards for the second straight game
(22 carries for 97 yards). The Patriots did different things with
their run blocking, including running to the left side more.
</P>
<P>
   Center Dave Wohlabaugh did a fine job on Saints nose tackle
La'Roi Glover and was especially effective on a first-quarter play
when he had to take on two blitzing Saints and warded them off long
enough for Bledsoe to complete a fourth-down pass to Terry Glenn
for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Pass protection was good, as well, as the line and fullback Tony
Carter did a nice job picking up blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best front we've played,'' said Carroll.
``Wohlabaugh did a nice job up front and our guards did a nice job.
It's really coming together with the pass and the run. We're
picking up blitzes, and the team we're about to play blitzes at
least 30 times a game. We beat the blitz very well, especially when
Drew hit Terry on the fourth-down play with a full blitz coming.
Teams have got to be saying, `Should we be doing this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 60 percent of his passes (21 of 35) for 317
yards. He said the offense seemed able to move downfield with ease,
but mistakes prohibited him from putting away the game earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've been accused of not being fiery,'' said Bledsoe,
``but I think one of my strengths as a quarterback is that whether
things are going well or bad, one of my strengths as a quarterback
is being able to keep a level head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe continues to spread the ball; seven players had
receptions. One of them wasn't Jefferson, who has caught only five
passes this season, though for a 25.6-yard average. Bledsoe is
going to whoever appears to be hot and whoever appears to be open.
</P>
<P>
   This offense appears ready to handle whatever the Chiefs throw
their way.

THE PROBLEM IS STILL JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I believe that we are in the most serious financial crisis
since World War II,'' the chief of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, William McDonough, told the Institute of International
Bankers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. And if it isn't altogether agreed upon what
to do about it, we should at least be clear about why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The slump now threatening to spread from Asia to the rest of the
world was made in Japan. It stems from the economy's superheated
boom in the late 1980s, and the subsequent bust that started in
1992. It has been exacerbated by the austerity demanded by the
International Monetary Fund as the crisis spread from place to
place _ Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia, Brazil. But the
problem's root cause remains the stagnation of the world's
second-biggest economy.
</P>
<P>
   How serious is it? Japanese employment has held up well enough,
though today's 4 percent jobless rate is awfully high by its
historic standards. Otherwise, the economy has lost all its its
oomph, at home and throughout the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown at an average rate of 3.7 percent a year from 1981
through 1992, Japan has barely grown at all since _ and this year
its economy will significantly shrink.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? The Nikkei 225 stock index peaked on Dec. 29,
1989, at 38,916. Monday it fell 2.1 percent to 12,948 _ a third of
its top value. It was the first dip below the psychologically
important 13,000 since early 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been more vigorous in diagnosing Japan's problem than
Paul Krugman, a policy whiz at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The affliction is a classic ``liquidity trap,'' he
says, little different from the condition of oversaving that
gripped the global economy in the 1930s. The idea was cooked up by
John Maynard Keynes and refined by John Hicks at the depth of the
depression.
</P>
<P>
   A liquidity trap occurs because of excess savings _ consumers
stop spending and save even as the interest rate drops toward zero.
(Japanese money market rates have been below 1 percent since 1995.)
At a certain point money itself and bonds become perfect
substitutes &UR;  &LR; for one another; monetary policy ceases to have any
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an article prepared for the latest Brookings Papers on
Economic Activity, Krugman has spelled out the clearest version yet
of his analysis _ including some surprising reflections on the
banks. (A version of the paper can be found on his Web page at
http://mit.edu/krugman/www.)
</P>
<P>
   Little has been heard in recent years about liquidity traps,
writes Krugman; the abstracts of just 21 papers in all of technical
economics since 1975 contain the term. Two factors contributed
heavily to the idea's eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the long postwar boom, during which nominal
interest rates stayed comfortably high. The second was the
reinterpretation of the depression by Milton Friedman and Anna
Schwartz, who argued that it had been caused by bad monetary policy
and could easily have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   These combined to convince economists that the liquidity trap
``can't happen, didn't happen and won't happen again.''``But it
has,'' Krugman writes, ``and to the world's second largest
economy.'' It will not do to pull the old analyses of the Great
Depression out and apply them to Japan, says the economist. That
has led the US Treasury to prescribe tax cuts and public works
spending to the Japanese. It hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, economists must take account of what has been learned
in the years since Keynes and Hicks _ much of it having to do with
the centrality to policy of expectations, the mobility of capital
in the global economy, and the ever-more-complex financial
industry. That's where the Japanese banks come in.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the economy can't get going
again until the &UR;  &LR; banks cleanse their balance sheets of the
staggering inventory of bad loans made during the pell-mell
expansion throughout Asia. The Japanese situation today makes
America's savings and loan workout mild by comparison. A financial
cleanup is necessary, says Krugman, but it is unlikely to bootstrap
Japan out of its liquidity trap by itself. That perhaps only a
policy of ``managed inflation'' will do _ about 4 percent a year
for 15 years would serve, causing the yen to depreciate by
something like 20 percent or 25 percent. Heresy? Yes, in this era
of price stability. But it is also the most interesting idea around
to get Japan growing again.

STARR'S CONNING OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Kenneth Starr, rogue prosecutor, has now managed
to do to the House Judiciary Committee what he did to Attorney
General Janet Reno last January _ a classic con to avoid the
inspection of tainted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Starr hoodwinked Reno with what we now know to
be at best spurious tape recordings into expanding his jurisdiction
to include a possible crime that, in fact, had not been committed,
on the basis of his probing of a similar possible crime that, in
fact, had also not been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the sting was completed as Starr got the engine of
presidential impeachment _ just the third in our history _ running
on the basis of a ``referral'' and thousands of pages of grand jury
testimony and other documents, not one of which has been examined,
cross-examined, or otherwise subjected to anything remotely
resembling scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he seems to have told the committee things that are
demonstrably not true, especially about the infamous Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Starr conned the passive attorney general into
performing a rubber stamp role. Monday, he completed an astonishing
con that transformed the Judiciary Committee into a willing
transmission belt for Starr's highly argumentative submission.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, the committee has done nothing more than any
self-abusive citizen could have done over the last several weeks _
read a giant batch of material based on someone else's work.
</P>
<P>
   What both ends of the process have in common is Linda Tripp and
her tapes. Starr played a few snippets at the Justice Department in
January, he claims, not to get a soap opera about sex and lies
about sex going, but to launch a probe of a possibly imminent
effort to obstruct justice in Paula Jones's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   His alleged link was Monica Lewinsky's statements to her
presumed friend about Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan's effort to
get her to lie about her dalliances with the president in exchange
for a job in New York; and those taped snippets, Starr also
claimed, were ``similar'' to what he said was Jordan's involvement
in previous effort to find work for former Justice Department
higher-up and Clinton friend Webster Hubbell in alleged exchange
for his Whitewater silence.
</P>
<P>
   It was all, we now know, baloney. No evidence of any wrongdoing
has ever been presented about the Hubbell matter; Starr's
insinuations about Jordan in both instances turned out to be
unsupported smears, and so, therefore, even a perfunctory inquiry
by Reno would have given a thorough official reason to pause.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Henry Hyde's staff guy, David Schippers, put up a giant
smoke screen around his fellow prosecutor's conduct, essentially
rewriting the Starr referral's charges to make new-sounding
allegations (conspiracy, misprison of Lewinsky's felonies) that
have lower standards of proof and to make ``lying'' equally
culpable with ``perjury'' as an impeachable high crime or
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr did, Schippers presented a pure prosecutor's brief that
consistently omitted or hid exculpatory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he ignored the patent untruths in Starr's referral to
the effect that his involvement in the Lewinsky case began with
Tripp's call to his office on Jan. 12 and a subsequent visit. But
from several sources, and most recently a detailed account last
weekend in The New York Times, there is information that
Tripp-Starr contacts began at least a week before that _ more than
enough time to prepare a strategy to snare the president in perjury
in his Paula Jones case deposition.
</P>
<P>
   And there is evidence that contact between Tripp and the Jones
camp went back at least another two months.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of an ordinary person, prepackaged evidence and
entrapment are real defenses and often get a case tossed out; in
this case, that would be a legitimate result even before we get to
questions of fact, credibility of witnesses, or whether certain
conduct comes near standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That is why independent-minded Judiciary Committee Democrats
like Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts were opposed to the route
insisted upon by the GOP majority Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, a veteran prosecutor himself, felt that to avoid being
a rubber stamp, his colleagues had to conduct at least a
preliminary investigation to see if Starr's referral was sufficient
for a full-blown inquiry _ in short, to see if probable cause
really exists.
</P>
<P>
   By not doing so, Delahunt said it had turned the independent
counsel statute into an automatic trigger and the Congress into a
rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   He was absolutely right, just as Janet Reno was turned into a
robot last January by Starr, and on the basis initially of the
same, tainted evidence.

BRITAIN'S MARYLEBONE ADMITS WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tradition, under siege in tradition-bound England like
never before, took another one on the chin last week when the
venerable Marylebone Cricket Club lifted its 211-year-old ban
against women.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists thundered, sniffed and ordered another gin and
tonic, lamenting that yet another institution that defined a
time-honored vision of Englishness had been consumed by what
conservatives here call the madness of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary people, meanwhile, thought it was about time women
got in, or wondered why in the world anyone would want to join a
cricket club in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Marylebone, however, is not just any cricket club. It is the
guardian of cricket heritage around the world. It is to cricket
what Wimbledon is to tennis, what Cooperstown is to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to let women in ends a seven-year battle of the
sexes that was played out against the backdrop of Marylebone's
pristine pitch at Lord's Cricket Ground. Even Prime Minister Tony
Blair, always anxious to hype his Cool Britannia image, got
involved, urging the club to change its old fogey ways.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous attempts to admit women failed to get a two-thirds
majority of the club's 17,500 members _ average age 57 _ needed to
amend club rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's motion to let women in carried easily with
almost 70 percent voting in favor, club president Colin
Ingleby-Mackenzie diplomatically described the debate that preceded
it as ``acrimonious.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was Ingleby-Mackenzie's swan song. He retired the day
after succeeding in his campaign to get women in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for MCC and for cricket generally,'' he said.
``It's going to create a better atmosphere in the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ingleby-Mackenzie isn't exactly a model of political
correctness. In applauding the decision to end the all-male
bastion, he said, ``Women are a very fine species.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingleby-Mackenzie said there will be one concession to the
traditionalists: a small male-only bar at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael Heyhoe Flint, the former England women's captain,
triggered the controversy in 1991 when she applied for membership.
After the vote, Heyhoe Flint cried tears of joy. Others were crying
in their beer, or, more precisely, gin, which is the spirit of
choice at MCC.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters clamored around Heyhoe Flint, a middle-aged man
walked by and mumbled, ``Life as we know it is now over.''
</P>
<P>
   MCC got religion in a hurry. In 1991, only 33 percent voted to
let women in. By last February, it was up to 56 percent. Faced with
the loss of corporate sponsorship and lottery funds, the club spent
more than $100,000 to convince its members that it was time for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rea, the club's marketing director, candidly admitted,
``No sponsors want to be involved with an organization whose image
is elitist, fuddy-duddy and old-fartish.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of history being made, the victory seemed a
rather hollow one. While as many as 10 honorary women members will
be admitted over the next few months, and up to 60 female
cricketeers let in over the next few years, the rest will have to
get on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The average wait: 18 years.

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOUNG GIRARD COULD HELP BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan Girard is a native of Quebec, he's 18 years old, he's a
defenseman, and he's quiet and shy _ all of which could be said
about Ray Bourque when he broke into the NHL in 1979. Girard has
been impressive in Bruins training camp and could be on the team
when the season opens Saturday at the FleetCenter against the St.
Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Girard's offensive talent is something the Bruins lacked on the
blue line last season, and that is part of the reason why the club
is weighing whether to keep him in Boston or send him back to his
junior team. He can play nine NHL games before his contract would
kick in and give him credit for one year of pro experience.
</P>
<P>
   He played six of the nine exhibition games, including the final
one at the FleetCenter against the Rangers last Saturday. Girard,
who was selected with Boston's first pick in the June draft (second
round, No. 48 overall), has shown significant flash for someone
with so little seasoning. He was on the right point for the Bruins'
five-on-three power play with Bourque Saturday. And he learned some
tough lessons. At one point early in the second period, he got
picked by Wayne Gretzky, though he recovered nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, a kid that age coming up is a little
bit intimidated,'' said coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   On the power play, said Burns, ``He's got everybody in the
building except me yelling at him to shoot the puck. He's got Wayne
Gretzky on the ice, he's got Ray Bourque playing beside him, he's
got Mike Richter in net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a kid who has never played in front of more than 3,000
people in his life. All of a sudden he's playing an NHL game
against Gretzky and Adam Graves and Brian Leetch and everyone is
yelling and screaming at him to `Shoot, shoot, shoot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He conducted himself well. He has to work on his defensive end
a little bit more, be a little bit stronger, but those things are
coming. He's a prize kid and we're certainly glad he's part of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor that will affect his status (he is not eligible to go
to the AHL) is whether the Bruins come to terms with free agent
Kyle McLaren. Boston is thin at forward but has a glut of blue
liners. However, few are of the offensive variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very young, but we just don't have that accomplishment on
the blue line on the power play that he brings,'' said
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``We're going to have to
see how much the coach thinks he needs that. With (Dave) Ellett and
(Darren) Van Impe, we tried it last year and it was OK but it's not
of the caliber we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid can move the puck really good. I wouldn't say he has
made the team yet. It depends what happens with McLaren. But he's
got an awful lot of Brian Leetch in him. Ray needs that along the
blue line with him. I can see he's very vulnerable to defensive
problems. But he is a smart kid and he'll probably overcome them
once he gets playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who converses with Girard in their native French,
thinks Girard has good instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, he sees the ice really well,'' said Bourque. ``He
moves it good. I tell him to try not to do too much, just keep it
real simple. A couple of times he might try a pass here or there.
Whenever he does something like that, I try to remind him sometimes
you've got to put it off the glass or hard around the boards. The
nice pass isn't always going to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think he's handled himself really well. I like that
whenever he does make a mistake, he doesn't get flustered. He'll
try a pass he feels he can make on the very next shift. It's a
matter of getting used to being pressured a little quicker than
you're used to. That's the big thing any young guy coming in has to
adjust to, and that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Girard was picked clean by Gretzky, Bourque was impressed
that the kid didn't lose his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things still happen to me,'' he said. ``You're going to
get picked by guys like that but he caught up to him. He can skate
and can recover really well. He's very talented and has good
composure for an 18-year-old. You don't see too many 18-year-old
defensemen handle the puck like he does from back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, Bourque has enjoyed taking the
youngster under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak to him in French but he doesn't say much, even in
French,'' said Bourque. ``I think I said a little more than he did.
That's the way he is. My nephew played with him last year and said
he's a very quiet kid. He just goes about his business.''

HERE'S A HAMBURGER WAR YOU'LL RELISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you ready for a Hamburg war?
</P>
<P>
   A while back, we reported on the claim that America's favorite
sandwich, the hamburger, originated in Hamburg, Germany, where it
was known as the Hamburg steak _ a name that was shortened to
``hamburger'' in the United States. But there is another claimant
to the birth of the burger: the village of Hamburg, N.Y. Here, as
forwarded by Mayor John S. Thomas, is the Hamburg, N.Y., version of
how the burger came to be:
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1885 and the place was the Hamburg Fair (now the
site of the Erie County Fair). Frank Menches, a concessionaire, and
his brother Charles brought their new gasoline stove to the fair to
cook their specialty, a pork sausage sandwich. Alas, the local meat
market had run out of pork sausage, so Frank came back with five
pounds of chopped beef. He got the stove going while his brother
formed the beef into patties. When the first patty came off the
grill, the brothers tried it and decided it didn't taste zesty
enough. So they went wild and sprinkled a little light brown sugar
into a frying patty, and the result was a scrumptious hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the village calls itself Birthplace of the Hamburger
and holds a Burgerfest the third Saturday of each July, an event
that's always well done. What's more, the Chamber of Commerce uses
this snappy slogan: ``We're on a Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Hamburg, Germany, story? ``Well, I guess the
war is on now!'' says Mayor Thomas. He's not kidding: Some say
hamburgers were on the menu at Delmonico's restaurant in New York
as early as 1836. Others maintain a little eatery in New Haven
called Louie's Lunch was responsible for the invention.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And as for frankfurters...: &LR;  In 1852, the Frankfurt, Germany,
butchers' guild created a long, thin sausage and named it
``frankfurter'' in honor of their town. Then, in 1906, Harry Mosley
Stevens, who operated the New York Giants' refreshments concession,
decided to add the frankfurter, which had been nicknamed the
``dachsund sausage,'' to his menu. He instructed his vendors to
yell, ``Get your dachsund sausages while they're red hot!'' A
cartoonist lampooned the item by depicting vendors selling real
dachshunds in a roll, yelling ``Get your hot dogs!'' And the name
stuck. (With thanks to Mike Schuster of Foxborough, who cites
Mailbits.com, which in turn cites three sources. Nonetheless, we'll
probably hear from the mayor of Frankfort, Ky.)

WOMEN FACE BARRIERS WHEN SEEKING OVERSEAS JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jan Ledbetter asked officials at a large Midwestern
manufacturing firm to consider her for an overseas assignment, they
didn't mince words. They refused outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We aren't comfortable sending a woman to South
America or Asia because of cultural issues,''' recalls Ledbetter,
43. ``The other concern was my husband. He was working, so the
company felt he wouldn't want to travel. I told them my husband was
looking forward to coming with me, but it didn't make any
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, a decade later, women continue to have difficulty
landing overseas assignments, says Lynn O'Brien Hallstein, a
communications professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In research published this year, Hallstein reports that the
biggest barrier women face when applying for foreign assignments is
the gender bias of male managers who believe American women cannot
be successful in cultures where gender roles are more traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that American women will be treated like the
women in the host country,'' says Hallstein. ``The truth is
American women are often treated as a third sex, and are given a
lot more leeway than the women in the host country.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, female executives still lag their male counterparts
when it comes to foreign assignments, reports New York-based
Windham International. The company, which helps new expatriates and
their families settle abroad, notes in a 1998 survey of 45 large
firms that only 15 percent routinely tap women for overseas
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, however, female expatriates said they had few, if
any, problems on the job and were often welcomed by their host
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But old ideas die hard. With lingering stereotypes of women
playing a submissive or limited role in some societies and their
workplaces, &UR;  &LR;  companies are still more likely to choose a male for
assignments in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or the Middle East for
fear their female emissary's gender will get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Dolins, cofounder of Windham International, says that when
her firm began polling companies about female expatriates five
years ago, ``everyone predicted that by the year 2000 women would
be 20 percent of all those sent on international assignments. But
the truth is, the female expatriate population has grown only 5
percent since 1992 and it was just 10 percent then.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hallstein, 83 percent of all women who were
assigned to international jobs in 1997 got them through their own
initiative. She maintains that female executives who take the
following steps are more likely to land a foreign assignment than
those who simply wait for their employer:
</P>
<P>
   _First, initiate a discussion about your interest in
international assignments as early as your initial interview with
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   _Educate your employer about the strategic advantages women
bring to overseas assignments. ``If you do not do this, the company
will operate from its own gender filters and may not consider
you,'' says Hallstein.
</P>
<P>
   _Find out the company's specific concerns about sending women
abroad before you make a serious pitch for a position. This will
allow you to respond appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   _Encourage employers to think about good predictors of success.
Point out that such assignments require people who can tolerate
ambiguity and change and who are flexible, are sensitive to
cross-cultural issues, and are capable of building strong bonds.
</P>
<P>
   _Point out that with international assignments, gender is only
one of many variables that can influence the quality of work. In
fact, your female characteristics and style might actually be
highly valued abroad.
</P>
<P>
   _Some companies have made significant headway in this area. Find
out who they are, gather statistics about the number of women they
have sent abroad, and present this to your firm as part of your
campaign to encourage your employer or supervisor to consider women
for these jobs.

MASSACHUSETTS DEALS SEEN AS UNLIKELY TO AFFECT HUDSON PCB CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two historic agreements to clean up industrial
PCB contamination in Massachusetts waterways are unlikely to have
much impact on the cleanup of the Hudson River, business and
environmental officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very different rivers, different facts, there is
different science, there is different laws,'' said David Warshaw,
spokesman for the General Electric Co. at its headquarters in
Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, the Environmental Protection Agency and GE
announced a $150 million agreement to remove PCBs from the
Housatonic River and contaminated areas of Pittsfield. One week
later, the agency announced a $120 million plan to dredge New
Bedford Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with officials in the New York office of the EPA,
GE officials and Hudson River environmental advocates suggest that
these recent accords won't alter how _ or if _ the EPA and GE
settle their differences over whether to dredge the Hudson to
remove PCBs. The Hudson's ecosystem and the laws that will guide
any cleanup of its waters are different than the Housatonic's. Both
rivers, however, were legally polluted for years by GE discharges
of PCBs, an industrial insulator used to make transformers and
capacitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Housatonic, most of the Hudson River, from Fort
Edward to Manhattan, is a federal Superfund site, which gives the
EPA greater power to enforce any PCB cleanup decision it reaches.
The Pittsfield agreement gives GE the option of challenging EPA's
proposed remedy in court. The company has no similar option for the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GE and the EPA say the Hudson's environmental
issues do not compare with either the Housatonic's or the harbor's.
PCB levels in New Bedford, for instance, are among the highest in
the nation, making dredging a necessity. For the Hudson, GE claims
dredging would only stir up long-buried PCBs, which the EPA
considers a probable human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in Pittsfield, the Housatonic runs weakly and is
almost shallow enough to wade across, lessening any potential
damage from dredging, Warshaw said. By contrast, the Hudson is a
much deeper, rapidly flowing river.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials agree. Dick Stapleton, a spokesman for EPA's
Region 2 office in New York City, said the Pittsfield deal won't
affect the agency's work in the Hudson River because it wasn't a
final settlement as much as ``an agreement to try to come to an
agreement,'' Stapleton said. ``There's no deal yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists in New York have cautiously embraced the
Pittsfield agreement but say the Hudson's future won't be affected
by it. Cara Lee of Scenic Hudson, an advocacy group in
Poughkeepsie, warned against drawing any precedents from what GE
hammered out with EPA's Region 1 office in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's seen the fine print on this settlement,'' she said.
``It's hard for me to see how that will affect the Hudson decision
in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Some EPA officials, in fact, expressed dismay at the Pittsfield
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the most profitable company in the United States, and
EPA is picking up part of the tab,'' said an EPA staff person
familiar with the Hudson PCB assessment project. ``Why is EPA using
taxpayer money to help out GE? We're really troubled by that.''

<P>
   If all goes well, next week should be prime time for foliage
viewing in many places throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   The best, and easiest, foliage route west of Boston is Route 2,
especially after you pass Fitchburg. Pick the route up at Route 128
and go west, leaf peepers. Beginning in Lincoln, you'll find
farmstands filled with the harvest, good places to get your
Halloween pumpkins. Once beyond Acton and Route 27, there's not
another traffic light for some 70 miles. The only problem at this
time of year is the traffic, which can be quite heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards, though, in beauty and festivities, are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield will hold its annual Fall Festival on the Common on
Oct. 10 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The festival will feature crafts,
food, sidewalk sales, magic shows, goat petting, live music from
jazz and bluegrass to a world beat, and there will be cow milking _
unfortunately, Betsy, the cow, has another commitment this year,
and she will be replaced by Victoria, a brown Swiss who just loves

   Greenfield, at the junction of Route 2 and Interstate 91, is a
good jumping-off place for the Mohawk Trail (Route 2 beyond
Greenfield), where the scenery gets even more magnificent. All
along this route you'll find apple farms, pumpkins, cider, and
more. There will be yard sales galore as well as many other local
fests.
</P>
<P>
   From Greenfield, you can take the relaxed Route 10 to Deerfield
and tour Historic Deerfield, a village from the past (its main
street has been described as one of the most beautiful in the
country). Historic Deerfield has many homes from the early 1700s to
tour (the town was the western frontier in colonial days), and a
grand and brand new museum filled with artifacts from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Continue down Route 10 and you come to what has become the
second-most-popular attraction in New England _ the Yankee Candle
flagship store. It has to be seen to be believed. Besides candles,
old cars, and a Bavarian Christmas village, there's also a nice
restaurant, Chandlers, where you can dine by _ you guessed it _
candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Take Interstate I-91 down to Northampton and you can catch the
Paradise City Arts Festival, Oct. 10-12. More than 200 artists and
designers from 42 states will be participating, making this a
festival not to be missed. There will be an emphasis on custom
furniture and home furnishings, large-scale sculpture and
functional pieces for the garden, and museum-quality collectible
work in all media. The festival also offers great food, jazz,
children's entertainment, and demonstrations. Northampton is known
for its restaurants and art. The festival is $7 for adults. For
information, call 413-586-6324. Northampton also is easily reached
via the Mass. Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   For those continuing on Route 2, the rewards are grand. You
could drive to the top of Mount Greylock, the state's hightest peak
at 3,491 feet. Mount Greylock is celebrating its 100th birthday as
a state reservation this year. Then continue on to Williamstown to
view the art of the Clark Art Institute, one of the country's
finest museums _ it even has some Monets. To get maps for driving
tours, events, lodging, and more in the Berkshires, call
800-237-5747 or on the Web at www.berkshires.org.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of traveling Route 2 is that you can dart off in many
directions, traveling on quieter roads, and return in a new
direction, almost without a map.
</P>
<P>
   While this routing encompasses only a small part of New England,
you can be sure no matter where you travel next weekend in the
region's southern parts, you'll be treated to good to great color.
Check out the foliage hot lines for the latest color; some states
also offer events to add to the trip.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who can't hit the road, the Vermont Chamber of
Commerce Web site is featuring a ``leaf cam.'' Just click on the
site and watch as a photo comes up showing a beautiful wooded scene
from Huntington in north-central Vermont. The camera stays focused
on the scene throughout foliage season and is updated every three
hours. To view, go to www.vtchamber.com. The leaf cam runs from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., and retains the clearest photo until the next
morning.

MASSACHUSETTS DEALS SEEN AS UNLIKELY TO AFFECT HUDSON PCB CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two historic agreements to clean up industrial
PCB contamination in Massachusetts waterways are unlikely to have
much impact on the cleanup of the Hudson River, business and
environmental officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very different rivers, different facts, there is
different science, there is different laws,'' said David Warshaw,
spokesman for the General Electric Co. at its headquarters in
Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, the Environmental Protection Agency and GE
announced a $150 million agreement to remove PCBs from the
Housatonic River and contaminated areas of Pittsfield. One week
later, the agency announced a $120 million plan to dredge New
Bedford Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with officials in the New York office of the EPA,
GE officials and Hudson River environmental advocates suggest that
these recent accords won't alter how _ or if _ the EPA and GE
settle their differences over whether to dredge the Hudson to
remove PCBs. The Hudson's ecosystem and the laws that will guide
any cleanup of its waters are different than the Housatonic's. Both
rivers, however, were legally polluted for years by GE discharges
of PCBs, an industrial insulator used to make transformers and
capacitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Housatonic, most of the Hudson River, from Fort
Edward to Manhattan, is a federal Superfund site, which gives the
EPA greater power to enforce any PCB cleanup decision it reaches.
The Pittsfield agreement gives GE the option of challenging EPA's
proposed remedy in court. The company has no similar option for the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GE and the EPA say the Hudson's environmental
issues do not compare with either the Housatonic's or the harbor's.
PCB levels in New Bedford, for instance, are among the highest in
the nation, making dredging a necessity. For the Hudson, GE claims
dredging would only stir up long-buried PCBs, which the EPA
considers a probable human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in Pittsfield, the Housatonic runs weakly and is
almost shallow enough to wade across, lessening any potential
damage from dredging, Warshaw said. By contrast, the Hudson is a
much deeper, rapidly flowing river.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials agree. Dick Stapleton, a spokesman for EPA's
Region 2 office in New York City, said the Pittsfield deal won't
affect the agency's work in the Hudson River because it wasn't a
final settlement as much as ``an agreement to try to come to an
agreement,'' Stapleton said. ``There's no deal yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists in New York have cautiously embraced the
Pittsfield agreement but say the Hudson's future won't be affected
by it. Cara Lee of Scenic Hudson, an advocacy group in
Poughkeepsie, warned against drawing any precedents from what GE
hammered out with EPA's Region 1 office in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's seen the fine print on this settlement,'' she said.
``It's hard for me to see how that will affect the Hudson decision
in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Some EPA officials, in fact, expressed dismay at the Pittsfield
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the most profitable company in the United States, and
EPA is picking up part of the tab,'' said an EPA staff person
familiar with the Hudson PCB assessment project. ``Why is EPA using
taxpayer money to help out GE? We're really troubled by that.''

   HALFMOON BAY, New Zealand _ There's a real secret side to New
Zealand. It's a great place for people who think an aerobic
exercise is something pilots do at air shows.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New Zealand has been promoted as some kind of extreme
sport capital of the world. After all, Edmund Hillary, a Kiwi, was
the first man to climb Mount Everest, along with his Sherpa
companion, Tenzing Norgay. The latest thing to make New Zealand
``hot,'' as a teenage neighbor remarked, was that it's the
``mountain biking capital of the world.'' Ah, mountain biking, the
sport guaranteed to fill the pockets of orthodontists and
orthopedists. The average tourist brochure begins with bungee
jumping and ends with mentions of the glorious 14-day hikes you can
take through the Southern Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Even the trout fishing, if you pick it up on one of those
Saturday morning cable fishing shows, always involves getting into
a helicopter and landing on a 45-degree slope with your trusty
guide. Personally, the only helicopter I'd ever ride in would be a
medevac, and only if I was unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? New Zealand is perfect for the non-adventurous,
perfectly ordinary, office-working, or retired human being. After
all, if it weren't for people like us, who would stand around and
watch people bungee-jump? You don't think this rubber-band roulette
would last a month without an audience, do you?
</P>
<P>
   On a December 1997 trip to New Zealand, the only causes of
elevated pulses were an airplane flight to Stewart Island
(brilliantly piloted through crosswind, fog, and twilight to a dirt
strip in the bush) and a series of S-curves on the highway over
Arthur's Pass (viewed from the passenger seat in a brief moment
when the eyes were open).
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Island, as conveniently reached by ferry as airplane, is
about 60 miles long, 40 miles wide, and all of its few hundred
residents live within two miles of one anothernear the hamlet of
Halfmoon Bay. It is the perfect spot for hiking through
impenetrable bush and miry bogs, if you like that sort of thing. Or
you can sit out on the porch of Doug and Margaret Wright's Stewart
Island Lodge and watch several Kakas, one of the world's rarest
parrots, bounce along the railing and give you the evil eye. After
the parrots get sated with Margaret's sugar water, smaller
songbirds drop in for liquid brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Mild exercise is encouraged in and around Halfmoon Bay, with
several department of conservation trails cut through native forest
and along seaside cliffs. The near-town trails are graded, graveled
in many places, and boardwalks, wooden steps, and bridges cover
tricky terrain and also keep visitors from tearing up the landscape
with waffle-stomping boots. I walked everywhere around Halfmoon Bay
and along nearby island and peninsula trails (easily reached by
water taxi) in street shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Guests with tastes for adventure would return cheerfully
mud-covered from more distant rain-forest destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Halfmoon Bay (and, therefore, Stewart Island) has varied
accommodations, including hiker's hostels, if you like the
wet-socks camaraderie. But Wright's lodge, surely the southernmost
first-class lodge in the world, is really the only choice. It is
not just the food (Margaret is a formidable and inventive cook) or
the location (high above the harbor at Halfmoon Bay). It is the
attention to detail. The Wrights know who gives the best wildlife
tours, where the best gift shop is (rather well hidden off a side
road), when the ferry leaves, how long it takes to stroll from here
to there and back again.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart Island can be kept tame despite itself, there are
whole towns in New Zealand worth visiting just because they are so,
well, so tame. In Oamaru, at about the midpoint of the South
Island's eastern coastline, you will find one of the few places in
the world where you can drive, park, walk a few steps, and look at
penguins. Here is this remarkably Victorian town (Oamaru was the
main port for New Zealand's 19th-century gold rush) with blue
penguins nesting in the riprap along the waterfront and on the
hillside above the shipyard. A few miles out of town, via paved
road and walkway, you can see one of the world's rarest birds, the
yellow-eyed penguin. It is as if you could go to Boston and look at
the great auks and the Labrador ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Oamaru has motels, but it would not make sense to go that far
and not stop at the Pen-y-Bryn Lodge, where Roy and Bernice
Vannini, new owners, are building a reputation based on native New
Zealand friendliness dispensed inside a Victorian grand house with
enough leaded glass and polished woodwork to make Sherlock Holmes
feel he'd stopped at the right spot before plodding on to the
Baskervilles. Just across the street and down the hill
(``Pen-y-Bryn'' means ``Top of the Hill'' in Welsh) is the Oamaru
lawn bowling and croquet club. Visitors are welcome, I was told by
a couple of lawn bowlers. Just a few miles away is the local golf
course where not only are visitors welcome but greens fees for the
day are less than $10 in US currency.
</P>
<P>
   Like many New Zealand towns, Oamaru is just one flower garden
after another. Every householder in New Zealand seems to have been
born with an urge to grow roses, and the dry temperate climate of
the east coast of the South Island is evidently perfect for
flowering plants. In the central courtyard at Pen-y-Bryn, there is
a decorative fuchsia plant that has, over the last hundred years or
so, turned into a small tree. (There are wild fuchsia trees as big
as oaks or hickories in New Zealand's rain forest, but with much
smaller blossoms.) For serious moderate exercise, walking from
Pen-y-Bryn downtown and back is a day of heady scents and bright
colors. The old downtown, somewhat shrunk from its glory days at
the turn of the century, has a remarkable, robust, main street. In
a few blocks, you can shop for everything from farm implements to
fancy duds. There are no malls in Oamaru, which only adds to its
period charm.
</P>
<P>
   Situated about halfway between Christchurch and the attractions
of southernmost South Island, the Pen-y-Bryn Lodge is already a
popular way-stop, but the area is so varied within an hour's drive
that it deserves to be a hub. The Waitaki River, flowing eastward
from the Southern Alps, is a fine trout and salmon stream, and the
whole Otago Province sportfishery is available on day-trips from
Oamaru. The Vanninis have located a reliable fishing guide
(something not always reliably found by browsing the advertisements
in fishing magazines or the local yellow pages). Roy Vannini puts
it this way: ``Tell us what you would like to do, what you would
like to see. We can help.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We didn't pick these lodges, nor did we find the excellent
Chateau Blanc hotel in Christchurch. One lodge owner knew another,
and as one of them said: ``One thing we are very good at down here
is passing visitors along from hand-to-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pen-y-Bryn has a toll-free number for reservations (once you are
connected to New Zealand by your long-distance carrier) at 0800 734
347. E-mail inquiries and reservations can be made on the web at
penbryn(at)es.co.nz or by mail to 41 Towey Street, Oamaru, NZ (no
zip codes in this country)
</P>
<P>
   The Stewart Island Lodge is also on the Web at:
doug&AMP;margaret(at)xtra.co.nz and by telephone at 64 (for New
Zealand) 03 219 1085 (voice and fax). Mail to box 5, Halfmoon Bay,
Stewart Island, NZ.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary with the seasons, but expect something on the order
of $125 to $150 U.S. per person per day, meals included.

 WARSAW, Poland: ... can-do capitalism.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major art museums I visited formed a study in architectural
contrasts. The National Museum is a bleak gray modernist structure.
Inside, it's also unwelcoming. The gift shop is a booth behind
glass, and if you want to examine something for sale, you have to
ask an attendant. The assumption that if you can get your hands on
it, you'll steal it, is a holdover from Soviet times. If you get
past the grimness, though, there are outstanding collections here,
especially in medieval art. The stars of the show, though, are the
haunting eighth- to 13th-century murals excavated by Polish
archeologists at the cathedral in Faras, Nubia.
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw's impressive Centre for Contemporary Art is housed in the
Ujazdowski Castle, built in the 17th century, burned and bombed in
the 20th. In the 1970s, the beautiful building with rounded towers
anchoring each corner was rebuilt. The airy rooms are now home to
the country's best display of new Polish art, as well as work by
the usual international suspects. There's an excellent restaurant
with fine terrace views, and a world-class gift shop featuring
Polish crafts _ glass, ceramics, furniture. You're welcome to pick
up and handle everything.
</P>
<P>
   The one piece of architecture nearly every Varsovian loathes, on
grounds of style as well as symbolism, is the Palace of Culture and
Science, a 1950s monstrosity inflicted on Warsaw by the Soviets. It
soars above nearly everything else in town and sprawls laterally,
too. A debate over what to do with it rages: One suggestion is to
hide it by erecting a quartet of even bigger buildings around it.
It's all well and good for an American to scoff at the bombast of
Soviet architecture, but arguably the second-ugliest building in
Warsaw is the US Embassy, a dreary gray box.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A pilgrimage to a city thousands of miles away, merely to see a
single painting, has the ring of romance _ and also of obsession.
I'd always wanted to see Leonardo's ``Lady with Ermine,'' which,
even in reproduction, intrigued me more than the ``Mona Lisa.'' It
didn't matter to me that an ermine is a repulsive rodent. But
traveling all the way from America to the Czartoryski Museum in
Krakow just for the ``Lady''? Impossible. Traveling by train from
Warsaw, though, seemed entirely reasonable. So I did. It was a 2
1/2-hour ride through a largely charmless landscape, except for
poppy fields. (Poppy seed cake is virtually Poland's national
dessert.) There were also occasional stork-sitings. There are 8,000
storks in Poland. They proliferate, like wildflowers do, because
Polish farmers can't afford the chemical pesticides that would kill
them off. Besides, storks are thought to bring good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Krakow itself has had a bit of luck, architecturally speaking.
The Soviets chased the Nazis out of the city before the Nazis had a
chance to bomb it, so Krakow, unlike Warsaw, boasts authentically
old buildings. Its churches, palaces, and market square _ Europe's
second largest, after St. Mark's in Venice _ are exquisite. And the
Wawel, the castle-and-cathedral-crowned hill from which Polish
kings ruled for 500 years, offers a whole history of Polish
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday afternoon in June, I saw four weddings (and no
funerals) in Krakow's churches, which, in the post- communist age,
seem well-used and well-maintained. There's restoration going on
everywhere. St. Mary's in the Market Square boasts the greatest
piece of Gothic art in Poland and one of the largest of its kind
anywhere: a huge wooden altarpiece that took sculptor Veit Stoss 12
years to carve, a tour de force for which he was paid the
equivalent of the city budget for one whole year.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite Krakow house of worship is the Franciscan Church,
built in the 13th century but with a wild Art Nouveau interior
designed hundreds of years later by Stanislaw Wyspianski, who
filled the walls with stylized angels, pansies, poppies, stars, and
geometric motifs that will remind Western viewers of William
Morris. And there's a still-radical stained-glass window with a God
who looks liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Churches weren't my main mission in Krakow, though. The Leonardo
was. ``Lady with Ermine'' is a moneymaker for the Czartoryski
Museum, which occasionally rents it out to other countries. I went
all the way to Poland without knowing for sure that the ``Lady''
was at home.
</P>
<P>
   She was. And the Czartoryski Museum that houses her proved
utterly charming, right down to its hospitable staff. Both at the
ticket booth and the desk where you buy guidebooks, I made the rude
if innocent mistake of trying to pay with rubles left from a stay
in Russia. Considering what the Soviets did to Poland, the
ticket-seller's reaction, a merry laugh, was gracious.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's core collection is that of the Czartoryski family,
aristocrats who founded the gallery in 1801 and moved it to its
current quarters _ a complex consisting of a monastery, a palace,
and an armory _ in 1876. The family had fabulous taste and the
fortune to exert it, buying the Leonardo in 1800 and the museum's
second-most-famous painting, Rembrandt's ``Landscape with the Good
Samaritan,'' in 1828. The collections of European portraits,
Italian majolica, and Etruscan art are also stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my visit was on a Saturday in high tourist season,
the only two occupants of the small gallery housing the Leonardo
were the ``Lady'' and I. No one is ever alone in the Louvre with
the ``Mona Lisa,'' which is always surrounded by hordes. So this
was a treat. And as if the curators knew you'd want to linger,
there's a long bench in front of ``Lady with Ermine.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo made the painting around 1490; it probably depicts
Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Duke Lodovico Sforza, at whose
Milanese court the painter was working. Part of the object's magic
is that, unlike the ``Mona Lisa,'' who is depicted in front of a
detailed landscape, the ``Lady'' is against a plain black
background. She's removed from the particulars of time and place.
She exudes a preternatural calm. Why? She is bathed in golden
light. From where? She and the little white animal she cradles both
look off to their left. At what? The painting's enigmas are part of
what rivets you in front of it. The larger part, though, is its
sheer beauty.
</P>
<P>
   My ``Lady'' experience was well worth the effort to get there.
Go. But time your visit carefully. European museums often have
weird hours. Those in Mediterranean climes, for instance, tend to
close for three-hour lunches just when jet-lagged Americans are
ready to start their sightseeing day. The Czartoryski Museum stays
open through lunch _ but closes for good at 3:30 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU GO.... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I traveled to Warsaw and Krakow on a tour called ``Poland, The
Baltic States, Finland and St. Petersburg,'' organized by the
Illinois-based travel company Abercrombie &AMP; Kent. Although I'd been
to Russia and Finland on my own before, this tour offered a
complicated itinerary that would have been arduous for me to plan.
So I let A &AMP; K do it, and they did it excellently, fitting in as
much as possible. The 14 day tour costs $5,995. Call A &AMP; K at
1-800-323-7308.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the time, I'd highly recommend extending this tour
at both the beginning and end, arriving in Warsaw before the
official itinerary starts, and lingering on in St. Petersburg
afterward. If you're able to do that, book yourself into the
Bristol Hotel in Warsaw. Rates start at $180 a night, including
goodies like use of the indoor pool and a buffet breakfast so
lavish and plentiful it could hold you right through lunch. There
are also attractive weekend packages at even lower prices. Compared
to the cost of a comparable hotel in, say, Paris, the Bristol is a
true bargain. The Bristol Hotel is at Krakowskie Przedmiescie
42/44, 00-325 Warsaw. Telephone 011-48-39-12-10-61. Fax
011-48-39-12-10-67.
</P>
<P>
   I flew transatlantic on British Airways, which has frequent
service to this part of the world _ including twice daily service
between London and Warsaw. For the short hops between countries I
flew on FinnAir, which I was happy to discover is a BA partner for
frequent flier mileage purposes. The BA number is 1-800-AIRWAYS.

THE SECRET SIDE OF NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INCHBONNIE, New Zealand _ The Tranzalpine train stops here if
you ask them to; otherwise, it isn't even a whistlestop on the
gorgeous route between Christchurch on the dry east coast and
Greymouth on the temperate, rain-forested west coast of New
Zealand's South Island. And virtually everyone who ever gets off at
Inchbonnie (there's not even a platform, let alone a station) is
met by Ray Grubb for the simple reason that if you're not going
fishing with Ray (New Zealand is the mightiest of
first-name-will-do societies), you're probably getting off at the
wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Grubb and his wife, Marian van der Goes, operate the Lake
Brunner Lodge a few miles from Inchbonnie ``station.'' This is a
place of nearly sinful luxury (``understated country luxury,'' as
Time magazine has put it, but sin is always best left understated).
Posh as it is, guests do tend to end up thinking of it as Ray and
Marian's place.
</P>
<P>
   You could drive to Lake Brunner Lodge easily enough if you don't
mind right-hand-drive and the road over Arthur's Pass (another
proof that Kiwis are first-name folk), which is, simply put, a
religious experience if you have a tinge of vertigo in your soul.
However you get there, you enter a world where rare native birds
sing in the trees and walk across the lawn; where gourmet meals
appear on the table as if you were in some international capital,
not nestled in a huge range of protected rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   But for an angler, this is cake decoration. A sporting lodge has
been on the site since the mid-19th century, when it was a six-day
stagecoach trip from Christchurch to Lake Brunner. The reason is
simple: This stretch of the western side of South Island has more
trout streams and rivers and lakes per square mile than any place
on earth. It's the rain, hitting the mighty Southern Alps, and the
consistent cool breezes coming in off the Tasmanian Sea that
provide the chill waters that are the first requirement in a
trout's life.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of a fishing lodge and a fishing guide is not what
happens in the best of all possible worlds. It is what happens to a
guest when everything out of man's control is on the fritz. It was
not by intention that we traveled halfway around the world to see
what Ray Grubb could do in adversity, it was El Nino's idea. Winter
(our summer months up here) is supposed to be windy and rainy in
New Zealand's Westland. But at the beginning of December, 1997 (our
first of June, weatherwise), El Nino brought 100-year floods to the
Southern Alps. They had subsided, but barely, when we got off the
train at Inchbonnie.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand is famous the world over for a particular type of
trout fishing: very big trout that are perfectly visible so that
the angler and guide know exactly what they're fishing for. The big
rivers of the West Coast that are usually, in the inevitable
metaphor, gin-clear, were not. In the cocktail line, they would
have been anything from Margaritas to White Russians (fruit juice
to chocolate milk in teetotaling similies).
</P>
<P>
   This kind of weather can be disastrous. For example, similar El
Nino weather (that's the usual culprit this winter) in October 1997
hit the Yellowstone River Valley of Montana while I was there,
turning the river into something resembling a cross between
cappuccino and buttermilk. They were holding an international
fly-fishing tournament on the Yellowstone that week, and 144
world-class anglers fished for two days on the Yellowstone without
catching a single trout. If Ray was going to uphold New Zealand's
reputation, he had his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   The salvation, when things like this happen, is extensive
personal knowlege of every bit of running water in the
neighborhood. This requires a variety of streams and creeks to
choose among, and the forests and farm fields around Lake Brunner
had the necessary mix. ``We will begin,'' Ray announced after
breakfast, ``at Robbie's.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie turned out to be a dairy farmer, and near his milking
parlor we parked by a tiny trickle of clear water. It was the first
of many springs that would, within a few hundred yards, mingle into
something big enough to be called a ``spring creek.'' Ray
apologized slightly for the water (``Not perfectly clear, I'm
afraid.'') and the size of the trout we could expect to find
(``Hardly big, but this is our only chance today, with the
weather.'').
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in falsely interjecting suspense into a
fishing story. Either you catch fish or you don't. We did, and the
plural is accurate. Ray could spot dark-colored trout lying over
dark weed beds as well as if they were goldfish in a pail. He could
teach the art of very-short-cast flyfishing in five minutes (on
average, we crept and waded up to within 15 feet of the trout).
</P>
<P>
   And in a longish half-day of fishing, interspersed with rain
showers, we caught the largest trout in the visitor's 45 years of
angling. For that matter, of the half-dozen largest trout in my
life, number one, and also three through six, came out of Robbie's
spring creek in the section where the average, so-so trout lived.
We could not fish where the big ones were; the El Nino storms had
backed muddy water up out of the main river into the larger lower
end of his spring creek. In sum, one fair to average day in New
Zealand can be the equivalent, for big fish, of a fair to average
angler's entire career in North America _ provided he knows Ray
Grubb.
</P>
<P>
   Over five days, we tried different places and found a few huge
fish, almost all of which we hooked and none of which were landed.
Eight- pound trout living under a log will come up and eat a trout
fly, but they plan on digesting it back underneath the log, a haven
from which they cannot be extracted with a leader that has a
breaking-strength half the weight of the fish. We did, however, net
fish that would have been bragging size in most of the extensive
world of angling.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fun was in fooling these enormous and wary trout;
landing a huge one is always a rarer event. El Nino simply didn't
give us the number of chances it would take to put a monster on the
bank for the usual photographic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the pleasure came from the surroundings. Trout often
live in handsome places, but not always. In New Zealand, the only
country I have visited that looked better than the photographs in
the travel brochures, the fish swam in rivers of various glories.
If you wanted an Izaak Walton experience, there were meadow rivers
with shepherds and lowing cattle (we could not find one of Walton's
dainty shepherdesses, but many of the cattle were old English
breeds _ Devons and Ayrshires and Jerseys). There were roaring
mountain brooks and, most peculiar, clearing rivers that flowed
gently between banks garnished with 20-foot-tall tree ferns. It was
something like angling in the central greenhouse at Kew Gardens or
the Brooklyn Botanical.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing, for a first-time visitor to New Zealand,
was that this marvelous angling, these brooks and rivers with the
trout of your life swimming in them, were not in some impenetrable
wilderness. Yes, you can take a helicopter or a two-day hike to
wonderful fishing, but you can have the time of your life a hundred
yards off the pavement. If you know Ray Grubb.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For non-anglers, Lake Brunner Lodge can offer guided or
self-guided nature walks, and help with those activities that
require 4-wheel-drive or boat transport to enjoy, including
colonies of rare birds and caves hung with glow-worms. Considering
the expense of telephone calls and the 19 hour Eastern U.S. time
difference (it's usually 18, due to alternating summer daylight
savings times), the simplest way to make enquiries is by regular
mail: Lake Brunner Lodge, RD1, Kumara, Westland, N.Z. The single
telephone (64 for New Zealand, plus 03 738-0163) serves voice and
fax. On the Web, the home page address is
www.nz.com/travel/lake.brunner and the email address is
lodge(at)brunner.co.nz
</P>
<P>
   High-season airfare to New Zealand begins December 1, but some
consolidators and travel companies can carry the off-season rates
($898 round trip compared to high-season rates of $1700) through to
December 10 departures. Newman's South Seas Vacations is one agency
with the lower airfares. Lake Brunner Lodge will continue its
off-season rates through December 20 this year.

<P>
   NEWBURY, N.H. _ Northern New England is swathed in autumn finery
_ arresting reds and vibrant oranges. And it is easy to believe,
looking at these forests, that foliage season has been exactly this
magnificent since the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   But these hills were not always so glorious.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage season as we know it, with scores of maple trees leading
the annual charge into colorful glory, is a relatively new
phenomenon, according to Dave Anderson, a naturalist and educator
with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Cogbill, a historical ecologist based in Vermont, says
the foliage picture now is much different from the one early New
England settlers saw.
</P>
<P>
   Cogbill, who is researching the makeup of the pre-European
settlement forest in New England, said that when the first settlers
gazed out over the hills in autumn, they did not see what we see
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more conifer, more dark green, no really blazing
oranges,'' said Cogbill.
</P>
<P>
   But the European settlers did not tread lightly on the forests
of the New World. And it was their actions _ and the continued
actions of their descendants _ that inadvertently made foliage
season what it is today.
</P>
<P>
   First, they cut down nearly all the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing for agriculture and wholesale cutting of spruce for
timber denuded as much as 85 percent of New England by the
mid-1800s, said Jim Hornbeck, a research forester at the
Northeastern Research Station of the US Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assume that after the Civil War, foliage was not
great,'' said Anderson, making his way along a wooded trail at the
John Hay Forest Reservation in Newbury, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 675 acres on the Hay Reservation were once farmland.
Now the area is nearly all forested _ a classic New England
combination of pine, hemlock, beech, maple, birch, oak, poplar, and
ash.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson explained that after the first great cutting, as farms
were abandoned and clear-cuts reverted to forest, what came back
was a combination of green conifers and foliage-producing
hardwoods. Old fields went to pine, with an understory of hardwood
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a second great cutting of pine, sparked by the
Industrial Revolution, that Anderson said made today's foliage what
it is. Anderson refers to this second harvest of pine as ``The
Boxboard Boom'' _ a massive harvest of pine for making packing
crates and other material needed by New England's mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``That released, in many cases, the hardwood forest we know
today,'' Anderson said. ``The Boxboard Boom begat the foliage.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, said Hornbeck, New England is back to being about 85
percent forested.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cogbill's field studies tells the tale. Using colonial
land survey records, Cogbill has determined that a plot of land in
Woodstock, N.H., in 1794 was comprised of 38 percent spruce, 32
percent beech, 22 percent birch, 8 percent fir, and not a trace of
maple.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby plot today, at the same elevation and close to the same
spot, boasts 16 percent sugar maple, 11 percent beech, 31 percent
yellow birch, 4 percent ash, 5 percent fir, and 13 percent spruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spruce is gone,'' said Cogbill. ``Sugar maple has come on like
gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   Red maple _ also called swamp or white maple _ has also come on
strong. While sugar maple turns predominantly orange and yellow, it
is red maple that produces the arresting crimsons so prized by
leaf-peepers.
</P>
<P>
   Since red maple is of little timber value, Anderson said, it is
often left standing when other trees around it are harvested.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire alone, said Anderson, red maple has increased
by 500 percent since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the US Forest Service, red maple and sugar maple
now account for a large percentage of all trees on forested land in
New England. The two species account for 28 percent of the trees in
Massachusetts, 31 percent in Connecticut, 18 percent in Maine, 25
percent each in Rhode Island and New Hampshire, and 31 percent in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want color,'' said Anderson, ``maple's the poster
child.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Anderson, current trends in timber harvesting _ and
the aging of foliage-producing hardwoods _ means the fall colors
will just keep getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing harvest of our big pines and the aging of our
forest gives way to hardwoods,'' said Anderson. ``A lumberman's
concern, but a foliage aficionado's dream.''

   WARSAW, Poland _ Say ``Warsaw'' to most Americans and they'll
think of war, death, destruction, Auschwitz. Maybe, on a more
pleasant note, Chopin. While other Eastern European cities have
become favorite post- communist destinations for vacationing
Americans _ Prague is the prime example _ Polish cities have
languished in terms of tourism. Fully 97 percent of the people
checking into Warsaw's finest hotel, the Bristol, are business
rather than leisure travelers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame. Warsaw is wonderful, I learned on a recent swing
through Eastern Europe. Part of the trip was business; for the
pleasure part, I linked up with a tour called ``Poland, The Baltic
States, Finland and St. Petersburg,'' organized by the travel
company Abercrombie &AMP; Kent. In Warsaw, I decided that the oft-made
comparison with Prague is silly: The two are completely different
cities. A more valid comparison, one Poles themselves make, is
between Poland's current and former capitals, Warsaw and Krakow,
which are supposed to be to each other as brash New York is to
bookish Boston. I was surprised to find I liked Warsaw better, and
even found it more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Its picturesque ``medieval'' buildings are mainly new, though.
The Nazis bombed the city nearly into oblivion: There's a 20-minute
black-and-white film at the main Tourist Office in the Old Town
that shows exquisite, centuries-old buildings being reduced to
rubble. But Warsaw rebuilt _ with determination and an eye for
historical accuracy. Aiding in that effort were people's memories,
old photographs, and a series of Bernardo Bellotto paintings now
en-sconced in the Royal Castle in the Old Town. Thank goodness for
Bellotto. The nephew of the much better-known painter Giovanni
Antonio Canaletto, Bellotto, like his uncle, was a meticulous
chronicler of picturesque cityscapes. From 1767 until his death in
1780, he was court painter to the Polish king, Stanislaus
Poniatowski. Nearly two centuries later, all those brick-by-brick
views helped to re-create a ruined city.
</P>
<P>
   The marvel of the reconstruction is that it doesn't look like
Disney, or even like Colonial Williamsburg. It looks, and feels,
real and unchanged. Even the sgraffito decoration scratched into
the facades of the buildings looks old.
</P>
<P>
   One issue in restoration is which period of a building's history
to bring back. Like most of the rest of Warsaw, the 14th-century
Cathedral of St. John was blown up by the Nazis and rebuilt during
the Soviet era. The cathedral's facade is now the severe, linear
brick of the original, without the accretions of plaster and fresco
the building acquired later on.
</P>
<P>
   With its meandering streets opening onto spacious squares, the
Old Town is an inviting place to walk. But be forewarned that on
entering it you're likely to be assaulted by gypsy children who,
according to my Polish guide, come from Romania for the summer
tourist season. They swarm around you, demanding money. My guide
insists that no one here is hungry, though, that begging is ``a
lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw today is chic and prosperous-looking, especially along
its main shopping street, Nowy Swiat, which has been rebuilt in its
original 18th-century style. It looks like London's Piccadilly, but
on a diminutive, almost doll-like scale that makes it friendlier.
Nowy Swiat is crammed with the usual high-end international
designer boutiques, but also with shops selling Polish wares,
including crafts and antiques. It's also crammed with cafes. The
one I chose for lunch, Blikle, has been in business since 1869, and
is known for its pastries. During the communist era, the Blikle
family managed to hold on to part of their business, and since the
democratic elections of 1989, they've expanded in good capitalist
style, opening several branches. The Nowy Swiat Blikle is
fashionably decorated, with mahogany paneling and dark green
fabrics that look like malachite. The food is a delight, light and
fresh. No kielbasa on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the food I had in Warsaw was excellent, especially at
the Bristol, which boasts two elegant restaurants serving
international and Polish specialties including the game for which
the country is famous: Venison and elk were on the menu during my
visit, along with exotica including sturgeon fin soup and Russian
caviar served with seaweed waffles.
</P>
<P>
   At a famous restaurant in the Old Town, Fokier, a place of many
small dining rooms filled with flickering candlelight and antique
furniture, I had a fabulous salmon tartare with red caviar and a
hot white borscht with veal. Both were fine _ but served at an
excruciatingly slow pace. Two and a half hours after I arrived, my
main course still hadn't, so I left. Warsaw waiters also seem
unable to deal with a woman ordering the wine. If there's a man at
the table, even if he's the woman's guest, the waiter will give him
the wine to taste. There is, by the way, no Polish wine, I was told
by my guide. This is liberating. Tourists don't have to be polite
about the local plonk, and the locals don't have to be patriotic
about it. Everybody's free to drink French, Spanish, or the more
affordable Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw's large royal park called Lazienki includes several
palaces, one the lovely Palace on the Water, actually on a little
island in the park's lake. The park is also home to an outdoor
theater where audience and stage are separated by a moat, making a
perfect setting for plays where part of the action is aquatic. And
the park boasts a 17th-century villa where the king met his
mistresses. Just outside is a pool with a single strong jet of
water pulsing into the air. An inspiration to the king, no doubt:
It must have been the Viagra of its day.
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw is also the city of Chopin. The city's most famous
musical son played the organ for three years in the ornate baroque
Church of the Nuns of the Visitation. Nearby is the Church of the
Holy Cross, where Chopin's sister brought the exiled composer's
heart after his Paris funeral. The heart now rests inside a pillar
in the church. In the Lazienki park is Waclaw Szymanowski's
``Monument to Chopin,'' a swirling, Art Nouveau design with a
willow bending over the figure. It's heroic in scale and tumultuous
in sensibility: I instinctively hummed a Polonaise while gazing at
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis blew up the original monument, both to get bronze for
cannons and as part of their program to eradicate Polish culture.
But a plaster cast kept in the basement of the National Museum
during the war made it possible to re-create the sculpture
afterward, another example of the city's indomitable will.
</P>
<P>
   A Chopin concert is de rigueur when visiting Warsaw, and they're
not hard to find. I went to one in yet another of the palaces in
the Lazienki park. The pianist _ Iwona Klimaszewska, a graduate of
and now teacher at The State Academy of Music _ is part of a
veritable Chopin industry. Her phrasing of the obligatory
nocturnes, waltzes, and mazurkas was erratic and tempestuous,
turning Chopin into a roller coaster. For anyone who wanted to
continue the ride, during the intermission there were Klimaszewska
CDs on sale in the palace's long court, which is filled with
plaster casts of classical sculptures from the Parthenon and other
Greek and Roman sites.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor with only a couple of days to spend in Warsaw will
have to make choices. You could do a tour emphasizing the tragic
history of Warsaw's ill-fated Jewish community. You could do a
Chopin pilgrimage. I'm an art and architecture fan, so collections
and buildings were my focus, starting with the Bristol Hotel, where
I stayed. Designed in Art Nouveau style, the Bristol opened in
1901. Interest in the new hotel was intense for several reasons.
Chief among them was that its principal shareholder was Ignacy
Paderewski, legendary pianist and later Poland's prime minister:
The first sessions of Paderewski's government, in 1919, took place
in the hotel. Later, the Bristol suffered first at the hands of the
Germans, then the Soviets. In 1981, it shut down. A decade later,
it was gloriously restored, for $50 million, its Art Nouveau
ceiling paintings and stained glass and the famous glass elevator
with its elaborate metalwork all re-created by dedicated
conservationists. The hotel was reopened in 1993 by none other than
Margaret Thatcher, herself a symbol of can-do capitalism.

   Food and dining stories in sight at this hour from The N.Y.
Times News Service for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SF-NORTH-BEACH (San Francisco) _ North Beach is a gentle old
Italian neighborhood that ambles up the hill from the Bay in the
shade of Telegraph Hill. Only 30 years ago the small streets were
lined with butchers who made their own sausage and its bakeries
supplied every Italian restaurant in town. But by the early '80s it
was impossible to go into any of the neighborhood places without
being bombarded by a standard lament: The neighborhood was
disappearing. Storefronts stood empty, one by one the restaurants
started to close, and even the cafes seemed sad. The people who
loved North Beach began to anticipate its demise. And then,
something remarkable happened: North Beach reinvented itself
through food. By Ruth Reichl.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-THE-MENU (Undated) _ When Michael Eisner, the chairman of
Disney, goes to La Grenouille, he doesn't look at the menu. Doesn't
have to. The chef, Daniel Orr, designs a meal just for him. And
when Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon, dines at Harry
Cipriani he almost always has roasted halibut served with a slab of
tomato, capers and oregano. It is prepared for him alone. At the
same restaurant, Oscar de la Renta, the clothing designer, orders
riso alla valenziana every single time he comes. Never mind that it
doesn't happen to be on the menu. In fact, that may be the point,
as some restaurant observers believe: treat the royalty royally and
they will return time and again, adding a less than subtle glitz to
the restaurant's cachet. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: On one level, it is
absurd, even insulting, to try to reduce an entire cuisine to a few
ingredients. But, in fact, so many of the world's exciting cuisines
do have signature combinations and flavors. With just a handful of
Thai ingredients, nearly all of which are available in most
supermarkets, dishes found in the typical neighborhood Thai
restaurant can be duplicated or improved upon. By Mark Bittman.

   &UR; COLUMNS: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ In the United States, ordering by the
glass did not become a widespread practice until the 1970s, when
wine first became popular among trend-setters. At first it was a
discreet way to mask one's ignorance. Murmuring ``Just a glass of
white wine please'' sounds a lot better than, ``I don't know one
wine from another.'' Now it is the way most wine is sold in
restaurants. By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TASTINGS (Undated) _ A capsule wine review.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-BITS&AMP;BYTES (Undated) _ The column: In theory, the Internet

<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is playing ``chicken'' with the president and the
American public. The federal government is now running on borrowed
time. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. There would have
been a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 1, except that
Congress voted for a ``continuing resolution'' that supplies
emergency funding until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president submits his budget requests to
Congress in January and February. Congress has until mid-September
to consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   But this Congress is playing special-interest politics with
appropriations bills. As of Oct. 2, only four of 13 appropriations
bills had been passed. And at least three of the bills yet to be
voted into law have been threatened with a presidential veto
because of the anti-environmental riders attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, but
unless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, the
public can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995
_ with the closure of national parks, national monuments, public
buildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and the
federal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can pass
another continuing resolution so that the federal government
doesn't shut down on Oct. 10. More borrowed time. More political
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congress
realizes it might lose in its collision course with the president
and the American people. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip off
some of the anti-environmental riders he wrote that impact his
state.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, echoed Stevens, but
predicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be even
stronger and Republicans will get what they want then. Presumably,
the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping and
scraping the public lands after this election.
</P>
<P>
   But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collision
in this session? A number of powerful special-interest groups have
forked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: the
fishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companies
and agricultural interests. Approximately 50 anti-environmental
riders remain attached to various appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office of
the Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's public
relations offices and its congressional relations offices.
Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, didn't
like what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston received more than $100,000 in political campaign
contributions from oil and gas, construction and agricultural
industries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department of
Transportation appropriations bill contains a provision that would
allow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas,
national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Helicopters
are now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergency
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
sent a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the
Subcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee on
Appropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill and
promising a recommendation for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: ``This provision would
change fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlife
protections and visitor enjoyment in our `last frontier.' It
clearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent for
wilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the ``whopp, whopp, whopp'' of copter blades somewhere
just above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautiful
silence of the great wilderness areas. In cold, dense air the sound
of helicopter blades carries a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife _
disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds during
winter when they need to conserve their energy.
</P>
<P>
   And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?
Extractive industries searching for geological formations that
promise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters;
wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at key
locations; and those intrepid sightseers who want to view the
Denali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge
from the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to put
their feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whopp
away. And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exit
a quick and useful tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences of
the wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience _ the
Omnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains a
provision to sell off the people's park lands.
</P>
<P>
   Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of the
Interior to sell, lease, or issue use-permits for parcels of land
or structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with the
Cumberland Island National Seashore. The bill also would also allow
vehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interior
appropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because they
didn't want Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Max Baucus, D-Mont., to be successful in adding an amendment
that would remove a number of anti-environmental riders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill in
with several other appropriations measures to create a gigantic
funding bill that President Clinton could not veto without serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the political games continue.

 c.1998 Ha'aretz  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (NOTE: In this exclusive interview, former U.N. arms inspector
Scott Ritter tells Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, that the U.N.
inspectors had broken Iraq's code for hiding missiles _ and then
inspections were stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq and what role Israel played in helping the inspections team.
He also reveals his own personal disillusionment with the United
States for what he characterizes as its lack of support for the
inspections program.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really could get the information before they move the
shell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before they move the shell. And I got stuck. That's why I was
so mad. Because I finally came up with the solution. I broke the
code. We untied the Gordian knot. We figured it out. We had the
problem solved and now we just need to go do the job. It took us
three years, but we solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. didn't let us. Not only didn't they let us, they
won't let us _ because to go do it ratchets it up to the ultimate
level of confrontation. Because there's no way Iraq will allow us
to inspect the people who need to be inspected. We're talking about
the people closest to Saddam Hussein. We're talking about the
security forces, the personal security forces of Saddam; we're
talking about the family of Saddam. These are the people doing
concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It basically works like a mafia organization. When you organize
crime (or set up a) terrorist organization, you have cells. And in
order to become a cell leader, you have to be trusted by the
family, so you have to be very close to the family. So the people
being selected are direct blood relatives of Saddam. There are
primarily Tikritis (people from Saddam's hometown) or there are
alliances of marriage to other tribes, like the Alduries.
</P>
<P>
   People of this nature are also close to Saddam. Abed is the one
who says I can trust this man or I can't. Abott does the
interviews. That's all compartmentalized. (Even) if you get one
cell, you don't what the other guy is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the Special
Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These elite
organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam. Now they
don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you need a
truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and vehicle
resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to that
Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do something
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,
saying its espionage. It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the FBI investigation become known to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew in January, February 1997 that the U.S. had a concern
about the nature of the work and I worked very closely with the
government to try and talk about what their concern was. And it
came down to basically bureaucratic jealousy. You know, I have a
better relationship with the Israelis than they do. They are not in
control. They lost control.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an American. Israel can't have an intelligence relationship
with an American that is not controlled by the U.S. These are their
concerns. I said basically if that's it, then tough luck. Because,
you sent me here to work. You told me to be independent. I'm doing
what you told me to do, and I'm succeeding. So unless you give me a
direct order to stop, and always I'm an American, you give me a
direct order, you say stop, I will stop today. You ask me a
question, I will answer it. I'm not hiding anything from them. But
they never said stop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you say about the Israeli officials you met?
</P>
<P>
   A: First is the professionalism. The people I dealt with were
dedicated, professional, smart. When you go down to Washington you
are overwhelmed with the 9 to 5 mentality. There wasn't this 9 to 5
mentality. This was national security. Plus they think out of the
box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does that mean 'to think out of the box?'
</P>
<P>
   A: In America, you have rules. We're going to address this
problem. Let's read the rules here. They say we can think this, we
cannot do this. That's how we are going to solve this. That's how
we're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are: `What's another way of looking at this? How
else can we do this? Let's think of alternatives here. Is there
another way we can solve this problem?' The Israelis were
innovative and courageous in terms of putting forward ideas. They
were not afraid to have an idea shot down. Again, professional. A
level of trust developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis looked at me and didn't see a United Nations
official, or an American. It's all professional. It's somebody whom
they can respect, whom can they can work with. That's what
impressed me about them. And the fact that they were always
sympathetic with the cause.
</P>
<P>
   I never once felt when I was over there that I was somehow
imposing on them or somehow inconveniencing them. When I was over
there, we were a team. We were all going for the same cause. We
were working really hard. They are good people.

 c.1998 Ha'aretz  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (NOTE: In this exclusive interview, former U.N. arms inspector
Scott Ritter tells Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, that the U.N.
inspectors had broken Iraq's code for hiding missiles _ and then
inspections were stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq and what role Israel played in helping the inspections team.
He also reveals his own personal disillusionment with the United
States for what he characterizes as its lack of support for the
inspections program.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really could get the information before they move the
shell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before they move the shell. And I got stuck. That's why I was
so mad. Because I finally came up with the solution. I broke the
code. We untied the Gordian knot. We figured it out. We had the
problem solved and now we just need to go do the job. It took us
three years, but we solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. didn't let us. Not only didn't they let us, they
won't let us _ because to go do it ratchets it up to the ultimate
level of confrontation. Because there's no way Iraq will allow us
to inspect the people who need to be inspected. We're talking about
the people closest to Saddam Hussein. We're talking about the
security forces, the personal security forces of Saddam; we're
talking about the family of Saddam. These are the people doing
concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It basically works like a mafia organization. When you organize
crime (or set up a) terrorist organization, you have cells. And in
order to become a cell leader, you have to be trusted by the
family, so you have to be very close to the family. So the people
being selected are direct blood relatives of Saddam. There are
primarily Tikritis (people from Saddam's hometown) or there are
alliances of marriage to other tribes, like the Alduries.
</P>
<P>
   People of this nature are also close to Saddam. Abed is the one
who says I can trust this man or I can't. Abott does the
interviews. That's all compartmentalized. (Even) if you get one
cell, you don't what the other guy is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the Special
Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These elite
organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam. Now they
don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you need a
truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and vehicle
resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to that
Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do something
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,
saying its espionage. It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the FBI investigation become known to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew in January, February 1997 that the U.S. had a concern
about the nature of the work and I worked very closely with the
government to try and talk about what their concern was. And it
came down to basically bureaucratic jealousy. You know, I have a
better relationship with the Israelis than they do. They are not in
control. They lost control.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an American. Israel can't have an intelligence relationship
with an American that is not controlled by the U.S. These are their
concerns. I said basically if that's it, then tough luck. Because,
you sent me here to work. You told me to be independent. I'm doing
what you told me to do, and I'm succeeding. So unless you give me a
direct order to stop, and always I'm an American, you give me a
direct order, you say stop, I will stop today. You ask me a
question, I will answer it. I'm not hiding anything from them. But
they never said stop.
</P>
<P>

 By KEN ADELMAN  
 FROM: Washingtonian Magazine  
 &HT;    The 20th century opened with Sigmund Freud publishing ``The
Interpretation of Dreams'' and closes with Freud so controversial
that not long ago the Library of Congress postponed an exhibit on
him. In October the library again hopes to display its large
collection of original Freud works.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, psychiatrists such as Sandra Gail Hershberg practice
Freud's craft and use his techniques.
 &HT;    Born and raised in the Bronx, N.Y., Dr. Hershberg graduated from
New York University and Yale Medical School. After an internship in
pediatrics at the University Hospitals of Cleveland and a residency
in general psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, she
completed a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. She is a
graduate of the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute.
 &HT;    Hershberg specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, the
psychology of female development, and the psychological dimensions
of medical illness. She lives in Bethesda with her husband, a
physician, and their two adolescent daughters. She enjoys reading
fiction, antiquing, watching old movies and biking.
 &HT;    In her office, lined with Freud's complete works and featuring a
couch, we discussed what she's learned.
 -0 
 &HT;    KEN ADELMAN: What makes Freud so incendiary a century after he
started writing?
 &HT;    DR. SANDRA GAIL HERSHBERG: Three things come to mind. People
today often view psychoanalysis negatively _ as a luxury treatment
that takes a long time and is very expensive. So it's thought that
Freud's method doesn't work any longer. At least, that it's been
surpassed by medication, group therapy, family counseling, or other
techniques. I've found that's wrong.
 &HT;    The psychoanalytic method is alive and well. To me it's an
exciting and meaningful treatment. But it's no quick fix. People
now seek to do everything faster and faster. Western Union's been
replaced by the Internet. So many people no longer have the
patience for psychoanalysis they once did.
 &HT;    Second is this big category summarized as comprising ``women.''
The way Freud viewed women _ as having inferior superegos and penis
envy and all that _ opened him to harsh criticism. I'm with the
critics here. I don't agree with Freud much on this score. Some of
what he said on women has some relevance. But there are much more
complex and productive ways of looking at women and gender than
what he presented.
 &HT;    Third is Freud's treatment of sexual seduction and abuse as a
type of fantasy. He initially did think there was real sexual
abuse, but then switched when he attributed patient accounts to
subconscious fantasies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did Freud get right?
 &HT;    A: When considering Freud in his own times _ he was a pioneer,
there was no one before him; he used his cases and his
self-analysis as data _ I'm impressed at how much Freud got right.
Every brilliant individual who makes discoveries makes errors along
the way. Freud made many important contributions.
 &HT;    First and foremost was the nature of the inner life, the
significance and meaning of the unconscious. Freud pioneered the
use of free association. Through his analyses of others and
self-analysis, Freud delineated the concept of psychosexual
development, the child's progression through various developmental
stages.
 &HT;    Unconscious motivation was and is an enormous discovery. It
permeates our lives and culture. Fantasy and creativity are central
to modern life. The fact that we never fully know our less rational
motivation is a staggering insight. Freud developed all that.
 &HT;    Moreover, Freud showed greatness in his willingness to revise
his theories based on new clinical information. He was thus
open-minded in an honest, scientific way. Freud got carried away by
his ideas and his narcissism in deciding to psychoanalyze his
daughter Anna. His putting his daughter on the couch and hearing
her innermost thoughts and fantasies in that way breached an
important boundary.
 &HT;    Clearly Anna Freud identified with her father through her
trailblazing work with children and her defining contributions in
the field of child development and child psychoanalysis.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Was Freud an attack on free will?
 &HT;    A: I don't see it that way. Not at all. Because of unconscious
factors, we make choices on the basis of more than rational free
will. That's true. But Freud's thrust makes one freer, not less
free. For people truly suffering _ as his patients did, as many of
my patients do, and as all of us do from time to time throughout
our lives _ Freud showed us a technique to better understand and
treat conflicts that result in feelings of shame, disgust, guilt,
etc.
 &HT;    Freud frees us by enabling us to be aware of inner connections
and see deeper motivations. That's at least been my experience with
patients. Once they're able to peer into their innermost feelings,
memories, fantasies, they can then make real choices. Freud knew
psychology and biology went together. As a trained neurologist, he
always searched for the biological basis of psychology. The concept
of mind versus brain interested him deeply.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why should someone choose psychoanalysis over drugs, a
family-systems approach, group therapy or yoga?
 &HT;    A: Pharmacotherapy helps with symptom relief. Drugs can
accompany psychoanalysis or another therapy for someone who's
extremely depressed or with a manic-depressive disorder.
Psychoanalysis works best with patients who suffer from traumas or
other early experiences they haven't integrated well.
 &HT;    It opens up an opportunity to be in a safe situation with
someone committed to exploring such experiences in depth. This
enables the patient to transform internal representations and thus
to act and feel better. They can be freer.
 &HT;    Granted, other therapies do that too. But to me psychoanalysis
provides that help in a deeper and broader way than the other
approaches. It opens a greater sense of meaning and knowing one's
internal motivations.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still use a couch?
 &HT;    A: Yes. I usually sit behind the patient, out of view _ like
Freud. The patient's usually lying down.
 &HT;    Q: What's your average length of treating one patient?
 &HT;    A: More than two years and up to 10 or 12 years _ or more. It
really depends.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How did you feel as a patient?
 &HT;    A: Undergoing psychoanalysis was an essential part of my
professional training. It had a very important, even dramatic,
impact upon my life and it made me more aware of what the process
is like for the patient. That made me a better analyst because I
both knew myself better and knew what this process was like on the
other side of the couch.
 &HT;    Psychoanalysis made me much more aware of who I am as a person _
what interests me, how I pursue creative interests, act as a
parent, and what I carry from my own childhood which then gets
aroused in me as an adult. Knowing all this, and these responses,
makes me freer to act _ more of being my own person.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Being a parent, I wonder if Freud really blamed neuroses
almost entirely on the mother.
 &HT;    A: Mothers do have a tough time and a tough job. By emphasizing
the importance of early childhood experiences, Freud did put
mothers at the center of traumas and such early episodes. But
remember that in cases like little Hans, Freud focused on the
father as well. I don't see it as being hard on mothers so much as
trying to understand the nature of the conflict in front of him.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Which groups get maddest at Freud?
 &HT;    A: We've all gotten mad at Freud. But too many have treated
Freud as the last word. They expect too much of him. No one gets it
all right. Certainly Freud didn't. By focusing on so many
cornerstones of the theory of the mind, development, and
psychopathology, Freud opened the door for others to modify and
change the theory. I think that even he would embrace that view. He
did change his theories when shown contrary evidence.
 &HT;    Remember, Freud was a man of his time. He was limited by the
milieu and context in which he worked. The field was brand new
then. There wasn't much to go on. Some of Freud's blind spots
reflect that. Many times he went beyond these constraints and made
enduring insights. And that's why he's still prized, and praised.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've lectured on creativity?
 &HT;    A: Freud wrote a lot on the subject. His office was full of art
pieces, mostly antiquities. Freud read constantly on art and had
many artistic friends. In a paper analyzing Dostoyevski, Freud
said, ``Before the problem of the creative artist, an analyst must
alas lay down his arms. '' Freud thus recognized that he was at a
loss when analyzing creativity. But then, as on most topics, he
proceed to say a lot on the topic.
 &HT;    Freud writes beautifully. I hope the Library of Congress exhibit
and the resulting conferences will prompt more people to read what
Freud actually wrote, rather than what other people have written
about Freud. Works like ``The Psychopathology of Everyday Life,''
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' and ``Civilization and Its
Discontents'' are accessible to the average person.
 &HT;    One of my favorite essays of Freud's was ``Creative Writers and
Daydreaming. '' There he says, ``The child's best loved and most
intense occupation is with his play or games. Might we not say that
every child at play behaves like a creative writer in that he
creates a world of his own, or rather rearranges the thing of his
world in a new way which pleases him?''
 &HT;    While a child takes play seriously, Freud pointed out that he
``distinguishes it quite well from reality.'' Freud concludes:
``The creative writer does the same as the child's play. He creates
a world of fantasy which he takes very seriously _ that which he
invests with large amounts of emotion, while separating it sharply
from reality.''
 &HT;    Freud goes on in this vein of comparing play and creative
writing. It's a very lovely essay.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What makes creativity?
 &HT;    A: Many artists had an early appreciation of the sensual world.
Sometimes even an early trauma. Edgar Allen Poe's mother died when
he was quite young. Poe saw her body then in all its horror. That
description appears in some of his later stories. Magritte's mother
jumped off a bridge and drowned. You can see that sense of time
standing still and unreal nature in his work.
 &HT;    Many creative people were ill or had a lot of time to
themselves. They then became more aware of their own thinking and
fantasies _ their inner workings. For those of us less gifted, we
must find a way to bring out the creativity within us. I see
psychoanalysis as a very creative act. In that space between me and
a patient, something exceptional happens.
 &HT;    I take in a vast range of images, fantasies and feelings from an
analysis, and I respond on a similar level. It's a most exciting
and creative endeavor. I'm very privileged to be able to help
people in need, to free them from symptomatic behavior.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How can we increase our creativity?
 &HT;    A: Give yourself time every day when you're not busy with
something else. Allow your thoughts then to flow out. When Freud
was very young, he'd place a blank sheet of paper in front of
himself every day, just to see what would come up. That was a way
to expand his creativity.
 &HT;    You can see how he was always interested in learning about
himself. This led him into the unconscious, being able to connect
with inner thoughts and emotions. That's what creativity's all
about and what psychoanalysis is about.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've also lectured on eating disorders. Is that an
upper-class, female adolescent disease?
 &HT;    A: Basically. It's not only teen-agers but young adult women as
well. I've treated so many that it appears to me like a societal
disease.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What causes it?
 &HT;    A: It involves a girl coming to terms with her body, with sexual
feelings, and relationships with each of her parents, particularly
with her mother. She must develop a sense of herself with
confidence _ just who she is in the world. While this sounds like
the adolescent struggle in general, some women are of a
perfectionist bent and more preoccupied with their bodies. They
have more eating disorders than others. But adolescent boys
body-build and strut around. They too fixate on their bodies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So why don't they have eating disorders?
 &HT;    A: The incidence of eating disorders in boys is on the rise;
however, our culture emphasizes beauty mostly in the female body.
Look at our advertisements. Girls must look a certain way, wear
makeup, watch every ounce of fat. There's a different emphasis on
the female body for the girl, and for her mother and father, which
is generally less pronounced in boys.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've studied women who have careers. Give us lessons
learned there.
 &HT;    A: The opportunities to be fulfilled by one's work are ever
increasing in our society. That's so wonderful. Not that women get
compensated equally for their work _ they don't yet _ but they can
fulfill such ambitions more easily nowadays. That's important. For
working mothers, it's essential to keep open all lines of
communication.
 &HT;    From professional experience I've learned that sometimes my kids
need more of me. Sometimes they need less of me. Occasionally they
don't need me at all, for a while.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is the incidence of mothers with careers increasing?
 &HT;    A: Yes, but we should look at how the whole family functions in
that household. The real problem arises when one parent becomes so
absorbed that he or she doesn't realize what's missing in the
family.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What have you learned from Freud?
 &HT;    A: The main thing is the primacy of one's inner life. That
determines so much of how we think and behave. As an analyst, I'm
very grateful to Freud for his methodology, which is very much a
part of my way of working and helping others.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What are the main lessons of life?
 &HT;    A: Psychological health is based on the capacities to love, to
work, and to play, as Freud indicated. To be able to maintain a
balance of those abilities makes for a satisfying and fulfilling
life.

 By KEN ADELMAN  
 FROM: Washingtonian Magazine  
 &HT;    The 20th century opened with Sigmund Freud publishing ``The
Interpretation of Dreams'' and closes with Freud so controversial
that not long ago the Library of Congress postponed an exhibit on
him. In October the library again hopes to display its large
collection of original Freud works.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, psychiatrists such as Sandra Gail Hershberg practice
Freud's craft and use his techniques.
 &HT;    Born and raised in the Bronx, N.Y., Dr. Hershberg graduated from
New York University and Yale Medical School. After an internship in
pediatrics at the University Hospitals of Cleveland and a residency
in general psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, she
completed a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. She is a
graduate of the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute.
 &HT;    Hershberg specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, the
psychology of female development, and the psychological dimensions
of medical illness. She lives in Bethesda with her husband, a
physician, and their two adolescent daughters. She enjoys reading
fiction, antiquing, watching old movies and biking.
 &HT;    In her office, lined with Freud's complete works and featuring a
couch, we discussed what she's learned.
 -0 
 &HT;    KEN ADELMAN: What makes Freud so incendiary a century after he
started writing?
 &HT;    DR. SANDRA GAIL HERSHBERG: Three things come to mind. People
today often view psychoanalysis negatively _ as a luxury treatment
that takes a long time and is very expensive. So it's thought that
Freud's method doesn't work any longer. At least, that it's been
surpassed by medication, group therapy, family counseling, or other
techniques. I've found that's wrong.
 &HT;    The psychoanalytic method is alive and well. To me it's an
exciting and meaningful treatment. But it's no quick fix. People
now seek to do everything faster and faster. Western Union's been
replaced by the Internet. So many people no longer have the
patience for psychoanalysis they once did.
 &HT;    Second is this big category summarized as comprising ``women.''
The way Freud viewed women _ as having inferior superegos and penis
envy and all that _ opened him to harsh criticism. I'm with the
critics here. I don't agree with Freud much on this score. Some of
what he said on women has some relevance. But there are much more
complex and productive ways of looking at women and gender than
what he presented.
 &HT;    Third is Freud's treatment of sexual seduction and abuse as a
type of fantasy. He initially did think there was real sexual
abuse, but then switched when he attributed patient accounts to
subconscious fantasies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did Freud get right?
 &HT;    A: When considering Freud in his own times _ he was a pioneer,
there was no one before him; he used his cases and his
self-analysis as data _ I'm impressed at how much Freud got right.
Every brilliant individual who makes discoveries makes errors along
the way. Freud made many important contributions.
 &HT;    First and foremost was the nature of the inner life, the
significance and meaning of the unconscious. Freud pioneered the
use of free association. Through his analyses of others and
self-analysis, Freud delineated the concept of psychosexual
development, the child's progression through various developmental
stages.
 &HT;    Unconscious motivation was and is an enormous discovery. It
permeates our lives and culture. Fantasy and creativity are central
to modern life. The fact that we never fully know our less rational
motivation is a staggering insight. Freud developed all that.
 &HT;    Moreover, Freud showed greatness in his willingness to revise
his theories based on new clinical information. He was thus
open-minded in an honest, scientific way. Freud got carried away by
his ideas and his narcissism in deciding to psychoanalyze his
daughter Anna. His putting his daughter on the couch and hearing
her innermost thoughts and fantasies in that way breached an
important boundary.
 &HT;    Clearly Anna Freud identified with her father through her
trailblazing work with children and her defining contributions in
the field of child development and child psychoanalysis.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Was Freud an attack on free will?
 &HT;    A: I don't see it that way. Not at all. Because of unconscious
factors, we make choices on the basis of more than rational free
will. That's true. But Freud's thrust makes one freer, not less
free. For people truly suffering _ as his patients did, as many of
my patients do, and as all of us do from time to time throughout
our lives _ Freud showed us a technique to better understand and
treat conflicts that result in feelings of shame, disgust, guilt,
etc.
 &HT;    Freud frees us by enabling us to be aware of inner connections
and see deeper motivations. That's at least been my experience with
patients. Once they're able to peer into their innermost feelings,
memories, fantasies, they can then make real choices. Freud knew
psychology and biology went together. As a trained neurologist, he
always searched for the biological basis of psychology. The concept
of mind versus brain interested him deeply.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why should someone choose psychoanalysis over drugs, a
family-systems approach, group therapy or yoga?
 &HT;    A: Pharmacotherapy helps with symptom relief. Drugs can
accompany psychoanalysis or another therapy for someone who's
extremely depressed or with a manic-depressive disorder.
Psychoanalysis works best with patients who suffer from traumas or
other early experiences they haven't integrated well.
 &HT;    It opens up an opportunity to be in a safe situation with
someone committed to exploring such experiences in depth. This
enables the patient to transform internal representations and thus
to act and feel better. They can be freer.
 &HT;    Granted, other therapies do that too. But to me psychoanalysis
provides that help in a deeper and broader way than the other
approaches. It opens a greater sense of meaning and knowing one's
internal motivations.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still use a couch?
 &HT;    A: Yes. I usually sit behind the patient, out of view _ like
Freud. The patient's usually lying down.
 &HT;    Q: What's your average length of treating one patient?
 &HT;    A: More than two years and up to 10 or 12 years _ or more. It
really depends.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How did you feel as a patient?
 &HT;    A: Undergoing psychoanalysis was an essential part of my
professional training. It had a very important, even dramatic,
impact upon my life and it made me more aware of what the process
is like for the patient. That made me a better analyst because I
both knew myself better and knew what this process was like on the
other side of the couch.
 &HT;    Psychoanalysis made me much more aware of who I am as a person _
what interests me, how I pursue creative interests, act as a
parent, and what I carry from my own childhood which then gets
aroused in me as an adult. Knowing all this, and these responses,
makes me freer to act _ more of being my own person.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Being a parent, I wonder if Freud really blamed neuroses
almost entirely on the mother.
 &HT;    A: Mothers do have a tough time and a tough job. By emphasizing
the importance of early childhood experiences, Freud did put
mothers at the center of traumas and such early episodes. But
remember that in cases like little Hans, Freud focused on the
father as well. I don't see it as being hard on mothers so much as
trying to understand the nature of the conflict in front of him.

 By FRANK BRUNI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It starts the moment Bill Weld steps from the car and seems as
if it will never stop: the craned necks, the raised thumbs, the
exuberant hellos.
 &HT;    As he makes his way into and then through Fenway Park, there is
a new fan at every step, another outstretched hand at every turn.
 &HT;    On this mid-July night in the heart of Boston, the approbation
is as thick as the humidity. ``Can I get a picture of you with my
nephew?'' asks one man, maneuvering the little boy into position.
 &HT;    Weld obliges with a hand around the boy's back, a well-practiced
smile and a wry apology.
 &HT;    ``Sorry about the extra poundage,'' he quips, his free hand
straying toward a belly that's only a tad larger than it used to
be.
 &HT;    There is another man who regales Weld with praise for his six
and a half years as governor of Massachusetts, another who vows
eternal political allegiance to him, yet another who simply wants
to chew the fat.
 &HT;    Finally, Weld reaches his destination: a swath of seats where
more than a dozen colleagues from the blue-chip law firm where he
now works are ensconced, frothy beers in hand, for a ties-off,
wing-tips-unlaced outing.
 &HT;    He takes his seat and looks toward home plate, a white speck,
almost invisible from this remote section deep behind right field.
Strangely, Weld has run a gantlet of adoration to end up far, far
away from the action.
 &HT;    ``Governor Weld,'' shouts a voice from three rows behind him,
``what are you doing all the way back here?''
 &HT;    ``These are the best seats I could get,'' Weld quips. ``When
you're out, you're out.''
 &HT;    Just two years ago, Weld was very much in. He was a popular
second-term Republican governor in a heavily Democratic state. He
had presided over, and certainly contributed to, the state's
transition from economic bust to boom. Pundits touted his brand of
fiscal conservatism and social liberalism as a New Age model, and
Democratic peers emulated it. Journalists anointed him a
presidential possibility.
 &HT;    Then he made one of the most abrupt, astonishing U-turns in
recent political history. Brashly tempting electoral fate, he
challenged John Kerry, a popular Democratic incumbent, for one of
Massachusetts' two seats in the U.S. Senate.
 &HT;    It was a questionable decision, ending in defeat, that Weld
followed with another, more quixotic quest: to become the U.S.
ambassador to Mexico, a post that Jesse Helms, the
ultraconservative Republican chairman of the Senate's Foreign
Relations Committee, almost immediately vowed to deny him. Weld
left office to devote himself to the fight for confirmation. Once
again, he lost.
 &HT;    Now comes another surprise, of an entirely different sort. This
month, Simon &AMP; Schuster published Weld's first novel, ``Mackerel by
Moonlight,'' a political, picaresque tale seasoned generously with
his trademark droll humor. Although Weld is not the first
politician to try his hand at fiction, the book remains an unusual
endeavor, the latest curve ball in a career that has recently been
rife with them.
 &HT;    And it draws renewed attention to a question that has perplexed
observers for some time now: How did William F. Weld, 53, a onetime
golden boy, get from there to here?
 &HT;    One of the most frequently offered answers has to do with Weld's
status as a pro-choice, gay-friendly libertarian in a Republican
Party that does not easily accommodate such thinking. Or, Weld's
exile is chalked up to a few bad decisions.
 &HT;    But the truth is more complicated, and has at least as much to
do with who Weld is on the inside as the world outside him. As
reflected in both the substance and tone of ``Mackerel by
Moonlight,'' which is more ``Primary Colors'' than ``Profiles in
Courage,'' this is a man who has always favored irony over
earnestness, who seems at least as interested in private amusement
as in public service and whose itchy mind demands new adventures in
rapid succession. This is a man, in other words, almost
spectacularly ill suited to the stratagems, tedium and patience
required for sustained political glory.
 &HT;    ``Bill Weld is a guy who likes the bold stroke,'' says Ray
Howell, who worked on Weld's gubernatorial campaigns. ``He likes to
throw the Hail Mary pass. Grinding it out is not something that
appeals to him. Unfortunately, I think grinding it out is often the
successful route for elective politics.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    ``Mackerel by Moonlight'' introduces Terry Mullally, who is both
like and unlike Weld. While Weld grew up on 600 acres on Long
Island and followed his forebears' leather-soled footsteps to
Harvard, Mullally comes of age in Brooklyn and gets his degree from
a city university.
 &HT;    Like Weld, Mullally first makes his name tackling corruption as
a federal prosecutor and ends up in Boston. Unlike Weld, he is a
Democrat, and the elective office he seeks is district attorney.
 &HT;    As the novel tracks Mullally's meteoric rise and all the debris
that falls to earth along the way, it eventually becomes a whodunit
about two mysterious deaths. The title alludes to a pungent
put-down of a successful politician, and of politics itself. Like a
rotting mackerel in the moonlight, the saying goes, it shines and
it stinks.
 &HT;    Jaunty and clever, the book nonetheless seems the byproduct less
of Weld's literary talents than of his name recognition, a more
respectable relative of ``Embrace the Serpent,'' the bizarrely
titled and quizzically received international thriller co-written
by Marilyn Quayle, and ``Murder at City Hall,'' a mystery
co-written by Ed Koch that also left many critics scratching their
heads, if not holding their noses.
 &HT;    It underlines the way in which political celebrity seems to be a
flexible currency that puts Susan Molinari in the anchor chair of a
TV news program and Donna Shalala in milk advertisements.
 &HT;    But ``Mackerel by Moonlight'' is most interesting for what it
says about Weld himself. He began writing it in January 1997,
shortly after his failed Senate bid, when he was still governor
and, according to friends, beset less by disappointment than by
disinterest in the familiar tasks at hand.
 &HT;    His account of its genesis and rapid completion betrays not only
his quicksilver mind but also his elite cultural bearings,
intellectual vanity and ``look, Ma, no hands'' style.
 &HT;    He says the book was born one night as he sat in front of a
blazing fire in his three-story, seven-bedroom house in Cambridge,
reading a description of the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote ``The
Last Tycoon'' from an outline. ``I thought, Gosh, it must be easy
to write a book from an outline,'' Weld recalls. So he tried one.
``It took me 15 to 20 minutes.''
 &HT;    He then dictated the narrative onto tapes for his secretary to
transcribe, devoting one day every weekend to the task and
finishing the first draft in eight weeks. His muses, he says,
included Thomas Mann and Graham Greene. As he refined the novel
over subsequent drafts, he kept a careful record of each version,
``just in case some jaundiced observer should suggest there must
have been a ghostwriter somewhere.''
 &HT;    The result offers no life lessons and suggests no particular
conviction, a charge that Weld's political critics have often
levied against him. As the protagonist caroms through a weightless
adventure that clocks in under 250 pages, his emotions remain
inscrutable and his demeanor aloof, very much like his author's.
 &HT;    ``I still have nothing to say,'' Weld explains one afternoon in
his Boston office, referring to a remark he once made about being
intrigued by the idea of writing a novel, but not being able to
identify a message he wanted to get across. ``I'm the guy who hates
politicians who preach at you.''
 &HT;    The next day, the subject recurs as he, his wife, Susan
Roosevelt Weld, and one of his five children, Mary, sit on their
vast, well-shaded lawn.
 &HT;    Susan says she did not actually crack the book but had Mary read
it to her as they drove from Cambridge to New Haven, where Mary
attends Yale. The two-hour drive proved ample time.
 &HT;    ``It's a bagatelle,'' Weld confirms.
 &HT;    ``Large print,'' his wife chimes in.
 &HT;    ``Generous margins,'' Weld adds.
 &HT;    The exchange captures Weld's charm: his occasionally
self-effacing humor, his banter. But it also suggests the lack of
gravitas that made his political career so offbeat and unlikely,
and arguably curtailed it.
 &HT;    Mary Weld, enjoying tiny spoonfuls of brownie batter
interspersed with mincing sips from a quart of milk, weighs in with
her own appraisal. ``I'm glad it has no moral,'' she says. ``A
moral would be pompous.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Weld's tenure as governor from 1991 to 1997 was so successful
that observers often forget how improbably he squeaked into office,
and how much his personal wealth and fortunate circumstances
mattered.
 &HT;    Back in 1990, when he first ran, he was a leaden public speaker.
He had never held any elective office, and while his experience as
a high-ranking member of the U.S. Justice Department in the 1980s
gave him law-enforcement credentials, he was untested on other
issues. At their convention, state Republicans endorsed his rival
in the primary, Steven Pierce.
 &HT;    Howell remembers, ``I couldn't get reporters to come to a
campaign event if I promised that Bill Weld would be biting off the
heads of chickens.''
 &HT;    But Weld pumped about $1 million of his own money into his
primary campaign, handily outspending Pierce. And primary voters
gambled that Weld's liberal social views _ arising from his
distaste for bigotry or any other limit to individual expression
and potential _ gave him a better chance against the eventual
Democratic nominee than Pierce had.
 &HT;    Weld won the primary and then, in the general election,
capitalized on voters' exasperation with the state's economic woes
and their willingness to try a change from decades of Democratic
leadership. He narrowly defeated a weak opponent, John R. Silber.
 &HT;    This was not the triumph of a man with a potent sense of calling
or long history of political involvement. Although his years as a
classics major and law student at Harvard coincided with the
activism of the late 1960s, Weld was largely unmoved by it.
 &HT;    He approached the job of governing with a similar insouciance,
keeping bankers' hours and seldom missing his thrice-weekly
appointments on the squash court. Once, after signing a bill to
protect waterways, he dove, fully clothed, into the Charles River.
Visitors to his office spotted a stuffed armadillo near his desk.
``I like creatures who are slow and stupid,'' Weld explained.
 &HT;    For Massachusetts voters, Weld's levity and sublime confidence
was a welcome relief after Gov. Michael Dukakis' severe
prognostications. Moreover, he got the job done. Leading the
national charge to trim welfare programs and generally rein in
government spending, he reduced taxes while finding ample money for
education and the environment.
 &HT;    All the while, he had the cooperation of a Legislature still
controlled by Democrats. In 1994, he was re-elected with a
staggering 71 percent of the vote. But aides said he was bored and
had limited interest in serving out a second term.
 &HT;    So he set his sights on the Senate, then the ambassadorship,
which dovetailed with his curiosity about international affairs.
Aides advised him that if he were looking toward the presidency,
such a job change and gambit were madness. Weld ignored them.
 &HT;    ``He's not ambitious in the way most politicians are,'' explains
Marty Linsky, his chief secretary from 1992 to 1995. ``The stuff
that most politicians care about it not important to him. He wants
to have a good time. He wants to have fun. He wants to be engaged
all the time, but his definition of engagement is different from
most people's, like sitting at the end of a dock in the Adirondacks
reading Greek.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Welds seem to have their own obscure sources of amusement.
While others regarded the war of words between Weld and Helms last
summer as a stomach-churning embarrassment for the Republican
Party, the Welds pronounce it a grand diversion.
 &HT;    As Weld tells it, he ran into Helms months later and told the
senator that he wanted to buy him dinner, because Helms was the
reason he was working as a high-priced lawyer and could afford to.
When Helms responded that he usually ate at home, Weld turned to a
companion and exulted, ``Senator Helms has just invited me to his
house for dinner!''
 &HT;    Weld guffaws at the memory. ``Senator Helms was waving his arms,
'No, no, no,''' Weld says. So there was never a trip to Helms's
house, for dinner or anything else. ``No jammy party,'' Weld sighs.
 &HT;    Although he assumes that what he calls the ``apostasy'' of his
liberal social views helped fuel Helms' opposition to him, he
steadfastly refuses to bash either Helms or the religious right.
That would imply that they rattled him, and it's not at all clear
that that's possible.
 &HT;    Besides, Weld says that he's happy now _ that there's more
``intellectual content'' in his current legal work advising venture
capitalists and private equity firms than there was in his second
term as governor.
 &HT;    And he has already finished the first draft of a sequel to
``Mackerel by Moonlight.'' It took him seven days instead of eight.
 &HT;    Beyond that, he is maddeningly hazy about his future, quite
possibly because he is waiting to feel the next tickle of his
fancy. Friends say he once eyed the presidency and probably, at
some level, still does. When questioned directly, Weld gives
answers that seem deliberately opaque.
 &HT;    The year 2000, he says, is out, but if the Democrats win again
and there is no plausible Republican challenger with moderate
social views in 2004, ``it's not so clear I'll be free to cultivate
my own garden.''
 &HT;    But by forcing a confrontation with his own party for a
dubiously prominent position in a Democratic administration, he
came across as disloyal, to the point where a shot at the
presidency seems impossible, and a Republican president might be
disinclined to consider him for the kinds of Cabinet posts he once
discussed with President Clinton's advisers.
 &HT;    ``Politically,'' said Greg Mueller, a Republican political
consultant, ``he's in no man's land.''
 &HT;    Even if he weren't, it's doubtful that Weld could ever muster
the conventional sincerity for the ultimate political prize.
 &HT;    ``Bill Weld is the mirror opposite of Bill Clinton,'' says
Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant. ``Clinton tries to
become you. He's like some sci-fi creature who wraps around you and
sucks out your energy. Weld is a guy who knows who he is and is
very comfortable with himself. He doesn't take himself that
seriously.''
 &HT;    At the end of the game in Fenway, which the Boston Red Sox win,
Weld is briefly elated, then instantly intent on finding a route
over the Charles, and into Cambridge, that circumvents traffic. His
demeanor is rapt as he barks out directions _ left, right, faster,
slower _ that brilliantly do the trick. He's home in a flash.
 &HT;    It's not much of a journey, or much of an accomplishment, but it
seems to give him great pleasure. He walks off into the night with
a bounce in his step.

 By FRANK RICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``TV is good.''
 &HT;    A year ago, ABC, the most desperate of the frantic TV networks
formerly known as the Big Three, invited (and received) ridicule
when it began promoting its prime-time season with a high-concept
campaign defending, however ironically, the goodness of television.
 &HT;    ABC's ratings remain in the cellar, but the campaign is still
with us on the air and on bright yellow billboards _ with such
additional slogans as ``Without a TV, how would you know where to
put the sofa?'' ``If TV's so bad for you, why is there one in every
hospital room?'' and, of course, ``We love TV.''
 &HT;    Give ABC credit for summarizing in a few haikus the debate that
has raged, with much noise but no resolution, for the better part
of our century. We love TV, and yet we fear it is not good.
 &HT;    Now TV approaches the millennium on the verge of its biggest
upheaval since its invention. Our love affair with the medium is
poised to enter a new and tumultuous phase. The question of whether
TV is good _ or can be better _ may not only be more pressing than
before but may have to be entirely recalibrated. The very
definition of that appliance we call the box is changing.
 &HT;    That we love TV is not in question, no matter how routinely we
deplore it in public, clamoring for V-chips, a rating system and
the head of Jerry Springer. (Love of television may truly be the
last love in America that dare not speak its name.)
 &HT;    Television is the medium from which most of us receive our news,
sports, entertainment, cues for civic discourse and, most of all,
our marching orders as consumers. TV is what brings us together to
share real-life tragedy (Oklahoma City), marathon titillation
(Monica) and grief (Diana or Mother Teresa, according to your
conscience).
 &HT;    The revocation of TV-watching privileges is widely considered,
after the electric chair, the most severe punishment that can be
inflicted on the nation's prison population _ or on any adolescent
in a middle-class home.
 &HT;    TV is also, perhaps, our one steady, loyal, reliable companion;
many Americans keep it flickering even when they're not watching.
(Surveys show that as many as a fifth of American sets play to
empty rooms.) Long before the nation's children can identify
specific programs _ or the products those programs want to sell
them _ they know TV as that other presence in the home, a baby
sitter beaming light and warm sound, making the world a little less
lonely and forbidding when parents are away.
 &HT;    For the elderly and the isolated and insomniacs, TV serves much
the same purpose. The box is a hearth with a laugh track - ``the
cool fire,'' as the TV producer Bob Shanks once dubbed it.
 &HT;    Though there's someone in every crowd who brags about not
watching television, it's not clear just how large this population
of TV resisters really is. Surely the most shocking revelation in
Joyce Maynard's new tell-all memoir about her affair with J.D.
Salinger is of the great man's infatuation with the '60s sitcom
``The Andy Griffith Show.'' Couldn't he have had the taste to pick
``Hallmark Hall of Fame'' over the likes of Gomer Pyle?
 &HT;    But he opted for schlock, and in this he is like so many of us.
If most of TV has never been ``Kraft Television Theater''
(initially created to introduce the product Cheez Whiz) or
``Masterpiece Theater'' (which helped burnish the image of Mobil
Oil on allegedly commercial-free public television), it may be
because we love its badness as much as its goodness and always
have.
 &HT;    It was Jim Aubrey, the CBS president during the era of ``Andy
Griffith'' and ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' who succinctly
characterized the sure-fire TV formula as ``bosoms, broads and
fun'' _ and this was when CBS still at least nominally aspired to
be the Tiffany network.
 &HT;    Even in the earliest history of the networks, the patently
clownish wrestling of Gorgeous George _ a Dennis Rodman eons before
Dennis Rodman was cool _ proved a far bigger draw than recitals by
singers from the Met. (And nothing has changed today if you compare
the booming cable audiences for wrestling vs., say, those for
Bravo.)
 &HT;    In 1953, setting another audience pattern that still persists,
the number of viewers who watched the stork (and in those days, it
was the stork) deliver Little Ricky to Lucy and Ricky was more than
50 percent larger than the higher-minded crowd that tuned in to
watch Ike's inauguration as president the next day.
 &HT;    That same year brought the first _ but hardly the last _
congressional hearings on the presumed link between TV and
violence. By then, Variety had long since taken to calling TV ``the
monster,'' such was the speed and avidity with which it devoured
and sometimes extinguished other forms of show business.
 &HT;    The trade paper had also by that point coined the term ``video
widows'' to describe the wives of TV-sports fanatics, and it
chronicled how ``parents became frantic over the problem of how to
tear Junior from the tele set, in time to get him to do his
homework or go to bed.''
 &HT;    It could be argued that the basic equation of TV entertainment
remains unchanged since those heady days of its emergence as a mass
medium. The improvised early-'50s potpourri of sitcoms, game shows,
dramas, movies, ball games, kiddie TV (with must-have merchandise
tie-ins) and hit-parade-plugging music-and-dance videos remains
intact.
 &HT;    There were rigged shows in the golden age (``Twenty-One'') and
now (``Jerry Springer''); there were occasionally outstanding
dramas then (``Playhouse 90'') and now (``E.R.''); there was sly
product placement then (Westinghouse appliances in Ozzie and
Harriet's kitchen) and now (Nike logos in CBS's Winter Olympics
coverage).
 &HT;    ``Meet the Press'' was caught in a libel crossfire involving the
smearing of a federal official as far back as 1950; NBC's ``Today''
and ``Tonight'' shows, with their inviolate formulas, date back
nearly as far. Throughout TV history, making money always came
ahead of art, let alone public service. Weather and crime always
trumped the rest of the news.
 &HT;    While these fixed points on the TV spectrum may never change,
they are rapidly being joined by others and could soon be scrambled
beyond recognition. We are at long last entering the
post-CBS-ABC-NBC television universe. This summer The Wall Street
Journal described the network-TV business as being in ``its worst
slump in 50 years.''
 &HT;    In June, for the first time, more people watched basic cable
channels during prime time than they did the four networks
combined. This doesn't mean that the media giants owning the
networks are suffering at the bottom line _ a young male viewer who
deserts ABC for ESPN is still a customer of Disney, which owns
both.
 &HT;    But the result is a TV audience so fractionalized that even the
most publicized, buzz-creating hit like ``Ally McBeal'' is only
watched regularly by barely 10 percent of the country's 100 million
or so TV households. Early research suggests that the networks,
with their increasingly narrow focus on the prized 18- to
49-year-old age group, are losing not just other demographics to
cable channels but are finally starting to lose some of these
viewers to the Internet as well.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the technological revolution that will merge old
electronic media with the new is reaching warp speed. After all the
loose talk of a still-unattained 500-channel cable box, the
convergence of television, computer and phone technologies into one
new TV box is really on its way _ in 3 to 10 years, depending on
whom you talk to and where you live.
 &HT;    When that happens, the TV viewer who once might have been
watching ``Seinfeld'' while flipping through a magazine and talking
on a phone may be just flipping among more channels. Or, in an
alternative scenario, he may be using the video compartments of a
single screen to watch the umpteenth ``Seinfeld'' rerun while
browsing the Web pages of a magazine or participating in an
electronic chat room or dispatching E-mail.
 &HT;    The implications of this new, splintered TV era are already
partly evident. Instead of relying on the Big Daddy of a network
for its diet of news, entertainment and sports, the audience is
seeking out whatever niche programming it wants, whether it be
all-news or all-financial-news cable (perhaps augmented by the same
brand's Web site) or all-sports cable (and its Web site) or the
cable channel (basic or premium) that offers a specific kind of
movie or children's TV diet or music or religion or sexual kick or
(who knows?) high culture.
 &HT;    The basic forms of programming may be unchanged since the '50s
but instead of three purveyors dictating the menu items and their
scheduling, you can have any flavor you want as often as you want
in helpings as large as you want _ and, with the aid of a VCR and
staggered repeat programming, on almost any schedule you choose.
 &HT;    For a country that seems less cohesive culturally and even
linguistically than ever, this dilution of the one common bond we
did share, the Nielsen prime-time Top 10, would seem to be yet
another route to Balkanization.
 &HT;    When ``Seinfeld'' ended this year, pundits noted that even it,
the signature TV smash hit of the decade, was hardly a common
experience among TV watchers: Its ratings would have placed it at
the bottom of the Top 20 as recently as the '70s. At a time when
most Americans don't bother to vote and only pluralities elect
presidents, we now seem to be incapable of reaching a consensus
over a faux paterfamilias as well.
 &HT;    We can no longer unite behind a Robert Young or a Bill Cosby any
more than we can behind a Bush or a Clinton.
 &HT;    Jeff Bewkes, the CEO of HBO, the pay cable service that has
offered its subscribers everything from high-end entertainment in
the network-sitcom format (``The Larry Sanders Show'') to scruffy
low-budget documentaries that PBS would never touch (``Real Sex''),
argues the contrary _ that the fractionalization of the audience is
potentially a democratization.
 &HT;    Disdaining nostalgia for the homogenous ``unity'' enforced by
the three networks in the ``Father Knows Best'' `50s, he asks
rhetorically, ``Is it important for the nation that we share a pop
culture that was created for commercial purposes?''
 &HT;    He points out that with the end of the dominance of the networks
and a few major production companies, the variety of TV
programming, and not just its quantity, will increase.
 &HT;    In this brave new world, a TV show no longer has to carry the
huge overhead, please the huge audience and sell the mass
Tide-and-Coke products of a broadcast network _ with all the
dumbed-down conformity that requires _ but it can be made for
peanuts, be profitable and still have nationwide reach on a
low-overhead cable channel.
 &HT;    The cost of entry for would-be TV artists and entrepreneurs
alike has been dropping as fast as the cost of manufacturing a
microchip. Let a thousand independent filmmakers _ or cutting-edge
comics or specialized news channels _ bloom.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that a greater number of entrants into the
TV race means a greater percentage of quality programs. History,
not to mention the law of human averages, tells us that mediocrity
will continue to rule. Nor is the independence of television's many
new grass-roots contenders ensured.
 &HT;    If a few of our large media conglomerates end up owning
virtually all the new channels, as they already threaten to do,
will they effectively function as gatekeepers just as the old
networks did? Will they neuter every show, whether out of political
caution or a desire to pander to advertisers or to the lowest
common audience denominator? Will they keep risky, alternative
visions off the air on dozens of channels as they once did on only
three?
 &HT;    If so, the illusion of countless choices will be simply that, an
illusion _ the same old same old, resliced and diced. Television
will remain more often than not what the writer Larry Gelbart has
called a ``weapon of mass distraction.''
 &HT;    What we must hope is that the optimistic Bewkes view is right. A
true diversity of American voices on TV could actually enhance the
medium's role in unifying an infinitely various population whose
many different constituencies, whether separated by geography or
race or class or ethnicity, are too often ignorant of too many
others. Though TV has sometimes fulfilled its potential of helping
to introduce Americans to one another, much of the record is
shameful.
 &HT;    As Jeff Kisseloff documents in his essential oral history, ``The
Box,'' the networks were slow to portray blacks as anything other
than domestics through and past the heyday of Jim Crow; a
frightened sponsor even derailed the star writer Rod Serling's
effort to dramatize the true story of the lynching of the black
teen-ager Emmett Till after protests by the racist White Citizens'
Council.
 &HT;    Other ethnic groups, from Jews to Italian-Americans to Latinos,
were also slow to be acknowledged on network TV except as
stereotypes, and their history was either ignored or bowdlerized.
In 1959, the American Gas Association successfully pressured CBS to
delete the word ``gas'' from descriptions of the Holocaust in
``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
 &HT;    The record has improved since, but always tardily. (``Roots''
would have contributed much more to racial progress if it had been
broadcast in 1967, not '77.) If some minorities (notably gay men
and lesbians) have broken through the vanilla status quo of network
TV of late _ if only temporarily, now that a backlash has set in _
many others, starting with the country's newest immigrants, remain
invisible there.
 &HT;    If this is to change in a multichannel TV world, new and
culturally disenfranchised Americans would have to be given a real
shot at creating nationally distributed programming _ rather than
being ghettoized (as is often the case now) in community
public-access TV.
 &HT;    Should such overdue variety in the total TV mix arrive, it would
not prevent the entire country from coming together as one around
the TV as it always has when the event _ whether an assassination
or a Bronco chase or a Mark McGwire home run or a Persian Gulf War
or a presidential resignation _ warrants that we all be there
together in the immediacy and communality that only TV can provide.
 &HT;    But even if such a democratic new TV universe does emerge, would
it guarantee that after all these years of being a guilty pleasure,
TV might finally become _ of all things _ good? Don't bank on it.
Such is the unchanging history of American television to date that
it's possible that every group, no matter how free to create its
own programming, will simply do its own retreads of game shows,
soap operas and sitcoms _ a transgender ``Jeopardy'' perhaps, or an
Asian-American ``Baywatch'' _ so intractably ingrained are the
perennially popular formulas that have ruled for half a century.
 &HT;    Should that be the future of the medium, TV will be no more or
less good than it ever was, just more plentiful. Either way, at
least one prediction can be made with absolute certainty.
Americans, no matter how much they may complain, will never
exercise the one power they have, and have always had, over
television _ the inalienable right to turn it off.

 By BILL CARTER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Christmas Eve in Aspen, Colo., Don Ohlmeyer got a telephone
call that realigned all the planets in his professional world. The
head of NBC's entertainment division, in Burbank, Calif., Ohlmeyer
had presided over one of the great runs in television history.
 &HT;    For five straight years, NBC had swallowed up virtually all the
profit to be made in the network television business. For that
year, the count for NBC's network side of the business alone
approached $500 million.
 &HT;    At the center of that success was Thursday night, ``Must-See
TV.'' From a low point in 1993, NBC under Ohlmeyer and Warren
Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, had rebuilt
Thursday into a murderer's row of ``Friends,'' ``Seinfeld'' and
``E.R.''
 &HT;    In the weeks before to the holidays, Ohlmeyer, a linebacker-size
man with a leadership style to match, had taken steps to address
one potential falling-rock zone: the status of ``E.R.,'' the
top-rated show in television.
 &HT;    NBC was coming to the end of a standard four-year deal with
Warner Brothers for the show. In that time NBC, which was paying
only about $2 million an episode, had made, by one NBC executive's
reckoning, ``pots of money'' on ``E.R.'' Now Ohlmeyer knew Warner
Brothers would be looking to be cut in.
 &HT;    Ohlmeyer had not missed how CBS and ABC had put out the word
that they would be willing to pay almost anything to take ``E.R.''
off NBC's hands. And he was aware that ABC's corporate parent, the
Walt Disney Co., might develop a special incentive to come after
``E.R.''
 &HT;    NBC had a scheme to steal ``Monday Night Football'' from ABC in
the upcoming NFL negotiations, and Ohlmeyer did not want ``E.R.''
available to Disney's Michael Eisner, who would surely have fire in
his eye and a lot of unspent football money on his hands.
 &HT;    NBC's exclusive negotiating period with Warner Brothers was to
begin in February. But in mid-December Ohlmeyer called Bob Daly,
co-chairman of Warner Brothers, and asked if he would mind starting
the ``E.R.'' negotiation sooner, right after the holidays.
 &HT;    Daly agreed, and he also consented to keep the talks completely
private _ only three or four Warner executives would know the
``E.R.'' negotiation had begun. Nobody involved with the show would
be clued in, not even any of the executive producers: John Wells,
Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg.
 &HT;    Despite figures already in the press that CBS or ABC would be
willing to pay as much as $10 million an episode for the 22-episode
future seasons of ''E.R.,'' Ohlmeyer was confident he could get a
reasonable negotiation going with Bob Daly.
 &HT;    Surely Daly didn't seriously want to move ``E.R.'' off NBC's
Thursday night _ that would be like looking to relocate from
Shangri-La. For the right price _ a fair price _ Ohlmeyer concluded
that NBC would be able to keep ``E.R.''
 &HT;    All of this was neatly in place by the time Ohlmeyer arrived in
Aspen. Then the phone rang. Jerry Seinfeld was calling.
 &HT;    The message was short, but not exactly sweet. Jerry had decided
to shut down production on ``Seinfeld'' at the end of the season.
Ohlmeyer thanked Jerry for all the success he had brought NBC. Then
he hung up the phone and thought: Merry Christmas. So much for a
reasonable negotiation for ``E.R.'' The biggest deal in television
history was about to go down _ and NBC was going to get skewered.
 &HT;    Despite the A-plus show-business pedigree of Steven Spielberg
and Michael Crichton, ``E.R.'' did not glide onto network
television. Everyone who read Crichton's original script realized
it was, as it's known in the trade, a ``trunk job'' _ a script an
established writer digs out of his trunk when he's a hot commodity.
 &HT;    This was all too apparent from a scene in which the doctors,
working at a hospital in Boston (the setting was later moved to
Chicago to avoid comparisons to ``St. Elsewhere''), take a break to
listen to a game between the Celtics and the Knicks _ and Bill
Bradley is taking a shot. Nevertheless, Warren Littlefield didn't
see how NBC could go wrong by ordering a two-hour movie from the
makers of ``Jurassic Park.''
 &HT;    That offer did not thrill Leslie Moonves, who was in charge of
television for Warner Brothers, one of the studios that produces
shows for different networks. (He was later to become Ohlmeyer's
friendly rival as head of CBS Entertainment.) Moonves was upset
because NBC had reneged on a guarantee for an additional six
episodes of ``E.R.''
 &HT;    When the pilot was delivered, Moonves was ecstatic; NBC,
however, was still lukewarm. At one point the network considered
moving its drama ``Homicide'' to Thursday, relegating ``E.R.'' to
Fridays. Moonves countered with research showing how strong
``E.R.'' would play with women. NBC finally offered up Thursday at
10, the spot that for more than a decade had been occupied by
television's best drama, first ``Hill Street Blues,'' then ``L.A.
Law.''
 &HT;    At Warner Brothers, the 1994-95 season was an endless party.
``E.R.'' had stormed to the top of the ratings, and its new comedy,
``Friends,'' was generating almost as much heat. Sensing a big
opportunity, Barry Meyer, the chief operating officer, decided to
take ``Friends'' into the syndication market _ where repeats of
shows are sold to TV stations for prices that often reach hundreds
of millions _ after Year 1, earlier than any previous show. He
suggested to Daly that they press NBC to extend the four-year deal
for ``Friends'' right away to guarantee that it would pass the
100-episode mark, crucial to syndication sales.
 &HT;    Meyer offered NBC two proposals: one, to increase the licensing
fee on ``Friends'' in exchange for an extension through Year 6; and
two, a similar deal for ``E.R.''
 &HT;    ``E.R.'' was being produced at a deficit, about $400,000 an
episode. Meyer's strategy: Pay us enough to cover our production
costs right away, increase our licensing fees in the later years of
the deal and we'll extend NBC's exclusive rights to ``E.R.''
through a sixth year. Of the two proposals, Warner Brothers was far
more eager to close on ``Friends,'' because of the pressure to make
a syndicated deal fast. NBC made a similar calculation.
 &HT;    The network knew that comedies held up far better than dramas.
Even though ``E.R.'' looked like a one-of-a-kind, maybe even
last-of-its-kind, breakout hit, there was some reason to question
whether the series would be roaring along when it reached the end
of its four-year deal.
 &HT;    When Meyer heard back, the message was mixed. NBC agreed to the
``Friends'' deal, paying an average of about $2 million an episode
through a sixth year. But the network was going to pass on a new
deal for ``E.R.''
 &HT;    The following year, Meyer decided to start monitoring how much
money NBC was making on ``E.R.'' Warner Brothers realized that the
true value of ``E.R.'' included the ancillary revenues NBC was
accruing: the huge boost to NBC's local newscasts after ``E.R.'';
the growing strength of the ``Tonight'' show, which began with a
surge on Thursday night; the way NBC packaged its sales so
advertisers had to buy lesser shows to get a position in ``E.R.''
 &HT;    In both Year 2 and Year 3 of the series, Meyer made informal
overtures to assess NBC's level of interest, but nothing stirred
any movement toward a new deal. By 1996, the overtures stopped.
Daly was openly angry with NBC for what he felt was shoddy
treatment of a Warner Brothers comedy called ``Hope and Gloria,''
which NBC had put on in the spring of 1995.
 &HT;    It had started off well, then NBC moved it around the schedule.
Daly believed NBC was damaging a studio asset. Daly asked
Littlefield to give the show back so the studio could sell it to
another network. Littlefield declined, saying NBC still loved the
show. Daly was angry enough that he blasted NBC to a few of his
friends in Hollywood; he told them NBC was going to lose ``E.R.''
 &HT;    The word, as Daly knew it would, quickly circulated. Moonves,
now at CBS, was all over Daly, pushing the network's interest. Both
Michael Eisner, the Disney chief, and his top executive at ABC, Bob
Iger, urged Daly not to assume ABC would not be a player if
``E.R.'' went on the open market. Still, both Iger and Moonves
concluded NBC could not risk losing the show.
 &HT;    When the formal negotiation for ``E.R.'' began in early January
of this year, Daly had three ground rules: First, he wanted a
three-year deal _ a surprise, since it had been widely expected
that Warner Brothers would ask for only two; second, that the show
stay on Thursday night at 10 _ that would prevent NBC from moving
the show to 9 to replace ``Seinfeld''; third, without mentioning
specific dollars, he wanted the highest possible licensing fee NBC
could put on the table.
 &HT;    The deal would have no other encumbrances, nothing like
commitments for other series on NBC. Daly wanted to assure the
show's partners _ notably Crichton, Spielberg and Wells _ that the
studio would get nothing they did not have a share in. ``I want a
very simple, clean deal,'' Daly told Meyer. The process went
quickly.
 &HT;    At the next meeting NBC accepted the three-year stipulation and
the guarantee of Thursday at 10. It made a financial offer that
Warner countered at a subsequent meeting. After just one more
meeting, the price was set. NBC would pay Warner Brothers $13
million an episode for ``E.R.'' _ $286 million a year, or more than
twice what NBC had totaled in profits the previous year.
 &HT;    For Ohlmeyer, it came down to the stars: After the ``Seinfeld''
news, the stars aligned against NBC. With another year of
``Seinfeld'' or a deal for ``Monday Night Football,'' NBC might
have been able to tell Daly it would pass on ``E.R.'' Without
either, Ohlmeyer knew Daly was going to get what he wanted.
 &HT;    Going in to a new advertising season, the network needed
``E.R.'' to guarantee premium prices for its shows. To protect its
``Must-See'' Thursday-night lineup, NBC moved its
multiple-Emmy-Award-winning comedy ''Frasier'' from Tuesday to the
spot ``Seinfeld'' vacated.
 &HT;    Ohlmeyer wanted to emerge from the so-called up-front season in
June _ when advertisers commit up to 80 percent of their budgets to
the new network prime-time schedules _ able to say NBC had
increased its take, even after losing ''Seinfeld.'' When Ohlmeyer
brought in $2.15 billion, he had achieved that goal.
 &HT;    But the ``E.R.'' bill had not yet arrived. One television
producer of many hit shows called the deal ``the
half-a-billion-dollar blunder.'' His math: For Years 5 and 6, NBC
might have paid only $3 million an episode. Now it must pay $10
million more an episode.
 &HT;    At 22 episodes a year, that is a $440 million surcharge over two
years. Even if Warner Brothers got a big price boost for Year 7, it
surely would not have been $13 million. That's how the extra hit on
NBC can reach $500 million over three years. NBC executives dispute
those figures, noting that the ``Friends'' deal, which seemed
extravagant at the time, now looks like a bargain that might help
offset the cost of ``E.R.''
 &HT;    But $286 million a year takes a lot of offsetting. NBC has
already instituted a company-wide austerity program. Everyone has
been told to cut costs, even at highly successful shows such as
``Today'' and ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''
 &HT;    One unhappy NBC executive in New York says: ``We can't have
bottled water anymore. It makes you sick to think of all the money
that's being spent on 'E.R.'''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, over at Warners, Anthony Edwards, who plays Dr. Mark
Greene, has signed a new contract, upping his salary to more than
$350,000 an episode. Noah Wyle (Dr. John Carter) did almost as well
at $275,000.
 &HT;    Clearly, the deal will have an impact on the television business
like no other. One network executive (not at NBC) said that no
network would ever again go down to the wire in working out a
renewal for the No. 1 show. But some at NBC argued it is just as
likely that studios with clout like Warners will try to put off any
extension, looking for a similar payoff.
 &HT;    The one sure way for networks to avoid this squeeze, and the
outcome from the ``E.R.'' deal everyone in the business expects, is
more ownership of shows by the networks. Already this fall,
networks own a higher percentage of the new programs on the air
than ever before.
 &HT;    NBC's executives came away from the deal feeling they stepped up
and paid the price _ because they had to. But they do worry about
one thing. What happens to ``E.R.'' between now and the end of the
$858 million deal? The show created a magic connection with viewers
that network television seldom saw before _ and hasn't seen since.
 &HT;    Now comes the scary part: How long can it keep the magic going?

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,100 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Slices of afternoon sun cut through the blinds of a darkened
second-floor room in the Hollywood Athletic Club as Joni Mitchell,
cigarette hanging limply from her thick lips, bends over a pool
table and meticulously lines up a shot to sink the solid yellow
ball.
 &HT;    ``You're stripes,'' one of her pool partners yells.
 &HT;    ``Oh,'' she exclaims and switches angles. She is distracted.
There is too much going on. Present in the room are a mixture of
friends and family members. Her friends are all men, mostly
younger, outdoor, athletic types.
 &HT;    Her family members, by contrast, are more cerebral and artistic.
Her daughter, Kilauren Gibb, whom she met for the first time a year
and a half ago after giving her up for adoption in 1965, is a model
(as her mother once was) whose real wish was always to be on the
other side of the camera (like her biological father, a Toronto
photographer).
 &HT;    Now she takes pictures of her 5-year-old son, Marlon, who seems
like a model and actor in the making.
 &HT;    ``Pretend like you're excited,'' Paul Starr, Mitchell's close
friend and makeup artist, tells the blond tyke as he widens his
mouth and eyes adorably. Paul mimes snapping a photo.
 &HT;    ``Now pretend like Joni's going away,'' he says. Marlon pauses
for a moment, and then pulls a forlorn, drooping face. A faux photo
is snapped again.
 &HT;    ``That was hard,'' Marlon says. ``I couldn't imagine why Joni
would be going away.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, at 54, Mitchell has settled down. In the last two
years, she has become a mother and grandmother simultaneously.
Seeing the family together, one would never know that she, her
daughter and grandson had ever been apart. Some musicians feel that
they must sacrifice the joy of raising a family because of their
commitment to their work.
 &HT;    Mitchell always seemed like this type of artist, but now she
seems to be relishing her new role. For someone whose art and life
have always been intertwined, this development is bound to have
implications for her music.
 &HT;    ``The coming of the kids hasn't come out in my art yet,'' she
says, referring to her latest projects _ a new album, ``Taming the
Tiger,'' a television special and a book of poetry.
 &HT;    But she has recorded music with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter
and ``they're convinced,'' she said, ``they can hear my family in
my tone. It has a more full-bodied femininity.''
 &HT;    That's just the beginning of the new, complete, ever-changing
Joni, one of the most influential and immodest songwriters of the
last 30 years. Since inheriting her new family, Mitchell has
suddenly become acquainted with pop culture. She watches ``Taxi''
reruns, reads kids' books to her grandson, spends more time
shooting pool and hanging out with her family and has rediscovered
Disney movies.
 &HT;    ``I used to be monastic, almost,'' she explains with a touch of
wistfulness. ``Now I'm like a Tibetan that has discovered
hamburgers and television. I'm catching up on Americana.''
 &HT;    Disney, in many ways, is responsible for Mitchell's career.
Watching Bambi as a child in Saskatchewan, she says, made an artist
out of her, inspiring her to pick up crayons and draw forest fires,
which led to art school, which led to an unwanted pregnancy (with
Kilauren) that forced her to drop out and take up music in Canada's
folk clubs.
 &HT;    Between pool shots, Mitchell, wearing a loose-knit sweater and
jeans, speaks words that fans of more complex albums such as
``Hejira'' and ``Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'' thought they'd
never hear: ``I don't like to make fluffy little songs but now I
want to make some light songs,'' she says. ``I think that comes
from watching a lot of comedy. People will probably not enjoy it as
much as the deep suffering that I've done in the past. And I don't
even know if I can do it.''
 &HT;    When it comes to her music, Mitchell can be humorless. People
describe her as ``bitter'' and a ``loose cannon,'' and those are
her friends.
 &HT;    Over the course of three days of conversations, Mitchell will
compare herself to Mozart, Blake and Picasso; she will say that the
lyrics to one of her songs ``have a lot of symbolic depth, like the
Bible'' and describe her music as so new it needs its own genre
name.
 &HT;    In discussing her autobiography in the works, she will explain
that there is no way to fit her life into one volume. She needs to
do it in four. (She already knows the first line: ``I was the only
black man at the party''; colleagues say she sometimes feels ``like
a black man in a white woman's body.'')
 &HT;    Mitchell is not a forgetful woman. Like Santa Claus, she
remembers who's been naughty and who's been nice. Speaking of a New
York Times profile written in 1996, she recalls that there were
``seven errors of observation in the piece.'' On the nice side, she
let Janet Jackson sample her song ``Big Yellow Taxi'' for the hook
of ``Got 'Til It's Gone'' because Jackson had once spoken favorably
of Mitchell's album ``Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm.''
 &HT;    And she distinctly remembers being excited by seeing the chins
of four people of different ages quiver during her performance of
``Summertime'' this summer on the original Woodstock site.
 &HT;    ``You think I got a trap mind or something?'' Mitchell asks when
I make the Santa Claus comparison. ``I guess I do.''
 &HT;    Howie Klein, the president of Reprise, her recording label, says
it can be a challenge working for Mitchell. ``She distinctly feels
her music belongs on black radio,'' he says. ``Sometimes I get the
feeling that she thinks I'm keeping it off black radio. We may not
see eye to eye on every detail, but I have so much respect for her
that I'm willing to subsume my own way of thinking to hers.''
 &HT;    Yet even as she lives up to the stereotype of the difficult
artist, Mitchell is ``a good-time Charlie,'' as she puts it, in her
private life. This is evident in her friends' comments about her as
well as in the good-natured way she loses her pool games.
 &HT;    Though Mitchell's most-loved work is her most melancholy
(particularly her introspective ``Blue'' album), her music, and
particularly her newest album, is also filled with joy. ``I'm not a
pitiable creature,'' she says. ``It's just that I suffer very
eloquently.''
 &HT;    Not only is Mitchell an influence on female songwriters from
Jewel to Madonna to Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, she is also
an influence on male songwriters from the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince to Elvis Costello to Beck, who all sing her praises.
 &HT;    Yet, despite such recognition, Mitchell is remarkably
discontent. Even the mention of a positive article merits the
response, ``It broke my heart to read it.''
 &HT;    Her ego is a complex thing. In her mind, she feels that she's
one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Yet in her heart,
she must have doubts or she wouldn't need the affirmation. Much of
it stems from a frustration that even as she has done better work,
she still can't eclipse the popularity of her earliest music.
 &HT;    At lunch at the Daily Grill in Brentwood, her home away from
home, we talk about the trappings of the popular-music game over
smelly tuna fish sandwiches.
 &HT;    For years, she rightly complained of a lack of recognition and
appreciation compared with that of the male musicians of her era.
But in the past four years, she has won a Grammy Award for Best Pop
Album, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and been
honored with a Century Award from Billboard magazine. Still, she
categorizes many of her awards as ``dubious.''
 &HT;    ``It's like that line of Dylan's: 'You know something is
happening here but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?'
That's what most of my honors felt like,'' she explains. ``They
knew they had to do it but they ... weren't quite sure what to
illuminate in the work.''
 &HT;    It antagonizes her no end that the songs that have made her
famous _ most notably ``Big Yellow Taxi'' _ are her least complex
and innovative ones. After all, Paul Simon was praised for bringing
together world music and pop in ``Graceland,'' and Sting bragged of
doing the same for jazz in ``The Dream of the Blue Turtles.''
Mitchell beat them all to the punch with albums such as ``The
Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' ``Hejira,'' ``Don Juan's Reckless
Daughter'' and the live album ``Shadows and Light'' by making music
in whatever style and tuning best suited her songs.
 &HT;    ``'Big Yellow Taxi' is nice,'' she says. ``It's like Chuck Berry
kind of skipping rope. It's a good little workhorse of a song and
it's got some content. But it's a nursery rhyme. Of all the
creations that are there, if you reduce it to this thing, it's a
tragedy.
 &HT;    ``Picasso was restless,'' she adds, her face half-shaded by a
straw sun hat. ``I mean, he just kept changing and changing and
changing.'' She mentions Miles Davis as well. ``So those are my
heroes. The ones that change a lot.''
 &HT;    Mitchell has always defined herself as being not who others have
expected her to be. She came down with polio when she was 9. Five
years later, having beaten the odds and recovered, she wasn't just
walking, she was dancing.
 &HT;    In her paintings, she has purposely made it part of her style to
break the rules that she was taught at the Alberta College of Art
(focusing on the same kind of stylistic combinations that can make
her records seem difficult). When she dropped out of art school and
committed to the folk circuit, where she traveled from Toronto to
Detroit to New York City, she denied that she was ever a folk
singer.
 &HT;    ``I came into the game looking like a folk singer but I was
really playing classical art songs,'' she explained as she checked
her watch to make sure she wasn't late to meet a friend.
 &HT;    ``Those weren't like the chords that folkies played. But I
looked like a folk singer, like the girl with the guitar. And at
that point I had already been a lover of classical music in my
pre-teens, a rock-and-roll dancer in high school, and I had
discovered jazz. So folk music was easy and I needed money for art
school just be cause we were all on students' wages. It wasn't
until I was 21 and the desire to compose and create came back ...
that I got caught between being pigeonholed by critics and laboring
for the sake of commercial exploitation.''
 &HT;    Mitchell traces her feeling of being misunderstood back to the
first music she made, at age 7. ``I had music killed by my piano
teacher,'' she says. ``She rapped my knuckles with a ruler, which
was the way they taught everybody in that era anyway, and said,
'Why would you want to play by ear' _ that's what they called
composing _ 'when you could have the masters under your fingertips,
when you could copy.' So you go to art school and innovation is
everything, but in music, you're just a weird loner. So I have more
of a painter's ego or approach, which is to make fresh,
individuated stuff that has my blood in it and on the tracks.''
 &HT;    Given all her anxiety about her career, it's perhaps
understandable that the musician's life is not one she professes to
relish. She regards touring as a violation of her muse and says
record labels treat musicians like dumb prizefighters built to earn
them purse money.
 &HT;    Speaking of her new album, she says, ``I'm already out of what
this record is about.'' She pauses and lights her fifth or 11th
cigarette and exhales. ``I'm involved with family and the
socializing process, which is something very exciting and very
different.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The night after we wrap up our interviews, I run into Mitchell
at Dominick's, a new Los Angeles restaurant so trendy that it fills
up every night despite its awful food. Mitchell is sitting in the
middle of a table surrounded by her daughter, grandson and friends,
celebrating her friend Paul Starr's birthday.
 &HT;    When I see her, she loops her arm around my elbow like an Auntie
Mame and spirits me into the foyer.
 &HT;    As we walk, we talk about astrology. According to a book she has
been reading, her daughter was born on the day of the explorer and
she was born on the day of the discoverer. ``She's a natural
follower, I'm a natural leader,'' she says. ``I can't help it, the
stars put me there.''
 &HT;    Mitchell says that their birth dates interact in a way best
suited to siblings and that, in fact, they have a sisterly
relationship. Not by design, they have the same handbags and shoes,
wear similar clothes and share what she describes as a ``crazy
bravado that comes from the Irish blood.''
 &HT;    Throughout her career, Mitchell dropped hints in her songs for
her only child to find. Although Gibb knew the biography of her
birth mother _ that she was a Canadian folk singer _ she never
dreamed that she was Mitchell's child. Then, in 1996, The New York
Times described Mitchell's search for her daughter. A friend of
Gibb's, who saw the story, joked that Mitchell could be Gibb's
birth mother. Gibb had only recently been told that she was
adopted, and she already had a son. She decided to investigate.
Eventually, she and Mitchell were united.
 &HT;    As for the adoptive parents, Mitchell says: ``We worked through
all of that. I'm totally grateful to them, and Kilauren hasn't
forgotten about them.''
 &HT;    At Dominick's, we sit down and she goes back to our previous
interviews and tries to clarify comments she made. Clearly, she has
tried to pinpoint where her natural frankness and expansiveness may
have got her into trouble.
 &HT;    There is a lyric on her new album that complains, ``I'm up to my
neck in alligator jaws gnashing at me.'' She is trying to figure
out if I am an alligator too. Her fears, however, seem dated. The
alligators are gnashing less and less, and at the dinner table
around the corner, she has found something to protect her from
them.
 &HT;    ``I used to be too much of an illuminated scribe locked in my
attic with a responsibility to my gifts,'' she says, laughing for
once at herself. She stubs out a cigarette. Now, she says: ``I long
to live in a Chekhov play with relatives and aunties and the long
white tables with green bottles on them, under the apple tree.
That's really where I should be.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,100 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Slices of afternoon sun cut through the blinds of a darkened
second-floor room in the Hollywood Athletic Club as Joni Mitchell,
cigarette hanging limply from her thick lips, bends over a pool
table and meticulously lines up a shot to sink the solid yellow
ball.
 &HT;    ``You're stripes,'' one of her pool partners yells.
 &HT;    ``Oh,'' she exclaims and switches angles. She is distracted.
There is too much going on. Present in the room are a mixture of
friends and family members. Her friends are all men, mostly
younger, outdoor, athletic types.
 &HT;    Her family members, by contrast, are more cerebral and artistic.
Her daughter, Kilauren Gibb, whom she met for the first time a year
and a half ago after giving her up for adoption in 1965, is a model
(as her mother once was) whose real wish was always to be on the
other side of the camera (like her biological father, a Toronto
photographer).
 &HT;    Now she takes pictures of her 5-year-old son, Marlon, who seems
like a model and actor in the making.
 &HT;    ``Pretend like you're excited,'' Paul Starr, Mitchell's close
friend and makeup artist, tells the blond tyke as he widens his
mouth and eyes adorably. Paul mimes snapping a photo.
 &HT;    ``Now pretend like Joni's going away,'' he says. Marlon pauses
for a moment, and then pulls a forlorn, drooping face. A faux photo
is snapped again.
 &HT;    ``That was hard,'' Marlon says. ``I couldn't imagine why Joni
would be going away.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, at 54, Mitchell has settled down. In the last two
years, she has become a mother and grandmother simultaneously.
Seeing the family together, one would never know that she, her
daughter and grandson had ever been apart. Some musicians feel that
they must sacrifice the joy of raising a family because of their
commitment to their work.
 &HT;    Mitchell always seemed like this type of artist, but now she
seems to be relishing her new role. For someone whose art and life
have always been intertwined, this development is bound to have
implications for her music.
 &HT;    ``The coming of the kids hasn't come out in my art yet,'' she
says, referring to her latest projects _ a new album, ``Taming the
Tiger,'' a television special and a book of poetry.
 &HT;    But she has recorded music with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter
and ``they're convinced,'' she said, ``they can hear my family in
my tone. It has a more full-bodied femininity.''
 &HT;    That's just the beginning of the new, complete, ever-changing
Joni, one of the most influential and immodest songwriters of the
last 30 years. Since inheriting her new family, Mitchell has
suddenly become acquainted with pop culture. She watches ``Taxi''
reruns, reads kids' books to her grandson, spends more time
shooting pool and hanging out with her family and has rediscovered
Disney movies.
 &HT;    ``I used to be monastic, almost,'' she explains with a touch of
wistfulness. ``Now I'm like a Tibetan that has discovered
hamburgers and television. I'm catching up on Americana.''
 &HT;    Disney, in many ways, is responsible for Mitchell's career.
Watching Bambi as a child in Saskatchewan, she says, made an artist
out of her, inspiring her to pick up crayons and draw forest fires,
which led to art school, which led to an unwanted pregnancy (with
Kilauren) that forced her to drop out and take up music in Canada's
folk clubs.
 &HT;    Between pool shots, Mitchell, wearing a loose-knit sweater and
jeans, speaks words that fans of more complex albums such as
``Hejira'' and ``Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'' thought they'd
never hear: ``I don't like to make fluffy little songs but now I
want to make some light songs,'' she says. ``I think that comes
from watching a lot of comedy. People will probably not enjoy it as
much as the deep suffering that I've done in the past. And I don't
even know if I can do it.''
 &HT;    When it comes to her music, Mitchell can be humorless. People
describe her as ``bitter'' and a ``loose cannon,'' and those are
her friends.
 &HT;    Over the course of three days of conversations, Mitchell will
compare herself to Mozart, Blake and Picasso; she will say that the
lyrics to one of her songs ``have a lot of symbolic depth, like the
Bible'' and describe her music as so new it needs its own genre
name.
 &HT;    In discussing her autobiography in the works, she will explain
that there is no way to fit her life into one volume. She needs to
do it in four. (She already knows the first line: ``I was the only
black man at the party''; colleagues say she sometimes feels ``like
a black man in a white woman's body.'')
 &HT;    Mitchell is not a forgetful woman. Like Santa Claus, she
remembers who's been naughty and who's been nice. Speaking of a New
York Times profile written in 1996, she recalls that there were
``seven errors of observation in the piece.'' On the nice side, she
let Janet Jackson sample her song ``Big Yellow Taxi'' for the hook
of ``Got 'Til It's Gone'' because Jackson had once spoken favorably
of Mitchell's album ``Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm.''
 &HT;    And she distinctly remembers being excited by seeing the chins
of four people of different ages quiver during her performance of
``Summertime'' this summer on the original Woodstock site.
 &HT;    ``You think I got a trap mind or something?'' Mitchell asks when
I make the Santa Claus comparison. ``I guess I do.''
 &HT;    Howie Klein, the president of Reprise, her recording label, says
it can be a challenge working for Mitchell. ``She distinctly feels
her music belongs on black radio,'' he says. ``Sometimes I get the
feeling that she thinks I'm keeping it off black radio. We may not
see eye to eye on every detail, but I have so much respect for her
that I'm willing to subsume my own way of thinking to hers.''
 &HT;    Yet even as she lives up to the stereotype of the difficult
artist, Mitchell is ``a good-time Charlie,'' as she puts it, in her
private life. This is evident in her friends' comments about her as
well as in the good-natured way she loses her pool games.
 &HT;    Though Mitchell's most-loved work is her most melancholy
(particularly her introspective ``Blue'' album), her music, and
particularly her newest album, is also filled with joy. ``I'm not a
pitiable creature,'' she says. ``It's just that I suffer very
eloquently.''
 &HT;    Not only is Mitchell an influence on female songwriters from
Jewel to Madonna to Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, she is also
an influence on male songwriters from the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince to Elvis Costello to Beck, who all sing her praises.
 &HT;    Yet, despite such recognition, Mitchell is remarkably
discontent. Even the mention of a positive article merits the
response, ``It broke my heart to read it.''
 &HT;    Her ego is a complex thing. In her mind, she feels that she's
one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Yet in her heart,
she must have doubts or she wouldn't need the affirmation. Much of
it stems from a frustration that even as she has done better work,
she still can't eclipse the popularity of her earliest music.
 &HT;    At lunch at the Daily Grill in Brentwood, her home away from
home, we talk about the trappings of the popular-music game over
smelly tuna fish sandwiches.
 &HT;    For years, she rightly complained of a lack of recognition and
appreciation compared with that of the male musicians of her era.
But in the past four years, she has won a Grammy Award for Best Pop
Album, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and been
honored with a Century Award from Billboard magazine. Still, she
categorizes many of her awards as ``dubious.''
 &HT;    ``It's like that line of Dylan's: 'You know something is
happening here but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?'
That's what most of my honors felt like,'' she explains. ``They
knew they had to do it but they ... weren't quite sure what to
illuminate in the work.''
 &HT;    It antagonizes her no end that the songs that have made her
famous _ most notably ``Big Yellow Taxi'' _ are her least complex
and innovative ones. After all, Paul Simon was praised for bringing
together world music and pop in ``Graceland,'' and Sting bragged of
doing the same for jazz in ``The Dream of the Blue Turtles.''
Mitchell beat them all to the punch with albums such as ``The
Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' ``Hejira,'' ``Don Juan's Reckless
Daughter'' and the live album ``Shadows and Light'' by making music
in whatever style and tuning best suited her songs.
 &HT;    ``'Big Yellow Taxi' is nice,'' she says. ``It's like Chuck Berry
kind of skipping rope. It's a good little workhorse of a song and
it's got some content. But it's a nursery rhyme. Of all the
creations that are there, if you reduce it to this thing, it's a
tragedy.
 &HT;    ``Picasso was restless,'' she adds, her face half-shaded by a
straw sun hat. ``I mean, he just kept changing and changing and
changing.'' She mentions Miles Davis as well. ``So those are my
heroes. The ones that change a lot.''
 &HT;    Mitchell has always defined herself as being not who others have
expected her to be. She came down with polio when she was 9. Five
years later, having beaten the odds and recovered, she wasn't just
walking, she was dancing.
 &HT;    In her paintings, she has purposely made it part of her style to
break the rules that she was taught at the Alberta College of Art
(focusing on the same kind of stylistic combinations that can make
her records seem difficult). When she dropped out of art school and
committed to the folk circuit, where she traveled from Toronto to
Detroit to New York City, she denied that she was ever a folk
singer.
 &HT;    ``I came into the game looking like a folk singer but I was
really playing classical art songs,'' she explained as she checked
her watch to make sure she wasn't late to meet a friend.
 &HT;    ``Those weren't like the chords that folkies played. But I
looked like a folk singer, like the girl with the guitar. And at
that point I had already been a lover of classical music in my
pre-teens, a rock-and-roll dancer in high school, and I had
discovered jazz. So folk music was easy and I needed money for art
school just be cause we were all on students' wages. It wasn't
until I was 21 and the desire to compose and create came back ...
that I got caught between being pigeonholed by critics and laboring
for the sake of commercial exploitation.''
 &HT;    Mitchell traces her feeling of being misunderstood back to the
first music she made, at age 7. ``I had music killed by my piano
teacher,'' she says. ``She rapped my knuckles with a ruler, which
was the way they taught everybody in that era anyway, and said,
'Why would you want to play by ear' _ that's what they called
composing _ 'when you could have the masters under your fingertips,
when you could copy.' So you go to art school and innovation is
everything, but in music, you're just a weird loner. So I have more
of a painter's ego or approach, which is to make fresh,
individuated stuff that has my blood in it and on the tracks.''
 &HT;    Given all her anxiety about her career, it's perhaps
understandable that the musician's life is not one she professes to
relish. She regards touring as a violation of her muse and says
record labels treat musicians like dumb prizefighters built to earn
them purse money.
 &HT;    Speaking of her new album, she says, ``I'm already out of what
this record is about.'' She pauses and lights her fifth or 11th
cigarette and exhales. ``I'm involved with family and the
socializing process, which is something very exciting and very
different.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The night after we wrap up our interviews, I run into Mitchell
at Dominick's, a new Los Angeles restaurant so trendy that it fills
up every night despite its awful food. Mitchell is sitting in the
middle of a table surrounded by her daughter, grandson and friends,
celebrating her friend Paul Starr's birthday.
 &HT;    When I see her, she loops her arm around my elbow like an Auntie
Mame and spirits me into the foyer.
 &HT;    As we walk, we talk about astrology. According to a book she has
been reading, her daughter was born on the day of the explorer and
she was born on the day of the discoverer. ``She's a natural
follower, I'm a natural leader,'' she says. ``I can't help it, the
stars put me there.''
 &HT;    Mitchell says that their birth dates interact in a way best
suited to siblings and that, in fact, they have a sisterly
relationship. Not by design, they have the same handbags and shoes,
wear similar clothes and share what she describes as a ``crazy
bravado that comes from the Irish blood.''
 &HT;    Throughout her career, Mitchell dropped hints in her songs for
her only child to find. Although Gibb knew the biography of her
birth mother _ that she was a Canadian folk singer _ she never
dreamed that she was Mitchell's child. Then, in 1996, The New York
Times described Mitchell's search for her daughter. A friend of
Gibb's, who saw the story, joked that Mitchell could be Gibb's
birth mother. Gibb had only recently been told that she was
adopted, and she already had a son. She decided to investigate.
Eventually, she and Mitchell were united.
 &HT;    As for the adoptive parents, Mitchell says: ``We worked through
all of that. I'm totally grateful to them, and Kilauren hasn't
forgotten about them.''
 &HT;    At Dominick's, we sit down and she goes back to our previous
interviews and tries to clarify comments she made. Clearly, she has
tried to pinpoint where her natural frankness and expansiveness may
have got her into trouble.
 &HT;    There is a lyric on her new album that complains, ``I'm up to my
neck in alligator jaws gnashing at me.'' She is trying to figure
out if I am an alligator too. Her fears, however, seem dated. The
alligators are gnashing less and less, and at the dinner table
around the corner, she has found something to protect her from
them.
 &HT;    ``I used to be too much of an illuminated scribe locked in my
attic with a responsibility to my gifts,'' she says, laughing for
once at herself. She stubs out a cigarette. Now, she says: ``I long
to live in a Chekhov play with relatives and aunties and the long
white tables with green bottles on them, under the apple tree.
That's really where I should be.''

 By REBECCA JOHNSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It may not feel like it now, but some day America may look back
on the Starr report as a publishing event as significant as the
Kinsey report was in its day.
 &HT;    True, it is a crudely sketched morality play, but it has given
the American public and the descendants of Kinsey _ the sex-advice
columnists, the researchers and the therapists whose job it is to
explain us to ourselves _ an unprecedented opportunity to examine
our attitudes about sex.
 &HT;    In the same way that a traumatic life event propels someone into
therapy, where he discovers much of what he believed true to be
false, the scandal has exposed the steady undercurrent of sexual
hypocrisy running through many marriages.
 &HT;    Politicians (other than Dan Burton, Helen Chenoweth and Henry
Hyde, of course) may be shocked, shocked to learn that people have
sex out of marriage, but they shouldn't be.
 &HT;    Studies of married people's sexual habits show again and again
that adultery is quite common. According to the 1992 Janus Report,
two out of three married men, and one out of three married women
have had an extramarital encounter _ figures that are backed up by
Kinsey and other national sex surveys.
 &HT;    The experts say the reasons are obvious. Sex may get deeper,
more emotional, more spiritual and certainly more convenient with
the person you wake up to every morning, but it does not get
hotter.
 &HT;    According to Judith Seifer, a therapist, sex-advice columnist
and past president of the American Association of Sex Educators,
Counselors and Therapists, ``Sexual boredom is the most pandemic
dysfunction in this country. Think of sex as an appetite. Now think
about having to eat the exact same meal every day for the rest of
your life _ of course you'd get bored.''
 &HT;    Judy Kuriansky, who has dispensed love and sex advice for 18
years as ``Dr. Judy'' on her nationally syndicated radio call-in
show, says, ``'How do I keep the passion in my marriage alive?' is
by far the most common question I hear.''
 &HT;    Throw in the biologists who correlate a need for novel sex with
the presence of testosterone and the outlook for long-term monogamy
in any marriage is dim. Turn on the talk shows, read the
editorials, listen to the radio and you hear a lot of outrage. How
could he? But if sexual boredom is as rampant as everyone says, how
could he not? Indeed, some columnists think this could be an
excellent moment for America to rethink its sexual paradigm.
 &HT;    Perhaps every age gets the advice it deserves. Once, the market
was cornered by Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren. The Iowa-born,
kindly, aphoristic twin sisters imprinted generations of Americans
with the kind of values that promised to make the center hold:
marriage, monogamy and the like. But the center did not hold.
 &HT;    Divorce rates soared. AIDS spread. Jerry Springer beat Oprah in
the ratings, and then came the Clinton scandal _ the public
response to which suggests that Americans are a lot less prudish
than they perhaps used to be.
 &HT;    With changing times came changing advice _ meaner, funnier, more
frank. And of all the new Miss Lonelyhearts to be found on cable or
the Internet or in the alternative press, none is blunter or more
libertine than a syndicated columnist whose name _ real name _ is
Dan Savage.
 &HT;    To one reader who wrote: ``I am an androgynous spirit. Sex to me
means spirituality, tenderness, kindness, loving another human
being as myself. ... Call me a freak, but that's my libido,''
Savage replied: ``Your 'libido' sounds really evolved. You, on the
other hand, sound like a drip.''
 &HT;    Savage says that the mess this country has made over the
Lewinsky affair can be traced directly back to our wrongheaded
thinking about love, sex, marriage and monogamy.
 &HT;    ``The sexual model that straight people have created doesn't
really work,'' he says. ``All it does is force people to lie.''
Savage, who is gay and whose collection of weekly columns, ``Savage
Love: Straight Answers From America's Most Popular Sex Columnist,''
was just published, says that to gay people monogamy is not a
monolithic all-or-nothing concept, and he thinks the rest of the
world could learn from that model.
 &HT;    ``In this society, we view monogamy like we view virginity,'' he
says, ``one incident and it's over, the relationship is destroyed _
but we should view monogamy like we view sobriety. You're sober.
You might get completely drunk one night, but you can get sober
again. You can get monogamous again.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Savage thinks our pity for Hillary Clinton is misplaced.
``We don't know what Bill and Hillary's agreement is,'' he says,
``and we will never know. She might not like sex. I don't feel
sorry for her. She's grown-up. She's smart. They have some sort of
arrangement, and who are we to say whether it's good or bad? I
think they are more mature about sex, like they are about drugs,
than they can let on.''
 &HT;    You would be hard pressed, however, to find a mainstream
sex-advice columnist who embraces adultery as an antidote to sexual
boredom. Not even James Petersen, a senior editor at Playboy who
wrote the magazine's advice column for 20 years. ``We don't endorse
it,'' Petersen says, ``but we accept that it's part of human
nature.''
 &HT;    In this era of neo-Darwinian sociobiology, some of the morally
conservative advice dispensers have even tried to apply scientific
principles to adultery. ``It's a medical fact that monogamy and
intimacy are what make people happy,'' says Drew Pinsky, M.D., aka
``Dr. Drew,'' co-host of MTV's ``Love Line,'' a nightly call-in
love-and-sex advice show that pairs Pinsky with a comedian
sidekick.
 &HT;    Says Seifer: ``I don't know if monogamy is a natural way to
live. It's a product of social organization, but it's essential for
the way our society is organized, both emotionally and for the
passage of property. In my practice I rarely find people who have
had affairs say they would do it again.''
 &HT;    What sex therapists do suggest, almost universally, is that
couples ``work at it'' when the passion goes. But the standard
resuscitation techniques advocated _ massage, videos, romantic
getaways and, who can forget, ``Meet your husband at the door
wrapped in Saran Wrap'' _ can be more deadly than the boredom.
 &HT;    And if the fireworks fail to ignite, then what? ``My advice is
always, 'Challenge the relationship,''' Petersen says. ``'Bring out
the whips and chains and if that doesn't work, leave.'''
 &HT;    Savage, on the other hand, thinks that as a culture we oversell
the importance of sex in a long-term relationship.
 &HT;    ``The way we talk about sex destroys a lot of perfectly decent
relationships,'' he says. ``Read Cosmo magazine, listen to Jenny
Jones. The whole culture reinforces these infantile ideas about
sex. You have to burn with sexual passion for your husband for 60
years or your relationship is over.''
 &HT;    We are, he says, ''laying down the dialogue that destroys these
relationships. When we talk about trying to bring the divorce rate
down, maybe we should do it by creating a society where we don't
insist a relationship is over when the sexual passion is gone. I
know gay couples who have been together for 35 years. They have
separate bedrooms. Sometimes they sleep together and sometimes they
sleep with other people, but they're a great couple. Who are we to
say: 'You're busted! You're not a couple anymore because you're not
having sex'?''
 &HT;    As the advice dispensers explain, for Hillary Clinton's
generation, the kind of behavior Lewinsky exhibited to snag the
president's attention reads as slutty and even unbalanced. But
women Lewinsky's age were weaned on the postfeminist notion that
``slut'' is a sexist term, a mixed message that encourages men to
compartmentalize what they need from women: one for companionship,
another for sex.
 &HT;    The Monica Lewinskys of the world grew up believing ``nice
girls'' do _ her therapist actually wrote a book with that title.
``Girls like Monica learned their sexuality from Madonna,''
Petersen says. ``They bought their underwear from Victoria's Secret
catalogues. Flashing it is nothing to them. It's the sort of thing
you might see in a Sprite ad.'' And one thing ``nice girls'' do in
the 1990s is oral sex.
 &HT;    The generation gap on this issue is startling. In a nationwide
study released in 1994 _ The Social Organization of Sexuality _
21.1 percent of women ages 25 to 29 said they found giving oral sex
``very appealing,'' but only 7.2 percent of women ages 50 to 54
said the same. Some women much older than that don't even know what
it means.
 &HT;    I was watching CNN with my 92-year-old grandmother, a lady if
there ever was one, on the day that Lewinsky testified before
Starr. She turned to me after the phrase ``oral sex'' had been
mentioned for the hundredth time and said, ``I guess that means she
stimulated him with her imagination.''
 &HT;    Society, of course, did not go from thinking oral sex was
perverted to embracing it in one great leap.
 &HT;    Attitudes changed incrementally beginning as far back as the
turn of the century with Havelock Ellis, moving forward to Alfred
Kinsey in the '40s and Masters and Johnson in the '60s. They also
occasionally go backward, as in the moral conservatism of ``Dr.
Laura'' Schlessinger, the radio personality.
 &HT;    It was, however, people like Xaviera Hollander, aka ``the Happy
Hooker,'' who has written an advice column for Penthouse magazine
since 1972, and Ruth Westheimer in the '80s, who first talked about
sex in everyday, sometimes salacious terms, who made dialogue about
sex truly accessible to the public.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Ruth was this tiny woman who said 'penis' with a German
accent and a giggle,'' Seifer says, ``and that's who we were
willing to hear about sex from.''
 &HT;    And now a growing number are willing to hear about it from
Savage. He draws letters from men and women, straight, gay and
bisexual _ all of whom want to hear what a rude anything-goes
columnist has to say about their sex lives. He explains his slow
convergence with the mainstream this way: ``The gay response to
AIDS forced everybody to start talking about what they were
physically doing in bed. It forced the newspapers to write honestly
about sex.''
 &HT;    At the same time, experts say, the generation of young
heterosexuals who grew up with the specter of AIDS has pushed the
envelope of what's considered kinky. In analyzing the results of
Playboy's college sex surveys, even Petersen was surprised by what
young people do these days.
 &HT;    ``They had to redefine safe sex, so they ended up doing things
it took me 20 years to do,'' he says. ``You name it, they've done
it _ whips, chains, Wesson oil, making videos.''
 &HT;    People who find Clinton's sexual behavior debauched are,
according to some therapists, buying into the idea that anything
other than missionary-position sex is shameful. And that, they say,
is where sexual dysfunction begins.
 &HT;    ``All sex is about power,'' says Allison Glock, the sex-advice
columnist for GQ magazine. ``Ultimately, someone is on top and
someone is on bottom.''
 &HT;    When clients go to Seifer complaining that sex is boring, she
says it is usually because of fear and shame that they have
absorbed from some source, often religion. You lose your
self-consciousness in sex by either feeling totally loved and
accepted, or not really caring what the other person thinks. It's
why so many men prefer to indulge their more far-out or just plain
selfish fantasies with prostitutes instead of their wives.
 &HT;    ``I think Hillary could be a powerful sexual partner,'' Petersen
says, ``but I don't think the president can see it. It's too much
like being in bed with your law partner for him.''
 &HT;    In the end, it is impossible to know how the scandal will affect
the future of sex relations in America. Petersen calls it the
``last chapter of the sexual revolution,'' but says that maybe it
will be good for us. As he says, scandals have a way of dragging
important issues into the public _ Anita Hill gave us sexual
harassment; perhaps this will give us honesty in relationships.
 &HT;    As Seifer says, ``Most people find it easier to have sex than
talk about it.''
 &HT;    Indeed the nation has clearly been traumatized by the endless
parsing of the sexual relationship between the president and
Lewinsky. In his own way, Savage draws a conclusion: ``If we were
all honest about our sex lives,'' he says, ``the republic would
crumble. This just confirms that people have a right and a
responsibility to lie about it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  START-UP PC MAKER iDot BUILDS ON THE MADE-TO-ORDER MODEL 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Start-up personal computer maker iDot.com may be small.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be impossible to find a store that sells its
products.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways it shares many similarities with the more
established PC companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like Compaq Computer Corp., iDot was conceived by technology
industry veterans who met in a restaurant, sketching out ideas on a
napkin. Like Dell Computer Corp., iDot sells its wares directly to
customers, rather than going through a reseller. And like Gateway,
iDot goes after home and small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Compaq, you can't buy iDot's computers in stores.
Unlike Dell and Gateway, iDot employs no workers in call centers to
take phone orders.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an iDot system, there's only one place to get one:
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started doing business on April 21, bills
itself as ``the first PC company built for the Web.'' By selling
only over the Internet, iDot hopes to wring maximum efficiency out
of the process of building and marketing personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of it as a beneficial conspiracy theory,''
says Jeremy Mark Marlow, one of the co-founders of iDot and its
senior vice president of marketing. ``If our customers will support
this very efficient business model, then we can give them excellent
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, iDot is more like Amazon.com, the Web-only
bookseller, and CDNow, which pioneered the sale of music compact
discs online. Crucial to its business is the company's technology,
a sophisticated piece of software that lets its customers configure
and then purchase a PC.
</P>
<P>
   An order placed on iDot's Web site and paid for with a credit
card can be instantly approved electronically. Within minutes, the
invoice for a new PC rolls out of a small Lexmark printer in iDot's
parts room _ the first time a human touches the order in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site and electronic commerce software was written by
programmers hired by iDot after the company couldn't find software
that did all this automatically. The software runs on a half-dozen
PCs built by iDot and linked by a fast connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the potential to be the next Dell. Or, they could be
gone from our experience in the next month,'' said Rob Enderle,
director of desktop and mobile technology at Giga Information
Group, a market research company in Norwell, Mass. ``But, they are
redefining what a low-cost PC manufacturer can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, iDot owes a lot to its larger Austin neighbor. Dell's
phenomenal success selling computers on the Web _ it has online
sales of $6 million a day _ has proven that people will buy PCs
over the Net. Founder Michael Dell has said he thinks his company
may have as much as 50 percent of its sales online by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Dell still relies heavily on sales personnel who
both take calls and solicit business over the phone. iDot's
founders hope to build a business without that expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dell was started, phone sales were the next big thing,''
Enderle said. ``Michael Dell stepped in and created the direct
business model around these call centers. But the new model is the
Web, and it has an intrinsically lower cost over call centers, just
as call centers do over a sales force in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also takes advantage of its Texas location. The same
parts and service suppliers that work for Dell and Compaq also have
deals with iDot. As a result, iDot can use the same just-in-time
inventory techniques _ in which parts are shipped by suppliers as
they are needed from nearby warehouses to the assembly floor _ as
the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started by a group of computer industry veterans
like Marlow, who had been working for Austin-based Power Computing,
one of the most successful makers of Macintosh clones. When Apple
Computer took action to shut down the clone makers, Marlow was
brought in because of his experience as an executive at AST
Research, which makes Windows-based systems. Power wanted to
convert to selling similar systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Power's attempts to remake itself fell apart, and Marlow
found himself unemployed. He talked to several Austin-area
companies, including Dell. He eventually hooked up with Neil
Bremner, a former executive of the direct PC seller CompuAdd, and
C.P. Lee, a Taiwanese entrepreneur. Lee also owns a company that
sells peripherals and monitors under the familiar name Digital
Research Technologies. (At the dawn of the personal computer
revolution, a company called Digital Research offered the early
CP/M &UR;  &LR; operating system for personal computers, as well as an MS-DOS
clone called DR-DOS.)
</P>
<P>
   One evening last November, the men were having dinner at an
Applebee's restaurant in the shadow of Dell's headquarters and
sketched out the plans for a Web-based company on a dinner napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Lee used his contacts to secure $3.5 million in seed money from
Mag Technologies, makers of the Mag Innovision line of computer
monitors, and iDot formally opened its doors in offices in north
Austin in January.
</P>
<P>
   The company has targeted three specific markets _ students,
gamers and small businesses. All three are considered to be
computer-savvy, which cuts down somewhat on technical support
calls, Marlow said. To hammer home just who iDot's customers are,
the company uses the slogan ``PCs for Smarties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as opposed to, `for Dummies,' '' said Marlow, referring
to the popular line of books aimed at computer novices.
</P>
<P>
   The gamer segment is its best so far, and the most profitable.
Marlow said 40 percent of gamer systems are state-of-the-art, going
out the door with 450-megahertz Pentium II processors, lots of
memory and big hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company aims most of its marketing at this
group. iDot recently completed a tour of Texas college campuses _
including Rice University and the University of Houston _ where it
set up multiplayer game tournaments. Students could compete by
playing the popular Quake II game, and the winners from each
university will meet for a match of champions at iDot's offices
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick Marckini, iDot's very first customer, is typical of the
kind of people the company is trying to reach. The Weston, Mass.,
Internet consultant bought a $2,300, 400-megahertz system on April
23, just two days after the site first went up.
</P>
<P>
   Marckini said he ``lives on the Web,'' and was impressed enough
by iDot's site to buy a computer from an unfamiliar company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their Web site said they were clearly a well-funded company.
It was nothing even a sophisticated developer could put together on
his own. They weren't going away tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the first iDot computer sold arrived with a flaw.
Marckini said there was a ``hard-disk issue'' and he had to send
the machine back. It was returned fixed, he said, and he's been
pleased with it. He's since bought two monitors from iDot.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's going after technology-savvy buyers, it also
attracts affluent ones. About 78 percent of people pay by credit
card, the rest by purchase order or check. The high number of
credit-card sales means iDot has a steady flow of cash. Company
executives won't say how many PCs they've sold, only that they are
doing better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company has borrowed another page from Amazon.com, setting
up virtual storefronts on other companies' Web sites. Amazon.com
will pay a commission to a business if it generates sales of books
via a link back to Amazon. An oil company, for example, could tout
Amazon.com books on geology or the petrochemical industry in
exchange for a cut of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   In an early marketing coup, iDot set up one of these storefronts
on the home page for Dilbert, the popular United Media cartoon
character (www.dilbert.com). iDot is now the ``official computer''
for the Dilbert Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect for us,'' said Marlow. ``Engineers love Dilbert,
and they're part of our market. Also, Dilbert represents the
underdog. We're an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives relish and encourage this image as an
underdog. They know they are in the shadow of computer-industry
giants like Dell on the Web. Thus, they have another slogan:
``Don't buy PCs made by billionaires,'' referring to Michael Dell's
net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Even their offices smack of an irreverent attitude. Visitors who
wait in a spartan lobby must sit on day-glo beanbag chairs _ and
there are only two. The decor is decidedly early '60s kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   That look is also part of iDot's emphasis on efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for ways to cut costs everywhere,'' said co-founder
Bremner. ``We even look for deals on office supplies. When someone
goes for pencils, they don't just buy the first thing on the
shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   That efficiency pays off in aggressive pricing. An iDot system
with a 450-megahertz Pentium II chip, a 16.8-gigabyte hard drive,
128 megabytes of memory, a 56K fax modem, an 8-MB video card and a
DVD-ROM drive costs about $2,099. A similarly equipped Gateway
system, priced at that PC maker's Web site, sells for $2,326. A
comparable Dell system is $2,252. Monitors for each of these
systems are extra.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are 50 employees at iDot, which had only four
employees when it began. Its executives plan to keep things tight _
Bremner expects there will be only about 100 employees a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next step in the company's growth is to raise more
private capital, $10 million to $15 million, ``to get us through
the next two years, and at that point we'll be cash-flow
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives realize that iDot's current niche won't
be enough to sustain it. Eventually it will have to begin offering
notebook computers and servers, and begin selling products to the
more lucrative corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, iDot begins seriously competing with Dell,
Compaq, IBM and other major players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, there are some very large, behemoth vendors like
Dell and Gateway out there, and iDot operates under their radars at
this point,'' said Bruce Stephen, head of personal systems research
at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``They are in the
fun part now, the start-up phase.'' &QL;

SHARE BUYBACKS GOOD FOR INVESTORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With stock prices felled by the turmoil in financial markets,
many companies are out to revive their stock by announcing they'll
buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical when investors punish stock prices because
company executives see it as an irrational overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   Finance experts who've studied buybacks say they are generally
good news for investors because they help to shore up the price of
a stock and create a positive reaction when times are tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To that extent, it's symbolic,'' said James Westphal,
professor of management at the University of Texas, who wrote a
report on buybacks. ``It sends a signal that the company is
undervalued and that top managers are concerned about shareholder
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the stock of companies offering buybacks outperforms
those of their peers not offering buybacks depends on several
factors, said Michael Mauboussin, an analyst with investment bank
Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, which recently issued a
report on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Those include how many shares a company intends to buy back,
what premium it's willing to pay for the stock and whether
management is selling its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if stock options attract top talent to a
company, that's good for its stock because it would eventually
translate into a higher stock price, Mauboussin said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Follow-through often lacking &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just because companies say they'll buy back shares doesn't
mean they're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal considered 412 major corporations that announced
buybacks between 1985 and 1991. In the five years after the
announcement, 38 percent of the companies didn't buy back any of
their shares and 66 percent didn't repurchase all the shares they
said they would buy.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, of the 28 buyback announcements from Houston companies
announced so far this year, only one was completed and 27 are
pending, according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J., a
financial information service company.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they don't follow through is that once a company has
telegraphed that it believes its stock is undervalued, ``the
purpose of the plan has been accomplished,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several factors that can trigger a buyback
announcement from a company, according to Credit Suisse:
</P>
<P>
   The company believes its shares are worth more than the market
believes _ When a company buys back its stock, it reduces the
number of shares outstanding, thereby bolstering the per-share
price of the stock. By shrinking the number of shares, a buyback
boosts per-share profits unless profits also decline.
</P>
<P>
   To soak up shares pouring into the market because of stock
options to employees _ ``Managers generally prefer to avoid an
upward creep in the share count as a result of stock options,''
Credit Suisse said. ``Share buybacks offset this embarrassment of
riches.''
</P>
<P>
   To redeploy excess cash _ A company generates surplus cash when
its earnings exceed its investment opportunities. It may want to
use the extra money to buy back its stock if it doesn't find a
better use for the money.
</P>
<P>
   To gather the shares to offer targets of future acquisitions _
That's one of the reasons cited by Vern Stockton, spokesman for
Bank United in Houston, who said the bank holding company believes
its stock is a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Look for completion notice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's important to see if a company has followed through with a
buyback because that tells you how sincere it is.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that hard to figure out. Some companies will announce
the completion of a buyback either in a separate announcement or
include the news when it announces another buyback.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies also announce completion of buybacks in earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
   You may also call a company's investor relations department and
ask whether a firm has completed a buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   If a company hasn't followed through on a buyback announcement,
you want to know why because it may be that it's found a better use
for its money.
</P>
<P>
   One tipoff that a company may not follow through is the number
of board members who are from outside the company, Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   You can find that out by looking at a company's proxy statement
or annual report. The more independent the board, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where managers sit on other boards that have announced and not
implemented buybacks, they are more likely to do the same thing (at
their own companies),'' Westphal said. ``To the extent that
managers have a strong influence over those decisions, they may
want to preserve their discretion on how to allocate free cash
flow.''

AVERAGE MUTUAL FUND INVESTING SLID 15 PERCENT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter where they turned, investors who put their money in
stock mutual funds couldn't escape the turmoil in financial markets
over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The average fund investing in U.S. stocks slid 15 percent, the
worst quarterly showing for stock funds in eight years, according
to Lipper Analytical Services in New York, which tracks fund
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gains earlier this year lessened the pain somewhat. Stock funds
have fallen an average 6.4 percent for the 12 months ended Sept.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Losses were even worse for those who invested in funds putting
their money in smaller companies _ where the typical fund was off
21 percent in the quarter and 20.6 percent for the year _ or
international funds, where losses averaged 16.2 percent in the
quarter and 10.7 percent for the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of your investors have just given up the ghost,'' said
money manager Gerald Perritt, editor of The Mutual Fund Letter in
Largo, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The one safe haven that investors found was in bond funds. The
average domestic long-term bond fund was up an average 1.4 percent
in the quarter and an average 7.2 percent in the year ended in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flight to certainty in an uncertain time,'' said Rob
Schumacher, chief investment strategist at the Van Kampen Focus
Portfolios in Chicago, a mutual fund. ``I'm not going to make any
money on a 4.29 percent treasury, but I know it's going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing by stock funds in the quarter showed that
investors couldn't depend on the stock-picking skills of portfolio
managers to shield them from the market rout.
</P>
<P>
   The losses were less in funds where the money is automatically
allocated into a portfolio that matches the benchmark Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index. These index funds fell an average of 10
percent in the quarter, 33 percent less than the typical U.S.
equity fund, and chalked up an average gain of 8.5 percent in the
year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case of big stocks performing better than small stocks
because the S&AMP;P index is dominated by large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest stocks held up better,'' said Scott Cooley, a fund
analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, a fund research firm. ``Active
managers tend to pick mostly smaller companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And small stocks got killed in the quarter, even though analysts
were predicting a revival from a previous downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Small-capitalization funds swooned an average 21.5 percent in
the quarter and an average 20.6 percent in the year ended in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There continues to be a penalty for investing in companies
with market capitalization below the largest,'' said A. Michael
Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.
</P>
<P>
   But then, small stocks tend to do worse than large stocks in
market downfalls, Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, when the market turns down, small caps get hit
worse,'' he said. ``They tend to be a little more volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The much touted technique of investment diversification failed
investors in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   International funds tanked an average 16.2 percent in the third
quarter and an average 10.7 percent in the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some real carnage in this stock market and the
more diversified you've been across stocks, probably the worse your
portfolio performance,'' Perritt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis, which has spread to Russia and Latin
America, decimated stocks in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   European Region funds were down an average 17.3 percent in the
third quarter but were up an average 3.4 percent for the year ended
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese funds dropped an average 9.4 percent in the quarter,
but they suffered severely in the long term, skidding a whopping
23.3 percent for the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets funds, which invest in companies in developing
countries, took an especially huge hit, the victim of the global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Those funds dived an average 23.6 percent in the quarter and an
average 46.5 percent in the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American funds plummeted an average 29.4 percent in the
quarter and lost more than half their value _ an average 50.2
percent _ in the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term declines in Latin American funds and emerging
markets funds are approaching depression levels,'' Lipper said.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles facing funds investing in emerging markets haunted
financial services funds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those funds, which were last year's leaders, dived an average
19.2 percent in the quarter but were off only an average 1.7
percent in the year ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decline is significant because the prior gains in
financial stocks have been driving some general equity performance
for some time,'' Lipper said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' fear of bad times came out in the performance of gold
funds, which rose an average 4.3 percent in the quarter and led all
stock funds for the first time since the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold funds were spurred on by an extraordinary 42.93 percent
gain in September,'' Lipper said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors flee to gold in turbulent economic and political times
because they perceive it as a store of value.
</P>
<P>
   Gold funds' gain came at a price, with an awful 33.4 percent
decline for the 12 months ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper was cautiously optimistic that stocks are due for a
comeback. He titled his fund report, ``First the Valley, then the
Rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock funds have fallen more than 10 percent in 12 quarters
since the beginning of 1960, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nine of those 12 periods, general equity posted a positive
return in the following quarter,'' Lipper said.
</P>
<P>
   However, stock funds are now up an annualized 13.7 percent in
the last five years, closer to the 35-year rate of 12.1 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary risk is that after many years of above-average
gains, we may be due for year of below-average gains,'' Lipper
said. &QL;

By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ It's barely daylight. Outside the convent
walls, the city of Michelangelo's birth comes alive. A tiny coffee
bar serves steaming espresso. Birds chatter and vie for tidbits not
whisked away by lumbering street sweepers. Motor scooters
putt-putt-putt through narrow, winding streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Suore Francescane dell'Immacolata, 10 black-robed nuns
kneel in prayer. Sunlight filters into their airy chapel, glinting
off stained-glass windows. The nuns sing a cappella, softly
chanting the rosary. Just as the priest enters, several sleepy
latecomers _ lay people in street clothes _ join the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, this convent serves as home to an aging group
of Franciscan nuns and as a residence for young women attending
college or graduate school nearby. It is near the center of
Florence, about a mile from the Duomo, the majestic Cathedral of
Santa Maria del Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   Off-season, the convent's whitewashed corridors join the
picturesque halls of some 2,000 religious houses worldwide that
accept travelers for short stays and guests for longer periods of
quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for space at these sanctuaries is so high that some U.S.
monasteries take reservations a year in advance. Modern life with
its fax machines, e-mail, beepers and cell phones has knocked us
off balance. We are seeking soul space at an unprecedented rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent book ``Music of Silence'' (Ulysses Press, $12),
Benedictine monk David Steindl-Rast teams with Sharon Lebell to
explore the spiritual riches of everyday life moving to monastic
rhythms. In the book's introduction, best-selling author Kathleen
Norris explores the difficulty of striking a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, when I timed an annoying delay (from my computer) and
found that it constituted all of 10 seconds, I had what I would
call a `monk moment,' a quick slap that told me, `Pay attention _
watch yourself,' '' Norris writes. ``And seeing myself as I was _
groaning with impatience over so small an increment of time _ made
me laugh. I had let technology and its attendant idol, efficiency,
make a fool of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris, also an award-winning poet, helped popularize the notion
of finding soul space in monasteries. A Presbyterian, she described
her seeking in three best sellers: ``Dakota,'' ``The Cloister
Walk'' and ``Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith.'' But forsaking
routine for silence is an ancient idea. Today, thousands find
silence far from the city lights, in sanctuaries once frequented
mainly by priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   General interest in such lodging is so high that at least three
recent travel books focus on it. One of the most engaging was
compiled by retired Army Col. James J. Hughes and his late wife,
Victoria. Hughes, 82, lives in Bloomfield, N.J. He is as
enthusiastic about his self-published guidebook today as he was
when its first edition appeared in 1990. His wife, nicknamed Lovey,
died last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we found some wonderful places,'' Hughes confides,
rattling off a list that begins in Assisi, Italy, in the
16th-century confines of St. Anthony's Guest House. He is planning
a trip that would include staying at a convent in London two blocks
from Victoria Station and at a monastery in the foothills of the
Dublin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' book, ``Overnight or Short Stays at Religious Houses
Around the World,'' is an extension of his European travels; it is
available for $19.95 (including postage) by writing to Hugen Press,
P.O. Box 2286. Bloomfield, N.J. 07003-0998. The directory lists
only addresses and telephone numbers; no details on types of
accommodations or proximity to famous sites. The basic information
was gleaned by Hughes directly, or acquired through friends and
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a travel guide with details about the houses and
area sites to be visited,'' Hughes tells readers in his
introduction. ``It is a simple listing of an extraordinary resource
that may be unknown to you. Ours is a mobile society that goes in
all directions. Some of these houses may be along your travel
route.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' book can point to out-of-the-way locales such as Angola
in Africa and Chiang Mai in Thailand or to destinations closer to
home (say, Paris or Madrid).
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the spartan pleasures of staying at a convent or
abbey were a little-known secret. Only religious insiders _ from
Catholic lay leaders to Buddhist meditators _ could outline the
pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a particular monastery, an experienced visitor would
advise a prospective one. ``Never stay there until late September.
There's no air conditioning, and it's too hot,'' a comfort-seeking
traveler remarked about a deep South Texas house of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   A traveler with a sweet tooth highly recommended one convent
because of its scrumptious cookies. Another adventurer urged a
friend to trust her instincts and go somewhere ``new'' on retreat.
Still another retreat-taker drafted several pages to explain her
penchant for convents to her wary adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes advises travelers to decide what they're seeking before
choosing a place to stay. Guest houses are best as ``the base for a
holiday,'' he writes. Retreat houses are more suited to people
seeking physical rest, mental review, emotional reflection and
spiritual renewal.
</P>
<P>
   His paperback directory is in good company. Another recent
release on such soul spaces is ``Sanctuaries: The Complete United
States'' (Bell Tower, $18) by inveterate travelers Marcia and Jack
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   An update of two previous regional guides, this book describes
127 monasteries, retreat centers, convents and abbeys that the
Kellys have visited. It also provides listings in all 50 states of
1,000 other places _ including Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Sufi and
religiously-unaffiliated havens.
</P>
<P>
   The Kellys' book gives details essential to parents, group
travelers or novices to the retreat circuit. Each entry is an
overview of types of lodgings, amenities, activities and proximity
to points of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Another recommended volume is ``A Guide to Monastic Guest
Houses'' (Morehouse, $13.95), which lists Christian hostels across
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to this sort of travel need to do their homework.
There is a difference between a house of prayer and a retreat
center. The former is designed for silent, soulful reflecting with
periods of silence _ or complete silence _ often required. Retreat
centers cater more to groups and families, but are usually noisier
and less suited to soul-searching. Guest houses, usually adjuncts
to a monastery, are designed for shorter stays.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all see hospitality to guests as ministry. Spiritual
counseling is available, but usually only if requested.
Nonbelievers are generally welcomed. And if you simply seek quiet,
fear not. No one will ask your religion if you call to reserve a
room.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities are simple: usually soap, towels and linens. Prepare
for inclement weather if the setting is woodsy. Expect company as
diverse as the sponsoring religious orders. You might meet a
vacationing family, a soul-searching single or a married couple
delighted by a quiet weekend away.
</P>
<P>
   The settings are as different as their locales.
</P>
<P>
   Look for star-studded night skies midwinter in the California
high desert at St. Andrew's Abbey, located at Valyermo in the
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. The abbey, famous in the
region for its ceramic studio, offers a fall festival that attracts
thousands and a series of summer workshops on themes including
personal development and sacred dance. Families are common at meals
where robed monks ladle fragrant soup into guests' bowls.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, autumn travelers might rest in the comfortable arms
of the Old South at Mepkin Abbey. A Trappist monastery along the
Cooper River in South Carolina, it is built on property rich in
ancient oaks draped in Spanish moss. Originally a rice plantation,
the monastery was built after a parcel was donated to the local
Catholic diocese by the Henry Luce family.
</P>
<P>
   In general, prices at such places average $30 to $75 per day per
person, often including meals.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, especially in Europe, call a minimum of
several months in advance. Some technically astute orders even have
Web sites, but most take reservations by letter or telephone. For
overseas reservations in even developed nations such as Italy, to
expect a fax machine is impractical. Even telephoning takes time
unless one speaks fluent Italian.
</P>
<P>
   When writing or calling:
</P>
<P>
   Be specific on arrival and departure dates.
</P>
<P>
   Find out if a deposit is required. If so, personal checks or
credit cards are usually accepted in the United States. Elsewhere,
use an international money order, available through larger
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ask if meals are served at the time of year you are visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Ask if children are accepted. Larger retreat centers often take
groups including children. Many religious houses accept mostly
singles or married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Ask if your ``house'' has a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Once the doors are locked, you'll be out in the cold unless you
have a key or the nerve to awaken a houseful of gentle souls.
</P>
<P>
   Once you arrive:
</P>
<P>
   Be quiet if silence is being observed.
</P>
<P>
   Find out when and where meals are served. Show up on time.
</P>
<P>
   Be courteous and patient. This is not the Holiday Inn. A
convent's equivalent of your average hotel desk clerk may be a
harried, overworked nun in her late sixties with arthritic knees.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared for the unexpected and the delightful.
</P>
<P>
   It is midafternoon, siesta time, at the Suore Francescane dell'
Immacolata house in Florence. A younger sister is answering the
phone. Most days her older peers would be napping now. But
listening carefully, visitors hear odd noises down a darkened
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Closer inspection reveals a small black-and-white portable TV in
a side room. Clustered around it, their chins thrust forward in
determination, are three older sisters. ``Hurrah, go, go, hurrah!''
they cheer in rapid-fire shouts. Italy is winning in a soccer
match. The siestas will have to wait. &QL;

CORN-FLAKY GIRL: TORI AMOS ON HER GAME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE CRAWFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With Tori Amos, you either get it, or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, she has a gorgeous voice, clear and supple. On
the other, she spends so much time in the upper ranges that it's
almost impossible to understand the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, a good many of those lyrics are just plain
goofy anyway. On the other hand, she has a way of connecting raw
emotions to her words in such a way as to create something of an
epiphany, especially with female fans.
</P>
<P>
   Count me, a guy, among those who don't get it. But that doesn't
mean I can't appreciate the kind of performance Amos delivered
Saturday night at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion north of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Her mix of performance art, high classical/jazz inflected
compositions, and bombastic rock 'n' roll doesn't always translate
on her recordings. But in the live setting, with room to cavort and
project her expansive and playfully coy stage presence, she comes
across as a true rock goddess.
</P>
<P>
   The constant cascade of high-pitched screams from the decidedly
distaff audience affirmed that point.
</P>
<P>
   The best moments of the show came with Amos' more controlled,
conventional songs, especially on ``Spark,'' ``Playboy Mommy''
(both from her latest work, ``from the choirgirl hotel'') and
``Cornflake Girl.'' These songs find Amos laying down a solid
repeating piano hook and hanging exotic rhythms and other
instrumentation on the foundation. The result is a hypnotic musical
crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   Other moments weren't so stellar. More than a few of Amos'
compositions fall in a rote quiet-crashing-quiet again format, with
tempo and chord changes thrown in seemingly at random intervals.
After about five or six of these compositions in the same vein,
they become a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Amos was otherwise on her game Saturday,
particularly on a couple of lovely, grim songs performed solo
(especially the powerfully melodramatic ``God''). And she ended her
main set with one of the most thrilling examples of over-the-top
Baroque musical theater I've experienced, the swirling, menacing
``The Waitress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish trio the Devlins opened the show with a satisfyingly
downcast batch of well-constructed guitar-pop songs. The Devlins'
tunes are a swirling mix of folk and Southern jangle-rock coupled
with somber, love-lost lyrics sung by charismatic (and exceedingly
polite) frontman/guitarist Colin Devlin.
</P>
<P>
   His remarkably clear and supple voice translated well into the
live setting, soaring above the band's crystalline compositions.
With numerous critical plaudits for their latest album,
``Waiting,'' the Devlins are definitely a band to watch. &QL;

<P>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Bajans, as people here like to be called,
have a sense of their own style. So much so that even McDonald's
couldn't invade the culture. The fast-food chain went bust after
just six months of operation because no one ate at the place.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is different from some other Caribbean islands in that
things just seem to work better here. The roads are good, the
phones connect, and appointments are kept. And, the island is
infested by millionaires the way some are infested by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans will tell you that their country has been blessed by God,
and this is no idle boast.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados hasn't been touched by a hurricane since 1955 and the
sun shines nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz'') are the most affluent and most
educated people in the Caribbean, and they have the highest
literacy rate _ nearly 98 percent _ in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Nations Development Program's annual ``human
development index'' that evaluates countries in terms of life
expectancy, income and education, Barbados ranks 24th, ahead of all
other Caribbean countries and even better than countries such as
Portugal, Luxembourg, and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   And if Barbados appears lacking in the vast poverty found on
other islands, it is because agriculture, commerce, and sugar cane
production provide most with work.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about their island's success, government officials
will say it's rooted in religion and a strong education system.
</P>
<P>
   The 166-square-mile island supports a population of 266,000
people and more churches than days in the year.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentecostal church holds five services each Sunday, all of
them packed with worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also home to 125 religious sects, with everyone from
Baptists to Buddhists on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The island is divided into 11 parishes all named after a saint,
except for the parish called Christ Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, stores and businesses are closed. The radio
broadcasts almost 30 different religious programs. And, almost
everyone attends church as well as other gatherings such as gospel
concerts and prayer recitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to church, and then they go home to eat and rest,
that's all,'' said Fran Evelyn, a tour operator. ``Everything's
closed because people consider Sunday to be a day of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides religion, education also is serious stuff in Barbados,
and discipline is strongly enforced in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   If a student is bad, he or she might be paddled. Girls can't
wear makeup, flashy jewelry, or skirts above the knee. Boys can't
wear earrings or tattoos. Days begin and end with prayer. School
assemblies feature the reading of Bible passages and the telling of
stories about morality.
</P>
<P>
   Education is so highly valued here that the government spends
nearly a fifth of its budget on it every year, as is evident by the
computers that adorn most of the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, students have something to strive for because, if
grades are good, students can get a full scholarship to their
college of choice, no matter what country it is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel education should be made available free of charge to
anyone who wants it,'' said Glenroy Cumberbatch, deputy chief for
the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this island doesn't have its share of troubles.
Drug-related violence is up, and drug traffickers from South
America are increasingly using the island as a stepping-stone to
transport cocaine and heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, still, there are only nine or 10 murders here a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very law-abiding society, so much so that police do
not even carry weapons,'' said Barbados Sen. Phillip Goddard.
``Parents instill in their children the importance of God and
education at a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is a very British island, hence its nickname ``Little
England.''
</P>
<P>
   People here drink beer in pubs, watch cricket on the weekends,
drive on the left side of the road, and visit Trafalgar Square in
downtown Bridgetown, just as they do in London.
</P>
<P>
   The English settled here in 1625 and continued to rule for 339
years, until the island became independent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bajans have certainly been influenced by the British culture,
even though today we are being increasingly influenced by the
United States through television programming and that sort of
thing,'' Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the United States, life here is delightfully
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses in Barbados have no numbers, but are instead marked
only by names. For example, a house might be called something like
Comfort, or Woodlawn, or Henry's Place.
</P>
<P>
   With little crime, the newspaper's front page features stories
on things like the country's declining sheep industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do so well because our temperament is good,'' said
Barbados Attorney General David Simmons. ``We think before we speak
and don't go in for excesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Excesses that seemingly include even Big Macs and
Quarter-Pounders. So much for American influences.

ROCK GROUP EYES BLIND AMBITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Third Eye Blind lead singer Stephan Jenkins snickered
like a smart-aleck school boy who had just pulled the wool over the
principal's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dirty, filthy song,'' he told the sell-out crowd _
many of them school kids themselves _ Friday night at the Woodlands
Pavilion. ``That means that all of you must be dirty, filthy,
too!''
</P>
<P>
   The band then kicked into Third Eye Blind's breakthrough hit
``Semi-Charmed Life,'' a disjointed little tale of sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll disguised by a maddeningly catchy ``doot doot doot''
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   You get the sense that Jenkins imagines himself a rock frontman
and songwriter in the tradition of the Who, the Clash and U2 _
big-statement bands that weren't ashamed to admit their own
ambitions. And after a decade of tortured grunge rockers trying to
reconcile punk ideals with pop megastardom, Jenkins' charismatic
cockiness comes across as a refreshing contrast.
</P>
<P>
   If only he and his band could do more to justify that ambition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Semi-Charmed Life,'' Third Eye Blind's
self-titled debut album has spawned a slew of modern rock radio
hits _ ``How's It Going to Be,'' ``Graduate,'' ``Jumper.'' At a
time when modern rock is desperately seeking a new direction to
take the place of faded flannel, these songs present a commercially
palatable alternative to wimpy folk-pop on the one hand and
metallic shock-rock on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The band performed on a stage designed to resemble the
dilapidated warehouse nightclubs where Third Eye Blind came up
playing in San Francisco. The show opened with the musicians
silhouetted behind a heavy curtain, like shadows from a bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins sang one song seated in an overstuffed chair, and
another skipping around with his arms in the air. An unplugged
segment found all four members huddled together strumming acoustic
instruments. On the radio hits, the audience sang along in almost
ritualistic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While Jenkins is the group's visual focal point, guitarist Kevin
Cadogan is most responsible for Third Eye Blind's chunky
instrumental sound. Bassist Arion Salazar and drummer Brad
Hargreaves bring a semi-anonymous professionalism to the rhythm
section.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins nodded to his classic rock inspirations by tagging a
verse of the Who's ``Baba O'Reilly'' on to the end of ``How's It
Going to Be.'' He also made a sincere but lame attempt to
reinterpret Ice Cube's rap ``It Was a Good Day'' as a rock song.
The encore, introduced by Cadogan as ``the first song I ever
learned to play on guitar,'' was U2's ``I Will Follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Twenty years from now, some young guitar player might
say the same thing about Third Eye Blind's ``Semi-Charmed Life.''
But I doot-doot doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Eve 6 opened the show with a set of songs from its self-titled
debut album, including the No. 1 modern rock hit ``Inside Out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California trio was signed to a recording contract
while still in high school, with an unusual stipulation of ``no
diploma, no deal.'' Once bassist/vocalist Max Collins and guitarist
Jon Siebels graduated, they hooked up with drummer Tony Fagenson
(son of noted producer/bassist Don Was) and set to work on their
debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a charmed life; Eve 6 played with the same spirit at
the Woodlands Pavilion they might have brought a post-game backyard
beer bash, only tighter. And they did it without snickering. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Bajans, as people here like to be called,
have a sense of their own style. So much so that even McDonald's
couldn't invade the culture. The fast-food chain went bust after
just six months of operation because no one ate at the place.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is different from some other Caribbean islands in that
things just seem to work better here. The roads are good, the
phones connect, and appointments are kept. And, the island is
infested by millionaires the way some are infested by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans will tell you that their country has been blessed by God,
and this is no idle boast.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados hasn't been touched by a hurricane since 1955 and the
sun shines nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz'') are the most affluent and most
educated people in the Caribbean, and they have the highest
literacy rate _ nearly 98 percent _ in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Nations Development Program's annual ``human
development index'' that evaluates countries in terms of life
expectancy, income and education, Barbados ranks 24th, ahead of all
other Caribbean countries and even better than countries such as
Portugal, Luxembourg, and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   And if Barbados appears lacking in the vast poverty found on
other islands, it is because agriculture, commerce, and sugar cane
production provide most with work.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about their island's success, government officials
will say it's rooted in religion and a strong education system.
</P>
<P>
   The 166-square-mile island supports a population of 266,000
people and more churches than days in the year.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentecostal church holds five services each Sunday, all of
them packed with worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also home to 125 religious sects, with everyone from
Baptists to Buddhists on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The island is divided into 11 parishes all named after a saint,
except for the parish called Christ Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, stores and businesses are closed. The radio
broadcasts almost 30 different religious programs. And, almost
everyone attends church as well as other gatherings such as gospel
concerts and prayer recitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to church, and then they go home to eat and rest,
that's all,'' said Fran Evelyn, a tour operator. ``Everything's
closed because people consider Sunday to be a day of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides religion, education also is serious stuff in Barbados,
and discipline is strongly enforced in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   If a student is bad, he or she might be paddled. Girls can't
wear makeup, flashy jewelry, or skirts above the knee. Boys can't
wear earrings or tattoos. Days begin and end with prayer. School
assemblies feature the reading of Bible passages and the telling of
stories about morality.
</P>
<P>
   Education is so highly valued here that the government spends
nearly a fifth of its budget on it every year, as is evident by the
computers that adorn most of the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, students have something to strive for because, if
grades are good, students can get a full scholarship to their
college of choice, no matter what country it is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel education should be made available free of charge to
anyone who wants it,'' said Glenroy Cumberbatch, deputy chief for
the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this island doesn't have its share of troubles.
Drug-related violence is up, and drug traffickers from South
America are increasingly using the island as a stepping-stone to
transport cocaine and heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, still, there are only nine or 10 murders here a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very law-abiding society, so much so that police do
not even carry weapons,'' said Barbados Sen. Phillip Goddard.
``Parents instill in their children the importance of God and
education at a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is a very British island, hence its nickname ``Little

</P>
<P>
   People here drink beer in pubs, watch cricket on the weekends,

SURVEY SUGGESTS SAME-SEX VIOLENCE ON RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The number of domestic violence cases among
same-sex couples surged both nationwide due largely to increased
reporting of abusive situations, according to a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The second annual survey by the National Coalition of
Anti-Violence Programs also found that while community outreach and
services have improved greatly, police response to same-sex
domestic violence is sometimes misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reporting from the coalition's member organizations in
12 cities, including in San Francisco, the survey found a 41
percent increase last year in gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, reported cases surged by 67 percent from 1996
to 1997, accounting for 27 percent of all cases in the national
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attribute that not to the magnitude of the problem, but
rather, increased information and services have translated into
people in our community being willing to seek assistance for
domestic violence,'' said Greg Merrill, director of client and
advocacy services for Community United Against Violence. ``The real
change is people are coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not a big gender gap: male victims accounted for 52
percent of cases and female victims 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another conclusion of the report was that restraining orders
provide the best legal remedy to abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our clients indicate to us after they've gotten a
restraining order, the person leaves them alone because they
realize there are going to be sanctions against them if they
continue,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Restraining orders are also invaluable in summoning the police
in an emergency situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see some homophobia, but mostly what we see is an inability
(by the police) to detect who they should arrest,'' Merrill said.
``Some police officers think, if it's two men or two women, it's a
fair fight and they shouldn't get involved. Or they arrest the
bigger one or the one who is, quote unquote, the more masculine
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In one extreme case in San Francisco, officers handcuffed the
victim to his batterer and put them in the same jail cell, Merrill
said. With a restraining order, it is immediately obvious to the
police who the aggressor is, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence survey was far from scientific: it depended on
self-reporting from member organizations in 12 cities. Those
organizations serve less than 20 percent of the U.S. population.
Those groups with the largest staff and funding _ in San Francisco,
Los Angeles and New York _ reported the highest number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a review of past studies and their own experience,
victim advocates say that domestic violence is just as prevalent in
gay relationships as in straight ones. They also have seen no
difference in the frequency, severity or patterns of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But because most services are geared toward heterosexual
couples, it is difficult for male victims and female batterers to
get counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Many gays and lesbians accept the widely held belief that
domestic violence occurs only in heterosexual relationships,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, seven states exclude people in same-sex
relationships from getting restraining orders: Arizona, Montana,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Virginia, New York and Delaware.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Print is not the best medium for Jerry Seinfeld's humor. You
lose the inflections, the way he jumps from a snap to a whine, the
way he swishes a punch line around in his mouth as if at some
comedic wine-tasting.
</P>
<P>
   It's with this disclaimer that we offer what we consider to be
some of the best lines from ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,''
the new CD of the HBO show of Seinfeld's Broadway stand-up act. The
material isn't frighteningly original _ Shouldn't Seinfeld be above
airport jokes by now? _ but he always gives it a fresh, Seinfeldian
spin.

   ON COMMUNICATION: ``The thing that amuses me the most about
phone machines is how often we call people now, trying to get the
machine. That's what's happened now with the machine. The person
picks up and you're saying, `Uh ... oh ... I didn't think you would
be there. I just wanted to leave a message saying, `Sorry I missed
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ON PLASTIC SURGERY: ``Friend of mine is going in for a nose job.
... Rhinoplasty, that's what they call it. ... RHINO. Is that
necessary? Person obviously is aware there's a problem. ... Do we
really need to compare them to a rhinoceros?''
</P>
<P>
   ON WOMEN: ``I know I will never understand women. I will never
understand how you can take boiling hot wax, pour it onto your
upper thigh, rip the hair out by the root _ and still be afraid of
a spider.''
</P>
<P>
   ON MEN: ``Women want to know what men are thinking. ... I will
tell you. Nothing. (Heavy applause) We're not thinking anything.
We're just walkin' around, lookin' around. This is the only natural
inclination of man.''
</P>
<P>
   ON McDONALD'S: ``Why is McDonald's still counting? How insecure
is this company? ... What is their ultimate goal _ to have cows
surrendering voluntarily? Showing up at the door, `We'd like to
turn ourselves in, we see the sign, we realize we have very little
chance out there. We'd like to be a Happy Meal, if that's at all
possible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ON SPORTS: ``There are many things we could point to as proof
that the human being is not smart; the helmet is my personal
favorite. ... Why did we invent the helmet? Well, because we were
participating in many activities that were cracking our heads. We
looked at the situation; we chose not to avoid these activities,
but to just to make little plastic hats, so that we could continue
our head-cracking lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CLOTHING: ``I brought this guy in a suede jacket, got spots
on it because I wore it in the rain. He says, `There's nothing we
can do. Water ruins leather.' Now _ aren't cows outdoors a lot of
the time? When it rains, do the cows go up to the farmhouse, `Hey,
hey, let us in, we're all wearing leather out here! Hey, open up,
man, I'm suede!'''

HIGH-TECH JOB GROWTH SPREADS BEYOND SAN JOSE, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the San Jose area remains far and away
California's undisputed high-tech employment center, San Francisco,
Sacramento, Fresno and the Vallejo-Napa region are quickly becoming
``cybercities.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the American Electronics Association
indicates the state's high-tech industry has moved well beyond
Silicon Valley, so that it is no longer ``a geographical state but
a state of mind,'' AEA spokesman John Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the most recently available data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the report shows the San Jose metropolitan area
employed 221,000 high-tech workers in 1996, representing nearly
one-third of the 724,000 high-tech jobs in California. The average
annual wage for technology workers in Silicon Valley was $72,000,
57 percent more than wages in the private sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest metropolitan area in total high-tech
employment was Los Angeles, with 147,000 jobs and an annual wage of
$51,000; followed by 81,000 in Orange County, 53,000 in Oakland and
52,000 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was the state's largest high-tech employer in a
number of key industry segments, including consumer electronics,
defense electronics and information services, the ``California
Cybercities'' report found.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the real-time 1998 employment figures are most likely
up from the 1996 data despite recent or planned layoffs in the
semiconductor and semiconductor equipment sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in software ``are still going gangbusters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the job growth beyond Silicon Valley _ and the
positive economic ripple effect it creates in other regions _ that
is the centerpiece of the AEA report.
</P>
<P>
   Today's electronics and information technology companies have
created thousands of new jobs with rapid employment growth between
1990 and 1996 in emerging high-tech metropolitan areas. During that
period, the number of jobs were up 56 percent in Sacramento,
followed by Fresno (54 percent), Vallejo-Napa (46 percent), San
Francisco (37 percent) and Santa Cruz (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   After the San Jose/Silicon Valley average high-tech wage high of
$72,000, San Francisco was No. 2 at $66,000. The average in Santa
Cruz was $61,000, followed by $57,000 in Oakland and $55,000 in
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that high-tech employment in Northern California
totaled 377,000, just ahead of Southern California at 313,000.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that one of every four jobs in Silicon Valley is
in high tech. Statewide, there was a 12 percent increase in
high-tech jobs _ from 197,000 in 1990 to 221,300 in 1996. Average
annual wages increased 29 percent in the same period _ from $55,600
in 1990 to $71,900 in 1996.

 &HT;    HOW THE DEMOCRATS CAN WIN
 &HT;    With SENATE and SENATE-MORRIS.
 &HT;    By HALEY BARBOUR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many experts are predicting a record low turnout in
November, so these elections will be decided by who actually votes.
The Democrat strategy, therefore, will be aimed at inflaming and
turning out the liberal base Democrat vote, while secondarily
trying to convince swing votes that Republicans in Congress have
accomplished nothing because of their determination to ``get
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat message will attempt to achieve both goals
simultaneously. They will lament the impeachment process as
partisan and political, while doing everything they can to make it
as rancorous and partisan as possible. On legislation, they will
stall, complain and blame.
</P>
<P>
   The union bosses will try to turn out the Democrat base vote.
While polling shows Republican voters are more likely to turn out
than Democrats, unions will try to overcome this GOP advantage with
untold millions for phone banks, direct mail, paid organizers and
Election Day ``street money.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Big Labor will be liberal groups, ranging from trial
lawyers to radical environmentalists, from pro-abortion
associations to ethnic political organizations. The Left's goal is
to transform the disgust and disillusionment felt by Democrats
toward Clinton's conduct into anger toward Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour was chairman of the Republican Party from January
1993 to January 1997.

 &HT;    HOW THE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN
 &HT;    With SENATE and SENATE-BARBOUR.
 &HT;    By DICK MORRIS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican candidates should let the Earth move
under their feet
</P>
<P>
   without trying to help it along. The Clinton impeachment
proceedings will energize the GOP base and will provide both lift
and loft for Republican candidates all by itself. Any candidate who
tries to help it along by addressing the issue directly will look
too partisan and will seem to be exploiting a national agony for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidates should take advantage of the hidden weakness in
Clinton's armor _ the fact that he doesn't have an agenda. He has
done what he came to do, and doesn't have much left for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should wage largely positive campaigns highlighting
their own issue proposals. They should focus on how they would
address traditionally Democratic problems like education,
environment, child care, the concerns of the elderly and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy has three advantages: it co-opts Democratic
issues; it shows a positive reason to vote Republican, and it
subtly emphasizes that Clinton can't get anything passed even if he
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris was a pollster and political adviser to President
Clinton until August 1996.

 &HT;    ELECTION'S CENTERPIECE IS STRUGGLE FOR SENATE
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. With SENATE-MORRIS, SENATE-BARBOUR and SENATE-DATA.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With midterm elections less than four weeks away,
both parties are bracing for the possibility of a sharp shift of
power in the Senate, one that could determine the fate of Bill
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans gain five seats for a total of 60 senators,
Democrats would no longer be able to delay legislation with a
filibuster, or win compromises by threatening one.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gain would also leave the president little room to wiggle
out of an impeachment noose.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the GOP can raise their Senate number to 67, the
two-thirds required by the Constitution to convict an impeached
president. But a filibuster-proof Senate will embolden Republicans
_ and perhaps even Democrats who fear for the future of their party
_ to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clinton's fate rests with voters in nine battleground
states where the Senate races are ``in play'': California,
Colorado, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in each state could come down to which party gets
their supporters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic turnout tends to lag behind that of Republicans in
midterm elections. A recent Gallup poll found 73 percent of
Republicans are extremely or very likely to vote in November,
compared with 63 percent of Democrats. Other polls have had similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``can't wait to get to the voting booth to send a
message to Clinton,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster with
Public Opinion Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Clinton's sex-and-veracity scandal is putting
extra pressure on the president's party to turn out its voters.
``Democrats have to concentrate on winning the 'ground' war versus
winning the 'air' war,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster with
Garin-Hart-Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates are openly raising the scandal as a campaign
issue in the battleground states. National Journal, an influential
magazine on politics and public policy, recently found campaign
advertising in this year's election overwhelmingly oriented to
issues, not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's definitely an environment that can't hurt us,''
said Mike Russell, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee (NRSC), a party organization that provides money and
advice to GOP Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are on the line this year, most of them
held by Republicans. But Democrats are bucking historic trends that
favor the opposition party in a president's sixth year in office.
Even the popular Ronald Reagan lost eight Senate seats in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The political math in the Senate is undoubtedly in the GOP's
favor. The equation begins with 55 for the GOP. Add Republican
gains in Ohio, where popular Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican,
is leading comfortably in the race to succeed retiring Sen. John
Glenn, and in Illinois, where Democratic incumbent Carol
Moseley-Braun is badly trailing GOP right-winger Peter Fitzgerald.
Then subtract the Republican-held open seat in Indiana, where the
popular Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh is expected to take back the seat
his father, Birch Bayh, lost in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the Republicans 56 seats. If the parties hold
their seats in other states, the GOP could gain a filibuster-proof
Senate majority by winning just four of these nine close races:
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that follows could run along
with SENATE-DATA graphics material.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  California, where Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer, one of
the Senate's most liberal members, is neck-and-neck with State
Treasurer Matt Fong, a Reaganite advocate of supply-side economics
and opponent of abortion who has chided his opponent for not being
more critical of Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Colorado, where Democrat-turned-Republican Ben Nighthorse
Campbell is being challenged by former Colorado first lady Dottie
Lamm. Campbell's opposition to gun controls has become a hot issue
because of recent violence in Denver schools.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kentucky, pitting Republican Rep. Jim Bunning, a former major
league baseball star who has built a near-perfect conservative
voting record during six terms in Congress, against Democratic Rep.
Scotty Baesler, a tobacco grower and former college basketball star
with a moderate record in three terms in Congress. They are vying
for the seat of retiring four-term Democrat Wendell Ford.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nevada, where two-term Democratic incumbent Harry Reid is
being challenged by Rep. John Ensign. The mild-mannered Reid, who
tried to be a peacemaker between the administration and Western
ranchers in a fight over grazing fees, has built a
moderate-to-liberal record in the Senate. Ensign, with family ties
to the state's hotel and gambling industries, was part of the 1994
Republican class that came to power with House Speaker Newt

   &QR;  New York, where Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato is
seeking a fourth term in a mostly Democratic state. His challenger
is Charles Schumer, a nine-term House member who has been a staunch

Washington outsider.

   WASHINGTON _ Many experts are predicting a record low turnout in
November, so these elections will be decided by who actually votes.
The Democrat strategy, therefore, will be aimed at inflaming and
turning out the liberal base Democrat vote, while secondarily
trying to convince swing votes that Republicans in Congress have
accomplished nothing because of their determination to ``get
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat message will attempt to achieve both goals
simultaneously. They will lament the impeachment process as
partisan and political, while doing everything they can to make it
as rancorous and partisan as possible. On legislation, they will
stall, complain and blame.
</P>
<P>
   The union bosses will try to turn out the Democrat base vote.
While polling shows Republican voters are more likely to turn out
than Democrats, unions will try to overcome this GOP advantage with
untold millions for phone banks, direct mail, paid organizers and
Election Day ``street money.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Big Labor will be liberal groups, ranging from trial
lawyers to radical environmentalists, from pro-abortion
associations to ethnic political organizations. The Left's goal is
to transform the disgust and disillusionment felt by Democrats
toward Clinton's conduct into anger toward Republicans.

 &HT;    HOW THE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN
 &HT;    With SENATE and SENATE-BARBOUR.
 &HT;    By DICK MORRIS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican candidates should let the Earth move
under their feet
</P>
<P>
   without trying to help it along. The Clinton impeachment
proceedings will energize the GOP base and will provide both lift
and loft for Republican candidates all by itself. Any candidate who
tries to help it along by addressing the issue directly will look
too partisan and will seem to be exploiting a national agony for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidates should take advantage of the hidden weakness in
Clinton's armor _ the fact that he doesn't have an agenda. He has
done what he came to do, and doesn't have much left for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should wage largely positive campaigns highlighting
their own issue proposals. They should focus on how they would
address traditionally Democratic problems like education,
environment, child care, the concerns of the elderly and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy has three advantages: it co-opts Democratic
issues; it shows a positive reason to vote Republican, and it
subtly emphasizes that Clinton can't get anything passed even if he
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris was a pollster and political adviser to President
Clinton until August 1996.

 &HT;    ELECTION'S CENTERPIECE IS STRUGGLE FOR SENATE
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. With SENATE-MORRIS, SENATE-BARBOUR and SENATE-DATA.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With midterm elections less than four weeks away,
both parties are bracing for the possibility of a sharp shift of
power in the Senate, one that could determine the fate of Bill
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans gain five seats for a total of 60 senators,
Democrats would no longer be able to delay legislation with a
filibuster, or win compromises by threatening one.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gain would also leave the president little room to wiggle
out of an impeachment noose.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the GOP can raise their Senate number to 67, the
two-thirds required by the Constitution to convict an impeached
president. But a filibuster-proof Senate will embolden Republicans
_ and perhaps even Democrats who fear for the future of their party
_ to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clinton's fate rests with voters in nine battleground
states where the Senate races are ``in play'': California,
Colorado, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in each state could come down to which party gets
their supporters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic turnout tends to lag behind that of Republicans in
midterm elections. A recent Gallup poll found 73 percent of
Republicans are extremely or very likely to vote in November,
compared with 63 percent of Democrats. Other polls have had similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``can't wait to get to the voting booth to send a
message to Clinton,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster with
Public Opinion Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Clinton's sex-and-veracity scandal is putting
extra pressure on the president's party to turn out its voters.
``Democrats have to concentrate on winning the 'ground' war versus
winning the 'air' war,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster with
Garin-Hart-Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates are openly raising the scandal as a campaign
issue in the battleground states. National Journal, an influential
magazine on politics and public policy, recently found campaign
advertising in this year's election overwhelmingly oriented to
issues, not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's definitely an environment that can't hurt us,''
said Mike Russell, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee (NRSC), a party organization that provides money and
advice to GOP Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are on the line this year, most of them
held by Republicans. But Democrats are bucking historic trends that
favor the opposition party in a president's sixth year in office.
Even the popular Ronald Reagan lost eight Senate seats in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The political math in the Senate is undoubtedly in the GOP's
favor. The equation begins with 55 for the GOP. Add Republican
gains in Ohio, where popular Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican,
is leading comfortably in the race to succeed retiring Sen. John
Glenn, and in Illinois, where Democratic incumbent Carol
Moseley-Braun is badly trailing GOP right-winger Peter Fitzgerald.
Then subtract the Republican-held open seat in Indiana, where the
popular Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh is expected to take back the seat
his father, Birch Bayh, lost in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the Republicans 56 seats. If the parties hold
their seats in other states, the GOP could gain a filibuster-proof
Senate majority by winning just four of these nine close races:
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that follows could run along
with SENATE-DATA graphics material.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  California, where Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer, one of
the Senate's most liberal members, is neck-and-neck with State
Treasurer Matt Fong, a Reaganite advocate of supply-side economics
and opponent of abortion who has chided his opponent for not being
more critical of Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Colorado, where Democrat-turned-Republican Ben Nighthorse
Campbell is being challenged by former Colorado first lady Dottie
Lamm. Campbell's opposition to gun controls has become a hot issue
because of recent violence in Denver schools.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kentucky, pitting Republican Rep. Jim Bunning, a former major
league baseball star who has built a near-perfect conservative
voting record during six terms in Congress, against Democratic Rep.
Scotty Baesler, a tobacco grower and former college basketball star
with a moderate record in three terms in Congress. They are vying
for the seat of retiring four-term Democrat Wendell Ford.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nevada, where two-term Democratic incumbent Harry Reid is
being challenged by Rep. John Ensign. The mild-mannered Reid, who
tried to be a peacemaker between the administration and Western
ranchers in a fight over grazing fees, has built a
moderate-to-liberal record in the Senate. Ensign, with family ties
to the state's hotel and gambling industries, was part of the 1994
Republican class that came to power with House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's ``Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New York, where Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato is
seeking a fourth term in a mostly Democratic state. His challenger
is Charles Schumer, a nine-term House member who has been a staunch
critic of Gingrich and the National Rifle Association. D'Amato is
wily, a brilliant tactician and a master of New York's
tabloid-and-TV culture. But Schumer is his match at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  North Carolina, where 70-year-old Republican incumbent Lauch
Faircloth, who frequently attacked First Lady Hillary Clinton

Edwards, a telegenic political newcomer who is running as a

   LIVING-COLUMN-HAHN (Seattle) With less than three weeks to go

some daylight. But most days lately seem to end with a race between
the stock market and actual daylight, trying to see which one can
close down faster.

occasions this summer, I took a colleague's advice and stretched

   ATHLETE-TAPLIN (Seattle) Cheryl Taplin, who dominated high
school sprints in Washington while at Cleveland High School and
then won multiple All-America honors at Louisiana State, has had an
amazing summer. She's competed on three continents, earned a fair
amount of prize money and won gold medals as a member of the
winning U.S. sprint relay teams at the Goodwill Games and track's
World Cup. A career update. PHOTO.

SPRINTER DREAMS OF OLYMPCI GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ She was talking with a common-cold accent. Her nasal
passages were feeling the kind of pressure Cheryl Taplin obviously
puts on herself.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin had just returned from the IAAF World Cup in
Johannesburg, South Africa. There, she captured first place in the
women's 400-meter relay, along with that annoying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, though, was summed up with two letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Taplin said, explaining her recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that is exactly how Taplin portrayed her track career
last season. It was all right, nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run anything spectacular,'' Taplin said. ``I just
seemed to run well when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, timely hits are priceless. In basketball, timely
scores are astonishing. In the world of track and field, either you
are on time or you are not.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Taplin if she is feeling a little off at the moment. Her
best time in the 100 meters this year is 11.15 seconds. She has run
22.79 in the 200. Those times in her premier events are below the
top 10 in the world, and Taplin is taking four weeks off to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run a lot faster,'' said Taplin, a 1990 graduate of
Cleveland High School in Seattle. ``I've just got to put everything
together. I'm anxious to see what I'm going to be running next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Taplin expects vindication.
</P>
<P>
   She is a former gold-medal winner at the Goodwill Games and
track's World Cup. Taplin runs well enough to earn thousands of
dollars on the circuit and maintain Nike as her sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Taplin will try hard to run better in 1999 than she did
in 1998 for one big reason: the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to shoot for the 2000 Olympics, and so next season
will tell her a lot,'' said Donald Cufrie, Taplin's coach and
former 200 gold medalist in the 1972 Olympics. ``She has the
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Taplin even walks into Azusa Pacific University _ a
southern California school where she trains in the offseason _ she
will have worked on the essentials. When she returned to Seattle
recently, Taplin did not bring any sweat suits or sprinter's garb.
She was attempting to re-group.
</P>
<P>
   Cufrie is helping Taplin to realize that running is more a test
of mental toughness than physical skill. Even though Taplin has
qualified for the finals of nearly every meet she has run the past
summer, her confidence has been shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a mental block. I was doubting myself,
which I had never done before,'' Taplin said. ``For some reason, I
was beating myself up before I ran a race. I had to put it behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin said her ensuing workouts will be critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things she can add to her training,'' Cufrie
said. ``I am confident she will do what it takes. You never know
what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin has come a long way from when she won individual Class AA
state titles all four years at Cleveland and led the Eagles to the
team championship in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   She moved into high gear in college, helping Louisiana State to
an NCAA track and field championship in 1994. At LSU, Taplin was a
16-time All-American. Throughout her professional career, she has
ranked among the national leaders in the sprint events.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin has run with the world's best, including Marion Jones,
Gale Devers, Christie Gaines and Inga Miller _ her training
partner. Now, she believes, it is time to be placed among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived this year,'' Taplin said. ``I'm not going to put
too much pressure on myself, but I've got to mentally prepare.
(Next year) is a big year for me.''

EACH RAY COUNTS BEFORE DAYLIGHT FADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With less than three weeks to go before our return to
standard time, I'm trying desperately to save some daylight. But
most days lately seem to end with a race between the stock market
and actual daylight, trying to see which one can close down faster.
</P>
<P>
   After carping that I'd used my hammock on only three brief
occasions this summer, I took a colleague's advice and stretched
out to enjoy one of our last sunny afternoons on the back deck.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang five times in 90 minutes, and I hung the darn
hammock and the phone back on the wall. With daylight and dry
weather vanishing, the 10 gallons of deck sealer probably won't be
applied until the next clear warm day . . . next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight-saving time seems like a good idea to kids who want
summer days to last longer, and to middle-age columnists who can't
seem to read all the newspapers out on the porch swing before the
sun goes down. When I was a kid, during World War II,
daylight-saving time went all year. And some cities and states
continued to shift back and forth onto daylight-saving time in the
summer even though the railroads operated on their own clock, which
created a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time, whether 24 hours or a phase of your life,
is a matter of perspective. The rest of the world is worried about
whether their computers will make it into the next millennium. I'm
trying not to worry about making it through the La Ni &UR; gftilde &LR; na
winter.
</P>
<P>
   With the warm, dry summer, I finally have managed to grow some
ripe red tomatoes. But I barely have enough time to pick and eat
them. I would seize the day, except that most of it seems already
to have flown while I am bent down tying my shoes. And if I stop to
smell the roses, sometimes I forget where I was going.
</P>
<P>
   I was poring through Sunday's paper for the best prices on snow
tires and discovered that Gene Autry and Roddy McDowall had died.
And I wondered if there was any point in getting a 70,000-mile
warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of you, I have that ``organ donor'' thing on my
driver's license, but if they parted me out tomorrow, there
wouldn't be a whole lot anyone could use again.
</P>
<P>
   This is a state of mind, this realization that the autumn of
your life is not a long-play CD. As you get older, everything seems
to be on fast forward. Everything, that is, except you.
</P>
<P>
   By what might generously be termed the far side of middle age,
most folks should learn to take things a bit slower. And some
things actually seem better when slowed down. Of course, you know
that I am referring here to hot showers and teeth-flossing.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past several years have I truly appreciated what my
late father used to say about how a certain biological function was
a sure sign of a good day. Parents _ most usually mothers _ have a
way of bringing up certain subjects in everyday conversation as
though everyone subscribes to the importance of bran cereal and
prunes. But it's taken me this long to appreciate that my dad was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Fading daylight-saving time and creeping middle age alter your
perspective as well as affect your eyesight. Not only do street
signs and road maps become more difficult to read, but police
officers, doctors and movie stars all appear to have just graduated
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Car and real estate salesmen look incredulous when you tell them
that the vehicle they're trying to sell you costs more than your
first house, or that the house they're trying to peddle costs more
than you could pay in your lifetime. Like, who cares about that
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time to readjust the clock to standard time, I
remember the old adage about ``spring ahead and fall behind,'' and
I'm happy it's fall because I don't think I've got the oomph to
spring anywhere.

merican League Championship series. By BUSTER OLNEY CLEVELAND:
89-73, AL Central champion NEW YORK: 114-48, AL East champion
Season series: Yankees won 7 of 11
<TEXT>
<P>
   They beat Texas because of their pitching, holding the Rangers
to a .141 batting average and one run in three games. Lest there be
any doubt, David Wells established himself as one of the best
big-game pitchers in baseball with his eight shutout innings in
Game 1; he is now 5-0 in the post season. Andy Pettitte, the Game 3
starter, has rebounded - he is relying more on his sinking fastball
and his breaking ball than his cut fastball - and he seems to
benefit from following Wells in the rotation. David Cone, the Game
2 starter, must work hard to keep Kenny Lofton off base, for
holding runners is the poorest aspect of Cone's approach. The
energetic Orlando Hernndez has not pitched since Sept. 25 and
might be over-eager when he starts Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Yankees' lineup carried the attack against
Texas: Scott Brosius driving in three runs and Shane Spencer
hitting two home runs and driving in four runs, Joe Girardi
collecting three hits in seven at-bats. The first five hitters on
the Yankees' lineup generally did not produce as they usually do
(Bernie Williams seems to be having trouble handling high fastballs
once again). A scout trailing the Yankees in the last week said
Spencer is so comfortable at the plate it is only a matter of time
before a pitcher tries knocking him down.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' defense is the best in the American League, with
two question marks - Spencer is adequate in left field but
sometimes is fooled on fly balls, and time will tell if Brosius's
sprained left ankle will affect his range at third base,
particularly on bunt plays.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar is a good catcher capable of throwing out runners,
but the Yankees should be extremely active on the basepaths in this
series, trying to go from first to third or first to home. The
Cleveland infielders who relay throws, Omar Vizquel and Joey Cora,
have poor arms.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove likes bringing in left-hander
Paul Assenmacher to face Paul O'Neill in crucial situations, and
with great success in the past: O'Neill has 3 hits in 24 times
at-bat in his career against Assenmacher, with 10 strikeouts. But
left-handed batters have hit Assenmacher hard this year, batting
.313.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' rotation is deep in bodies, but nobody really knows
how good they will be until they take the mound. Bartolo Coln, the
Game 3 starter, shut down the Yankees on June 21, but he pitched
badly in the second half of the year, the opponents' batting
average jumping from .216 to .321. Jaret Wright, the Game 1
starter, can be great, but if he can't get his curveball over, he
can get ripped. Charles Nagy pitched well down the stretch to
finish 15-10, beating the Yankees in the final week of the season.
Mike Jackson is a better closer than Jos Mesa was, and more
fearless, but the Indians' left-handed set-up man, Paul
Assenmacher, has not been dominant this year, and right-handed
set-up man Paul Shuey is prone to control trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are a lot like the Yankees - a deep team with some
speed and many offensive weapons. Manny Ramirez slugged 45 home
runs, Kenny Lofton swiped 54 bases and scored 101 runs, David
Justice can hit any good pitcher on any given day and before Jim
Thome was hurt, he was a most valuable player candidate. In some
respects, however, the most prominent threats to the Yankees are
Omar Vizquel and Joey Cora, two pesky hitters who can drive the
offense if they find a way on base. The Indians are very, very good
in some spots, from the catcher Sandy Alomar to the center-fielder
Kenny Lofton, to the extraordinary hands of Vizquel at shortstop.
But second baseman Joey Cora is terrible and the right- fielder
Ramirez has the potential to be terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will be able to put pressure on the Yankees with
speed at the top and bottom of the lineup. Lofton swiped 54 bases,
and Vizquel 37, and they should challenge David Cone in Game 2 and
David Wells and Andy Pettitte from second base in Games 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians acquired the second baseman Cora because of his
great success against Yankees pitchers such as Wells (5 for 10 this
year) and Pettitte (4 for 7 this year). But Cora's defense could
kill the Indians, if he is tested. Playing him is a calculated
risk.

   SF-NORTH-BEACH (San Francisco) _ North Beach is a gentle old
Italian neighborhood that ambles up the hill from the Bay in the
shade of Telegraph Hill. Only 30 years ago the small streets were
lined with butchers who made their own sausage and its bakeries
supplied every Italian restaurant in town. But by the early '80s it
was impossible to go into any of the neighborhood places without
being bombarded by a standard lament: The neighborhood was
disappearing. Storefronts stood empty, one by one the restaurants
started to close, and even the cafes seemed sad. The people who

Cipriani he almost always has roasted halibut served with a slab of
tomato, capers and oregano. It is prepared for him alone. At the
same restaurant, Oscar de la Renta, the clothing designer, orders
riso alla valenziana every single time he comes. Never mind that it
doesn't happen to be on the menu. In fact, that may be the point,
as some restaurant observers believe: treat the royalty royally and
they will return time and again, adding a less than subtle glitz to
the restaurant's cachet. By Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unlike most of today's outdoorsmen, my dad hunted and
fished for sustenance rather than sport. As soon as we were old
enough, my brothers and I joined him in the fields and forests of
upstate New York, bringing home deer, rabbit, pheasant, partridge
and a host of other game birds.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only years later, as I trained to become a chef, that
I learned truly to appreciate the complex flavor of game. And now,
as it becomes more widely available in the market, game is becoming
more popular among home cooks who aren't living as close to the
land as I once did.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most game animals are raised on farms or in game
preserves. It's true: farm-raised game and game birds do not have
the subtlety of flavor of those taken in the wild. But they do have
some advantages: they have a more assertive flavor than more
familiar poultry, they are lean and they allow the cook to prepare
game throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the table, pheasant has a long history as the king of game
birds, notably in classic French preparations like braised pheasant
with wild mushrooms. Like all royalty, though, it requires careful
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Pheasant, particularly the breast, quickly loses moisture when
it is roasted. Instead, I like to give it a quick searing at high
heat, which seals in the juices and creates a crisp crust.
</P>
<P>
   Muted, earthy kale and cabbage make a fine complement in flavor
and texture. When they are young and tender, these hardy greens
make splendid foils for delicate game. To add a little
sophistication, I finish the dish with a subtle pan sauce of sweet
sherry and pungent shallots infused with thyme, citrus and mint.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the dish is a balance of the straightforward and the
sophisticated, delicate and hearty: humble greens and royal bird. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHEASANT BREAST WITH HARDY GREENS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 3 tablespoons shelled pistachios
</P>
<P>
   { pound fresh kale
</P>
<P>
   6 boneless pheasant breasts, with skin
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons corn oil
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 cup rich chicken stock or low-sodium canned broth
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pound savoy cabbage, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh thyme, for garnish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread pistachios on baking
sheet, and bake until slightly crisp and brown, about 5 minutes.
Set aside. Bring large pot of water to boil. Add kale, and blanch
for 10 seconds. Drain immediately, rinse with cold water, and drain
again. Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Season pheasant breasts with salt and pepper to taste. In
large saute pan over medium heat, heat corn oil, and add breasts
with skin sides down. Sear until a crisp, golden crust forms, 6 to
7 minutes. Turn, and sear the other side for 4 to 5 more minutes.
Remove breasts to warm platter, and cover lightly with foil to keep
warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Return saute pan to medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons minced
shallots and the minced thyme. Saute until shallots are softened,
about 2 minutes. Add sherry, and stir to deglaze pan. Raise heat to
medium-high, and simmer until sherry is slightly reduced, about 3
minutes. Stir in chicken stock, reduce heat to low, and simmer for
4 minutes. Whisk in 4 tablespoons butter, a tablespoon at a time,
until smooth sauce forms. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and keep
warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. In large saute pan over medium heat, melt remaining 2
tablespoons butter. Add remaining 2 tablespoons shallots, and saute
until they soften, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage, kale and salt and
pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low, and saute until greens are
wilted and well coated with butter. Add \ cup pistachios, and toss
to mix. Remove from heat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, place an equal amount of greens in center of each
of six warm dinner plates. Place pheasant breast on top of each
plate of greens. Drizzle pan sauce over pheasant and around edge of
plate. Sprinkle each plate with some of remaining pistachios. Stick
thyme sprig into each pheasant breast, and serve immediately. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

SLOW-BAKING THE LAST TOMATOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C.)   (af)  
 By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to garden-fresh tomatoes, it's annual
separation-anxiety time. Next week, maybe even this weekend, the
last of the summer's sun-ripened beauties will be gone, and we'll
be back to imports and hothouse tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Or no tomatoes: purists would argue, particularly after this
summer's lush crop, that anything other than local, seasonal
tomatoes isn't worth the bother.
</P>
<P>
   One way to say a fond, lingering goodbye to the season's
tomatoes is to slow-roast some tomato halves until they become
shrunken disks of concentrated flavor. There is a double bonus here
_ not just the celebration of flavor, but also the irresistibly
seductive perfume that fills the house.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-baked tomatoes are a classic dish in France, particularly
in Provence, where tomatoes are, if not the staff of life, then a
large part of it. But duplicating the classic technique in my New
York kitchen was not easy. When standard recipes were followed, the
tomatoes fell apart or were bitter, too chewy or too tough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated failures, it became apparent that the trick is to
get rid of the seeds (which can become bitter) and some of the
moisture before cooking the tomatoes. And keeping them warm until
serving time, a subtlety that makes a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert, the cookbook author and specialist in all things
Mediterranean, suggested salting the tomatoes to get rid of excess
water and then keeping them in the turned-off oven until mealtime.
Slow-roasted this way, the tomato halves become small bites, almost
caramelized, more sweet than acid.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve real tomatoes well into winter, homemade tomato
sauce is justifiably the time-honored way. I've always been partial
to Alice Waters' roasted-red-tomato sauce with its deep, fresh
flavor. Roasting the tomatoes first gives the finished sauce an
earthy edge you won't get otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   If you have on hand Matthew Kenney's tomato jam, a sort of North
African salsa, you're ready to conquer almost any meal. Cooked with
spices, hot pepper, garlic and honey, the tomatoes make a smooth,
thick sauce, an elegant balance of sweet, spicy and hot that
upgrades just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   At his restaurant Matthew's, on Third Avenue at 61st Street, the
jam is used as a marinade _ rubbed into chicken before it is
grilled _ and as a chutney with shrimp; it is also used as a sauce
for steamed fish. And at his cafe, Mezze, on 44th Street, it is the
key ingredient in the Moroccan spiced chicken sandwich served on
flat bread.
</P>
<P>
   You might also consider using tomato jam as a sauce for
vegetables, a spread on toasted pita, a dip mixed into cottage
cheese or _ this is a real early-morning eye-opener _ a topping on
a half bagel smeared with cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   And about those seasonal leftovers, green tomatoes. John Martin
Taylor, a cookbook author in Charleston, S.C., suggested a way of
using green tomatoes that puts a new spin on the last of the
season's crop _ the unripe ones that backyard gardeners rescue from
the vines right before the first frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't deseed them, but just cut them up in wedges, salt and
pepper them, mix them with a little olive oil and throw them in a
350-degree oven for about 30 minutes,'' said Taylor, who is known
as Hoppin' John.
</P>
<P>
   The roasted green wedges don't entirely collapse; they just melt
down into juicy wedges, soft, sweet and succulent.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is not trying to replace fried green tomatoes, a favorite
of his, which, he said, the movie helped make into a fixture on
diner menus in his neck of the woods. But anyone who tries roasted
green tomatoes may have a hard time going back to the pan-fried
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted green tomatoes are so good, in fact, that they suggest a
sequel. &QL;

   SLOW-ROASTED TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Paula Wolfert
</P>
<P>
   Time: 3{ hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 medium-size red tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   { cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Cut the tomatoes in half
horizontally. Squeeze each half gently over the sink to extract as
many seeds as possible. Salt each half liberally, turn them upside
down and drain them for 30 minutes on a cake rack set over a tray.
Squeeze gently again to get rid of any excess moisture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Using 3 tablespoons olive oil, brush a nonmetallic gratin
dish large enough to hold all the tomato halves in one layer. Add
tomatoes, cut sides up. Cook on middle level of oven for 2{ hours.
If they are cooking too fast (if the oil begins to sizzle), lower
heat to 275 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. In small bowl mix minced garlic and parsley, and add 1
tablespoon olive oil. Remove tomatoes from oven, and press equal
amounts of garlic-parsley mixture into each tomato top, pressing
down lightly with back of spoon. Drizzle remaining tablespoon of
olive oil over tomatoes, and return to oven for 20 more minutes.
Turn off heat, but let tomatoes stay in oven until serving time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

   ROASTED RED TOMATO SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Chez Panisse Vegetables'' by Alice Waters;
HarperCollins, 1996; $32.50 Time: 1{ hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ripe tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow onion, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size leek, washed, trimmed and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch basil (about \ pound)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut out a cone at stem end of
each tomato to remove core. Cut tomatoes into quarters. Spread them
in baking dish. Toss tomatoes with half the olive oil, and roast
them, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring them up several times.
The tomatoes are cooked when flesh is very soft and skin separates
easily from flesh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat remaining olive oil in stainless-steel or other
nonreactive pot. Add onion, leek, carrot and garlic, and cook over
medium heat until completely soft, about 10 minutes. Add roasted
tomatoes and herbs. Simmer, stirring frequently, to prevent
scorching, until flavors come together, 30 to 45 minutes. Pass
sauce through food mill, and adjust seasoning with salt and
pepper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat gently to use as sauce for pasta, grains or vegetables.
If refrigerated in covered container, sauce will keep for a week;
if frozen, for several months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 quart. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
PACIFIC BELL FACES UPHILL BATTLE TO ADD LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pacific Bell should not yet be entitled to offer
long-distance service because the company has made little progress
in proving it has opened its local network to competitors, state
regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released late Monday, the state Public Utilities
Commission said Pacific Bell has met only four of 14 federally
mandated requirements to become a long-distance player.
</P>
<P>
   The report is considered crucial to the company's chances of
cracking the long-distance market. The PUC gathers next month to
vote on whether to recommend Pacific Bell as a long-distance
carrier, and if it votes no, it is unlikely that the Federal
Communications Commission would approve the company's entry into
the long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   In July, after the PUC's initial review of Pacific Bell's
long-distance application, the commission stated that the company
had only satisfied three of the 14 criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (report) paints a very dismal picture of Pacific's
repeated efforts to keep out competition,'' said Charles Carbone,
telephone analyst at Utility Consumers Action Network, a watchdog
group in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Bell has said repeatedly it has opened its local
phone market to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blase, the company's regulatory vice president, issued this
statement: ``We were disappointed that the (PUC) staff report did
not reflect today's highly competitive market and the significant
progress that Pacific Bell has made to open the door to full
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has concluded that Pacific Bell has met the
following conditions established by the federal Telecommunications
Act of 1996: It has given competitors access to phone poles and
cables; has provided competitors access to groups of phone numbers;
has allowed customers to use their existing phone numbers if they
transfer service to another phone carrier; and has developed resale
contracts in which competitors can achieve sufficient rates of
return on phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC report asserts that competitors aren't going after
residential customers because Pacific Bell has made it difficult
for challengers to get access to customers, Carbone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific is proactively keeping competitors out of the
residential market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell, which is owned by SBC Communications Inc. in San
Antonio, stood by its claim that its competitors are more
interested in serving big businesses than consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, the PUC is scheduled to vote on whether Pacific Bell
should be allowed to offer long-distance service. Should the PUC
not give the company the go-ahead for long-distance service, the
company can reapply.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no regional Bell operating company has been allowed to
offer long-distance service.

   ``AMBASSADOR ANN-MARGRET.'' From W magazine. One color slide. In
``Life of the Party,'' a dishy movie premiering Oct. 12 on
Lifetime, legendary actress Ann-Margret plays the late Pamela
Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to France who became notorious for
her affairs with wealthy married men. Although Ann-Margret was the
first choice of producer Francine LeFrak for the role and looks
uncannily like Harriman in the movie, it's difficult to think of
two women less alike than the courtesan-cum-diplomat and the
actress. An interview from W magazine.

artists _ think of Yves Saint Laurent's Mondrian dress, Stephen
Sprouse's Pop Art prints and Karl Lagerfeld's Watteau collections.
Now, however, the relationship between art and fashion has been
moving into the realm of marketing. In recent years, the fashion
industry has embraced art with the fervor of Armand Hammer and the
beneficence of the Medicis. A report.

   ``AMBASSADOR ANN-MARGRET.'' From W magazine. One color slide. In
``Life of the Party,'' a dishy movie premiering Oct. 12 on
Lifetime, legendary actress Ann-Margret plays the late Pamela
Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to France who became notorious for
her affairs with wealthy married men. Although Ann-Margret was the
first choice of producer Francine LeFrak for the role and looks
uncannily like Harriman in the movie, it's difficult to think of
two women less alike than the courtesan-cum-diplomat and the
actress. An interview from W magazine.

GETTING TO KNOW THAI COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One one level, it is absurd, even insulting, to try to reduce an
entire cuisine to a few ingredients. But, in fact, so many of the
world's exciting cuisines do have signature combinations and
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, any cook presented with olive oil, lemon, parsley,
garlic and tomatoes and a few directions could well be on the way
toward a terrific Western European dish. And it will have about it
a sense of reassuring familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with many Asian dishes. Even reasonably accomplished
cooks sometimes find themselves trembling with trepidation as they
dip into Eastern cookery. But core combinations and flavors are
there just the same: with only a handful of Thai ingredients, and
most of them available in supermarkets, you can duplicate or
improve dishes found in the typical neighborhood Thai restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few ingredients that will be unfamiliar to most
American cooks, but the dishes I offer here are consistent with the
minimalist mission: even though there is very little fuss, the
results are fabulous. However, I won't pretend that they offer
anything like the true breadth of the cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, like Italy, is a country of many regional cuisines.
There are areas that feature cumin, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and
other spices we associate with India; areas where an abundance of
chilies makes the food fiercely hot, and still others that rely
heavily on fresh green peppercorns. The country's geography insures
that there is no one true Thai cuisine. So the approach I offer
here is necessarily selective, though not without its logic.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the cuisines of Paris and Rome are amalgams of the
regional cuisines of their countries, the flavors we most often
think of as belonging to Thailand are those of Bangkok. Taken from
the Bangkok perspective, and for the sake of this discussion
putting aside distinct regional differences, there are a relatively
small number of ingredients that can serve to define Thai cooking.
And there are a couple of overriding principles.
</P>
<P>
   Many Thai dishes are not unlike what we call curries, but
although they may contain curry powder, they are more often based
on a combination of herbs and aromatic vegetables rather than dried
spices. A typical dish might feature a mixture of garlic, shallots,
chilies, lime leaf, sugar and galangal (or ginger).
</P>
<P>
   This intense flavor combination features three basic flavors _
sweet, sour and salty. Chilies, which provide heat (not exactly a
flavor), are also ubiquitous, but their quantity is easily and
frequently varied according to taste.
</P>
<P>
   During my visit to Thailand last winter, several local residents
insisted that I would be wise to learn how to say ``not too hot''
in Thai, because most restaurant food is fiery. A search through my
notes finds the word ``hot'' used on almost every line.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs are used to freshen dishes, but the trinity of sweet
(usually palm sugar or coconut milk, but often ordinary sugar),
salty (in the form of nam pla, or fish sauce, and salt) and sour
(lime in several forms, and also tamarind) is all-important, and
ideally well balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a common snack that perfectly exemplifies the proclivities
of the Thai palate is sliced green mango (which is sour) dipped in
a mixture of salt, sugar and chili. Even desserts may combine all
these flavors; I was served sweet bean pancakes spiked with chilies
and a garnish of shallots and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is served at most meals; noodles, which are also popular,
are not considered indigenous. (Asked about pad Thai, the noodle
dish found in almost every Thai restaurant in America, one chef
said to me, ``That's not even Thai, it's Chinese.'')
</P>
<P>
   There is short-grain rice (which can be cooked like a long-grain
rice, using a ratio of two parts water to one part rice), but even
more popular is sticky rice, also called glutinous or sweet rice.
It is served not only with savory dishes but also as a dessert. It
is great stuff, and well worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   While the recipes here provide a sense of the basics of Thai
cooking, the principles can be reduced even further. Just cook a
basic stir-fry or stew of your choice but flavor it with garlic,
galangal or ginger, chilies, lemon grass and lime, and finish it
with nam pla.
</P>
<P>
   The dish, I promise, will be just about as legitimate as the
stuff you have been ordering from the Thai takeout place on the
corner _ and it may be a lot more satisfying, too. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEMON-GRASS-GINGER SOUP WITH MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   4 nickel-size slices ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 small hot chilies, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons nam pla (fish sauce), or to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 ounces roughly chopped oyster mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced lime leaves or lime zest
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   \ cup minced cilantro leaves. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat the stock over medium heat. Trim two of the lemon-grass
stalks of their toughest outer layers, then bruise them with the
back of a knife; cut them into sections, and add them to the stock
with the ginger and about \ of the minced chilies. Simmer for about
15 minutes, longer if you have the time. Peel all the hard layers
off the remaining stalk of lemon grass, and mince its tender inner
core.
</P>
<P>
   2. When you're ready to eat the soup, remove the lemon grass and
ginger. Add 1 tablespoon nam pla and the chopped mushrooms. Taste
the broth, and add more chilies if you like, as well as some salt
if necessary. In the bottom of each of 4 warmed bowls, sprinkle a
little each of the chile, lime leaves or zest, lime juice, cilantro
and minced lemon grass.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ladle the soup into the bowls and add a teaspoon of nam pla
to each bowl. Serve piping hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

<P>
   STEWED SPICY CHICKEN WITH LEMON GRASS AND LIME
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   { cup minced shallot
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced galangal, or ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced hot chili, or crushed red pepper flakes, or to
taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground dried coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound chicken, cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced lime leaves or zest
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons nam pla
</P>
<P>
   \ cup minced cilantro leaves. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the oil in a large, deep skillet, and turn the heat to
medium. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger and chilies, and cook,
stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender and the
mixture pasty. Add the turmeric, coriander and sugar, and cook,
stirring, for another minute. Trim the lemon-grass stalks of their
toughest outer layers, then bruise them with the back of a knife;
cut them into sections, and add them to the mixture along with 1
cup of water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the chicken, and turn it once or twice in the sauce;
then, nestle it in the sauce. Season with a little salt and pepper.
Turn the heat to low, and cover the skillet. Cook, turning once or
twice, until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Uncover the skillet, and raise the heat to medium-high; turn
the chicken skin-side down. Let most (but not all) of the liquid
evaporate, and brown the chicken just a little on the bottom. Stir
in the lime leaves and nam pla. Taste, and adjust seasoning as
necessary; then, garnish with cliantro and serve with white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Short List for Thai Ingredients &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a basic Thai pantry requires a short shopping
list, and perhaps a trip to an Asian grocer, although many of these
ingredients are also sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   CHILIES _ Typically small and very hot. Use crushed red pepper
flakes if necessary. (Wear latex gloves when handling chilies, or
wash your hands very thoroughly afterward.)
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT MILK _ Sold canned, which is most convenient (there is
even a low-fat version), but it can be made at home: Combine 1 cup
dried (unsweetened) coconut with 1 cup boiling water in a blender.
Carefully blend for about 15 seconds, then let sit for 10 minutes.
Strain and use the milk. (You can repeat the process with the same
grated coconut to make a second, thinner batch of milk if you
like.)
</P>
<P>
   GALANGAL _ A close relative of ginger, though somewhat more
pungent. Ginger is a good substitute.
</P>
<P>
   HERBS _ Cilantro, mint or basil (especially the exceptionally
fragrant Thai basil) are common garnishes. Not strictly
interchangeable, but you can cheat.
</P>
<P>
   LEMON GRASS _ Long, scallion-like stalks with irreplaceable
flavor (no cheating here). To use, peel the toughest outer layers
and bruise the stalk with the back of a knife. Or peel all the
tough layers to expose the tender inner core, and mince.
</P>
<P>
   LIME LEAVES _ Sold fresh or dried; fresh are far superior. Lime
zest may be used as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   NAM PLA _ The ubiquitous fish sauce, made from fermented fish
and salt and often used in place of all or most of the salt in a
dish.
</P>
<P>
   RICE NOODLES _ Use rice sticks, which are linguine-to-fettuccine
size, for most purposes. Cook as in the Vegetarian Rice Noodles
With Basil recipes on this page.
</P>
<P>
   STICKY RICE _ Delicious, lightly sweet rice that requires
unusual handling. To serve four, soak one and a half to two cups of
rice for an hour in water to cover. Wrap in cheesecloth (or a clean
kitchen towel) and steam over boiling water in a covered pot for
about 10 minutes, or until tender. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ Democratic leaders struggle to
maintain unity in opposition to the Republican resolution for an
impeachment inquiry. By Lizette Alvarez and Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHARGES (Washington) _ The version of Starr's report
provided by David Schipper, the Republican counsel on the House
Judiciary Committee, served one purpose: choosing charges easier to
prove than Starr's, but with potentially less gravity. By Alison
Mitchell and Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ With a deadline three days away,
Congress is moving ahead on appropriations bills. Looking at what
is in each of the unfinished measures. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHIEFOFSTAFF (Washington) _ The new White House chief of
staff is likely to be John Podesta, a wiry, wry devotee of the
X-Files and conspiracy theories who has been at the center of the
White House conspiracy alleged by Ken Starr. In turning to him
rather than to an outside heavyweight like George Mitchell, Clinton
will be picking a longtime damage-control expert with ties to the
Hill who is widely respected, if also feared, within the White
House. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CRISES (Washington) _ President Clinton is confronting a
severe global economic crisis and the worst domestic political
crisis of his career simultaneously. The world's top economic
policymakers are meeting in Washington as Congress weighs the
president's fate. So far, the American economy has not been
substantially affected by the chaos in Europe, Asia and Latin
America, and Clinton's political prospects may hinge on whether he
can construct a firewall around the domestic economy. How are the
two parallel crises affecting each other and what do the finance
ministers and central bankers have to say about Clinton's ability
to manage the two problems? By John M. Broder.

casino licensing. DeBartolo will agree to testify that he paid
$400,000 to Edwards to get the last riverboat gambling license in
the state. By Kevin Sack.

to veto any U.N. plan for military action in Kosovo. By Celestine
Bohlen.

<P>

CONTROVERSY OVER SCOPE, COST OF STARR INVESTIGATION COULD MEAN END
OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House of Representatives begins taking
action on Kenneth Starr's impeachment recommendations, the
controversy over the scope and cost of his investigation could mean
the end of the independent counsel law, at least in its present
form. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; After taking over the investigation of the president from
Robert Fiske in 1994, Starr has looked into a number of matters,
including Whitewater, the White House travel office firings,
unauthorized use of FBI files, and the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office last week estimated the total cost
of the investigation at about $40 million, second only to Lawrence
Walsh's six-year, $47.4 million review of the Iran-Contra scandal
during the Reagan administration. Starr's share of those costs was
pegged at $33.5 million through March 31 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of an independent counsel investigation almost always
means it will be expensive and time-consuming because the subjects
are such powerful and well-protected government officials,
according to several former special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that it costs a lot to investigate people
who are bound and determined to fight the investigation at every
turn,'' said Joseph diGenova, who investigated a State Department
search for Clinton's passport file before his November 1992
election. ``This is what the independent counsel law envisioned,''
he contended.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped, diGenova said, that Starr has ``been met by
one of the most massive obstructions and delay tactics I've ever
seen.'' He contended that the administration's tactics were
primarily responsible for the length of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who also faced considerable stonewalling from Reagan
officials and had to deal with the additional burden of an
investigation that dealt with highly classified information, said
Starr has not even hit ``the end of his road yet,'' in terms of
investigation costs, and will probably spend at least another $5
million or $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   He listed several challenges that cause high-priced
investigations: the independent counsel and staff must start from
scratch, as opposed to normal prosecutors who have a wealth of
files and information on their subjects; the prominence and
position of the investigation's target brings a great deal of
intense and formidable opposition; and the investigation's
directive generally requires every avenue of criminal possibility
to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost can be deceptive as well, according to Dan
Pearson, who investigated Commerce Secretary Ron Brown until his
death in a plane crash in Bosnia in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsels often use agents from other areas of the
government, such as the FBI or Internal Revenue Service. They are
paid through the special prosecutor's budget, but in the end it is
still the federal government paying their salary, Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Trout, who worked with Pearson on the Brown
investigation, had a more critical view Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the sense they've got to go down every rabbit hole
without necessarily exercising the sort of judgments prosecutors
normally routinely exercise in evaluating what leads they ought to
investigate,'' Trout said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the blame for the length and cost of the
investigation lies with Clinton or Starr, there likely will be no
Office of Independent Counsel by this time next year if
congressional sentiment remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy generated by Starr's investigation and the fact
that both parties have now seen administrations of their own under
the relentless scrutiny of independent counsels could mean that the
Ethics in Government Act, originally passed in 1978 in the wake of
the Watergate scandal, will not be renewed by Congress next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh would rather the statute be revised, with two major
changes.
</P>
<P>
   An Independent Counsel only should investigate matters related
to criminal misconduct in the course of official government duties,
and should only investigate those in the offices of the president,
vice president or attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of criminal acts prior to office, such as
Whitewater, or civil misconduct, such as the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit, should have their statute of limitations extended,
Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   That way, a president can deal with the business of the country
while in office and face prosecution once he's out, when it doesn't
matter to the functioning of the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova sees no such room in the political process for an
independent counsel, and Trout calls it ``a fourth branch of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Office of the Independent Counsel may pay an
even higher cost than its current tab of hundreds of million of
dollars for almost two-dozen investigations over the last 20
years. &QL;

MED SCHOOL DEAN IS A STAR, LIKE HER SISTER, DIANA ROSS

   &UR; (Editors: A COLOR SLIDE showing Barbara Ross-Lee with her sister,
Diana, is available.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Ross-Lee grew up in the projects of Detroit, put herself
through medical school and became the first black woman to head a
medical school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her story could serve as a blueprint for any woman trying to
balance family and career, or for anyone facing overwhelming
obstacles like poverty and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still strongly identified with her supremely
recognizable sister, pop diva Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Lee, dean of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic
Medicine, has been featured in People Magazine and USA Today. Many
will tell you she is to the world of medicine today what her
younger sister was to the world of music 30 years ago -- a bona
fide shooting star.
</P>
<P>
   And if, after her years as physician, professor and dean, the
opening line is often, ``So YOU'RE Diana Ross's sister,'' as
children the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Diana would start a new year at school and hear teachers croon,
``So YOU'RE Barbara's little sister!''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara was always seen as the brains of the family and Diana
the brawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, when teenager Diana was an aspiring singer,
the family's Detroit apartment pounded with the music of future.
Motown stars Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson crowded
around the kitchen table experimenting with the R&AMP;B sound that was
to become a part of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Barbara knew them as friends but showed little
interest in their music, ``Books were my passion,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While Diana's singing career skyrocketed, and she claimed a
place in the history of American music, Barbara pioneered in other
ways. The first in her family to attend college, Barbara constantly
forged new paths, and today -- by her very position at Ohio
University -- claims an important place in African-America womens'
history.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 1, 1942, Barbara was the oldest of six children born
to Fred Ross, a factory worker and union steward, and his wife,
Ernestine, a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to both hard work and creative financial problem
solving, Barbara held many different jobs while growing up -- from
ticket sales clerk at the Old Graystone Ballroom in Detroit and
dance instructor to microbiologist at Sealtest Dairy (which
included literally gallons of free ice cream each week for her
relatives) and mistress of ceremonies for Diana's performances with
her pre-Supremes group the Primettes.
</P>
<P>
   She always was a standout science student with a strong interest
in medical school, but didn't pursue it right after graduating from
Wayne State University in Michigan in 1965. Instead, she earned a
masters in education and began teaching junior high science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 a friend suggested that Barbara -- by then a divorcee
with two young children -- apply to Michigan State University
College of Osteopathic Medicine, a new medical school in Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, I am of an age in which women,
especially minority women, found it very difficult to be accepted
in medical schools,'' Ross-Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She was accepted and began a grueling, highly structured,
never-a-moment-to-spare, three-year campaign to become a doctor of
osteopathic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   (Osteopathy emphasizes a hands-on approach in the belief that
the muscles and bones of the body play a significant role in many
diseases. In addition to conventional tests and drugs, the
osteopathic physician's manipulative therapy may be used to correct
a wide range of physical ailments, from migraines to back strains
to Parkinson's disease.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduation and residency, Ross-Lee returned to Detroit and
for 10 years maintained a family practice in a section of the inner
city marked by poverty and a high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have many problems with violence, but there
were some tense circumstances,'' she said. ``My patients were as
protective of my clinic as I was, and they helped look out for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One great frustration, however, were the number of people who
sought her out as a physician because of her famous sibling, a
concept she finds appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go to a doctor because she was Barbra
Streisand's sister,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Diana appeared in concert in the Detroit area,
patients, friends and even strangers would jam the phone lines to
Barbara's medical office trying to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most painful episodes for Barbara happened in a
hospital elevator when her mother was undergoing treatment for the
breast cancer that claimed her life in 1984. Diana was sobbing in
her sister's arms over the impending death of their mother when the
elevator operator touched her on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, aren't you Diana Ross? Could I have an autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Barbara began teaching family medicine at MSU-COM,
eventually becoming chairwoman of the Department of Family Medicine
and associate dean for health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   She has also completed a fellowship in nuclear medicine, is a
commissioned captain in the U.S. Naval Reserves and -- for good
measure -- was the first osteopathic physician to participate in
the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, where
she worked as a legislative assistant to former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   As his legislative assistant for health policy, she was the lead
person representing him in the areas of women's issues, women and
children, immunizations, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse,
senior citizens and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   From her office in the rolling hills of Athens, Ohio, Ross-Lee
promotes an agenda to maintain excellence in education at her
school, to improve healthcare for isolated populations in her
region of the state and -- most ambitiously -- to strengthen
osteopathic medicine's role in the national conversation regarding
primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that we could
easily serve as the model for primary-care education for the rest
of the country,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically called ``America's other doctors,'' osteopathic
physicians make up only about 5 percent of U.S. physicians (about
35,000 compared to more than 600,000 allopathic (conventional)
medical doctors).
</P>
<P>
   These doctors are considered the more hands-on cousins of M.D.s,
providing badly needed primary care family practices and
demonstrating dedication to preventive healthcare and service to
poorer populations.
</P>
<P>
   What they DON'T have is the clout, wealth and political power of
the American Medical Association. Ross-Lee -- with her own
history-making achievements and her sister's
internationally-recognized name -- may be uniquely positioned to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being dean of a medical school is of no consequence unless I
can make the way better for those who will follow ... those who
must follow me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was not always a medical school dean. Before this, I was
a medical educator. Before that, I was a family physician
practicing in the inner-city of Detroit. Before that, I was a
grade-school teacher in the inner-city of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before that, I was poor and living in the housing projects
of Detroit.''

TAKE THE YANKEES, JERSEY: DOM'S HAS MOVED TO SOHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
By FLORENCE FABRICANT  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The creaky wooden floors and the array of sausages
and salamis hanging over the meat counter make Dom's look as if it
had been in SoHo for 100 years. But the store, one of the few
places in New York that make their own cured meat products, is a
newcomer, having moved from Union City, N.J., to 202 Lafayette
Street (Broome Street) earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Neapolitan-style sopressata, the meaty little cacciatorini
(available plain or marinated in olive oil) and the Genoa-style
salami are especially good. The salamis, available sweet and hot,
are mildly salted and very meaty.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential to slice them _ or have them sliced _ paper thin
or they will be chewy. There is also an excellent cotechino garlic
sausage to stew with lentils. The sausage products are mostly $6.99
to $10.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, non-Italian sausages including boudin,
merguez and chorizo will be available. The store also sells meats:
leg of lamb is $4.99 a pound, short ribs of beef are $2.99 a pound
and Black Angus strip loin steaks are $7.99 a pound. The store
carries produce as well, along with cheeses, breads, some seafood
and packaged Italian products. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), has
expanded and for the first time is selling fresh meat and seafood
in a sparkling new tiled area. In addition to run-of-the-steer
steaks, the meat department carries buffalo strip steaks, $23.99 a
pound; Argentine beef fillets, $13.99 a pound, and, soon, Kobe
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Salpietro, the manager of the seafood department, says he
plans to concentrate on European varieties like whole branzino,
$9.99 a pound, and Italian scampi, $25 a pound. Norwegian salmon
fillets will be $13.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the store have been reorganized, allowing for a
larger cheese department near the front and a produce section that
is 50 percent bigger and has more organic items. More checkout
counters now line the 71st Street side.
</P>
<P>
   The prepared food area has also been dressed up. The smoked fish
counter is larger, and among the unusual items it now carries are
big fresh duck eggs, 99 cents each. And there will be an espresso
bar for a snack on the spot, just to the left of the entrance. &QL;

   Dinner tables in American homes are being set with glasses for
wine or beer at a slowly increasing rate. Eating Patterns in
America, an annual survey conducted by the NPD Group, a market
research company in Port Washington, N.Y., showed that for the
first time, alcoholic beverages, primarily wine and beer, were
served with dinner slightly more often than coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol was served in 3.5 percent of homes, barely inching ahead
of coffee, at 3.4 percent. In 1990, alcohol was on the table in 2.5
percent of homes surveyed, and coffee in 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Balzer, a vice president of the company, predicted that
alcohol consumption at dinner would keep rising because of
publicity about the health benefits of moderate alcohol
consumption. People 45 and older are the ones drinking more, with
17 percent of them consuming alcohol with dinner at least once in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on diaries kept for two weeks in 2,000 homes
nationwide, lasted a year, ending in February 1998. &QL;

   Maurice Bonte's pastry shop has been a delicious destination on
the Upper East Side for 25 years. But the lease for the shop, at
1316 Third Avenue (75th Street), expires this month. Bonte said
that the landlord wanted to increase his annual rent from $87,000
to $145,000, and that he had offered $144,000 but had heard nothing
back. The building's owner, Jaminco Management of Glen Rock, N.J.,
refused to comment. Bonte said he was determined to stay open at
least until the year-end holidays. &QL;

NFL MATH RELIES HEAVILY ON DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A recommendation on checking the NFL standings:
Don't undertake this activity without the help of Dramamine. You're
bound to get a little dizzy when you see ``New Orleans _ 3-1'' in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers are sharing the top spot in the NFC West
with the New Orleans Saints. The Atlanta Falcons are up there, too.
Things are getting cramped, and the Niners have to be wondering
what happened to the league's zoning laws. Or the loitering
statutes, which might be more applicable.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners should be able to shoo the Saints away this weekend,
when the two co-leaders meet in the Superdome. But could it be that
the Saints really belong where they are, that in the NFL of 1998,
they're above the pitiful average?
</P>
<P>
   There are crazier truths out there. Consider some of Sunday's
winners at quarterback: Bubby Brister, Donald Hollas and Jason
Garrett, in place of John Elway, Jeff George and Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make your eyes cross and then you turn on the
television Monday night, and there's Randall Cunningham, the
Minnesota Vikings' cryogenically preserved backup, frolicking at
Lambeau Field, having his name held up alongside Joe Montana's.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Two things, only one of which is
guaranteed to hold up. Minnesota is really, really good (no
guarantee). The NFC East really, really isn't (or your money back).
</P>
<P>
   While the Saints are sneaking into a gated community, the entire
NFC East, once the province of kings, has become a slum.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the Cowboys, Giants and Washington Redskins were
handing off Super Bowl appearances every year, as if the whole NFC
race were their own relay? When they wore one another out and
elevated one another at the same time? When only the Cardinals were
a breather, because they also had to get past a tough Philadelphia
team with a young nimble quarterback named Cunningham who was
supposed to be the next great one, maybe the new Montana, but it
never worked out?
</P>
<P>
   Well, now here's what it's all come to: The Dallas Cowboys lead
the division because somebody has to be in first place. How did
Garrett win on Sunday? He faced Washington and the esteemed
signal-caller Trent Green, who is cheating destiny by not toting a
clipboard. And he faced coach Norv Turner, who is cheating destiny
by not working for someone else. Neither he nor the Bears' Dave
Wannstedt should ever have left his job as Jimmy Johnson's
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Denver Broncos
could afford to shelve a battered John Elway and start Brister,
plus let Terrell Davis cool his smoking feet after just one half.
They still beat the winless Eagles by almost four touchdowns,
42-16.
</P>
<P>
   Hollas' victim was the Arizona Cardinals, whose last-minute
clock management rivaled that of the folks overseeing the 1972
Olympic basketball final between the Soviets and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But this was probably destiny. The Oakland Raiders, you see, own
the NFC East. All three of their wins have come against that
division (Giants, Cowboys, Cardinals.) They still have Washington
on the schedule, which assures Oakland of matching last year's four
wins. Given that the Indianapolis Colts head to Oakland this
weekend, it's a reasonable bet that the Raiders will top their 1997
win total.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity that they can't simply switch divisions. Theirs,
once again, is a minefield. If Denver can dominate without Brister,
and if Kansas City can beat a good Seattle team behind Rich Gannon,
who keeps turning up behind center the way your mother's leftover
casserole used to pop up on the dinner table ... well, then either
the AFC West is brimming with talent or every starting quarterback
in the league needs to take a pay cut because the job just isn't
that important.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that division is simple and true to form. Its NFC
counterpart is confounding, living in an altered state. A few more
games could sort everything out, returning the division to its
natural order, with the Niners looking down at everyone, or more
devastatingly, just dismissing them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Niners' 26-21 loss in Buffalo will linger in the air for
a while. It was impossible to watch that game, with its
league-record-tying 22 penalties, and not wonder: Who are these
guys?
</P>
<P>
   It was also impossible not to think later on: If they can play
that badly, historically so _ if they can give away 178 yards in
penalties, if the offense can been so unstable that Steve Young
lined up behind a guard on one play, threw a shovel pass that
looked like a jump ball on another and capped it all off with a
throw that hit a member of the Bills' secondary in the back _ if
they can do all of that and still almost win the game, then what
would they have done to the Bills on a good day?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a lot of that depends on how good or bad the Bills
really are. Either way, the 49ers may end up being grateful to
them, for exposing every weakness, for introducing them to a
passionate Great Lakes audience a month before their game in Green
Bay and for not smacking Steve Young's head against the artificial
turf any more than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith showed the 49ers a lot on Sunday, roaring off the
defensive line and past the underwhelming Jamie Brown. But even as
he displayed his moves, Smith revealed his class. He had a couple
of clear shots at the quarterback, but he never went for the
maiming blow. A dirtier player would have seen a chance to end
Young's season and taken it.
</P>
<P>
   But the quarterback stayed healthy and now he is preparing to
play on Sunday, his 37th birthday. He will play the Saints, the 3-1
Saints, division-leading New Orleans _ and isn't that enough to
make us all think we're seeing stars?

LAWMAKERS PROD SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP LESSONS ON IRISH POTATO FAMINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Concerned that New York public schools were
ignoring a mandate to teach the Irish potato famine as a human
rights issue, legislators have ordered the state Education
Department to develop a curriculum for teachers to use.
</P>
<P>
   The order comes in the wake of a controversial amendment in 1996
that added instruction about the famine to a law requiring courses
examining genocide, slavery and the Holocaust. Critics said such a
mandate would politicize the issue by blaming the English for
intentionally causing the crop failure.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the legislation believe educators are dragging
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the legislation, there had been no discernible change in
what was being taught,'' said Joseph Crowley, the Queens Democrat
who was a prime sponsor of the measure. ``We were meeting with some
opposition from the state Education Department, inasmuch as they
believed they were in compliance with the law by simply developing
and issuing to school districts a bibliography of materials
concerning the famine.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the academic establishment was using a loophole in
the legislation to evade the spirit of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lo and behold, we had mandated something for which there was
no curriculum to be disseminated,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dolan, chairman of the board of trustees of the Irish
American Heritage Museum, said it was more than an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to avoid it ever happening is don't fund it,''
said Dolan, who was present when the mandate was signed.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy the situation, Crowley and supporters met with
legislative leaders and Gov. George Pataki and secured a quiet
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks of this spring's legislative session, with
little notice and no debate, Pataki added $200,000 to develop study
guidelines and resource materials.
</P>
<P>
   George Gregory, supervising the project for the Education
Department, said his team has solicited proposals from academic
institutions and groups like the Irish American Heritage Museum.
The award will go to a group of institutions that must complete its
work by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed curriculum will be reviewed for accuracy and
fairness by an advisory committee of scholars whose precise
composition has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Their focus is a period between 1845 and 1850 during which more
than 1 million people died in Ireland and 2.5 million plus were
forced to flee, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley contends that old textbooks give the subject scant
attention, or treat it simply as a natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It's Crowley's view that the English government was responsible
_ at the least through neglect, at worst through food-export
policies aimed at decimating the Irish population.
</P>
<P>
   Others describe the events as an unavoidable result of a potato
blight that afflicted other populations in Europe and which Britain
tried to alleviate with foreign grain purchases only to run into
distribution and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many historical perspectives, and I'm not a
historian. I have my own personal views on it,'' Crowley said.
``That's not the issue. The issue is what was being taught was
lacking. And it had a significant impact historically on the state
of New York because an overwhelming majority of those people who
were forced to leave that country came to this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory said the Legislature's action has been helpful and
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have surveyed their constituency and determined there is
a need,'' Gregory said. ``They teach about the Holocaust. They
teach about slavery. This is another case study that students can
learn about in the area of human rights.''

ON THE INTERNET, ADVICE CAN BE SLOW IN COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By S.A. BELZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In theory, the Internet should be a first-rate place to get
answers to urgent cooking or nutrition questions. But is it? The
following question was sent to four Web sites that invite questions
for their resident authorities:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bake an apple pie for the holidays. Which apples
will stay crispest and juiciest through the baking? Do I have to
prepare the apples in any way, by cooking them first, for
instance?''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Goldman at Baker Boulanger (www.betterbaking.com) wrote
back by e-mail within a couple of hours: ``I always use a
combination of apples. Yellow delicious keep their shape (but
little flavor). McIntosh and Cortland (mushier but great flavor).
Granny Smith (stays crisp). Never liked Granny Smith for baking at
all, but everyone swears by them. Mostly yellow delicious and
anything sweet and tart.'' Her advice on preparation was simply
``core, peel and slice,'' no cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To ask a question at Ms. Goldman's site, click on RSVP (``You
ask, we answer''). A search of previous questions she was asked
will probably bring a list of recipes to the screen. Search for
``strudel,'' for instance, and the tempting recipe choices include
Romanian strudel made with Turkish delight and a ``mile high''
apple-and-raisin strudel cake for Thanksgiving dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.,
participates in www.digitalchef.com. To ask questions, click on Ask
Digital Chef. Karen (just Karen) responded after two business days:
``I've always found that Granny Smith apples are the best to use
for baking. They keep their shape, don't get mushy and have great
sweet and tart flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be a site for questions you couldn't ask a friend
without risk of humiliation. For instance: ``What is a `solimmier'?
I don't know if I'm spelling it correctly.'' The chef was very
understanding in explaining what a sommelier is.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two weeks, Tina Ujlaki, the food editor of Food &AMP;
Wine Magazine(www.foodwinemag.com), answered on the site: ``The
best apples to use in making pies, if you can find them, are some
less common firm varieties that hold their shape when baked.'' For
example, Arkansas Black, Braeburn, Cox's Orange Pippin, Jonathan,
Northern Spy and Rhode Island Greening. If those aren't at your
market, she will allow Golden Delicious or Granny Smiths, and Romes
before McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, advises peel, core and slice and adds these tips:
``Tossing the just-sliced apples with fresh lemon juice will
inhibit browning. Many bakers add sugar and spices for flavor and a
little flour as well to thicken the juices as the pie cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   From www.iVillage.com, which calls itself ``The Women's
Network,'' an acknowledgment that the question was received came
almost immediately by e-mail (with an invitation to join
iVillage.com). But nearly two weeks later the answer had still not
followed either by e-mail or at the site. Three experts on food and
nutrition are said to be there waiting to help. (Click on Experts
Center and then Food.)
</P>
<P>
   The best advice, then, on food advice from the Internet (except
perhaps for Ms. Goldman's site) is: Don't preheat the oven while
waiting for an answer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Need to spell creme froide de concombres, creme bavaroise or
creme patissiere?
</P>
<P>
   You do if you write menus or edit cookbooks and the food pages
of newspapers or magazines. Arno Schmidt, a former Waldorf-Astoria
executive chef (who has a computer programmer son), offers help
with Menuspell, a diskette containing 26,000 menu terms. They are
broken into 10 categories, like French, German, English, Bordeaux,
Burgundy and beer.
</P>
<P>
   The diskette is in the bookstores of Johnson &AMP; Wales University
and the Culinary Institute of America (on whose board Schmidt is an
emeritus member). ``Chefs love it,'' Schmidt said, not
surprisingly. But whether or not editors will is another question.
</P>
<P>
   Spot checking shows that the lists are not uniformly
alphabetized internally; for instance, the list of agnello (lamb)
dishes in the Italian section. This may not be crucial because it
is best to use a search or find command and give a reliable
fragment (like ``bav'' to find bavaroise), rather than, say, to
scroll and scroll.
</P>
<P>
   An editor will search in vain for kabocha, delicata and turban
squash. But care has been taken here (for example, the foreign
terms on the English list have accents). Editors should find
Menuspell, despite some inconsistencies, a useful supplement to
their shelf of reference books.
</P>
<P>
   The diskette comes in MS Word and Macintosh versions and costs
$54.95, plus $3.50 for shipping, from (800) 787-1455. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Motch got into steady brownie baking when her very good
friend developed a sweeter and sweeter tooth during a course of
chemotherapy. Now, she is baking brownies to order in her kitchen,
selling them on the Web at www.salliesbrownies.com and giving part
of the proceeds to a dozen good causes.
</P>
<P>
   She offers 10 varieties, from chocolate fudge to bittersweet
cherry kirsch. Ms. Motch uses Ghirardelli chocolate, Madagascar
vanilla, fresh eggs and butter and no preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   For a product uninterested in a shelf life, that means
indulgence must be swift and decisive. Which isn't difficult: the
chocolate fudge brownie is richly chocolaty without being cloyingly
sweet. (Yes, refrigeration is possible.)
</P>
<P>
   Each two-pound, 8-by-8-inch pan of uncut homemade brownies costs
$20, excluding shipping, with $1 going to a Hudson Valley, wildlife
or animal-care organization (the buyer chooses from a list on the
Web site, and the choices change four times a year). Design your
own brownie and Ms. Motch will bake it for you for $35, with $5
going to a nonprofit organization.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Michael Eisner, the chairman of Disney, goes to
La Grenouille, he doesn't look at the menu. Doesn't have to. The
chef, Daniel Orr, designs a meal for him that is, unlike almost
everything else on the menu, fat free.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon, dines at Harry
Cipriani, he almost always has roasted halibut served with a slab
of tomato, capers and oregano. It is prepared for him alone.
</P>
<P>
   At the same restaurant, Oscar de la Renta, the clothing
designer, orders riso alla valenziana, a rice dish with saffron and
shrimp, every single time. Never mind that it doesn't happen to be
on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that may be the point, as some restaurant observers
believe: Treat the royalty royally and they will return time and
again, adding a less than subtle glitz to the restaurant's cachet.
Just think of Le Cirque 2000, which often feels like a celebrity
cafeteria. The Maccioni family learned this trick long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, food isn't everything. Some affluent diners
apparently go to a restaurant more to soak up the ambiance _ or
perhaps for the sake of their guests _ than for their own gustatory
needs: One publisher, for instance, has been known to have a lunch
at the Four Seasons that consisted of a plain baked potato and
nothing else. It might well be the most expensive baked potato in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   That off-the-menu request is not a phenomenon either welcomed or
admired by some chefs _ who, of course, pride themselves on their
carefully designed menus _ or by some customers, who find it
boorish. Daniel Boulud, for instance, is responsive to the unusual
requests of his true regulars _ the people who, he says, treat his
restaurant like an extension of home. (He has even made what he
calls a ``golf club salad'' filled with raw vegetables for a couple
who come every week.)
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't tolerate such requests from newcomers. ``We don't
want to build a relationship with a customer who doesn't appreciate
our food in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs are even less tolerant. ``People don't come
to Savoy so we can be their personal caterer,'' said Peter Hoffman,
the owner of the SoHo restaurant. ``We don't promote that, and our
customers aren't those kinds of people. They're not the finicky,
limited palate kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Blass, the designer, who admits to making modest
off-the-menu requests, finds that the increasing desire for
pampering by some diners can reach the point where it's offensive
and pretentious. ``You're in the hands of people who know what
they're doing,'' he said. ``You put yourself in their hands.
Otherwise stay home and boil an egg.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when you enter a restaurant of any reputation
these days, it's a pretty good bet that some of the diners aren't
eating anything you've learned about from the menu or the waiter.
Michael Batterberry, a food historian and the editor of Food Arts
magazine, said that today's special treatment in restaurants is
rooted in practices of the past, when to bring in business, chefs
would create and name dishes for a celebrity. Peach Melba, for
instance, was named for Nellie Melba, the legendary soprano, and so
was Melba toast. Now it's individual treatment that does the trick
_ or maybe we just have too many celebrities today for the name
game.
</P>
<P>
   Fame isn't a prerequisite for privilege. Just establish yourself
as a regular.
</P>
<P>
   If you do so at Montrachet, the restaurant will add your name to
a file listing foods you like and dislike. ``For instance,'' said
Eric Rota, the maitre d'hotel there: ``Mrs. Simon is coming
tomorrow, and we know she loves lobster. So we will send her an
hors d'oeuvre of lobster.''
</P>
<P>
   To speed up acceptance, it may be a good idea to say the word
``truffles'' or ``foie gras'' every time your waiter passes to make
sure it sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of dishes are kept on hand only for these regulars. Like
the Basque lobster salad at Gertrude's. So many regular customers
have asked for it since it was taken off the menu that the chef now
keeps poached lobsters in the refrigerator. (As a new customer
though, I ran into determined resistance and discovered I had to be
extremely insistent with the waiter to get it.)
</P>
<P>
   At Manducatis in Long Island City, Queens, regular customers
know to ask for the pappardelle alla nonna, a hearty dish of pasta
with cannellini beans and tomato. But dining off the menu at the
restaurant goes beyond asking for specific dishes. ``We have a lot
of what we call suggestion people,'' said Anthony Cerbone, the
manager. ``They don't even look at the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   La Grenouille, which has been open for 36 years, has built up a
hefty repertory of classics. Though many of the Careme-style dishes
are down and have been discreetly removed from the menu, they are
not yet out. Longtime customers still hanker for roasted oysters
with champagne sauce, poularde pochee, a poached chicken served
with horseradish and vegetables, and even calves' brains. So Orr,
the chef, makes sure they get them.
</P>
<P>
   Some requests are not so lofty.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Green, a voice-over specialist and regular at Chianti, worked
over the waiters and the chef at the restaurant so much, that they
now keep a container of ``Eddie's dressing'' in the refrigerator at
all times _ a honey mustard concoction that is used just for his
salads. It's official: Green has gained a toehold into the world of
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Benjamin Jr., a portfolio manager at a New York investment
bank, who dines frequently at Oceana, has his own way of finagling
dishes not on the menu. ``First of all, you have to be real low
key,'' he said. ``You have to ask in a very subtle way with a
smile. Tell them the restaurant is the best and that this is the
only place you can get it. You have to make them feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   He is sure it helps to ask someone at the management or
ownership level. ``If you get an ordinary waiter or waitress, let
me tell you, what do they have to gain?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has worked for him. The cooks at Oceana serve
Benjamin his beloved salmonburgers, which are not on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only make them for me,'' he said. ``I'm the king.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It takes some clout, or some nerve, to ask for a dish not on the
menu, which is why most New York restaurantgoers will never eat the
roasted oysters with Champagne sauce at La Grenouille (an old-time
classic). Or the pappardelle with white beans and tomato at
Manducatis (you have to know about it to ask for it). Or the Basque
lobster salad at Gertrude's (a favorite with the regulars).
</P>
<P>
   But you can make them all at home, no request required.
</P>
<P>
   LOBSTER SALAD BASQUE STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Gertrude's
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   16 quail eggs
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt or kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 lobsters, about 1 pound each
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons duck fat, or butter
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Bayonne ham, cut in strips 1/4 inch thick by 1/4 inch
wide
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers, halved, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 green bell peppers, halved, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 Spanish onion, halved and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Spanish piments d'espelettes powder (see note) or 1
teaspoon minced fresh jalapeno pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sherry wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 handfuls mesclun greens
</P>
<P>
   4 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   1. Fill a medium pan with water, and bring to a boil. Add the
quail eggs, and simmer for 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a
bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. When cool, peel. Cover, and
refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add about 2
teaspoons of salt. Add lobsters, and cook for 12 minutes. Remove
from water, and allow to cool completely. Pull off the tails, and
remove the meat from the shells; reserve the remainder of the
lobster for another use. Cover, and refrigerate the meat from the
tails until needed.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stew the peppers. In a large saute pan over medium-low heat,
heat the duck fat, and add the ham. Saute until lightly browned, 3
to 4 minutes. Add red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion and
garlic, and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add
tomatoes and thyme. Cover, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring at
times. Add water if needed; there should be a few tablespoons of
liquid. Add piments d'espelettes powder or jalapeno, and salt and
pepper. Saute for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Allow to cool
completely, then cover, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   4. For the dressing, combine 2 tablespoons of pepper stewing
liquid, tomato paste, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Slowly whisk in oil. In a large bowl, combine mesclun greens and
basil. Add 2 tablespoons of dressing, and toss to coat the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of stewed peppers in
the center of each of four plates. Lean a lobster tail on the
peppers, and spoon remaining dressing on the meat. Place a handful
of greens closely around and partly on the lobster. Place 4 quail
eggs on the outer edges of the plate, and drizzle the remaining
dressing around the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   ROASTED MALPECQUE OYSTERS WITH CHAMPAGNE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from La Grenouille
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt
</P>
<P>
   2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, very thinly
sliced
</P>
<P>
   24 Malpecque or other meaty oysters, scrubbed well
</P>
<P>
   4 shallots, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 black peppercorns, crushed
</P>
<P>
   6 mushrooms, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brut Champagne or sparkling wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fish stock or clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt
and the leeks. Blanch the leeks until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Drain, then rinse with very cold water, then drain again. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Open the oysters, and remove them from their shells,
reserving all their liquid. Set aside the bottom cuplike portion of
each shell, and discard the flat top.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make the sauce, combine the oysters and their liquid in a
medium saute pan. Place over medium-high heat until the edges of
the oysters begin to curl, 1 to 2 minutes; do not overcook. Using a
slotted spoon, transfer the oysters to a small bowl. Continue to
cook the oyster liquid until it has been reduced to 1 or 2
tablespoons. Remove the liquid from the heat, and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a medium saucepan, combine shallots, garlic, peppercorns,
mushrooms, thyme, bay leaf, Champagne, fish stock and reduced
oyster liquid. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until reduced and
thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 15 or 20 minutes. Add
the cream, and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer
until the sauce is again reduced by half, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Pour the sauce through a fine strainer into a bowl; discard
the solids. Add lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Place
the egg yolks in a medium bowl. While whisking vigorously, add
about 1/2 cup of the sauce to the yolks. Pour the yolk mixture back
into the bowl of sauce, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   6. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Place oyster shells on a cookie
sheet, and place one oyster in each shell. Divide the leeks equally
over the oysters, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide
the sauce equally among the shells, pouring it over the leeks.
Roast the oysters until hot and browned on top, 8 to 10 minutes. If
the oysters are hot but not browned, they may be placed under a hot
broiler for 1 minute. Serve six oysters to a person on oyster
plates or on flat plates, using seaweed, rock salt or watercress to
steady them.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 ripe tomatoes, cut into quarters
</P>
<P>
   5 large basil leaves, torn into large pieces
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound pappardelle
</P>
<P>
   Crushed red pepper flakes.
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse the beans, and place in a large bowl with 6 cups of
water. Soak them overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain the beans, place in a large pot, and cover with 6 cups
of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat,
and simmer until tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Drain, and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. In a
large saute pan over medium-low heat, combine oil and garlic. Saute
the garlic until golden but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add
tomatoes and basil, reduce heat to low, and saute until the
tomatoes are slightly softened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the
beans, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Remove from heat, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente, about 8 to 11
minutes. Drain well. Add the bean mixture to the pasta, and toss to
combine well. Season to taste with salt, pepper and crushed red
pepper. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

   1 pound medium shrimp, shelled, deveined and cut in half
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup canned crushed tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of powdered saffron
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat a broiler with a rack 3 inches from the heating element.
Place the pepper halves, cut side down, on a baking sheet, and
broil until the entire pepper surface is blackened. Put the pepper
into a small paper bag, and fold the top to seal. Leave the peppers

</P>
<P>
   3. In a large casserole or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the
butter. Add onion, and saute until the surface is slightly softened
but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add rice, and stir for about 2
minutes. Add the simmering broth, and salt to taste. Raise the heat
to bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Cover the pan with a
sheet of foil, and top with the lid. Place in the oven, and bake
for 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. While the rice is baking, place a large saute pan over medium
heat, and add olive oil. Add garlic, saute for 30 seconds, then
remove and discard it. Add mushrooms, and saute until they are
lightly browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add
shrimp and reserved red bell pepper. Saute to sear the shrimp,
about 2 minutes. Stir in parsley. Add brandy, and carefully light
with a match. Swirl the pan until the flames die out. Add crushed
tomatoes, curry, saffron, cayenne and black pepper to taste. Season
to taste with salt. Saute for 1 minute more.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add the mushroom mixture to the pan of baked rice, and toss
to combine well. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eighty years ago, when Richard Colburn was growing
up on a farm in what was then still the sleepy seaside town of San
Diego, his mother surprised him on his seventh birthday with a
violin case and a bow and took him to have his first lesson. It was
given by a neighbor who advertised ``instruction in violin, piano,
banjo, guitar, mandolin and something else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as I know and remember, I never expressed any interest
in taking music lessons at all, let alone the violin,'' Colburn
recalled the other day, eyes twinkling from between the pink
crinkles of his cheery face. ``But she thought every person should
be exposed to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Colburn's insistence paid off, and not just because her son
switched instruments to become a middling amateur violist, who
still takes a month each year to play chamber music, sometimes in
the company of the world's best artists. He also became a
demi-billionaire businessman who for the last 18 years has been the
principal patron of a respected music education program for young
people here.
</P>
<P>
   Now Colburn's lifelong passion has taken on far grander
proportions. Sunday, the new $28 million home of the Colburn School
of Performing Arts, which he financed, will be officially dedicated
on a site a block from the Los Angeles Music Center and across the
street from the future home of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Since
midsummer, the new building has been used by nearly 1,000
after-school and summertime students from age 2{ to adults, mostly
in music but also in dance and drama.
</P>
<P>
   The building, designed by the New York and Los Angeles firm of
Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, has a facade of Roman brick
dominated by the giant sloping zinc-shingled roof of the 416-seat
concert hall. But even as its new home opens, school officials are
putting the final touches on a plan to use $150 million of
Colburn's money to expand it by adding a four-year, tuition-free
college-level conservatory for 120 to 140 students. The project is
aimed at rounding out a local ``cultural corridor'' and rivaling
established national institutions like the Juilliard School in New
York and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the primary pre-college experiences in California
for music,'' said Juilliard president Joseph Polisi, referring to
the existing program. The expansion will have a substantial
national impact, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, any institution that plans to do what Colburn
says he wants to do will be great for the serious music environment
in this country,'' said Polisi, who years ago as a student
bassoonist at Yale played in a chamber concert at Colburn's house
in Beverly Hills. ``Sure, there's competition for the very best
talent. But even more important, if we can get institutions of high
quality, that's a plus for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Polisi noted, conservatories like Juilliard and
Curtis have been started by wealthy individuals, but Colburn
officials could point to only one other _ the Harid Conservatory in
Boca Raton, Fla. _ that has been founded in the last 50 years. They
are well aware of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to reinvent the wheel, but to learn from the
mistakes of the past and incorporate the best,'' said Joseph J.
Thayer, a French-horn player who has been the dean of the 65-member
Colburn faculty dean since 1983. ``It's the most expensive kind of
education, because it's all one-to-one instruction. And you don't
get many research grants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Fleischmann, who retired this spring after 29 years as
managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said that, along
with Gordon Getty, Colburn was ``probably the single greatest
benefactor of music and musicians in California'' and an
``iconoclast and individualist.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischmann called the planned conservatory ``an absolutely
essential undertaking'' and added, ``It is what this part of the
world has lacked for all these many years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Colburn, it is all just the logical outgrowth of his own
early experience with inadequate teaching that led him to abandon a
potential musical career in favor of accounting and eventually
investments in foundries, mining and construction equipment
rentals. Colburn was chairman of U.S. Rentals, a Modesto,
Calif.-based concern in which he owned two-thirds of the shares,
until its $1 billion acquisition this summer by a rival, United
Rentals Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. He has been listed as among the 30
richest people in Los Angeles, with a fortune estimated at $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the victim of poor training myself, and still have not
overcome the bad habits of early teaching,'' he said in an
interview in an elegant office bungalow on the grounds of his
sprawling Beverly Hills estate. The Colburn faculty includes master
teachers like Ronald Leonard, principal cellist of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern schools have come out here and robbed us of our most
promising students, even before they've finished their training at
the Colburn School,'' he said. ``There was a time when Vienna was
the world headquarters of medical studies. I hope the day will come
that you don't have to say you went to Juilliard to establish your
pedigree, that you can say you went to Colburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What is new for Colburn is the publicity that comes with
philanthropy on such a scale. Well known in the music world for his
collection of 72 vintage-quality instruments, which he has lent to
aspiring musicians around the world for the last 50 years, and for
paying top-quality players to join him in amateur quartets, Colburn
has remained, by choice, little known to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me as a little boy, `Fools' names and fools'
faces often appear in public places,''' said Colburn, who answers
innocuous questions like ``What did your parents do?'' with impish
but unrevealing answers like ``They raised three lovely boys.''
Asked how he acquired his fortune, Colburn replied with a stream of
cryptic Ben Franklinisms: ``A penny saved is a penny earned; waste
not, want not. You've heard some of those?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I never created anything,'' he added modestly. ``I identified
dogs, and I got people to run them.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping out of college and working as an accountant in
Chicago in his 20s, Colburn moved into investment banking. More
than 30 years ago, by then back in California, he helped rescued
Susquehanna Corp., a Denver-based conglomerate with interests in
building materials and uranium mining.
</P>
<P>
   At 87, Colburn is clearly a character, turned out for an
interview in soft, custom-made clothes with a gold watch fob tucked
in his tweed lapel and jokingly offering a visitor vodka at midday.
He has been married nine times, to eight women, most recently in
June, and he and his 38-year-old wife, Jacqueline, have just
returned from Austria with their newborn daughter, his sixth child.
For each of the last 29 summers he has taken a house in Salzburg
for the international music festival there, and has served as
president of its American friends organization.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Opera in
New York and the Los Angeles Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The school began life in 1950 as the preparatory division of the
University of Southern California's School of Music, and its alumni
include Michael Tilson Thomas, the music director of the San
Francisco Symphony, and principal players in orchestras in
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York. In 1980 the
university decided it could no longer afford the school, and
Colburn stepped in anonymously to keep it going, in an former
warehouse on the fringes of the campus in south central Los
Angeles. In 1986, he allowed his name to be placed on the school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Colburn also recruited Toby Mayman, a former
congressional aide and the wife of one of his business colleagues
at Susquehanna, as the school's executive director, a job she
retains. But now she presides over the spanking new building on
Grand Avenue in the heart of downtown, with 67 pianos, a library of
6,000 compact disks, 20 state-of-the-art acoustic practice rooms
and recording equipment, 28 teaching studios, 2 dance studios and a
100-seat recital hall named for . . . Toby Mayman.
</P>
<P>
   The building was designed so it could be expanded farther down
Bunker Hill into vacant land that now holds a parking lot, with
room to build a 10-story dormitory complex for the future
conservatory students. An open plaza connects the new school with
the Museum of Contemporary Art next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had kind of a schizophrenic requirement, because on the one
hand it will be used by professional chamber musicians for concerts
and on the other it really is a school and will be used by
children,'' said the project's architect, Norman Pfeiffer. ``Trying
to come to terms with the appropriate architectural response to
that wide diversity of audience made it interesting. You didn't
want to make it seem like an elementary school or a kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   A program of daytime classes for adults has already lured
workers from the downtown area, including U.S. District Court Judge
Stephen Wilson, who comes to take noontime jazz piano lessons with
David Scott of the Colburn faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it,'' Wilson said in a telephone interview. I've
never had any serious training, but I've had a proclivity for it,
and I sort of taught myself. Unfortunately, I've now learned that a
lot of what I had been doing was wrong, and it's difficult to
unlearn things. It's like a golfer who's hitting in the 90s and
wants to get down to the 80s, and the pro shows him what he's doing
wrong and with the new grip he's suddenly hitting in the hundreds.
I'm not quite as facile with this new technique yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, though he especially favors chamber music, Colburn
declined to characterize his musical tastes, or even name a handful
of favorite pieces or composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorites are what I'm listening to,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- DIVERS. A strong majority of Pennsylvanians say

(Working.) Marlin
</P>
<P>
   -- BUSINESS. A final compromise could be worked out this week on
a bill that would allow many restaurants to play music without

<P>
   In the last several weeks, while Bill Clinton has faced the
greatest moral crisis of his presidency, Jimmy Carter has built a
recreational complex for the children of Plains, Ga., promoted his
ambitious plan to bring democracy to China one village at a time,
received a visit from the former president of Nigeria and taught a
Sunday school class on the subject of personal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some carefully worded comments last month
at Emory University -- in which the former president demonstrated
disgust for President Clinton's affair and lack of honesty with the
American people and in which he predicted Clinton would survive
impeachment hearings -- Carter has remained mostly silent about
Clinton's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is often the case, regular students in his Sunday
school class at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains were the first
to get a hint of just what Carter is thinking about national
events.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been the regular adult Sunday school teacher at
Maranatha for the last 16 years. He teaches an average of three
times a month, beginning each hour-long class with a 10-minute
update on personal events or observations relating to the
activities in his own life in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he has made several observations regarding the
Lewinsky affair and the campaign-finance investigation now
surrounding Vice President Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sunday after Congress released President Clinton's taped
grand jury testimony, Carter told his class he had spoken that week
with former president Gerald Ford, ``who has evolved into a very
deep and personal friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we discussed this week was the crisis now in
Washington, Carter said. We agreed to not speak out in public about
what should happen, but we both deplore the crisis and the moral
problem of our nation. We constrasted it with when we happened to
be in office, and we agreed to just consult with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   --In addressing his class just a few days after Clinton's Aug.
17 admission, Carter spoke about his visit to the ``Tonight Show''
with Jay Leno after he wrote ``Living Faith'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparation for my visit to the show, he (Leno) interviewed
people on the street to see what they knew about the Bible. It was
surprising how many people knew the first commandment was freedom
of speech, and a lot of them knew the whale swallowed Pinnochio,''
Carter told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one that modern-day leaders should remember involves the
seventh commandment. I'm not going to name any names, but they
thought it said, ``thou shalt not ADMIT adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   --In early September, Carter told his class, ``One thing I did
this week was to call Al Gore, who is a friend of ours, and give
him some advice on how to deal with the charges against him that he
might have used improper means to raise funds for the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I hoped that no matter what he did, that if he
made a mistake that he should just admit it and say, 'I made a
mistake. My lawyers advised me to do this.' and not get caught
later on in having told the American people something that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened carefully and began to tell me his lawyers advised
that this was technically correct. And I said, 'Look Al, I don't
even want to hear that. You just tell the worst that you possible
could have done, and let the American people be on your side.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure would hate to see Al Gore get caught up in a situation
where people would doubt his honesty and his integrity. I think Al
Gore is a very honest and decent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's obvious omission of comment on Clinton was not lost on
anyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the contrasts between Clinton's moral quotient and
Carter's is not lost on anyone who remembers the 1976 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ``I'll-never-lie-to-you'' promise seemed almost naive
at the time but stands in total contrast with Clinton's public lie
in January, ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lead in the 1976 pre-election polls vanished when
``Playboy'' reported that he had admitted having lusted for women
other than his wife Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   This is mild stuff when compared to the thousands of
near-pornographic pages released in the last four weeks related to
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was voted out of office by Americans who considered him
ineffective in his efforts to reduce double-digit inflation and to
reclaim our hostages from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost his bid for re-election, Carter was consoled by
people who told him he was too good a man, too honest a human
being, to be in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now is tagged untrustworthy, morally repugnant, ``but an
effective president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carter has remained restrained in his public comments on
the moral crisis in Washington, he does offer a profound example of
redemption after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton should start taking notes.
</P>

greatest moral crisis of his presidency, Jimmy Carter has built a
recreational complex for the children of Plains, Ga., promoted his
ambitious plan to bring democracy to China one village at a time,
received a visit from the former president of Nigeria and taught a
Sunday school class on the subject of personal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some carefully worded comments last month
at Emory University -- in which the former president demonstrated
disgust for President Clinton's affair and lack of honesty with the
American people and in which he predicted Clinton would survive
impeachment hearings -- Carter has remained mostly silent about
Clinton's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is often the case, regular students in his Sunday
school class at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains were the first
to get a hint of just what Carter is thinking about national
events.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been the regular adult Sunday school teacher at
Maranatha for the last 16 years. He teaches an average of three
times a month, beginning each hour-long class with a 10-minute
update on personal events or observations relating to the
activities in his own life in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he has made several observations regarding the
Lewinsky affair and the campaign-finance investigation now
surrounding Vice President Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sunday after Congress released President Clinton's taped
grand jury testimony, Carter told his class he had spoken that week
with former president Gerald Ford, ``who has evolved into a very
deep and personal friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we discussed this week was the crisis now in
Washington, Carter said. We agreed to not speak out in public about
what should happen, but we both deplore the crisis and the moral
problem of our nation. We constrasted it with when we happened to
be in office, and we agreed to just consult with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   --In addressing his class just a few days after Clinton's Aug.
17 admission, Carter spoke about his visit to the ``Tonight Show''
with Jay Leno after he wrote ``Living Faith'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparation for my visit to the show, he (Leno) interviewed
people on the street to see what they knew about the Bible. It was
surprising how many people knew the first commandment was freedom
of speech, and a lot of them knew the whale swallowed Pinnochio,''
Carter told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one that modern-day leaders should remember involves the
seventh commandment. I'm not going to name any names, but they
thought it said, ``thou shalt not ADMIT adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   --In early September, Carter told his class, ``One thing I did
this week was to call Al Gore, who is a friend of ours, and give
him some advice on how to deal with the charges against him that he
might have used improper means to raise funds for the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I hoped that no matter what he did, that if he
made a mistake that he should just admit it and say, 'I made a
mistake. My lawyers advised me to do this.' and not get caught
later on in having told the American people something that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened carefully and began to tell me his lawyers advised
that this was technically correct. And I said, 'Look Al, I don't
even want to hear that. You just tell the worst that you possible
could have done, and let the American people be on your side.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure would hate to see Al Gore get caught up in a situation
where people would doubt his honesty and his integrity. I think Al
Gore is a very honest and decent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's obvious omission of comment on Clinton was not lost on
anyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the contrasts between Clinton's moral quotient and
Carter's is not lost on anyone who remembers the 1976 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ``I'll-never-lie-to-you'' promise seemed almost naive
at the time but stands in total contrast with Clinton's public lie
in January, ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lead in the 1976 pre-election polls vanished when
``Playboy'' reported that he had admitted having lusted for women
other than his wife Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   This is mild stuff when compared to the thousands of
near-pornographic pages released in the last four weeks related to
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was voted out of office by Americans who considered him
ineffective in his efforts to reduce double-digit inflation and to
reclaim our hostages from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost his bid for re-election, Carter was consoled by
people who told him he was too good a man, too honest a human
being, to be in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now is tagged untrustworthy, morally repugnant, ``but an
effective president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carter has remained restrained in his public comments on
the moral crisis in Washington, he does offer a profound example of
redemption after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton should start taking notes.
</P>

BAND `FEATURING BEACH BOYS' IS JUST A SHELL OF THE ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How many of the original Beach Boys are left in the band?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.M.H., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: When Mike Love performs today with a group billed as the
Beach Boys or ``American Band Featuring Members of the Beach
Boys,'' he is the only original member who was there in 1961 when
the group formed in Hawthorne, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The original fivesome consisted of Love, Al Jardine and the
brothers Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Love's group includes two early Beach Boys: David Marks, who
replaced Jardine from 1962 to 1963, and Bruce Johnston, who toured
in place of Brian Wilson beginning in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 Beach Boys tour, Love, Jardine and Carl Wilson
performed together. Wilson, who was replaced by Marks during the
tour because of health problems, died of cancer in February at age
51. Dennis Wilson drowned in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine is reportedly putting together his own ``Beach Boys:
Friends and Family'' tour. Brian Wilson continues to record and
perform occasionally on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Barbara Bush?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to 10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 900, Houston 77024.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the White House, the former first lady has been an
active speaker on behalf of children's literacy and other
charities, including her own Barbara Bush Foundation for Family
Literacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, she will participate in a Celebration of Reading
in Houston, where she and President Bush live for half of every
year. The rest of their time is spent at their summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.

A HOME THAT'S TRULY LIVED IN CAN BE A GENUINE WORK OF ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have lovely works of art at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   There are beautiful paintings, specimens, and unusual objects on
display throughout the building. Many people travel great distances
to view their latest exhibit. It's well worth the trip. As a child,
one of my favorite pastimes was visiting museums like the Amon
Carter Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History.
Yes, I was a strange kid.
</P>
<P>
   I carried my love for museums from my parents' home right into
my own home today.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know exactly how it happened. It must have started
normally enough, probably with comfortable furnishings purchased
more for their practicality and durability than their aesthetic
value. But a couple of episodes of Martha Stewart and a few
articles in some decorating magazines changed all of that.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, I had started buying frames that cost more
than the pictures inside them. We had white chairs in the dining
room. The rug was a work of art. The magazines _ the socially
conscious and incredibly boring magazines _ were arranged
symmetrically on the fingerprint-free table. I was warning my
children not to use the ``good'' soap or the ``good'' towels in the
``good'' bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I had to take my shoes off just to walk into my own
house. I don't even have to remove my shoes at the Kimbell, and
they've got Cezanne and Matisse in there.
</P>
<P>
   We had a dining room that we hardly ever dined in because we
were afraid we might stain the white chairs. And we had a living
room that absolutely no one lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Like a museum, our house was on display.
</P>
<P>
   People have a certain way of behaving in museums. But what's
appropriate for a museum is not appropriate for a home. Homes are
for living, lounging, loving and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   If the pictures, chairs, towels, and pretty dishes aren't for
your family, then who are they for? And why? That's what I asked
myself one day when I found myself becoming angry because I had
discovered dirt on one of the ``good'' towels.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like the answer I gave myself.
</P>
<P>
   So now, we burn the candles. We use the soap. And we drink tap
water out of the long-stemmed glasses. Life is too short. The only
thing irreplaceable in my home is my family.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I still love to visit museums. I just don't want to
live in one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll have a glass of chardonnay,'' the lady says. Her male
companion adds, ``Make it a glass of merlot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine by the glass: how au courant, how American. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   At Le Rubi, a little cafe I frequent near the Place Vendome in
Paris, the first wine drinkers of the day appear around 10:30 a.m.
Workmen on their morning break, they call for ``un p't rouge'' _ a
small glass of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   At midday the suits crowd in: office workers, ministry clerks,
junior MBAs from the banks. They order the plat du jour and wash it
down with a glass of Bordeaux rouge or a cru Beaujolais like Morgon
or Julienas. No one orders by the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, wine by the glass has been trendy for a hundred years.
Actually, people have drunk wine by the glass for longer than that,
as there is really no other way to get at it, other than swilling
from the bottle, which is uncouth, or squirting it from a goat-skin
bag, which is unsanitary if you're out of practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, ordering by the glass did not become a
widespread practice until the 1970s, when wine first became popular
among trend-setters. At first it was a discreet way to mask one's
ignorance. Murmuring ``Just a glass of white wine please'' sounds a
lot better than ``I don't know one wine from another.''
</P>
<P>
   Then someone came up with the Cruvinet, and ordering wine by the
glass became part of the bar scene. The Cruvinet is a brass-trimmed
glass cabinet in which opened bottles of wine are hooked up to a
source of nitrogen. As the wine is served out by the glass, the
nitrogen fills the empty space in the bottle. No air gets in, and
the wine, theoretically, can last for days. The one-bottle Cruvinet
became the three-bottle Cruvinet and eventually the 25- and
30-bottle Cruvinet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quickly as it had arrived, the Cruvinet all but
disappeared. Bartenders noticed that the bottles that lasted for
days were wines no one particularly wanted and that bottles of
popular wines were soon emptied _ even the most expensive ones.
There was no need to preserve them in a glass case like Vladimir
Ilyich Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, wine by the glass had arrived. Gradually, the
standard request moved up the scale from ``a glass of white wine''
to ``a glass of chablis,'' to ``a glass of chardonnay.'' Or
cabernet, or merlot.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more restaurants added wines by the glass to their
wine lists, even a difficult-to-pronounce wine could be ordered
without loss of face. ``I'll have a glass of No. 6'' would usually
do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, wine consumption faltered
because of stricter controls on drunken driving, general concerns
about alcohol and health, and an economic downturn. Then, with
widely publicized claims that wine could actually be good for you,
coupled with a brighter economy, wine bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   And with fitness as important as ever, having just a couple of
glasses of wine at dinner made more sense than drinking a whole
bottle. ``Drink less but better'' became a popular slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a new group of wine drinkers had emerged: more
knowledgeable, more discerning, more adventurous. They wanted to
try different wines but they were not prepared to buy full bottles
just to experiment. In fact, the staggering increases in wine
prices have made it almost impossible for restaurantgoers of
moderate means to sample many sought-after wines.
</P>
<P>
   A couple celebrating an anniversary at a prominent New York
restaurant might be put off by the $90 price for a bottle of good
Champagne. But they might be able to swing two glasses at $17 each.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants, like Gramercy Tavern in New York, offer wine
by the glass and by the taste. Not sure if the Tulocay Winery's
Haynes Vineyard pinot noir is what you want with dinner? Try a
three-ounce taste for $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   At I Trulli, another Manhattan restaurant, wine by the glass is
supplemented by wine by the flight, served at Enoteca, a wine bar
adjoining the restaurant. A flight is a group of wines to be
sampled together.
</P>
<P>
   One flight consists of two ounces each of three Tuscan wines:
two 1995 Chianti Classicos _ one from Rodano, the other from Rocca
di Castagnoli _ and a 1994 Sassoalloro from Biondi-Santi. The
flight costs $13.25. By the glass, the wines are $6.25, $7.75 and
$12.25, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall, Enoteca is offering a weekly series of flights
of more expensive Italian wines weekly. Next week a $36 flight of
three so-called Super-Tuscans will be featured: the Solaia 1993,
Sassicaia 1994 and Ornellaia 1994.
</P>
<P>
   SoHo Kitchen and Bar, one of New York's oldest wine bars _ and
one of its best _ offers more than 100 wines by the glass and more
than 20 flights, including, for the exceptionally self-assured, a
mystery flight of three whites and three reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Club in Chicago also pours about 100 different wines,
but the mother of all wine bars is probably the Panorama Ristorante
in Philadelphia, which offers about 120 wines by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unlikely that each of those wines will be ordered
every day, most large wine bars use some kind of refrigeration and
preservation system. Panorama and the Hudson Club use a system
called Wine Keeper, which costs about $40,000, said Curt Burns, the
wine director of the Hudson Club.
</P>
<P>
   But even the machines, which resemble props from the Sci-fi
Channel, are not infallible. Maria de Corpo, the wine buyer for
Mistral, a restaurant and wine bar in Santa Rosa, Calif., told
Cheers, a trade publication, that spoilage was still a major
problem and that it was important to feature what the customers
liked most. In other words, turnover is everything _ just as at Le
Rubis.

FOOD Q&AMP;A: SOCCA, MELONS AND CASTOR SUGAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a recipe using chickpea flour, water and
olive oil to make a flat wafer I saw in a French travelogue. Any
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A: The flat wafer you are looking for is called socca. It is a
savory treat sold in the Cours Saleya open-air market in old Nice.
Vendors set up little stands in the market stalls and sell warm
squares of the salty snack folded into brown paper cones.
</P>
<P>
   Socca is easy to make, provided you have a very hot oven, which
transforms the thin batter into a cake with a texture halfway
between a pancake and a fritter. Below is a recipe adapted from
Mireille Johnston's ``Cuisine of the Sun'' (Biscuit Books, 1996).
You can buy chickpea flour in Italian and Middle Eastern markets,
and in fancy-food shops.
</P>
<P>
   To Wilt a Melon
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm very fond of melons, but for health reasons can't eat raw
fruit. Can you provide any recipes for cooking melons that retain
their flavor and, hopefully, their texture?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a reason why recipes for cooked melon are so few:
The fruit turns pulpy because it contains a lot of water, which it
gives up when heated enough to cook it through. Traditionally,
melons are cooked only to preserve them _ for example, to candy or
pickle them, or to make them into jam. None of these preparations
retain the juicy-crisp texture of fresh melon, and the sugar, salt
or spices necessary in the preserving markedly affect the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Upper Lip
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have come across several dessert recipes (for cheesecake,
for example) that require something called castor sugar. I have had
no success in finding a store that carries this, let alone knows
what it is. Where can I get it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Castor sugar is actually the British name for extra-fine, or
superfine, sugar. (This is not the same as powdered, or
confectioners', sugar.)
</P>
<P>
   Its fine grain lets it dissolve almost instantly in liquid,
making it well suited to sweetening meringues and cold drinks.
However, some older British cookbooks _ those by Elizabeth David,
for example _ call for castor sugar routinely, even when granulated
would do. For foods that don't require the instant dissolution of
the sugar, such as most cakes and pastries, the same amount of
regular granulated sugar is perfectly fine.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, it is easy to make your own superfine sugar. Simply
whirl sugar in the food processor for several minutes. Use it in
any recipe calling for superfine or castor sugar _ or, for that
matter, granulated sugar.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCA
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Cuisine of the Sun''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes, plus 1 hour for batter to rest
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chickpea flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fruity olive oil, plus more for drizzling
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients but pepper. Let
batter rest 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Oil a 10-inch round baking
pan and pour in the batter. Bake the pancake until it sets, about 6
minutes. Drizzle the top with olive oil. Turn on the broiler and
broil until the top is crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes
longer.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove socca from the oven and sprinkle with salt and pepper
to taste. Cut into wedges and serve, in the spirit of Nice, with a
chilled aperitif wine.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

   Miguel Torres Mas La Plana 1994 Penedes, Spain. About $35.
</P>
<P>
   When this wine, which is 100 percent cabernet sauvignon, was
introduced in 1970, it was known as Gran Coronas Black Label. It
was created by Miguel Torres Jr., who joined the family business in
the early 1960s and introduced French grape varieties to the
Penedes region, southwest of Barcelona. The cabernet vines were
planted in the Milmanda Vineyard in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, the wine was rich and tannic, apparently
too much so for the Spanish market. Even though the wine was
immensely popular elsewhere, its style was softened to conform more
to that of most Spanish reds.

   In the early 1990s, it reverted somewhat to the earlier
versions, with more structure. This 1994 embodies the best of both
styles: rich, opaque and intensely flavored. It would be just right
for Thanksgiving; it will also last for 15 years.

 &HT;    HUMANITARIAN GROUPS FIGHTING TIME, WINTER TO SAVE KOSOVO
REFUGEES
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trim.

   TIRANA, Albania _ Determined government and humanitarian
agencies are struggling to provide food and shelter, before winter
sets in, to more than 20,000 refugees who have fled to Albania to
escape the violence of neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Already a poor country with a fragile government, Albania is
straining under the weight of caring for the refugees, and
officials here express deep concern about the future if the crisis
in Kosovo persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes this difficult country even more difficult to
govern,'' said Daan Everts, the ambassador here for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, aid groups, including the Red Cross an Catholic
Relief Fund, met with representatives of Western governments and
Albanian officials to take an account of the situation and plot the
next steps in coping with the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   NATO airstrikes, meanwhile, moved closer to reality as U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for a second day on Tuesday in Belgrade and warned him
against failing to show the West he really means to end his harsh
crackdown in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking in Washington, said Holbrooke was
telling Milosevic that NATO is prepared to act if he fails to honor
U.N. resolutions ordering him to withdraw from areas of conflict
and allow a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   No halt to the violence, many fear will only exacerbate the
refugee problem -- particularly as winter looms.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations are being made for as many as 20,000 additional
refugees but officials here worry about the country's capacity to
handle such an influx. ``This is an emergency plan, and we hope
this will remain on paper,'' said Tauland Dedja, the Albanian
government official coordinating refugee efforts. ``If we had such
a number there would be tremendous problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the government pledges not to close the border
with Kosovo, where an estimated 250,000 more refugees have been
displaced by the seven-month struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our countrymen,'' Dedja said. ``Only destiny put a
border between us. To close the border would be unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian, is a province
of Serbia, one of the two remaining republics of Yugoslavia. Kosovo
was largely self governing before 1989, when Milosevic placed the
region under direct Serb rule.
</P>
<P>
   Since February fierce fighting between the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which seeks independence from Serbia, and Serb police and
military forces has emptied dozens of villages. Many refugees say
they will not return home until their safety can be assured.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20,000 refugees already in Albania, nearly half are women
and about 7,500 are children aged 14 years or younger, according to
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. More than 3,400
are under 6 years old, and 1,265 are over 60. About a quarter have
significant health problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,600 school children between 7 to 15 years of age have
been admitted into Albanian schools, and the government has given
them free school books.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the refugees stayed with Albanian families, but over
the months this arrangement has become untenable, officials said.
Consequently, warehouses, old barracks and dormitories are being
improved to provide housing. Additionally, the government has
pledged to provide land where aid groups intend to build a compound
of prefabricated buildings for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   However, the process has been slowed by a number of problems,
including security and complicated legal issues related to
ownership of many of the buildings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Efforts also have been hampered by turmoil within the Albanian
government. The impoverished former Communist country has endured
months of political conflict that last month erupted into street
violence in the capital. In an attempt to ease tensions, Prime
Minister Fatos Nano resigned last week. He was replaced by Pandeli
Majko, a 30-year-old official in Nano's ruling Socialist Party.
Even so, there are fears that tensions could escalate into civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee situation here is potentially a destabilizing force
for the frail Albanian government, Everts said. Many refugees have
expressed unhappiness with the relative moderate stance of the
Albanian government toward Kosovo and have added to the civil
unrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis also has diverted the government's attention and
resources, while contributing to the lawlessness in the
northeastern region where the only clear authority is heavily armed
clans, Everts said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict with Serb forces has stimulated the illegal arms
trade in the region, making it even more difficult for the
government to regain control, he said. An estimated 3,000 refugees
are in the Tropoja district, the heart of a region of near anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid workers have been pulled out of the area because of
harassment by the clans, who apparently view the workers as
profitable prey, said Ilir Gjoni, an official with the U.N. refugee
commission. ``We're operating in very difficult circumstances ,''
Gjoni said. ``There have been thefts, lootings of our warehouses,
life threats, cars stolen, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, because the poor conditions in Albania are well-known
in Kosovo, officials assume -- and hope -- that few remaining
refugees will cross the border. Additionally, Kosovar rebels eager
to preserve the ethnic Albanian majority are blocking a mass
exodus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, authorities believe they will be able to
shelter the refugees through the winter if the numbers remain
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this will be determined by the scale of conflict in
Kosovo,'' Dedja said. ``The conflict will determine whether the
number of refugees in Albania will increase or whether it will slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far nobody has been left out on the streets.''

`LOVE IS THE DEVIL': INSIDE AN ARTIST'S MIND AND A WORLD OF
TORMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who subscribes to the sentimental fallacy that great
artists are nicer people than the rest of us (the reasoning goes
that because they supposedly feel more than ordinary mortals, they
must be nobler and more caring) hasn't met many great artists. If
anything, the reverse tends to be true: the obsessive pursuit of an
artistic idea more often than not involves a ruthless tunnel vision
that screens out anything that isn't useful to the work or to the
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is the Devil,'' John Maybury's searing portrait of the
English painter Francis Bacon (Derek Jacobi) at the height of his
fame in the 1960s, is one of the nastiest and most truthful
portraits of the artist-as-monster ever filmed. Its story of the
colossally self-absorbed painter and his self-destructive younger
lover, George Dyer (Daniel Craig), begins when Bacon awakens in his
studio one night to discover a burglar on the premises. Sizing up
the thief as an appetizing piece of rough trade, Bacon makes a
proposition: if the robber sheds his clothes and comes to bed with
him, he promises, he can have anything he wants. The next thing you
know, they're a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon craves being totally dominated by other men, but the most
you see of him acting out this fantasy is in an early scene where
Bacon kneels over a bed while George knots a belt around his fist
and aims a lighted cigarette at his bare back. Later in the film,
he attends a boxing match where he watches intensely as one fighter
smashes the other in the head, splattering a jet of blood onto
Bacon's ecstatic face.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie also makes clear that the dynamics of dominance
and submission work both ways. Outside the bedroom, Bacon is
relentlessly controlling of his lover, who falls to pieces. Bacon
refers dismissively to George as his ``odd job man,'' and locks him
out of the house when he's entertaining other sexual partners. When
George tells Bacon he loves him, the artist wonders out loud what
bad television show those lines came from.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon is similarly high-handed with his circle of friends, whom
the movie portrays as a viperish nest of supercilious hangers-on.
``Champagne for my real friends; real pain for my sham friends,''
Bacon caustically announces in one of several scenes of nocturnal
carousal.
</P>
<P>
   When a young painter who idolizes Bacon begs him to come see his
work, Bacon retorts that the young man's taste in neckties is proof
he couldn't possibly have any talent. In Jacobi's uncompromising
hard-edged performance, you can feel the cold fury burning behind
Bacon's glare.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Love Is the Devil'' more than a disturbingly rancid
love story is John Mathieson's brilliant cinematography, which
saturates the film with Bacon's corrosive artistic vision. Although
``Love Is the Devil'' doesn't show any of Bacon's work, the look of
the entire film resembles a Bacon painting.
</P>
<P>
   Acidic lighting throws the characters' faces into harsh relief,
often shadowing their eyes and making their flesh appear to
crumble. Certain images become Baconesque diptychs and triptychs
through the use of mirrors. Some scenes are photographed through
distorting lenses that stretch faces into sinister masks that
dissolve and decompose. In a recurrent fantasy image of George, he
is a flayed, bloodied figure leaping from a diving board into the
void.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, the movie stumbles, and you can sense the
budgetary constraints (a trip to the United States is indicated
only by a picture of an American flag in the background). But in
presuming to take you inside the mind and heart of a major artist,
confronting the demonic aspect of the human condition, ``Love Is
the Devil'' goes as far and as deep as any movie has dared.

THE STARR REPORT: AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE?

<P>
   The word ``unprecedented'' keeps turning up in the media's
analysis of the Clinton/Lewinsky saga. Particularly perplexing to
many analysts has been the popularity of the Starr Report, in both
printed and on-line forms, despite the fact that most Americans
have told pollsters they don't want to see President Clinton
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits have been unable to reconcile these facts, which seem to
point to opposite conclusions. What they don't realize is that the
Starr Report is actually only the latest example of an American
fondness for what could be termed ``political pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nineteenth century the American public showed a
remarkable appetite for publications that were, for their time,
graphically sexual, as long as these works made at least a pretense
of being related to an important issue of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was an entire genre of books that purported
to be exposes written by wives who had escaped from polygamy in the
Mormon territory of Utah (Utah's admission as a state was denied
until 1896, after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
formally renounced polygamy).
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans sincerely believed that what the Mormons called
``plural marriage'' was a danger to the nation; in fact, in the
1860 Republican platform the young party referred to polygamy and
slavery in the same sentence as evils to oppose, ``twin relics of
barbarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one remembers the early Republicans for their stand
against Mormon marriage practices; we remember them for their stand
against the extension of slavery. And, in truth, Republicans of the
time spent the preponderance of their energies on the slavery
issue, despite what their platform said.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy simply didn't seem to be as important an issue. But you
would never know that from the number of anti-Mormon books and
pamphlets produced and consumed in the nineteenth century.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent example was ``Wife No. 19,'' whose author claimed
to be ``Ann Eliza Young, Brigham Young's Apostate Wife.'' Among the
many tales she told about life in Utah, she often stressed how the
Saints were fond of marrying more than one female from the same
family. (It is true that Mormons believed taking ``sister wives''
who were truly sisters might lessen some of the tensions inherent
in a polygamous household.)
</P>
<P>
   As an example of an ``incestuous intermarriage'' she told of a
widowed mother who remarried, with the understanding that her two
daughters would also wed her husband when they were old enough.
``The little girls knew of the arrangement, and used to talk very
openly of 'marrying Pa,' and in very much the same way they would
speak of their intention to take tea with a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The author also insisted that very young girls were forced into
marriage, saying her father had to begin turning down marriage
proposals for her once she reached the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polygamy, incest, and underage marriage were not the only
avid interests of nineteenth-century readers. Anti-Mormon stories
were a variation on even more popular anti-Catholic works, whose
sordid details found large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' of a woman who claimed to be a former
nun and called herself ``Maria Monk'' was a runaway bestseller when
it first appeared in 1836. (It was the best-selling book in
American history before Harriet Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's
Cabin,'' published in 1853, finally overtook that distinction.)
Monk inspired scores of imitators, whose stories were eagerly
bought long after the specific ``facts'' of Monk's tale were
exposed as frauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' remained the model for Monk's
imitators. The book spun lurid tales of convents being attached to
priests' quarters by underground tunnels, of mother superiors
ordering nuns to ``obey the priests in all things,'' and of the
cold-blooded murder of newborns produced by the illicit unions
which seemed to be the whole purpose of convents. Monk even claimed
to have been raped by clergymen the day she took her vows as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of this sort of work sought to inspire Americans
to join a political crusade, the nativist movement, which opposed
the influence of immigrants who were arriving in port cities in
numbers they found alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these immigrants were Catholic, and that was a
frightening thing to many native-born Protestants, especially since
the official pronouncements of the papacy, embroiled in the
political upheavals of Europe, seemed so at odds with American
values. (For instance, one pope of the early nineteenth century
referred to liberty of conscience as ``that most pestilential
error.'')
</P>
<P>
   The consumers of anti-Catholic material, however, did not rise
up and make nativism the controlling political force of the day.
How many current Americans have ever even heard of the Know
Nothings, the short-lived national nativist party?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the current threshold for titillation is exponentially
higher than it was 100 or 150 years ago. Today's eager audience for
``respectable pornography,'' salacious material with a political
veneer, needs more graphic, explicit detail. But the Starr Report
does have precedents in American culture. Give something salacious
the fig leaf of political significance (e.g., egregious
presidential misconduct) and Americans have always consumed it
lustily, whether it be the report of an independent counsel or the
purported memoirs of escaped nuns or Mormon wives.
</P>
<P>
   But the past demonstrates that whatever the public's appetite
for such pornography, it doesn't necessarily produce the expected
political response.

   Alice Walker's best-known novel, ``The Color Purple,'' for which
she won the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award in 1983,
placed her in the literary pantheon, as a writer who spoke in
searingly dramatic terms of the struggle of black women against
both racism and the violence of patriarchal society.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker has continued, with less noteworthy results, to spin
variations on this theme. Her latest offering, ``By the Light of My
Father's Smile,'' is a strong indication that, if she hasn't
exhausted the subject, she is exhausting her readers with what has
by now become a mannered and tendentious litany of New Age cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker's new novel recounts the interwoven experiences of
several women, though the underlying message of the book, hammered
home in frequent passages of sophomoric didacticism, is that most
men are not very admirable, that sex is spiritual and that
primitive civilizations are morally and sensually superior to
technologically advanced ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker never loses an opportunity to make these points,
though mostly she does so by putting opinions into the mouths of
half-formed characters rather than developing ideas through the
action of the story itself. ``We believe only in the unavoidable
horror of hurting others and of likewise being hurt,'' intones a
member of a Mexican tribe of Indians, demonstrating the point about
moral superiority. ``Being sorry and not being sorry. Forgiving or
not forgiving. Our Story is one that continues only for as long as
it takes us to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The person speaking, Manuelito, goes on to describe the source
of Western colonialist violence against the indigenous peoples as a
harshly puritanical repudiation of the Indians' ritualistic
celebration of their children's sexuality. ``They did not
appreciate the idea of a mother and father touching the breasts and
kissing the vulva and phallus of their grown children, even to
bless them,'' Manuelito explains of the Christian missionaries who
came to his tribe. ``Because we practiced this, they raided our
villages, hacked off our heads with machetes, enslaved us to work
in the gold and silver mines. Burned our children alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists will be surprised to learn that Indian mothers
and fathers kissed the sexual organs of their newly married
children and that the practice prompted Cortez's genocidal attack
on the Aztecs. But a kind of rapturously wrongheaded rewriting of
scholarly visions is not the only fault in Ms. Walker's new book.
Other problems include characters whose shared chief feature is
bland self-satisfaction and the almost complete absence of
narrative drive or, indeed, of dramatic structure.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker seems to have substituted the heartfelt concerns that
motivated ``The Color Purple'' for a mediocre sort of spiritualist
philosophizing that is both cloying and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker's main characters are two sisters, Susannah and
Magdalena Robinson. Susannah is a striking middle-class woman whose
first appearance is described by her father, speaking to us (as
does Manuelito) after his death. Robinson Sr., observing Susannah
from the afterlife, describes her in the midst of a vigorous erotic
encounter with her lover of the moment, Pauline, a gray-haired
55-year-old who, during the course of the book, extols the virtues
of marijuana, of having contempt for men and of sensualist
liberation. Another of the main characters is Irene, an ostracized
dwarf whom Susannah meets while on a visit to a Greek island and
who later in the novel turns out to have a lot of the same ideas as
Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   The story told in ``By the Light of My Father's Smile'' is one
of discord and reconciliation among the members of the Robinson
family. Susannah and Magdelena grew up in a remote village in
Mexico where their anthropologist parents went to study the Mundo
tribe, a half-black, half-Indian group that escaped North American
slavery centuries ago. Lacking research grants, the Robinsons
pretend that they are Christian missionaries so that they can be
sent to the land of the Mundo. Their presence among their subjects,
in other words, takes place under false pretenses, which,
unbeknownst to them, the Indians have understood all along.
</P>
<P>
   The seminal moment in this family story comes when the girls'
father, concerned that 14-year-old Magdalena's romance with the
young Manuelito is making a bad impression, beats her with his
belt. That act turns all the other members of the family against
him. Magdalena, known as Mad Dog by the Indians, becomes sullen and
obese. Susannah, forced to take sides, blames her father for
estranging her from Magdalena. The girls' mother, Langley, sleeps
in another room, though the father wins her back. ``There was no
warmth without her, no fire,'' the father recalls. ``No rebellion
of my own angel to enjoy. No surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robinson family story is told by several narrators _ the
father, Susannah, Magdelena and Langley, as well as Pauline and
Manuelito, all of them echoing the well-worn themes of Ms. Walker's
victim politics. ``So much beauty in a world indifferent to their
ways, a green and gentle and supple world that was actually
repelled by the mountainous thickness of the pale male body,'' says
Susannah of one people she visits as a tourist. That is actually
one of the more stylistically compelling of the pronouncements in a
book replete with sappier ones. ``Anyone can see that woman is the
mother/of the oldest man on earth/ is it not then a prayer/to bow
before her?'' goes a Mundo poem taught by Manuelito to Robinson Sr.
after the two of them have met up in the afterlife. ``Did you ever
wonder why we bothered with you, Senor?'' Manuelito asks the former
missionary. ``It is because you were always making love to your
wife,'' he replies to his own question.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the story's most intense moment, when Magdalena, in a
jealous rage, attacks and almost kills her sister, Ms. Walker fails
to create a sense of emotional urgency, letting the episode slip
quickly into the narrational and intellectual limpness that infuses
this whole book.

ANOTHER QUESTION IN THRILLERS: WHERE DID THE LOGIC GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock, as is well known, gave the playful name
McGuffin to the element in a movie's plot that propels the action.
A McGuffin can be one of two types, an event that unleashes a
series of subsequent events (as in ``Strangers on a Train'') or (as
in, say, ``Frenzy'' or ``Psycho'') a secret, a mystery, that must
be revealed by the end.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the unfolding of the intrigue must follow logically
from the McGuffin, as it always did in Hitchcock. Things made
sense.
</P>
<P>
   What if they don't? The question is relevant because more and
more, it would seem, thrillers, however technically brilliant, do
not make sense _ or, at least, do not flow from a tight interior
logic.
</P>
<P>
   Well, call me a pedant, but my reaction to a thriller that fails
logically is always disappointment, a sense of having been cheated.
I would appeal for good old logical consistency, a high level of
plausibility, as a necessary ingredient in thrillers, in movies as
well as in books (where the same problem exists).
</P>
<P>
   A thriller should be a dramatic intensification of the possible
as well as a tightly constructed puzzle. Even if the tale is
farfetched, it needs to follow logically from its own premise and
and give the appearance of something that could happen in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   If a thriller is unmoored from a sense of the possible, it loses
the capacity to inspire the dread that makes both for suspense and
intellectual coherence.
</P>
<P>
   The current example of a movie with logical gaps as big as
Manhattan is the much-acclaimed box office hit ``Ronin,'' directed
by John Frankenheimer and starring Robert De Niro. As Anthony Lane
of The New Yorker wrote, ``Ronin'' has three of the best car chase
scenes of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Lane also allows that there are some ``loose ends,'' but he
treats them, as other critics do, as minor flaws in what he regards
as a basically good work.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that ``Ronin'' is good in many ways. But my overall
reaction was to feel let down, to believe that what could have been
a tingling entertainment, like Frankenheimer's masterpiece, ``The
Manchurian Candidate,'' was ruined by its absence of logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' involves a group of former intelligence agents from
various countries who take on a lucrative freelance assignment
consisting of stealing a mysterious metallic suitcase from its
well-armed owners. The suitcase stealers, the Ronin of the title,
proceed to perpetrate mayhem and murder as they carry out their
task.
</P>
<P>
   The suitcase is also sought by shadowy groups of Irish
terrorists and of unidentified Russians who have planted secret
agents among the Ronin. Indeed, these groups will stop at nothing
to recover the object, whose original owners, by the way, are
equally determined to hold on to it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of several secretly competing groups, of three
different levels of betrayal, is marvelous, and it leads to a great
deal of action-filled skulduggery. But a fundamental question
remains unanswered. What, as the De Niro character asks several
times, is in the suitcase? We never find that out.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? Clearly a lot of people, including most of the
critics, don't think it does, and they give essentially two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the De Niro character, as it turns out, doesn't
really care about the suitcase after all. He is really interested
in infiltrating the Irish group so that he can eliminate an Irish
terrorist standing in the way of the negotiations in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, leaves a gaping question: Why, if the suitcase
was so important to the Irish and the Russians, are the Americans
indifferent to it? But never mind.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more important argument is that the heart of the
movie lies in the layers of distrust and betrayal among the Ronin,
while all else is relatively unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lane found it refreshing that, as he put it, the McGuffin turns
out to be a question of lost luggage. That it is not some standard,
overworked thriller device _ a lode of enriched uranium, for
example _ gives it a witty post-modernist touch.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Frankenheimer is saying, We are going to create a
cinema of absolute purity, free of the drag and dross of a
conventional McGuffin.
</P>
<P>
   That is a strong argument, but a thriller without a real
McGuffin is like a placebo, a pill with no real chemical effect.
Another problem is that much of the action in ``Ronin,'' from its
small gestures to the way it solves its own puzzle, seems both
illogical and unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   The bits and pieces of illogic accumulate, turning the film into
a kind of gritty fairy tale full of automobile acrobatics but
depriving it of a machine with working parts.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in the opening scene, for example, does the De Niro
character hide his gun or go to inspect the men's room? He does
these things for no reason other than the director's interest in
creating a sense of foreboding, but without plausible reasons
emerging for his behavior, the foreboding is contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: People are always going into hiding in this
movie, and they are always found effortlessly, as if by magic, by
those looking for them. At one point, three of the dramatis
personae get hold of the suitcase and disappear in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The De Niro character and his partner (played by Jean Reno),
still in the south of France, go to a mysterious French former
agent living in a gated chateau, where he spends his time making
miniature models of famous Japanese battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll find them for you,'' he tells the defeated pair and, sure
enough, presto! Next scene: The De Niro character and his partner
are staking out the battered Parisian hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' is certainly not unusual in this absence of connective
tissue. I am not speaking of the unserious thrillers, like the
``Lethal Weapon'' series, that dispense even with the pretense of
logical plausibility, but of serious thrillers like, say, ``The
Peacemaker,'' which is full of political absurdities and
unexplained occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Peacemaker,'' for example, a Serb extremist is pushed
to an act of nuclear terrorism because his family is gunned down
before his eyes in ``sniper alley'' in Sarajevo during the Bosnian
civil war. No critic whom I read felt it worthy of note that in
reality the Serbs were the snipers of sniper alley. The Muslims
were generally the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever other qualities of excitement or drama these movies may
have, the absence of logic, their disconnection from real-world
plausibility, deprives them of the essential ingredient of
satisfying suspense. When writers and directors have recourse to
what are essentially magical interventions, they might as well be
making Road Runner cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   You need an escape from an impasse? Have the Road Runner paint a
tunnel on the side of the cliff. You need to find some disappeared
rivals? Turn to some savant who makes toy soldiers in a castle, and
he will do the job without providing a hint to the viewer of how
the feat was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   And to require recourse to a magic wand is the cinematic
equivalent of defying the laws of gravity. It helps to get the
moviemaker to the next scene, but it leaves the audience with its
feet suspended in midair.

   &QL;  PENNSYLVANIANS BACK DIVERSITY, AFFIRMATIVE ATION
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Ellen Butler
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. -- A majority of people in Pennsylvania and
the nation support increased diversity on college campuses, despite
contentious debates about affirmative action, according to a
national poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators and other diversity advocates claimed
that the affirmative action debate has been dominated by a small
faction of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime around 2035, 50 percent of all Americans will be made
up of what today we call minorities,'' William Gray, III, president
and CEO of the United Negro College Fund, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this study says to me is that Americans may be way ahead
of their political, economic and social leaders in understanding
that reality,'' said Gray, the former congressman from
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 71 percent of people in the nation and 64
percent from Pennsylvania said diversity in education on college
campuses helps bring society together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to hear the vocal minority speaking out against
diversity,'' said Edwin Escalet, Penn State's University Park
Campus director of minority admissions and community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Students, however, are increasingly interested in attending
diverse colleges, whether they are diverse in terms of gender, race
or ethnicity, Escalet said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, a first-of-its-kind national poll examining the
public's attitudes toward diversity in higher education, was part
of the Ford Foundation's Campus Diversity Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the result of a telephone poll of 2,011
registered voters conducted between July 14 and August 4. The poll
has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percent. The
Pennsylvania results are part of a 200-person sample.
</P>
<P>
   Practical concerns like communication at work were a prime
factor in the public's attitudes toward diversity, said Daniel
Yankelovich, chairman of DYG, Inc., the group that conducted the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Of respondents to the study, 96 percent of Pennsylvanians said
in the future people will need to get along with people who are not
like them. And 88 percent said the global economy makes it more
important than ever for everyone to understand people who are
different from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public feels the purpose of higher education is to acquire
job and job-related skills,'' Yankelovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, of The College Fund, described diversity in colleges and
in the curriculum as America's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about who we are going to become and how we will become
what we will be,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents to the survey not only responded to questions about
encouraging diversity in admissions, but in the curriculum.
Fifty-three percent of those polled in Pennsylvania said every
college student should have to study different cultures in order to
graduate. That percentage was higher than in states with
increasingly diverse populations such as California, where less
than half, 49 percent, said students should have to study different
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   At Penn State, students are required to take three
diversity-focused classes. The administration encourages faculty
members to incorporate diversity by giving them time off and extra
money to develop the courses in their free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a lot easier to keep these initiatives because the
students support them,'' Escalet said.

   PHONE COMPETITION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The contest for local phone customers in
North Texas kicked off with a gust of hot air last summer.
Southwestern Bell, the state's largest local carrier, invaded No. 2
GTE's turf in Plano and Irving, launching its multimillion-dollar
challenge to the entrenched monopoly at a balloon rally. ``That's
when it began,'' says Carl Bracy, director of competitive response
for GTE. Remember the Plano Balloon Festival? It may not be a
battle cry for the ages, but that September 1997 face-off between
the two companies was supposed to fulfill the promise of the new
phone era _ local competition _ and set an example for the rest of
the nation. So far, the results have been disappointing to those
who wanted a model that could be transplanted to other parts of the
country. By MARK P. COUCH. Story will move in ``f'' financial

PRIVATE RAILWAY COMPANIES IN JAPAN FIGHT BILL TO SHIFT DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A bill that is likely to lead to a showdown between the
Japanese government and foreign investors has passed the Lower
House of Parliament and is expected to win Upper House approval by
the time the current legislative session ends later this month.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the government's plans to shift debt of 180 billion
yen, or $1.34 billion at current exchange rates, onto the seven
railway companies formed when the national railroad system was
privatized more than a decade ago. The presidents of the seven
companies, led by Masatake Matsuda, the outspoken former bureaucrat
who is president of the East Japan Railway Co., have vowed to fight
the measure, contending it violates their shareholders' rights by
illegally changing the terms of the privatization.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned that at a time when Japanese companies
are increasingly forced to turn to global capital markets for
financing, the government's actions may inhibit the rail companies'
ability to issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Their cause has been joined by two U.S. Senators _ Massachusetts
Democrat John Kerry and New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato _ as
well as several large foreign institutional shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The government has backed down somewhat. Its original proposal
was to shift twice as much of the debt to the privatized companies.
The debt is part of the old national railway's underfinanced
pension liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a move widely seen as an attempt to divide and conquer, the
government's revised bill includes some subsidized loans for four
of the companies, which are operating with losses.
</P>
<P>
   The debts the government took on as part of the privatization
have ballooned to $220 billion from $173 billion, and officials say
that without the legislation the taxpayers will have to pay for the
pension liabilities. The railways have rejected that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Matsuda said that the government
could have retired its portion of the old railroad system's debt by
using the money from the privatization as well as payments the
railways make for the high-speed train, the Shinkansen, but, he
said, officials opted to spend the money on other things. He again
asserted that the bill passed by the Lower House violated
shareholders' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow shareholders to be deprived of profits without
rational reasons, it means the collapse of the modern state and the
free economy set up with corporations at the core,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuda stopped short of repeating a previous threat he has made
to sue the government, saying he thought it was possible to gain
support for the rail companies' position in the Upper House and
thwart passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the
Upper House, but two smaller opposition parties have given their
support to the bill in the Lower House. Their members are expected
to do the same in the Upper House, giving the dominant party the
needed votes.

   Funding battles threaten schools
</P>
<P>

   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ America's premier public universities,
including Texas' two flagships, are in peril because of a
``relentless barrage of criticism,'' regional politics and intense
competition for state money, former University of Texas President
Robert Berdahl said in a speech Monday at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a subtle but a dangerous effort to weaken flagship
campuses,'' said Berdahl, who now heads the University of
California at Berkeley _ considered the flagship of U.S. public
universities. ``No one will admit that it is happening, but it is.
Texas is not unique in this.''
</P>
<P>
   UT, which last year launched a campaign to raise $1 billion by
2004, hopes to persuade potential donors that Texas benefits
economically from having a comprehensive research university
powered by strong faculty and students. UT, along with Texas A&AMP;M,
also must convince the Legislature to sustain them as flagships in
the face of criticism and complaints of elitism, Berdahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing, of course, kills private fund-raising for public
universities faster than the belief that the state will withdraw
funds if private donors are willing to add them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl's remarks on ``The Future of Flagship Institutions''
were made before a crowd of several hundred attending an academic
convocation to honor 125 Texas A&AMP;M faculty and staff for their
achievements. A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen, who became friends with
Berdahl during Berdahl's 4 1/2-year tenure at UT, said the topic
was intended to open the debate on flagships in Texas. It is an
issue California has successfully confronted by creating a system
that provides access and academic excellence to all, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   When Berdahl, 61, left UT 16 months ago, he cited inadequate
state aid to higher education as the main reason. Some lawmakers
had said they did not see a need to pour more resources into UT and
Texas A&AMP;M at ``the expense of'' other Texas universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my first years here, the regional universities launched
an assault on graduate education, ostensibly in the name of
undergraduate education, that moved resources from College Station
and Austin elsewhere,'' Berdahl said. Regional universities
``persuaded their representatives that the distribution of
resources is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the primary beneficiaries of the state's Permanent
University Fund, UT and Texas A&AMP;M continue to be challenged by
other state schools that want a share of the historic endowment.
Some state lawmakers, including state Rep. Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, have said
those schools have a point.
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl revealed that an appearance before Junell's committee
persuaded him in February 1997 to become a candidate for the
Berkeley job after turning down an interview three months earlier.
It was the same week he learned UT would not get a share of $600
million in recommended construction money because the
appropriations committee believed UT could raise the money
privately.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year substantially boosted aid to higher
education in Texas, but it provides just 25 percent of the UT
System's overall budget. The rest comes primarily from tuition,
donations and revenues from UT System hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Permanent University Fund ``was a whipping boy of sorts
during each of the three legislative sessions I was in Austin,''
Berdahl told the audience. ``I actually came to see the PUF as a
political handicap for UT.''
</P>
<P>
   When the better funded Berkeley campus beckoned, Berdahl said it
was hard to resist. California has made a strong commitment to
financing higher education over four decades, guided by a master
plan created in 1959, and now boasts eight flagships. Texas could
use at least one or two more flagships, Berdahl said, but not until
it adequately finances the two it has.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that if Texas fails to protect and promote UT and A&AMP;M,
the best students will leave for better schools out of state, and
``we will all be the poorer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher education critics have long complained that research
universities shortchange undergraduates by corralling them into
huge classes and giving them graduate students as instructors.
Lawmakers have been sensitive to those critics and have targeted
elementary and secondary education for higher chunks of state aid.
</P>
<P>
   While some criticisms are valid, including inattention to
undergraduate education, Berdahl said, flagship universities ``are
the envy of the world.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ North Beach is a gentle old Italian neighborhood
that ambles up the hill from San Francisco Bay, in the shade of
Telegraph Hill. Only 30 years ago, the small streets were lined
with butchers who made their own sausages, and with bakeries that
supplied every Italian restaurant in town. Old men played boccie in
the park in front of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, and
argued over espresso in the sidewalk cafes along Columbus Avenue.
The neighborhood was sprinkled with modest restaurants _ Columbus,
U.S., Little Joe's _ where bachelors gathered nightly to talk
politics and eat good, solid meals at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beats arrived in the 1950s, they coexisted peacefully
with the population, and even the sex shops crawling along Broadway
gave the place personality. There was a fine balance until
Chinatown began to encroach from the western end and the Italians
began moving out; suddenly, it seemed, the strip joints were
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '80s, it was impossible to go into any of the
neighborhood places without being bombarded by a standard lament:
The neighborhood was disappearing. Storefronts stood empty, one by
one the restaurants started to close, and even the cafes seemed
sad. The people who loved North Beach began to anticipate its
demise.
</P>
<P>
   And then, something remarkable happened: North Beach reinvented
itself through food.
</P>
<P>
   It started slowly, with a restaurant here and a cafe there. But
in the last year the North Beach movement has picked up steam.
Restaurants are opening at a stunning rate, and once moribund shops
and bakeries are packed. And why not? The neighborhood has charm.
It has history. It is one of San Francisco's sunniest areas and it
is just a short walk from the financial district or Fisherman's
Wharf. More important, North Beach has character.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has always loved food, and today it is filled with
important new restaurants. I tried them all. I was impressed with
Jardiniere, bowled over by the transformation of the old Trader
Vic's into the new Colonial, stunned by the decor at Loongbar. But
you could pick those restaurants up, plunk them down in any city in
America and they would be fine. The best restaurants of North
Beach, on the other hand, need the neighborhood. They belong to San
Francisco. And I found myself irresistibly drawn back.
</P>
<P>
   I spent days wandering the streets of North Beach, stopping by
its hardware stores, bakeries, coffee roasters and pottery shops. I
ate in restaurants old and new. And although I had many wonderful
meals, in the end I found myself returning to the ones with the
strongest sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   Because the remarkable thing about North Beach is that, unlike
Times Square in New York, which is being sanitized into an urban
entertainment mall, its renaissance has been organic, gradual and
utterly inclusive. The neighborhood thrums with activity, and every
shop is occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Diners leaving San Francisco's hottest new restaurants still
find themselves accosted by barkers urging them to come in and
watch women take off their clothes. Meanwhile, City Lights
Bookstore, as scruffy as ever, is a constant reminder of the area's
literary past. North Beach feels raucous, alive, vibrant. It feels
loved.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere do you get a better sense of this than at the corner of
Broadway and Kearny Street, the gateway to North Beach. On the
north side of the street, Enrico's, one of the area's most
venerable institutions, has been given a new lease on life.
Although Enrico Banducci made a valiant effort to keep it going,
the restaurant died in the '80s. It stood empty for a while, and
then Rick Hackett, Meredith Melville and Mark McCloud, who have
worked at the East Bay's best restaurants (Olivetto, Chez Panisse
and Bay Wolf), bought the building and pumped in money, energy and
spirit. They upgraded the food and wine while leaving the
restaurant's raffish energy intact. There is almost no time of the
day or night when the joint doesn't jump.
</P>
<P>
   In the daytime, people sit outside eating spaghetti and salads.
At night, wisecracking waitresses thread their way through the
crowded room, delivering baked goat cheese salads with baby spinach
and grilled pork ribs. Lamb chops from the trendy Niman Ranch are
cooked in a wood-burning oven, and potatoes are mashed with rivers
of butter. The food is more likable than fabulous, but the room has
a raw energy that is fueled by live jazz and a sense of history.
Looking around, you expect Jack Kerouac to show up any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico's, 504 Broadway; (415) 982-6223. Dinner main courses,
$11.95 to $22.25.
</P>
<P>
   When the Black Cat opened just across the street in June, the
city's outspoken mayor, Willie Brown, reportedly looked around the
room and said, ``Well, they finally named a restaurant after me.''
Indeed; few restaurants fit so perfectly into their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Broadway,'' the menu says, ``Black Cat celebrates the
uneasy pot that never quite melts _ San Francisco.'' The owner,
Reed Hearon, conceived the casual restaurant as a tribute to
Broadway, filling the menu with dishes from the neighborhood's
past. The food honors Chinatown with dishes like brightly colored
chow mein with roast duck, chanterelles and Chinese chives and
soothing salmon jook, a thick rice chowder with ginger and shiitake
mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winner among the Chinese-style dishes is spot
prawns, fished live from a tank and poached simply in the Cantonese
style. To New Yorkers unfamiliar with the big, succulent West Coast
prawns (which are often laden with roe), they are a special treat.
The tank also houses Dungeness crabs, which are cooked in the
Chinese manner (black beans, ginger and scallions) or the Italian
(spiced and served atop spaghetti).
</P>
<P>
   The Italian food tends to be more delicate than the heavily
sauced, garlicky food I remember from the old North Beach. There
is, for instance, a wonderful frito misto of artichokes and fennel
with shaved Parmesan, fragile ravioli filled with red snapper and
wild greens, and an awesome capponada that does not remotely
resemble the similarly named Sicilian eggplant salad. A robust
mixture of soaked bread, greens, tiny tomatoes, tuna, anchovies,
olives and hard-boiled eggs, capponada is a Lenten dish that I
found absolutely irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   This being San Francisco, you can also get sand dabs with tartar
sauce or a fine rib eye steak for two, on the bone. And for
dessert, be sure not to miss the donut holes filled with apricot or
ricotta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Black Cat, 501 Broadway; (415) 981-2233. Dinner main courses,
$9.50 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hearon's other restaurant, Rose Pistola, is also a conscious
tribute to the neighborhood. Named for one of the ``old stoves'' of
North Beach (Hearon traded Mrs. Pistola, 87, a permanent table for
the use of her name), it is a chic, modern homage to the Ligurian
people who first populated North Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Meals begin with little plates bearing clear, mingled flavors.
Shaved artichokes are dotted with fava beans and tossed with lemon
and parsley. Crostini are laden with prosciutto, bright green
leaves of arugula and figs grilled until they melt into the
crescenza cheese on top. Sardines are grilled and drizzled with
lemon. And rabbit livers are wrapped in pancetta, skewered with
rosemary and painted with tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   There are various pizzas and a few pasta dishes, and at the
heart of the menu are meat and fish simply grilled or roasted. But
the real triumph of Rose Pistola is the cioppino _ a huge silver
pot of San Francisco's famous seafood stew, rich with crab,
mussels, rockfish and calamari. Ladled into beautiful blue bowls,
it is how the stuff at Fisherman's Wharf longs to taste.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert there is another local treasure, sacripantina. The
original, a specialty of the nearby Stella Bakery, is a fluffy
blond cake that is as light as air. The Rose Pistola version is
denser, richer and, as far as I am concerned, an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Pistola, 532 Columbus Ave.; (415) 399-0499. Main courses,
$9.50 to $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   If Rose Pistola is a tribute to the past, the four-month-old
Tavolino is an ode to the future. A beautifully designed room with
walls washed with colors and trimmed in warm woods, it has
hand-blown glass lamps hanging over granite counters.
</P>
<P>
   The air, in this re-creation of a Venetian bacaro _ a place
serving the little snacks called cicchetti (pronounced
chee-KET-tee) _ is rich with garlic and olive oil. The wine list is
wonderful. And the food is surprising, savory, very delicious. Is
there anyone who could resist crisp brown little marbles that turn
out to be fried olives stuffed with anchovies?
</P>
<P>
   These little snacks are so good that it is easy to find yourself
eating more than you intended. House-made sausages are served with
polenta. Grilled nectarines are framed by rosy slices of prosciutto
and sweet, floppy chunks of Taleggio cheese. The leaves of arugula
on top are the perfect accent. I love the spicy olive-oil-braised
green beans and the crisp, long rectangles of soft polenta
punctuated by Gorgonzola cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Other terrific little tastes include seabass in saor, a classic
Venetian sweet and sour sauce, and tramezzini, pressed triangles of
sandwich with interesting fillings like portobello mushrooms and
goat Cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   Even desserts are impressive: I like the polenta tart with pears
and raspberries so much that it is hard to resist seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this high-end charm, there are still reminders
that some things about North Beach have not changed. One afternoon,
I watched two older gentlemen wander in at 3 and order martinis,
straight up, with a few tramezzini. It made me wish I still lived
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tavolino, 401 Columbus Ave.; (415) 392-1472. Little dishes from
$3.25 to $9.75.
</P>
<P>
   The most touching new restaurant in North Beach is L'Ostria del
Forno, a tiny little place that has recaptured the old spirit of
the neighborhood. There are just eight tables, only cash is
accepted and all the cooking is done in the pizza oven. The choice
of wines is limited to five bottles, none more than $20. ``Have the
sangiovese,'' our waitress told us, matter of factly, ``it's better
than the Chianti.''
</P>
<P>
   We took her advice on the food as well. And so we had cipolline
in agrodolce _ little onions simmered with vinegar, sugar and
oregano _ that were spare and good. Grilled sweet peppers were
slicked with olive oil, garlic and parsley. Speck, an Italian ham,
was paired with fat white beans, arugula and shavings of Parmesan
to make a robust and satisfying way to start a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The pizzas are fine, there is a robust roasted meat of the day
(served with potatoes) and good polenta, roasted in the oven with
Gorgonzola. A different baked pasta is pulled from the oven each
day.
</P>
<P>
   The food is hearty, uncomplicated and very satisfying, and the
prices are astonishingly low. The great ricotta cheese cake costs
just $3 and the espresso, which costs $1.50, is served with
biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the sweet little restaurant, you could easily
persuade yourself that nothing had changed in North Beach. When the
ghosts gather to play boccie in front of the church across the
street, I am sure they are smiling.
</P>
<P>
   L'Osteria del Forno, 519 Columbus Ave.; (415) 982-1124. Dishes
from $3.75 to $9.25.

BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO SAILING WITH THE ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something familiar about the slogan used by the Escape
Sailboat Co.: The Sailboat for the Rest of Us. If the phrase calls
to mind Apple Computer's famous 1980s pitch for the Macintosh, ``a
computer for the rest of us,'' well, that's fine with Peter
Johnstone, Escape's president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Macintosh redefined the personal computer
industry. Johnstone aims to do the same for sailing. Just as
mountain bikes rejuvenated bicycling, in-line skates blew skating
wide open and snowboards pushed the parameters of downhill skiing,
he wants to breathe new life into a sport that has been flagging
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people sail today, and far fewer new sailboats are sold,
than in the 1960s and 1970s. The Escape, an 11.5-foot dinghy, is
Johnstone's magic formula for reversing the trend. The Escape is
not loaded with high technology, but it uses technology to achieve
two goals that could prove crucial to luring the masses to sailing:
The Escape is cheap, and it is easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the sailing business, though, find Johnstone's
brashness and lofty claims a bit much. They dismiss his new
sailboat as nothing more than a toy and contend that it will do
little to revitalize the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone's sailboat is cheap because it is built of plastic, a
material that old salts scorn but that keeps construction costs
down. The basic Escape model sells for just $2,000, compared with
about $3,000 for similarly sized fiberglass boats. The cheapest
starter Escape model goes for just $700.
</P>
<P>
   And it is easy to use because of its innovative design and such
helpful gizmos as a color-coded wind-direction indicator that shows
sailors how to orient the sails. Novices can master the basics in
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing never moved forward after the 60s,'' said Johnstone,
who is 32. ``All that we're about is removing the barriers to
entry. Our whole schtick is to make it so simple that anybody who
ever thought about sailing would try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers are beginning to try it. Johnstone said his company,
based in Portsmouth, R.I., sold about 1,900 Escapes last year and
expects to sell about 4,000 this year. That does not sound like a
lot until one realizes that the entire U.S. sailing industry sold
about 14,000 boats last year, counting everything from eight-foot
dinghies to millionaires' mega-yachts.
</P>
<P>
   As with small sailboats, bicycles were pretty much the domain of
children and a few hard-core racers until some Northern California
enthusiasts added knobby tires and heavy-duty components to start
the mountain bike craze. Skates were kid stuff, too, until
Rollerblade Inc. put the wheels in line and reinvented the sport.
And while snowboards are the bane of ski snobs, no one can dispute
that they have brought thousands of new people to the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, selling sailboats today is harder than it was back in
the 1960s. After all, there were no personal computers, mountain
bikes or sea kayaks then to consume spare time _ and there was more
spare time to consume. Another problem is that too many people
associate sailing with the America's Cup races and with yacht
clubs, which often come across as exclusive and excluding.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not just the sport's elitist image that turned off
consumers. Market research showed that many people were intimidated
by sailboats, viewing them as too expensive, too complicated to
operate and too easy to tip over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criteria were simply to overcome these objections,''
Johnstone said. ``The entire goal was to redefine and reinvent the
sport for the mainstream public. So when the potential customer
thinks, `Should I look at sailing?' they know there's a new
user-friendly alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   What most sets the Escape apart from conventional sailboats is
the way that its hull and deck are constructed of plastic from a
single mold rather than being built separately with fiberglass and
then attached together.
</P>
<P>
   This method holds several advantages. While the plastic _
rotomolded polyethylene, the same material that is used in modern
kayaks _ is not as strong or as light as fiberglass, it reduces
manufacturing costs by 75 percent. It is also more resistant to
scratches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the hull shape _ broad and flat at the
waterline _ makes the boat more stable and less likely to tip over.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape's rigging is also different. The mast is made of
carbon fiber, meaning that it bends more easily than the standard
aluminum or wood, letting it spill excess wind that might overpower
a novice sailor. The boom, the horizontal spar that holds the
bottom of the sail, stands by itself rather than extending from the
mast. That makes it less likely to bang heads, and allows the
boat's operator to shorten the sails quickly if the wind kicks up,
thus preventing the boat from capsizing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beginners, not surprisingly, love the Escape. ``It's not very
tippy, and sure enough, it is easy to learn,'' said Kathryn Tarsa,
a 40-something newcomer to sailing who bought an Escape with her
husband, John, last year to sail near their home in Duxbury, Mass.
``The video showed exactly how to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some longtime seafarers see the attraction of the boat. Si
Kamen, 78, is an experienced sailor who owns a larger boat, but he
keeps an Escape at the dock behind his home in Bel Marin Keys,
Calif., because it is so quick to set up. ``It performs pretty
well,'' he said. Best of all, ``you unroll the sail and you're off,
in two minutes.'' He adds, though, that he would like more leg
room.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of the Escape sailboats by the sailing establishment
have been mixed, with some deriding them as plastic pool toys and
others praising any product that can bring fresh faces to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape ``is sort of a crossover boat between your typical
beach toy and your real boat,'' said Robert Perry, a naval
architect and columnist for Sailing magazine, who keeps an Escape
at his beachfront home near Seattle. ``I sail the 11.5-footer onto
the beach full bore. It's supremely designed for that use.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Colgate, president of the Offshore Sailing School, a chain
based in Fort Myers, Fla., has bought four Escapes for his
children's classes, but he said he did not believe the boat was a
significant advance over the classic Sunfish, the quintessential
beach boat that was introduced 45 years ago and is the all-time
best-selling sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday, about 10,000 to 15,000 Sunfishes, which were
not much more than a sail attached to a shallow-hulled board wide
enough for one or two people to sit on, were sold annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hype is far beyond what it delivers,'' Colgate
said of the Escape. ``Once you learn to sail the Escape, which
takes maybe an hour, where do you go from there? Then you need to
get into something with more challenge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One thing that irks Colgate, not surprisingly, is the assertion
that the Escape eliminates the need for sailing lessons. It is an
assertion aggressively promoted by Johnstone, whose name means
something in the sailboat industry. Twenty years ago, his father
and uncle founded Jboats, a successful maker of racing sailboats in
Newport, R.I. After graduating from college, Johnstone joined the
company alongside several siblings and cousins, but his strong
opinions soon brought him a polite invitation to leave, he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he formed a partnership, with North Sails, the leading maker
of high-performance sails, and Gary Jobson, a former America's Cup
skipper, to buy the Sunfish and Laser brands from a struggling
manufacturer. Although they succeeded in reviving these two
venerable designs, naming their company Sunfish Laser Inc.,
Johnstone said they were dismayed to discover virtually all of
their sales were to longtime sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a new outlet, they conceived the Escape, which was
introduced in April 1996. Once the new design seemed to attract
interest, they sold Sunfish Laser last year to Vanguard Sailboats
Inc., a leading maker of small racing boats, also based in
Portsmouth. Escape now offers four hull sizes, and two kinds of
rigs. It has also recently branched out to offer plastic canoes.
</P>
<P>
   While sailing traditionalists frown on plastic, regarding it as
an inferior material, it is rapidly gaining acceptance at the low
end of the boating market. Vanguard now offers a plastic boat, the
Pico, at $2,095; a plastic trimaran, the Windrider, from Wilderness
Systems has also been a strong seller at $3,350. (A trimaran is
similar to a catamaran, but has three parallel hulls instead of
two.) The Hobie Cat Co. actually introduced the first rotomolded
plastic boat, a 13-foot catamaran called the Wave, in October 1994.
At $3,595, it is now the company's best-selling boat.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry longtimers question the material's longevity.
A short life span could be a plus for the industry, though, if it
encourages people to replace their boats more frequently. Because
fiberglass stands up so well, companies like Sunfish Laser and
Hobie have had to compete with their own products on the used
market, where boats can be had for a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone readily concedes that rotomolded plastic becomes
brittle with prolonged exposure to sunlight, and he estimates the
life of an Escape from as little as 5 years if left outside in the
Caribbean, to 15 years, sailed seasonally in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to deal with used Sunfish 45 years after
they were built,'' he said, ``we'll have to deal with Escapes for
15 years.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Saturday night to Monday night, 48 inches of snow
accumulated at the town of Galena in the Black Hills of South
Dakota as a potent winter-like low pressure system forged across
the northern Rockies and northern Plains. Wednesday, the center of
the weakening low will move into the Canadian province of Ontario.
Nonetheless, the system will leave a legacy of showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the eastern half of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains will douse parts of the eastern
Great Lakes region as moist air streaming north from the Gulf of
Mexico is lifted by a slow-moving cold front attached to the
Ontario low. Rainfalls in excess of an inch are possible from
eastern Michigan to northern Kentucky. The heavy rainfall will
shift eastward to western New York and Pennsylvania on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms marking the cold front
will extend southward to the central Gulf States. Brief downpours
are possible. Some storms may contain gusty winds, but the risk of
severe weather will be limited by the lack of energetic jet stream
winds that could augment the lifting of low-level moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, partial to full sunshine will bathe eastern New
England as an area of high pressure retreating slowly east shields
the region from inclement weather developing along and west of the
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate rains will develop over west-facing slopes
of the Cascades as moist Pacific winds blowing from the southwest
are forced to rapidly ascend the sloping terrain. Rainfalls of an
inch are possible in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Closes In
</P>
<P>
   Winter has begun to close in, launching a seasonal assault on
two fronts. On the northern front, winter has gained a foothold on
northern Alaska, where splotches of light snow fell Tuesday with
temperatures hovering in the 20s and 30s. Winter also attacks from
above, slowly descending earthward as it wages war with fading
warmth in the upper atmosphere. Tuesday, between 8 and 12 inches of
snow blanketed the mountains of southeast Wyoming, while, to the
east over the lofty Black Hills of South Dakota, heavy snow was
whipped into a blizzard frenzy by winds gusting to 60 mph.

`RECIPES 1-2-3 MENU COOKBOOK': DAILY MENUS, LESS SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers like to brag that you can get absolutely
any ingredient in the city. I think this is probably true. I've
tracked down fresh curry leaves, a tropical fruit called a genep
and soft wheat berries with almost no effort. What they don't tell
you is that these ingredients are never all in one place. In a
year's time, not once have I been able to buy everything for a
recipe-testing session in one store. Instead, I run all over the
city and am usually exhausted before I even begin cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Rozanne Gold, who lives in New York City, responded to this
tedious aspect of cooking with her first book, ``Recipes 1-2-3''
(Viking, 1996), in which no recipe had more than three ingredients,
not including salt and pepper. With fewer ingredients, shopping
becomes less painful, and cooking times and techniques tend to be
simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gold's second book, ``Recipes 1-2-3 Menu Cookbook'' (Little,
Brown, $25), follows the same set of rules, but this time the
recipes are grouped into menus for morning, noon and night.
Arranged this way, a menu of four dishes, for instance, has a
maximum of 12 ingredients. Which isn't bad when you consider how
many you have to hunt down for your average salsa.
</P>
<P>
   She is a clever cook. She doesn't allow a recipe for poached
prunes with cardamom yogurt to rest as is. She has you reduce the
prune poaching liquid to make an intense sauce. And she doesn't cut
corners. In the same recipe she instructs you to strain the yogurt,
making it much denser and creamier and markedly improving a simple
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some recipes inevitably suffer as a result of the
three-ingredient rule. I made the menu called ``a dinner of
aromatics,'' which included a warm goat cheese and fresh mint
salad, Bombay leg of lamb with yogurt and lime, curried couscous
with currants and chilled sliced oranges with rose water and dates.
The lamb was delicious, though my guests could have lived without
the sauce, which tasted fine but had curdled. (More explicit
instructions, about not letting it boil, for example, might have
helped prevent this.)
</P>
<P>
   But the couscous, which worked perfectly and was extremely
fragrant, could have been so much better with a little butter. In
fact, it was: I tried it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   It made me wonder whether the dishes I tried were good, or just
good for dishes containing three ingredients. Would it be better to
go all out on one dish and round out the menu with things like
bread, salad and a cheese course? I'm torn on this point, but not
on another: Ms. Gold's approach is so well executed and so many of
the dishes impress upon you the power of wholesome, quality
ingredients that it is far better than any cookbook promoting easy
cooking that I've tried.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBAY LEG OF LAMB WITH YOGURT AND LIME
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Recipes 1-2-3 Menu Cookbook''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes, plus 6 to 8 hours' marinating
</P>
<P>
   1 2-pound boned leg of lamb, butterflied
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain low-fat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 large limes
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large nonreactive bowl, combine lamb and yogurt. Grate
zest of 1 lime, and squeeze the juice of 2 limes (you will have
approximately 1/4 cup). Add to bowl with freshly ground black
pepper and the salt. Mix well so that lamb is thoroughly coated
with yogurt marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Turn
once or twice during the marinating period.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat the broiler. Remove lamb from the marinade. Place
lamb in a heavy baking pan. Place marinade in a small pot.
</P>
<P>
   3. Broil lamb on each side for 6 to 8 minutes. It should be 150
degrees on a meat thermometer for rare; 160 degrees for
medium-rare. Meanwhile, warm marinade over low heat, whisking
constantly; do not let boil. Remove lamb from oven. Let rest 5
minutes. Slice thinly, and serve with marinade (if curdled, pour
through a fine strainer).
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

BILL MAHER AND THE PROS AND CONS OF A SCANDAL  
 BROUHAHA OVER LINCOLN WHITE HOUSE SITCOM  
 STAR SEARCH FOR ANOTHER `60 MINUTES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: bylines at end of articles)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're doing a show called ``Politically Incorrect,'' it has
to help when a political scandal is dominating the news, right?
</P>
<P>
   The star of the ABC show of that name, Bill Maher, is not
totally convinced. ``I'm sure it's been good for the show, because
it's something anyone can weigh in on,'' Maher said. ``You don't
have to explain the issue, and frequently people are passionate
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside: ``People are sick of it. They want it to end, and
they kind of blame the messenger a little bit. You're talking about
it so you're part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Maher himself is sick of talking about the travails of
President Clinton. ``It's fascinating; I never get sick of it,'' he
said during an interview at the studios of the Comedy Central
program ``The Daily Show,'' where he was a guest this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, derisively, that it's all about whether Clinton
gets to keep his job,'' he continued. ``I think that's right. It's
really important that he keep his job to prove this kind of attack
can't succeed. That you can't just say, `OK, we've got a lot of
money, a lot of lawyers and we'll find something and we'll get you
out of there.' That's treason. That's like a coup. That's like a
fourth branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher makes no pretense at being objective on the subject.
``It's obvious I'm backing Clinton on this one,'' he said, ``though
I have been tough on him on a lot of things in the past.'' That
only makes it harder to balance the show every night, he said,
because in Hollywood, where ``Politically Incorrect'' is taped,
celebrities who don't come down on Clinton's side are a rare
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the celebrities say get out of his sex life,'' he said,
``because celebrities know what it's like to have their privacy
invaded. And they're all liberals anyway. Once you get past Pat
Boone and Charlton Heston, there's not a lot of conservative
celebrities. They're worth their weight in gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher said he usually tries to steer the conversation into new
areas, like the night he argued that Clinton's responses in the
grand jury could be seen as an act of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   His search for new angles on the story has extended to his
nightly monologue, he said, where he has pushed his writers to
steer clear of all the obvious jokes. ``I see the same kind of
jokes from other people,'' he said. ``I try to do jokes with some
point of view. I don't like neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent example Maher cited: `'I've never seen a story that
turned so many cliches on their head. Because this really IS about
dirty laundry, and they really DID make a federal case out of
nothing.''
</P>

   White House Farce
</P>
<P>
   A group that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson gathered as planned
Monday for a protest rally urging the cancellation of UPN's new
sitcom ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' but the more
effective protest was a silent one. Viewers stayed away in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy, a farce set in the Lincoln White House and centering
on an aristocratic black Englishman who has mistakenly become
Abraham Lincoln's butler, made its debut Monday night at 9. But it
drew only 2.06 million viewers, with a Nielsen rating of 1.6 (each
rating point represents 994,000 homes).
</P>
<P>
   At 7 that morning, Jackson (who was in Los Angeles to attend the
funeral of former Mayor Tom Bradley later that day) and about 200
others gathered outside Paramount Studios to complain that
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' made light of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   UPN president Dean Valentine has said that the show has nothing
to do with slavery other than being set in the Civil War period. He
also has said that the protesters will not determine the show's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the American public tells us they hate the show,''
Valentine said, ``it'll come off, just like any other network
show.''

<P>
   `60 Minutes' More
</P>
<P>
   Because ``60 Minutes'' is the grand old monarch of all network
news magazines, the growing pains of its offspring have been
matters of great curiosity in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any serious television news correspondent not already
locked into a dream job has seen his or her name tossed out as a
candidate for a correspondent's job on ``60 Minutes II,'' which is
to take a midweek time slot on CBS early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the span of one week, from last week to this, Chris
Wallace of ABC News (whose father, Mike Wallace, is one of the
originals on the original ``60 Minutes''), has gone from being
labeled can't miss to dismissed as out of the running. (The truth,
as of Tuesday, remained somewhere in between.)
</P>
<P>
   Still considered front-runners are three CBS veterans _ Dan
Rather, Bob Simon and Vicki Mabrey _ and one from well outside the
bloodlines, PBS's Charlie Rose. Reached Tuesday, Rose said: ``This
is going to happen, and I'm so excited.'' He said he would be a
contributor rather than a full-time correspondent because he will
keep his own weeknight interview program on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   With all that said, CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius had the
following comment Tuesday: ``Not a single correspondent agreement
has been signed yet.''

FOR JON LOVITZ, A HARD JOB TO ACCEPT: A SLAIN BUDDY'S SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman was more than a
longtime comedy partner on ``Saturday Night Live'' in the 1980s,
more even than a friend so close they often spent Thanksgiving and
other holidays together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like my older brother,'' Lovitz said, a sentiment he
repeated many times in a choked voice during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For Lovitz, the anguish of Hartman's death last May, when,
according to the police, he was killed in his home by his wife,
Brynn, who later shot herself to death, was compounded by an
emotional conflict when he was asked to replace Hartman as the star
of the NBC series ``News Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   He joins the series Oct. 7 in its second episode of the season.
The first episode dealt with the rest of the cast's reaction to the
death of Hartman's character, Bill McNeal. Lovitz joins the staff
of the fictional New York radio station WNYX as Max Lewis, who will
be described as a close friend of Bill McNeal.
</P>
<P>
   While Lovitz now says he believes his joining the show is
``comforting to me and the rest of the cast,'' the decision did not
come lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after Phil died I was at a friend's house,'' Lovitz
said. ``Everybody was devastated and really in shock.'' Somebody in
the group noted that Hartman left behind some continuing roles,
including his starring role in ``News Radio.'' Lovitz turned to
Brad Grey, his manager and one of the executive producers of ``News
Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Brad: `They better not come to me to replace
Phil,''' Lovitz said. ``The show wasn't doing that well, and I just
thought me joining it would be manipulative. I thought I'd be
profiting from his death. And I didn't want to face the fact that
he was gone. So I said it to Brad, never thinking they would offer
it to me in a million years. I didn't even think they should
continue with the show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the offer did come, in a discussion with the show's creator,
Paul Simms. ``Paul just said to me: `I don't know what to tell you.
You're his friend. It feels right. Everybody in the cast wants
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reality was that Lovitz was looking for a new
television role. Only weeks earlier he had starred in a pilot for
an ABC comedy, one in which Hartman showed up for his guest
appearance a day after his father died despite Lovitz's assurances
that he could be replaced. When ABC did not order a series from the
pilot, Lovitz said he had decided to ``hook up on a show on NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the way he wanted to join a show, he said. ``At
first I thought people are going to say he's only there because
Phil got murdered _ and now let's be funny!''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitz discussed the idea with friends in and out of show
business, people like Herb Sargent, the ``Saturday Night Live''
writer, and the family of Lisa Kudrow, from the NBC series
``Friends,'' whom Lovitz grew up with in suburban Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Mrs. Kudrow, and she said, `You're not profiting from
his death.' She's like the most moral person I know. I thought, if
she's saying it, then I'm not. And Paul Simms said, `Because Phil
was murdered, I don't want the show murdered.' That made sense to
me. That got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally at a memorial service, Hartman's mother approached
Lovitz. ``His mother said to me, `Thank you for picking up the
flag.' When she said that, I breathed a huge sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitz met Hartman in 1984, when they were members of the Los
Angeles improvisational comedy group called the Groundlings. ``Phil
had been there for like 10 years,'' Lovitz said. ``He was the king
of the Groundlings.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the two began working together on sketches
centering on one of Hartman's signature characters, Chick Hearn, a
1940s-style detective. Lovitz loved the speaking style of old movie
characters and, in fooling around with another friend, developed
his signature character, the Liar.
</P>
<P>
   The character helped him win a spot on ``Saturday Night Live''
in 1985. ``It was the biggest break I ever had,'' Lovitz said. He
remembered walking into the show's offices and seeing photos of
prospective cast members piled in knee-high stacks. ``And I
thought: How did I ever get out of those stacks?''
</P>
<P>
   His entire time on the show, Lovitz said, he found himself full
of doubt. ``People would ask and I'd say, `Oh, I'm on ``Saturday
Night L . . .' I couldn't say `Live.' I just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But his Liar character, which he performed in 13 sketches in his
first season on the show, was an instant national phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Lovitz said. ``One Sunday my father
called me and said, `Look at Doonesbury.' And Doonesbury had done a
whole cartoon about the Liar. I was like, `Oh my God!' People came
up and said, `Ted Kennedy is doing the Liar on the Senate floor!'''
</P>
<P>
   After that first season, ``Saturday Night'' executive producer
Lorne Michaels asked Lovitz to recommend new cast members. He
pushed for Hartman, of course. ``I remember Lorne saying, `He's
been in the Groundlings 11 years. Don't you think there's a reason
why? I told Lorne: `If you like me, you've got to like him. He's
better than me. He's a genius.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels did offer Hartman a spot, but he proved to be
reluctant, Lovitz said. ``He liked doing his Groundlings scripts
and living in his house in Encino.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman turned the job down, only to be talked into
reconsidering by Lovitz and other friends. ``Phil was very laid
back. He wasn't competitive,'' Lovitz said. ``Once he got there, of
course, he was great for the show. He could do anything. It was
really great having him there. We wrote a lot of things together.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years, Lovitz moved on to films (``A League of Their
Own''); Hartman stayed on at ``Saturday Night Live'' for four more
seasons. The two men remained close. Lovitz was one of few people
invited to Hartman's wedding in 1988. He remained an intimate
friend throughout the marriage, which is one reason Lovitz said he
was upset by news coverage after Hartman's death that included
interviews with people who identified themselves as friends of the
Hartmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these people dredging up dirt.'' Lovitz said.
``I can tell you I've never seen any of these people in the 14
years I knew Phil and the 10 years I knew Brynn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real friends don't talk about any of this. These people are
just profiteers on murder. They're trying to get famous over
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitz says he wants Hartman's memory to be celebrated by
friends and fans and that's ultimately why he joined ``News
Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are going to compare me, I can't please them all,''
he said. ``I don't care. I'm the first to say I'm not as good as
Phil. I'm different from him. I can't do what he did. So I'll just
do my thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important is this is a group of people, and they
decided to continue the show, and not quit, in his honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitz said he insisted that his character be written as one of
Hartman's character's closest friends so the recollections of him
would be heartfelt, for character and actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy to be there and everything,'' Lovitz said.
``And then I see a box with his clothes in the hallway or a picture
of him. They had taken this picture of him down and I told them,
`Leave it there.' I'd give up everything to have Phil back. It's
like the most horrible thing. Now I want everybody to look at me in
the show and just think it's him.''

Southeastern Legal Foundation may have violated its tax-exempt

the Republican party. The 22-year-old public interest law firm has
recently raised its profile by challenging in federal court the
Clinton administration's plans to use statistical sampling to get a
more accurate count of minorities in the 2000 census. But a letter
from Amos McMullian, a foundation board member and chief executive

INGELS A KIEV SURVIVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Raspy-voiced funnyman Marty Ingels is at his
happiest in restaurants, so it makes sense that his show will move
to one in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Ingels, whose popular hourlong call-in program can be heard at 7
p.m. Monday through Thursday on Glendale talk radio KIEV-AM (870),
will broadcast from a specially built studio at the soon-to-open
Legacy eatery on Sunset Boulevard starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to Marty'' features celebrity and listener chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the pendulum is turning away from the shock-jock
thing,'' Ingels said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Married to actress Shirley Jones for 21 years, comedian-producer
Ingels caught the radio bug when onetime ``Partridge Family'' child
actor turned Chicago nighttime talk host Danny Bonaduce invited him
on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ingels eventually filled in for Bonaduce for two weeks and then
went looking for a station to hire him. Nobody bit, so Ingels
bought time on KIEV in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most natural thing,'' he said. ``I realized this
was my place.''
</P>
<P>
   When new owner Salem Communications took over KIEV and fired
many longtime staffers, Ingels was put on contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty's humorous, yet intelligent and sensitive format seems
to be the perfect balance to the solid issues-oriented lineup
already in place,'' said Salem vice president Dave Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ingels says his own career ``has had more dips and
turns than the Matterhorn. But I'm really old-fashioned, and I
believe in restraint and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests on ``Talk to Marty'' have included Charlton Heston, Red
Buttons, Shecky Greene, Gloria Allred, Phyllis Diller and others.
</P>
<P>
   HUMBLE HARVE RETURNS: Longtime disc jockey Humble Harve returns
to oldies radio KRLA-AM (1110) this weekend to launch a new doo-wop
show.
</P>
<P>
   Harve, born Harvey Miller, has worked at many of the area's top
stations, most recently country radio KZLA-FM (93.9) on weekends.
He worked at KRLA throughout the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Harve's new ``Doo-Wop Heaven'' can be heard on KRLA at 10 a.m.
Saturday and noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE OF KFI HOSTS: You're invited to watch talk radio KFI-AM
(640) afternoon team John and Ken debate morning man Bill Handel on
the Clinton-Lewinsky mess at the Museum of Television and Radio
(465 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills) from 5 to 7 p.m. Friday.
Parking is available in the museum garage or nearby lots.

NOT HALF BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Unusual forces fighting evil are the new arrivals
on Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The WB offers up ``Charmed,'' which focuses on three good
witches fighting evil and also marks the reunion of Shannen Doherty
and Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   UPN will debut ``Seven Days,'' in which an alcoholic mental
patient saves the world. &QL; 
CHARMED &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' wasn't enough for you, the WB
has upped the ante threefold with ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one, not two, but three attractive young women will try to
rid the world of warlocks the way Buffy tries to exterminate
vampires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed'' is the story of the three Halliwell sisters _ Prue
(Shannen Doherty), Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) and Piper (Holly Marie
Combs) _ who are an excellent cast of those who cast spells.
</P>
<P>
   They are brought together after the death of their mother and
spend their days bickering with each other in the creepy San
Francisco Victorian fixer-upper their mother left them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sisters, while snooping around the attic, happens
upon ``The Book of Shadows.'' In it she discovers that she and her
sisters are witches and each has a specific power.
</P>
<P>
   Prue can move objects, Phoebe can see the future, and Piper can
stop time. They also find that when they chant in unison _ ``The
power of three will set us free'' _ they are an unstoppable force.
</P>
<P>
   This show is not nearly as campy as ``Buffy,'' but its special
effects are wonderful, and it just might find its audience on the
television schedule. It is certainly distinctive and plays right to
the crowds that have flocked to see such movies as ``Scream'' and
``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Having hit teen drama ``Dawson's Creek'' as its lead-in won't
hurt ``Charmed'' any, either.
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW: ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: &UR; : &LR;  Three good witches fight bad witches in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   THE STARS: Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano,
T.W. King.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE &UR; : &LR;  The WB (Channel 5).
</P>
<P>
   WHEN &UR; : &LR;  9 p.m. Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating &UR; : &LR;  2 { Stars.
</P>
<P>
   SEVEN DAYS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Parker (Jonathan LaPaglia) is a belligerent alcoholic who
resides in the CIA mental hospital. He is also the best man to do a
difficult and dangerous job, as he is highly intelligent and
performs even better under duress.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA offers Parker a trade-off: He will be released from the
mental hospital if he agrees to join their covert operation.
</P>
<P>
   The president, vice president and the speaker of the House have
been killed by a terrorist, and the country needs a quick fix. The
CIA wants to send Parker on an experimental time machine to go back
in time seven days and alter history.
</P>
<P>
   Parker accepts the mission and saves the world. But everything
he does, including making a seemingly harmless bet on a basketball
game, will affect history.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of the show is a two-hour movie, which is not
always the best indicator of the future of a series, but the
presentation was slick and the story compelling. Once you get past
the time travel and Parker's past, it requires no unbelievable
leaps. There are enough light moments to keep you glued, and
LaPaglia is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW: ``Seven Days.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: A science-fiction thriller about a covert military unit
with a top-secret operation that allows one person to go back in
time seven days to prevent present-day catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   THEN STARS: Jonathan LaPaglia, Don Franklin, Norman Lloyd,
Justina Vail, Nick Searcy, Alan Scarfe, Sam Whipple.

   The top ten ways the Bible would have been different if it had

</P>
<P>
   10. The Last Supper would have been eaten the next
morning--cold.
</P>
<P>
   9. The Ten Commandments are actually only five, double-spaced,
and written in a large font.
</P>
<P>
   8. New edition every two years in order to limit reselling.
</P>
<P>
   7. Forbidden fruit would have been eaten because it wasn't
cafeteria food.
</P>
<P>
   6. Paul's letter to the Romans becomes Paul's e-mail to
abuse(AT)romans.gov.
</P>
<P>
   5. Reason Cain killed Abel: They were roommates.
</P>
<P>
   4. The place where the end of the world occurs: Finals, not
Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   3. Out go the mules, in come the mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Reason why Moses and followers walked in the desert for 40
years: They didn't want to ask directions and look like freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   1. Instead of God creating the world in six days and resting on
the
</P>
<P>
   seventh, He would have put it off until the night before it was
due and
</P>
<P>
   then pulled an all-nighter.

<P>
   As a result, investment clubs hew to a simple strategy: Pick
solid companies, invest in them regularly, and don't try to jump in
and out on every bit of news.
</P>
<P>
   With many stocks now off peak prices, clubs are readying their
shopping lists. Members of four clubs, who have shared their
strategies with Cox writers Hank Ezell and Robert Luke over the
past two years, met again Sept. 11 to discuss their latest moves.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are your members saying about the market? Are they
nervous?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Williams, 60, of Best Buy Investment Club, is a retired
transportation engineer: Most of them are not. They think this is a
good opportunity to buy good stocks at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Werner, 45, of the Women's Investment Society for
Education, helps form other clubs: We just had a meeting. There was
almost jubilance. There were no sad faces, no panicky questions. As
our treasurer said, `Gee, stocks have gone on sale.'
</P>
<P>
   The biggest dilemma of the night was that we don't have enough
money to do what we want to do. It all had to do with what should
we buy and how should we buy it. Should we spread the money around
through DRIP (dividend reinvestment) programs? Should we buy more
(oil services giant) Schlumberger to take advantage of the price
right now? Should we save our money until next month, to see if we
can buy some of these great companies that are on our shopping
list?
</P>
<P>
   Q:So what did you decide?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: We decided, after much discussion, to buy 65 shares of
(specialty chemicals maker) RPM.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any particular reason for adding that stock to your portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: I think it was because we had just studied RPM. We liked
it in July at $16, but we didn't have enough money to buy (steel
maker) Nucor and RPM. We bought Nucor then. Now, all of a sudden,
RPM was at $14, paying a 3.3 percent dividend yield. We decided
we'd take advantage of this low price now.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any tips for finding bargains?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Reno, 52, of Mutual Investors of Atlanta, is comptroller
of the Army's Second Recruiting Brigade: Develop a watch list. You
identify good companies that are outside your buy range. When it
hits that buy range, start buying.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Commit all your money at once?
</P>
<P>
   Reno: Normally not. What we like to do is get 10 or 15 shares,
get into the DRIP program if it's available. You get the advantage
of dollar-cost averaging. You may reduce the commissions. If the
market goes down, you could pick up additional shares at even
better prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clair Redmond, 51, of Buckhead Investment Club, is a Forest
Service economist: Investment clubs usually don't have enough money
to buy a big stake. You start off small.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is there a sense that the bargains are just beginning to
emerge, or is there an urgency to buy, and buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: We may have the market come down a little bit more. You
still have several Dow (Jones industrial average) stocks like
General Electric selling at a price-to-earnings multiple of
28-plus. Merck is selling at over 28, Johnson &AMP; Johnson is selling
at a P/E of over 28, and you have Wal-Mart selling at a P/E of 34.
</P>
<P>
   These companies have good growth, but I don't think any of them
have growth that's over 20 percent that would justify the high P/E
multiples.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond: There's got to be some corrections in those big stocks
before this is all over with.
</P>
<P>
   Williams: The market is where it was last October. That's not
big enough of a pullback, in my opinion. Most stocks, even at
today's prices, are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So will they go lower if the economy continues to slow?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: Yes. Definitely that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Werner: But I think there are some attractive buys out there
now. They might get more attractive, but you don't time the market.
If the stocks meet your criteria, as far as being a good solid
company at a reasonable price, go ahead and buy.
</P>
<P>
   If the market pulls them down further, that's when you use the
dividend reinvestment programs and dollar-cost average over time.
We're not buying stocks today for tomorrow or next year or even
three years from now. We're buying companies, not stocks, and for
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Q:But isn't there a tendency on the part of investors to avoid
putting more money into stocks in which they have a loss, at least
on paper?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: Yes. It's really difficult for new clubs and new
investors to put more money into something that's declining. Their
faith is shaken.
</P>
<P>
   With our club, Century Telephone did nothing for two years after
we bought it. Earnings kept going up, the price kept going down or
staying the same, and the P/E ratio kept getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   There was no bad news for this company, except the negative
outlook for the industry it's in. Several times the question came
up whether we should add to Century Telephone. But we were
reluctant to do so because the stock hadn't performed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in six months time, it doubled in value.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So is there a lesson to be learned?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: I believe the lesson is that just because a stock
doesn't do anything over a short period of time, it doesn't mean
that the value won't be recognized at some point in the future.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've done your homework, and the company is
fundamentally strong, you need to have the faith and courage to add
to your holdings while the price is attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is that what you did with Norrell?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. We added to our holdings last summer, near its
high, right before the stock plunged on an earnings warning. After
a slight rebound, we added once again. Now, the market has taken
the stock price a lot lower. The decision at the last meeting was
to hold and not buy more.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that at the current price of $14, P/E of 15, and
projected growth rate of 15 percent to 20 percent, Norrell appears
to be an excellent buy for the long term. However, it is a
small-cap company, with only 19 million shares outstanding, which
may not make it appropriate for all clubs or investors.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   Werner: It may be inappropriate because of the illiquidity of
the stock, which makes it a lot more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any other bargains out there?
</P>
<P>
   Redmond: We like (insurer) AFLAC (which derives most of its
revenues and profits in Japan). It's got a P/E of about 18.5 now.
It had been really high until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Isn't that because of Japan's economic problems?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: The problem with AFLAC is not the Japanese economy.
They have a lock on cancer insurance there, and the Japanese are
not giving up their insurance. The problem is the currency
fluctuations, which is making their earnings a lot lower than they
should be. But they are pushing their business in the United
States, and their growth here is up about 30 percent this year.
They're doing very well in the United States. Their cream comes
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Aren't a lot of companies facing pressure on their earnings
because of economic turmoil overseas? Doesn't that hurt their stock
prices?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: I had a college professor who told me, ``Only be
concerned about the things you can control.'' I can't control the
world economy, I can't control politics. I can control what good
companies I buy and how long I hold on to them. That's all I can
do.
</P>
<P>
   Werner: I have been reading that McDonald's has been over in
Southeast Asia buying properties cheap. Royal Dutch Petroleum has
been down in South America, buying stuff cheap. (Automotive parts
maker) Dana Corp. was in Europe three years ago buying companies
cheap. So some of these companies are taking advantage of the world
doom and gloom, and it's going to set them up to be better,
stronger companies in the future. Even Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola
are taking advantage of the bad situation in other countries.
They're buying things cheap. You just have to understand that if
you have well-managed, financially strong companies, with a
long-term outlook, the sun will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Q:OK, any other potential bargains?
</P>
<P>
   Redmond: If you're a contrarian, Citicorp is another good stock.
It has dropped 50 percent in price this year because it has so much
exposure to the Asian situation and uncertainties with the merger
with Travelers Group. It's got a P/E of about 10, and the P/E has
been as high as 16 or 17. It's going to be a while before they
bounce back, because of the Asian difficulties. That's something
that's five years out, if you want to start accumulating shares
now.
</P>
<P>
   Williams: One company we like is Fiserv. It's pulled back quite
a bit. They do the backroom service for banks and set up systems
for banks. They're super at it. Part of their growth has been by
acquisition, which will continue. But even without that they could
probably maintain 15 or 16 percent growth. With acquisitions,
they're growing about 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another one I like is (medical products maker) Stryker. It's
back in the buy range. It's dropped down from $48 to around $30 or
$32. Fantastic company.
</P>
<P>
   Werner: Stryker is buying Pfizer's Howmedica orthopedics unit
for $1.9 billion, and the stock took a pretty good dip after that
was announced. This is a company that for years has had 20 percent
growth and a dynamic CEO that drills into his employees this 20
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   I called the company and said I'm a long-term investor. But I
want to understand how much of a detour the company is taking (with
the Howmedica acquisition) and how long it's going to take to get
back to that 20 percent earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The company told me that probably over the next year they will
be below 10 percent growth as they digest this acquisition. They
should get back to 20 percent growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This acquisition is going to make them a bigger, stronger,
dominant company. It will have about 15 percent of the worldwide
market for devices to repair injured joints and bones.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm trying to say is that you take advantage of the
short-term problems and be patient for the long-term payoff. There
are reasons it's down, and the market in general is not helping.
But if you do the research, you can be a lot more comfortable
sitting on a stock that may be depressed a while.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Let's turn to some hometown companies. What are your thoughts
about Home Depot, which some of you have?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: I love it. It's back in our buy range. The outlook is
fantastic. Lowe's is really not hurting at all. In fact I think
Lowe's is helping them, because it's making them get a little bit
more aggressive on what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What about Coca-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: Coca-Cola is a fantastic company. I bought some last
week at $62, but I'll buy more when it's down below $58.
</P>
<P>
   Reno: I continue to buy shares for my wife. Matter of fact, she
came into a chunk of money and we bought more than our usual $100 a
month. But, yes, I'm still buying. I think it's getting better
every day as it comes down.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond: We discussed buying Coke at our last meeting, but
Disney won out because we hadn't purchased it for years and it was
more attractively priced, in our view.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any others you like?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: Synovus Financial is one we haven't discussed that I
really like. It's really high right now, but it might come down.
It's a fantastic company, especially with the (bank card processor)
Total System Services kick to it. They own 80 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   Werner: I follow Synovus for our club. Even though it's come
down from $25 to $18, I personally think it's overvalued. It has a
P/E of 29. It's high for a bank stock, even taking into
consideration Total System.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did you sell any stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Reno: We had a member cash out at our last meeting, so we had to
sell some stocks. We eliminated our position in (filter maker) Pall
and (electronic chip maker) Atmel.
</P>
<P>
   We had Pall, I think, about 18 months. It didn't meet our
anticipation. Earnings have been going down rather than up. They
just reported for the fiscal year, and they're down again. We just
felt like we could do better elsewhere. I think we broke pretty
close to even, but we took a loss in Atmel. We sold (at) between
$10 and $11. We bought it at $38.
</P>
<P>
   We also sold Motorola the previous month. We were cleaning
house.
</P>
<P>
   Williams: That's something we need to do from time to time. But
most people sell the good stocks. You ought to get rid of your bad
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Reno: We had a lengthy discussion on that. Get rid of your dogs.
With a portfolio of 10 stocks, you're going to have one or two
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any closing thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: It's a good time to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond: The last time we had a market downturn like this, in
1987, people were getting ready to jump off buildings. But those
who held off and didn't sell, they were back to normal within a
year. It may take a year for this market to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Reno: In '87, when it made the dive, I put some money in, and
I'm proud I did. I'm hoping that in the year 2003, when I look back
on '98, I can be real proud of it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Werner: The stock market has been my passion. I saw a chart in
Forbes that went back to 1801. And doggone it _ from 1801 to 1998 _
although there were a lot of ups and downs, the long-term trend for
stocks has always been up.

REPUBLICANS SEEK CLINTON COMPROMISE TO FUND GOVERNMENT, AVOID
SHUTDOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders said Tuesday that Congress would
not be able to finish work on all appropriations bills by its
scheduled adjournment deadline of Friday and asked President
Clinton to negotiate a compromise package that would fund the
government well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   But while extending the hand of compromise, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., accused President Clinton and
Democratic lawmakers of conspiring to force a government shutdown
to divert public attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching out to try to get some discussion with them as
to what they want (in the 1999 spending measures),'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said GOP leaders are ``concerned about a domestic `Wag
the Dog' scenario in which Clinton would veto a number of spending
bills this week and force a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to the movie in which a president stages a phony
war to distract attention from sexual misbehavior drew a sharp
response from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Press Secretary Joe Lockhart denied that there are any ``secret
plans'' to close government operations. He said Lott and other
Republican leaders should ``stop worrying about the politics and
start worrying about the job they were sent here to do and get the
work done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in session now for nine months,'' Lockhart added.
``We're now six days late (for the 1999 fiscal year that began on
Oct. 1).''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concerns, Lott said he was hopeful that White House
officials would meet with congressional leaders as early as today
to work out the details of rolling at least five of the 13 major
appropriations measures into one omnibus bill. He acknowledged that
packaging whatever the Republican-controlled Congress fails to pass
before Friday into one big measure is the only way to avoid an
interruption in government services and allow members time to
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers realized several weeks ago that they would not be able
to complete work on the major spending bills by Oct. 1, and adopted
a temporary funding measure that expires at midnight Friday. If
lawmakers fail to reach agreement with the White House on remaining
spending matters by then, they may have to pass another stopgap
measure until compromise agreements can be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Congress will complete work by Friday on no more than
eight of the 13 bills needed to fund government operations. That
would leave five that would have to be combined. But many of those,
covering everything from foreign operations, labor and commerce to
education, contain funding levels and amendments that have been the
source of disagreements between Clinton and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton wants $14 billion included in the State
Department spending bill to help shore up the International
Monetary Fund. But conservative Republicans, led by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Irving, are against it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants money to hire 100,000 new teachers and build
more schools, and wants to eliminate what he considers a number of
anti-environmental provisions in the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have is the president, as usual, and the
Democrats, want to spend more money,'' Lott said. He added that a
meeting with administration officials would try to focus on where
the ``major heartburn'' problems are with remaining legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking down, both sides appeared willing to
abandon a number of controversial positions to avoid a budget
stalemate like the one that forced partial government shutdowns in
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, for instance, announced that GOP conservatives had
dropped their insistence that school vouchers be included in the
District of Columbia funding measure that would allow parents to
send their children to private schools. Clinton had threatened to
veto the bill if the voucher program remained in it.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, meanwhile, Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., signaled that Democrats were ready to negotiate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time running out, we realize that we're not going to get
everything we want,'' he said. ``But we want a lot more than the
Republicans are offering.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has completed work on six of the 13
appropriations measures. But the $60 billion farm bill approved by
the Senate Tuesday could be headed for a veto because it falls $3
billion short of the $7 billion Clinton requested for emergency
relief to farmers and ranchers hit by drought and floods. &QL;

 &HT;    Wobbly world threatens to unseat U.S. economy
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut as the third quarter
came to an end was a clear sign policy-makers think the world's
economic problems are a threat to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The cut of a quarter of a percentage point in the federal funds
rate was about as small a change as the Fed could make. But it
symbolized Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's intention to prevent a
recession, which some analysts had begun to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan had warned the Senate Budget Committee in advance of
the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday about the danger of
``deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to domestic
markets ...''
</P>
<P>
   And clearly, the bailout of the huge Long-Term Capital
Management hedge fund showed the depth of the Fed's concern about
how vulnerable U.S. financial institutions might be.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rate cut, designed to stimulate the economy, was the
first rate change in almost a year and a half, and a dramatic
switch from the Fed's usual policy of guarding against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan and others have argued that inflation is in no
danger of becoming a problem in an environment of global deflation
and slower U.S. growth. In short, encouraging growth has replaced
fighting inflation as the Fed's strategic objective.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is expected to make additional rate cuts if necessary to
maintain the economy's growth and hold off the foreign threat.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the Fed was too cautious in cutting rates on
the first go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there is no commodity inflation whatsoever.
However, there is labor market inflation, and there's nothing that
is easing that off,'' said Georgia State University economist
Donald Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we we're starting to see some accelerating prices in
the service sector even as we're seeing deceleration or actual
declines in prices on commodities,'' he said. ``I think they (the
Fed) should have been more aggressive, but I understand their
reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed aimed chiefly at boosting the economy, analysts
said Greenspan and company were also concerned about the economic
impact of the stock market sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of household wealth due to declining stock prices has
been estimated as high as $1.5 trillion since the sell-off started
on July 17 _ when the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average peaked
at 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of loss that threatens to weaken consumer
spending, forcing people to curb their spendthrift habits, analysts
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the economy is that a drastic cut in consumer
spending has not yet occurred. If anything, the consumer is still
driving the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems in Asia, Russia and Latin America, coupled with
the prospect of further stock market losses, are expected to put
pressure on the economy over the next 12 to 18 months despite
interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say that the trade, investment and other
financial links now connecting world economies are what caused the
stock market sell-off and the U.S. economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary problem is not the market downturn itself, but the
world financial crisis that triggered the slide,'' said David A.
Wyss, Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian economies are showing few signs of recovery, and in
fact are tumbling deeper into recession. The Asian flu is also
showing signs of infecting South America,'' said Wyss.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian crisis is not directly connected to Asia, he
said it reflects and reinforces the increasing investor wariness of
all emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the world's economic problems are affected
primarily by Japan's reluctance to go through with promised
financial reforms. A Japanese rescue would go a long way toward
curing Asia's problems, it is thought.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's foot-dragging has led in turn to growing concern that
China, which still promises to hold the line on its currency, may
yield next year and devalue the yuan to protect its producers.
</P>
<P>
   That would set off another series of currency devaluations not
only in Asia, but very likely in Latin America, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, of course, is not so much an economic threat _ its
economy is about the size of Denmark's _ but its problems are
emblematic of the difficulty that once centrally planned countries
have had in adopting market capitalism. Their cultures have no
experience with it.
</P>
<P>
   All of these trends threaten to converge some time in the future
as an economic problem that may be too big for the United States to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the nation shows signs of ``moderate'' growth, the
New York Federal Reserve District has already reported that
``significant segments of its economy were slowing,'' and the
Dallas district showed decelerating manufacturing growth in August.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates, which are market-related and affect
bond yields, already are at historic lows. The 30-year Treasury
yield has moved below 5 percent, due in part to demand for bonds
from foreign investors looking for a safe haven. The demand that
drove prices higher pushed yields lower.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Fed's rate cut at the end of September, and the
prospect of further rate cuts, drove bond prices even higher and,
therefore, yields lower.
</P>
<P>
   The economy could get some help from a rebounding economy,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows what the market is likely to do. The outlook
greatly depends on what kind of third-quarter corporate earnings
reports are released during October.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are not very optimistic, although first- and
second-quarter profits turned out better than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The strong U.S. dollar has hurt profit growth so far this year,
but it has also helped the economy to retain at least a part of a
``just right'' aura _ in the form of minimal inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economists look for consumer price increases to remain in the 2
percent to 3 percent range in the next 18 months, thanks in part to
the cheap Asian imports the dollar makes possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that foreign economies may get so weak
that the problem will shift from inflation to deflation.
</P>
<P>
   But without dismissing it as impossible, most mainstream
analysts doubt prices will get that weak.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, analysts see even more events that could have an
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   One is the European Union's currency that is scheduled to go
into effect Jan. 1, creating another enormous and competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
   And while the prospect of a presidential impeachment is still up
in the air, analysts believe the long-range implication of future
congressional and White House economic policy may be decided by the
outcome, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Year 2000 problem. Analysts are greatly
divided over what is likely to happen when 2000 arrives, with
computers misinterpreting dates ending in two zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   But with the next millennium just 15 months away, its one of
those economic problems that seems certain to get increasing
attention.

 &HT;    Switch to euro considered good for U.S. investors
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of computer code to fix, and if the job isn't done
on time unconverted software could plague or even shut down banking
systems and stock trading. No, it's not the year 2000 problem. It's
the euro conversion scheduled to kick off Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, 11 countries _ France, Italy, Germany, Austria,
Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal _ will begin to phase out their native currencies in favor
of the euro. It's part of the final phase of the European Monetary
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Four other countries in the union _ Great Britain, Sweden,
Denmark and Greece _ haven't opted to phase out their traditional
currencies, but the euro will be legal tender in those nations as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, many experts were saying the euro introduction
would create a crunch like that posed by millennial date foul-ups.
Now, in many quarters, the worries seem to have been displaced by
euphoria about the new era.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the message for investors seems to be: Prepare for
short-term technological disruptions of the European financial
system. But over the longer term, the euro will provide a strong
backing for investments.
</P>
<P>
   That means it will make more sense for U.S. investors to buy
European stocks, bonds and real estate than it does now because the
euro is expected to be strong currency. In a recent cover article,
The European, a weekly business magazine, trumpets, ``European
stock markets will benefit from a wave of risk-averse money which
has to find a home.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the euro also should mean U.S. investors _ and
U.S. companies _ will be better protected against currency
fluctuations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But first there's the conversion to make, and if things go wrong
at the outset, European stocks and bonds could take a fall,
offering temporary bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, such as Capers Jones, chief scientist at Artemis
Management Systems of Boulder, Colo., continue to expect trouble.
Jones believes only 55 percent of European companies, and most of
the governments, won't be ready. He estimates delays in the
conversion will last for three to nine months and that computer
disruptions could cost $1 billion per day.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Whitt Jr., an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank
of Atlanta, is among those with a positive view about the
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hassle for banks and other companies that have to
convert their financial records, but in a sense it's just taking
their old numbers and dividing them into a new number that
represents the euro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that adapt the euro will give up control of their
monetary policy _ the ability to expand or contract their supply of
money, a tool most governments consider a vital instrument of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Control will pass into the hands of the European Central Bank in
Brussels. The other central banks will remain in operation but
without their monetary teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In return for that loss of control, the participating nations
can expect to benefit from a strong, stable currency. The European
Central Bank will be managed in spirit, in not in fact, by
Germany's inflation-fighting central bank, the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the euro is expected to threaten the dollar
both as the currency of choice in foreign exchange transactions and
as the preferred currency backing for investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is going to become a major global currency as long at
they hold the union together,'' said Mark Gargano, managing
director of currency derivatives at First Union.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Enough already! After self-pity, life's looking up
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When bad things like an automobile accident happen to bumbling,
well-meaning but clumsy people like me, the first step, according
to my raising, is to say your prayers and promise to try harder and
do better in the future.
</P>
<P>
   You also get specific. I'll never say anything mean about
anybody, I vowed (and I do enjoy nipping at other people when I get
a chance).
</P>
<P>
   I'll start doing all the things I dread and avoid. And I did. I
went home and cleaned out the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   I'll hire that nice cleaning lady I heard about and keep an
impeccably tidy house. (She came and looked around and departed
looking defeated. There are some places a respectable cleaning lady
wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.) So I washed dishes, the ones I
had hidden from her, and made beds and finally got in one of them,
pulled up the cover and, to quote a Jewish mother I met, I said
``Enough, already!''
</P>
<P>
   You can be upbeat and striving for just so long. Then your
bruises begin to hurt almost more than your conscience, which was
mortally offended that my good car, bought through the courtesy of
friends, sat in a garage with the ultimate bad word against its
name: ``Totaled.''
</P>
<P>
   I, too, am totaled, I thought. My arms hurt; my legs hurt;
there's a pain somewhere in back and ribs. Here I sit in a cold,
dirty cabin without wheels to take me to the world out there beyond
the paved road. Totaled is the word for me.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, woe, woe is me. And then I heard the rain on the tin roof,
and I thought, if you have gratitude in your heart for anything,
now's the time to recognize it. Rain on the tin roof, who has
anything better? So I lit the fire in the fireplace and pulled up a
wool throw. (A legacy from my late friend, Faith Brunson. And the
friendship of people like Faith suddenly made me ashamed of my
self-pitying slump.)
</P>
<P>
   And then I went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke, the sun was shining. It was suddenly a summer day,
except for the dogwood trees in the back yard, which are turning
gold and red.
</P>
<P>
   My granddaughter Betsy and her little friend, Alex, arrived with
nutty muffins and stayed to show me a dance they are practicing.
Tib, my big granddaughter, called to see if I needed a ride. My
biggest grandson, John, called to offer me a ride to look at rental
cars, strongly recommending that I go for a Mack truck. My other
grown-up grandson, Bird, called to make a date for car-looking and
to say comforting words about other people who have survived dumb
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The inference, of course, is I'm not the only one. Or as Snoopy,
the wise hound in ``Peanuts'' put it, when Charlie Brown read him
an item about National Dog Day, ``I am not unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the world looked good to me. Driving to town had a
fresh feeling about it. I hadn't done it for a long time, it seemed
to me, although it was only two days. I was glad to be at work and
to find two gifts of the season _ a jar of muscadine jelly and a
diminutive pot of yellow chrysanthemums.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where all those bruises went, and I don't ask. I
picked up a little black book put out by NationsBank. It's called
``The Book of Excellence,'' and it opened to words of instruction:
``Look at life through the windshield, not through the rear view
mirror.'' And one that's hard to follow: ``It is important that you
like yourself.''

 &HT;    Dawson is back_ with hormones raging in full force
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C._Here is where to catch the buzz on ``Dawson's
Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school hallways, students are anticipating tonight's
second-season premiere on WB. The adolescent soap opera, featuring
the tangled love lives and improbable philosophizing of four
good-looking kids, all 16-going-on-30, quickly became the No. 1
show among teen girls on any network last season.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, fans chatter with obsessive zeal about each
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can catch the real buzz, the annoying attack of countless
insects on a muggy, buggy day on the set of ``Dawson's Creek.''
Near a reedy marsh, in what serves as Dawson Leery's back yard, the
gnats and mosquitoes are as thick as adolescent longing. Crew
members spray themselves with bug repellent and occasionally slap a
bare arm as the pouty-mouthed Jen (Michelle Williams) tells
ever-so-earnest Dawson (James Van Der Beek): ``You are so on the
rebound, Dawson.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dawson's Creek'' sets are closed, of course, both the
houses that double for Dawson's and Jen's, and the soundstages at
Wilmington's Screen Gems Studio, previously home to ``Matlock'' and
movies like ``Billy Bathgate'' and ``Blue Velvet,'' now housing the
interiors of Dawson's house.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's up to date in Dawson's bedroom. An aspiring
filmmaker and Steven Spielberg wannabe, the TV character has
plastered his walls with Spielberg movie posters, even the bad ones
(``Hook''). Last year, the ``Dawson'' folks had to beg Spielberg's
company for permission to use the posters. For this new season,
Spielberg gladly sent a one-sheet of ``Saving Private Ryan'' to
hang above Dawson's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek'' had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the show arrived with its target audience almost from
the moment it debuted in January. Boosted by a canny saturation
marketing campaign by WB, the show had enormous word-of-mouth among
teens even before it debuted. They even knew it was created by the
jalapeno-hot screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who'd written
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' and who based
Dawson on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nielsen ratings are small by ``ER'' standards,
``Dawson'' is a hit with more than teen girls. In Atlanta, where
ratings are more than twice as high as the national average, it
sometimes beat ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Frasier'' last season. The
cast appeared on TV Guide covers and in a special J. Crew catalog.
This season, the WB moved it to 8 p.m. ET Wednesdays in an attempt
to knock off ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' (although the two won't go
head-to-head until Oct. 21 because of baseball playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' says Van Der Beek of the media swirl, the
magazine covers, the fandom. One Wilmington teen was hired to be an
extra and fainted dead away at her first sight of Van Der Beek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very dehumanizing actually,'' he says. ``You cease to be
a human being. All of a sudden, you're a novelty item.''
</P>
<P>
   But the four young stars _ in addition to Van Der Beek and
Williams, there's Joshua Jackson as Pacey and Katie Holmes as Joey,
both long-time buds of Dawson _ agree that filming in bucolic
Wilimington, an entire country and several attitude zones away from
Los Angeles, has kept them steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is a wonderful city and it has so much to offer, but it's
almost too much,'' says Holmes, sitting on a bug-free screened
porch on the set, a copy of ``Pride and Prejudice'' on a table in
front of her. ``Everything's about the business. To be able to
concentrate solely on what we're doing and not be exposed to all
the temptations, life is a little more simple here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is the epicenter of hype,'' says Williams, who's only 18
but speaks in a soft, slightly bruised manner that makes her seem
older. ``But it's really hard to pick up and move your life to a
town you might not normally pick.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Josh, the most aptly named of the four _ Josh
Jackson. As Pacey, he's the comic spice in their stew of teen
angst. As Josh, he bounds around the set with more energy than his
huge black dog, Simba (which he pronounces Shoom-ba).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels kind of chilly out here,'' he announces loudly to no
one, strolling through Dawson's back yard on a hot, humid day. Over
the next few hours, as soon as director Joe Napolitano yells
``Cut!,'' Jackson acts as if that's his cue to cut loose: a few
lines of ``I Feel Pretty'' from ``West Side Story,'' followed by
``I Just Wanna Fly'' and ``Rock On.'' To round off the off-screen
performance, he gives Holmes a long, tight bear-hug, then walks
away whistling ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, keep his pants on. One of Jackson's set stunts
is to ``hang a moon'' at other cast members, something he says he
hasn't done so far this season. To which Van Der Beek replies with
a cryptic smile and a raised eyebrow, ``Has he not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep the mood on the set as light as possible,''
says Jackson. ``There's no need for it to be somber all the time.
We're here to do a job, but it's a pleasurable job.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also some new faces hanging out in Wilmington these
days. Monica Keena, who appeared as sassy trouble-maker Abby in one
episode last season, is now a regular. And Meredith Monroe and Kerr
Smith are joining the cast as Andie and Jack McPhee, brother and
sister who move to Capeside, Mass., the show's fictional setting.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson describes Andie as ``over-achieving and slightly
anxious,'' and says she and Pacey will be very romantically
involved. Katie Holmes, whose Joey will be paired up with Jack
(much to Dawson's chagrin), describes Jack as ``kind of aloof, a
little shy, and you don't quite understand what he's about for
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson and the show's producers realized ``Dawson'' couldn't
keep going just on last season's love triangle among Dawson, Joey
and Jen; hence the new blood. Also on tap this season:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jen will return to her bad-girl ways, says Williams, of being
promiscuous and self-destructive. As an actress, ``it's the stuff I
wait and long for.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Dawson will win a film festival award, his first step toward
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   -- A big homecoming dance will feature swing dancing similiar to
the popular ``Jump, Jive and Wail'' Gap TV ads. A bunch of
Wilmington high school dancers spent several days learning and
filming the intricate dance steps.
</P>
<P>
   The first two months have not been a total tap-dance on the
``Dawson'' set, though. Hurricane Bonnie swept through North
Carolina and knocked out production for four days; the shooting
schedule is so tight they're only now catching up.
</P>
<P>
   And Williamson's film career kept him away for more than a
month, causing the show to suffer a bit, according to Williams and
Van Der Beek. The creator finally flew to Wimington in September to
meet with the cast and crew and help map a strategy, before heading
back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any show has growing pains,'' says Van Der Beek, at 21 the
elder of the main cast. ``I think it ended up being a little more
vague than we wanted it to be. The episodes are actually a lot
stronger than we were afraid. They're fine, they're just not a cut
above.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a long day of filming, Van Der Beek sits in a
trailer. His hair is held back off his square-jawed face by several
large white plastic hairclips, making him look anything but the
teen idol, and he looks back on an amazing recent run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprised me how quickly everything happened, how I went
from looking for an agent to turning down films in a year and half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from college (Drew University in Madison, N.J.), being
an English major, I auditioned for this show on this tiny little
network, and I got it. I got a pilot. But then of all the pilots
they make, this one actually got picked up. That doesn't happen
very often. But then to be on a show that has this much buzz, I
struck gold. It's like a one in a million shot.''

 &HT;    Only time will tell if latest UPN offering will be successful
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A big, old-fashioned thriller-adventure with hokey dialogue,
ticking digital readouts, political assassinations and more gun
battles and blow-'em-up scenes than a summerfull of Jerry
Bruckheimer pocorn flicks? Sign us up, says UPN, as long as it's
about time travel.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``Seven Days'' (8 EDT tonight on UPN), which is loaded
with preposterous doo-dah but works just fine as neat-o mindless
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero is Frank Parker (Jonathan LaPaglia of ``New York
Undercover''), an ex-CIA op who's shut up in a mental hospital,
then is recruited for a secret project called Operation Back-Step.
Is Parker really nuts? ``I'm not crazy enough to get involved in an
operation you want a crazy man for,'' he says, just before he signs
up.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that while Parker was squirreled away, Russian
terrorists killed the U.S. president, vice president, speaker of
the house and the Russian president for good measure. Why? Who
cares? All we care about is the big spherical machine at a secret
military base in Nevada that can send Parker back in time seven
days to thwart the assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Why can Back-Step only send one man back in time for only seven
days? Who cares? All Parker cares about is changing history to save
his young son's life (he was killed in the attack); getting down a
bet on a basketball game where he already knows the outcome; and
making time with the babe-ski Russian defector scientist (Justina
Vail) who's part of the time-travel team.
</P>
<P>
   How can ``Seven Days'' be a long-running series when all it can
do, according to tonight's two-hour pilot, is send Parker back in
time one week, over and over and over?
</P>
<P>
   UPN had better care. It doesn't look like a premise with much
long-range promise. So for now, enjoy the corny but engaging pilot.
As for the future, only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

<P>
   ``Charmed'' is a bad stupid show
</P>
<P>
   It's not like there's never been a successful stupid show. The
key may be those stupid shows that don't realize they are stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Charmed'' (9 EDT tonight on WB) and its trio of
sisters-turned-witches fits the bill. It's real stupid _ but it's
no ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannen Doherty, Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs portray
``we sisters three'' who live together in a big old house in San
Francisco, change their low-cut blouses every few minutes and end
up discovering they're good little witches with special powers. One
can see the future. One can freeze-frame aggressive boyfriends and
really bad dudes. And one can make things move with her mind.
</P>
<P>
   What they're destined to do is slay evil warlocks (there's
millions of 'em out there in all shapes and forms, we're told). And
on ``Charmed,'' our girls do this with far less aplomb than Buffy,
who so gloriously kicks vampire butt every Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good stupid show here. It's just not there yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something familiar about the slogan used by the Escape
Sailboat Co.: The Sailboat for the Rest of Us. If the phrase calls
to mind Apple Computer's famous 1980s pitch for the Macintosh, ``a
computer for the rest of us,'' well, that's fine with Peter
Johnstone, Escape's president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Macintosh redefined the personal computer
industry. Johnstone aims to do the same for sailing. Just as
mountain bikes rejuvenated bicycling, in-line skates blew skating
wide open and snowboards pushed the parameters of downhill skiing,
he wants to breathe new life into a sport that has been flagging
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people sail today, and far fewer new sailboats are sold,
than in the 1960s and 1970s. The Escape, an 11.5-foot dinghy, is
Johnstone's magic formula for reversing the trend. The Escape is
not loaded with high technology, but it uses technology to achieve
two goals that could prove crucial to luring the masses to sailing:
The Escape is cheap, and it is easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the sailing business, though, find Johnstone's
brashness and lofty claims a bit much. They dismiss his new
sailboat as nothing more than a toy and contend that it will do
little to revitalize the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone's sailboat is cheap because it is built of plastic, a
material that old salts scorn but that keeps construction costs
down. The basic Escape model sells for just $2,000, compared with
about $3,000 for similarly sized fiberglass boats. The cheapest
starter Escape model goes for just $700.
</P>
<P>
   And it is easy to use because of its innovative design and such
helpful gizmos as a color-coded wind-direction indicator that shows
sailors how to orient the sails. Novices can master the basics in
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing never moved forward after the 60s,'' said Johnstone,
who is 32. ``All that we're about is removing the barriers to
entry. Our whole schtick is to make it so simple that anybody who
ever thought about sailing would try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers are beginning to try it. Johnstone said his company,
based in Portsmouth, R.I., sold about 1,900 Escapes last year and
expects to sell about 4,000 this year. That does not sound like a
lot until one realizes that the entire U.S. sailing industry sold
about 14,000 boats last year, counting everything from eight-foot
dinghies to millionaires' mega-yachts.
</P>
<P>
   As with small sailboats, bicycles were pretty much the domain of
children and a few hard-core racers until some Northern California
enthusiasts added knobby tires and heavy-duty components to start
the mountain bike craze. Skates were kid stuff, too, until
Rollerblade Inc. put the wheels in line and reinvented the sport.
And while snowboards are the bane of ski snobs, no one can dispute
that they have brought thousands of new people to the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, selling sailboats today is harder than it was back in
the 1960s. After all, there were no personal computers, mountain
bikes or sea kayaks then to consume spare time _ and there was more
spare time to consume. Another problem is that too many people
associate sailing with the America's Cup races and with yacht
clubs, which often come across as exclusive and excluding.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not just the sport's elitist image that turned off
consumers. Market research showed that many people were intimidated
by sailboats, viewing them as too expensive, too complicated to
operate and too easy to tip over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criteria were simply to overcome these objections,''
Johnstone said. ``The entire goal was to redefine and reinvent the
sport for the mainstream public. So when the potential customer
thinks, `Should I look at sailing?' they know there's a new
user-friendly alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   What most sets the Escape apart from conventional sailboats is
the way that its hull and deck are constructed of plastic from a
single mold rather than being built separately with fiberglass and
then attached together.
</P>
<P>
   This method holds several advantages. While the plastic _
rotomolded polyethylene, the same material that is used in modern
kayaks _ is not as strong or as light as fiberglass, it reduces
manufacturing costs by 75 percent. It is also more resistant to
scratches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the hull shape _ broad and flat at the
waterline _ makes the boat more stable and less likely to tip over.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape's rigging is also different. The mast is made of
carbon fiber, meaning that it bends more easily than the standard
aluminum or wood, letting it spill excess wind that might overpower
a novice sailor. The boom, the horizontal spar that holds the
bottom of the sail, stands by itself rather than extending from the
mast. That makes it less likely to bang heads, and allows the
boat's operator to shorten the sails quickly if the wind kicks up,
thus preventing the boat from capsizing.

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN '98 ORBITS INTO CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the November elections near, candidates are
planting their virtual battle flags in record numbers across
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   While 1998 is the first election year in which the Internet is
widely regarded as a mass medium, it's still uncertain what impact
these powerful new digital tools will have on individual campaigns,
or more broadly, on the country's future political course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a test year for the Internet and politics and
we expect to learn a lot from this effort,'' Steve Case, chairman
and chief executive officer of America Online (AOL), said Tuesday
as he helped launch a major initiative to mesh the established
political world with the fluid World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by AOL, the new Web, White and Blue site
(http://www.webwhiteblue.org) offers one-stop political shopping to
some 45 major non-partisan political databases. The selected sites,
replete with their own clickable links, dispense voter information,
campaign schedules, issue papers and state-by-state political news.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation, a co-sponsor of
the cyberproject, said 450 commercial Internet sites had so far
agreed to carry a Web, White and Blue icon on their own home pages.
</P>
<P>
   As Case put it in a conference call with reporters: ``We're
giving people the tools and resources to do their own research _ to
learn about the candidates and issues and to connect with the
political process on their own terms and timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of candidates, key staff members and consultants in 270
current campaigns published last month in Campaigns &AMP; Elections
magazine last month found that nearly nine out of 10 respondents
saw the Internet as a vital medium that is changing, or soon will
change, political campaigns. Less than 12 percent voiced a
skeptical viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The new explosive political demographics of the Internet became
evident last month when, within 24 hours, about 20 million
Americans accessed the impeachment report on President Clinton that
was referred to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
NetRatings, a cyberspace traffic measuring firm, found that each
online visitor spent an average of 30 minutes reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as television has all but eliminated observational
reporting, the Internet threatens interpretive and beat
reporting,'' said Michael Cornfield, who teaches courses on
politics and the new media here at George Washington University's
Graduate School of Political Management.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield, who also co-publishes an online political review,
noted that the advent of such massive document dumps puts extensive
source material for the first time directly in the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, ``journalists are being forced to
accommodate to the Internet by devoting more of their efforts to
guiding their audiences into, and through, publicly relevant
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public becomes an intimate part of the story itself, and
the dynamic and the role of the media changes from being mere
'reporters of fact' to 'guides to context'.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The sheer growth of cyberspace is another factor impacting the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the Internet has grown extensive roots, a
recent Field Poll shows that 41 percent of likely voters now use
e-mail and that 67 percent use a computer regularly at home, work
or school. Such high numbers offer largely unplowed soil for
political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide telephone survey conducted last February found that
the proportion of people who used the Internet for political
activity had doubled since a similar survey conducted before the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth path has a ways to go. According to Bruce Bimber,
a political science professor at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, who conducted the February poll, only 17 percent of
respondents used the Internet to express political views, to learn
about political issues, to browse for political information or to
get in contact with elected officials or candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of activity encouraged by Project Vote Smart, a
nonpartisan nonprofit group founded 40 years ago by former senators
and presidential candidates Barry Goldwater of Arizona and George
McGovern of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're averaging more than a half million hits a day,'' said
Richard Kimball, the group's president. ``I fought against going on
the Internet three years ago,'' he added, ``but it's become huge
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No so huge, however, that the Internet stands a chance of
displacing television as the prime contact point for voters in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants note that, unlike television, the Internet
is still not universally available and that online information
reaches only self-selected interested voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, you decide you want to watch 'Seinfeld,' and you get
our ad,'' says Mark Mellman, a Washington political consultant
whose clients have included Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota and Barbara Boxer of California. ``But when you go to the
Web, you have to want to go to a political site.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL's Case remains undeterred from his middleman function
of creating another viable ``portal for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics Internet-style: interactive, contextual,
informative, and, above all, optimistic,'' he concluded in touting
the new Web White &AMP; Blue site. ``While we cannot predict how the
Internet will change politics, we can say with certainty that it
will.''

 UNDATED: from capsizing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginners, not surprisingly, love the Escape. ``It's not very
tippy, and sure enough, it is easy to learn,'' said Kathryn Tarsa,
a 40-something newcomer to sailing who bought an Escape with her
husband, John, last year to sail near their home in Duxbury, Mass.
``The video showed exactly how to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some longtime seafarers see the attraction of the boat. Si
Kamen, 78, is an experienced sailor who owns a larger boat, but he
keeps an Escape at the dock behind his home in Bel Marin Keys,
Calif., because it is so quick to set up. ``It performs pretty
well,'' he said. Best of all, ``you unroll the sail and you're off,
in two minutes.'' He adds, though, that he would like more leg
room.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of the Escape sailboats by the sailing establishment
have been mixed, with some deriding them as plastic pool toys and
others praising any product that can bring fresh faces to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape ``is sort of a crossover boat between your typical
beach toy and your real boat,'' said Robert Perry, a naval
architect and columnist for Sailing magazine, who keeps an Escape
at his beachfront home near Seattle. ``I sail the 11.5-footer onto
the beach full bore. It's supremely designed for that use.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Colgate, president of the Offshore Sailing School, a chain
based in Fort Myers, Fla., has bought four Escapes for his
children's classes, but he said he did not believe the boat was a
significant advance over the classic Sunfish, the quintessential
beach boat that was introduced 45 years ago and is the all-time
best-selling sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday, about 10,000 to 15,000 Sunfishes, which were
not much more than a sail attached to a shallow-hulled board wide
enough for one or two people to sit on, were sold annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hype is far beyond what it delivers,'' Colgate
said of the Escape. ``Once you learn to sail the Escape, which
takes maybe an hour, where do you go from there? Then you need to
get into something with more challenge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One thing that irks Colgate, not surprisingly, is the assertion
that the Escape eliminates the need for sailing lessons. It is an
assertion aggressively promoted by Johnstone, whose name means
something in the sailboat industry. Twenty years ago, his father
and uncle founded Jboats, a successful maker of racing sailboats in
Newport, R.I. After graduating from college, Johnstone joined the
company alongside several siblings and cousins, but his strong
opinions soon brought him a polite invitation to leave, he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he formed a partnership, with North Sails, the leading maker
of high-performance sails, and Gary Jobson, a former America's Cup
skipper, to buy the Sunfish and Laser brands from a struggling
manufacturer. Although they succeeded in reviving these two
venerable designs, naming their company Sunfish Laser Inc.,
Johnstone said they were dismayed to discover virtually all of
their sales were to longtime sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a new outlet, they conceived the Escape, which was
introduced in April 1996. Once the new design seemed to attract
interest, they sold Sunfish Laser last year to Vanguard Sailboats
Inc., a leading maker of small racing boats, also based in
Portsmouth. Escape now offers four hull sizes, and two kinds of
rigs. It has also recently branched out to offer plastic canoes.
</P>
<P>
   While sailing traditionalists frown on plastic, regarding it as
an inferior material, it is rapidly gaining acceptance at the low
end of the boating market. Vanguard now offers a plastic boat, the
Pico, at $2,095; a plastic trimaran, the Windrider, from Wilderness
Systems has also been a strong seller at $3,350. (A trimaran is
similar to a catamaran, but has three parallel hulls instead of
two.) The Hobie Cat Co. actually introduced the first rotomolded
plastic boat, a 13-foot catamaran called the Wave, in October 1994.
At $3,595, it is now the company's best-selling boat.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry longtimers question the material's longevity.
A short life span could be a plus for the industry, though, if it
encourages people to replace their boats more frequently. Because
fiberglass stands up so well, companies like Sunfish Laser and
Hobie have had to compete with their own products on the used
market, where boats can be had for a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone readily concedes that rotomolded plastic becomes
brittle with prolonged exposure to sunlight, and he estimates the
life of an Escape from as little as 5 years if left outside in the
Caribbean, to 15 years, sailed seasonally in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to deal with used Sunfish 45 years after
they were built,'' he said, ``we'll have to deal with Escapes for
15 years.''

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN '98 ORBITS INTO CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the November elections near, candidates are
planting their virtual battle flags in record numbers across
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   While 1998 is the first election year in which the Internet is
widely regarded as a mass medium, it's still uncertain what impact
these powerful new digital tools will have on individual campaigns,
or more broadly, on the country's future political course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a test year for the Internet and politics and
we expect to learn a lot from this effort,'' Steve Case, chairman
and chief executive officer of America Online (AOL), said Tuesday
as he helped launch a major initiative to mesh the established
political world with the fluid World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by AOL, the new Web, White and Blue site
(http://www.webwhiteblue.org) offers one-stop political shopping to
some 45 major non-partisan political databases. The selected sites,
replete with their own clickable links, dispense voter information,
campaign schedules, issue papers and state-by-state political news.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation, a co-sponsor of
the cyberproject, said 450 commercial Internet sites had so far
agreed to carry a Web, White and Blue icon on their own home pages.
</P>
<P>
   As Case put it in a conference call with reporters: ``We're
giving people the tools and resources to do their own research _ to
learn about the candidates and issues and to connect with the
political process on their own terms and timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of candidates, key staff members and consultants in 270
current campaigns published last month in Campaigns &AMP; Elections
magazine last month found that nearly nine out of 10 respondents
saw the Internet as a vital medium that is changing, or soon will
change, political campaigns. Less than 12 percent voiced a
skeptical viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The new explosive political demographics of the Internet became
evident last month when, within 24 hours, about 20 million
Americans accessed the impeachment report on President Clinton that
was referred to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
NetRatings, a cyberspace traffic measuring firm, found that each
online visitor spent an average of 30 minutes reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as television has all but eliminated observational
reporting, the Internet threatens interpretive and beat
reporting,'' said Michael Cornfield, who teaches courses on
politics and the new media here at George Washington University's
Graduate School of Political Management.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield, who also co-publishes an online political review,
noted that the advent of such massive document dumps puts extensive
source material for the first time directly in the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, ``journalists are being forced to
accommodate to the Internet by devoting more of their efforts to
guiding their audiences into, and through, publicly relevant
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public becomes an intimate part of the story itself, and
the dynamic and the role of the media changes from being mere
'reporters of fact' to 'guides to context'.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The sheer growth of cyberspace is another factor impacting the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the Internet has grown extensive roots, a
recent Field Poll shows that 41 percent of likely voters now use
e-mail and that 67 percent use a computer regularly at home, work
or school. Such high numbers offer largely unplowed soil for
political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide telephone survey conducted last February found that
the proportion of people who used the Internet for political
activity had doubled since a similar survey conducted before the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth path has a ways to go. According to Bruce Bimber,
a political science professor at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, who conducted the February poll, only 17 percent of
respondents used the Internet to express political views, to learn
about political issues, to browse for political information or to
get in contact with elected officials or candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of activity encouraged by Project Vote Smart, a
nonpartisan nonprofit group founded 40 years ago by former senators
and presidential candidates Barry Goldwater of Arizona and George
McGovern of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're averaging more than a half million hits a day,'' said
Richard Kimball, the group's president. ``I fought against going on
the Internet three years ago,'' he added, ``but it's become huge
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No so huge, however, that the Internet stands a chance of
displacing television as the prime contact point for voters in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants note that, unlike television, the Internet
is still not universally available and that online information
reaches only self-selected interested voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, you decide you want to watch 'Seinfeld,' and you get
our ad,'' says Mark Mellman, a Washington political consultant
whose clients have included Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota and Barbara Boxer of California. ``But when you go to the
Web, you have to want to go to a political site.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL's Case remains undeterred from his middleman function
of creating another viable ``portal for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics Internet-style: interactive, contextual,
informative, and, above all, optimistic,'' he concluded in touting
the new Web White &AMP; Blue site. ``While we cannot predict how the
Internet will change politics, we can say with certainty that it
will.''

DEATH TOLL RISES IN AFTERMATH OF FLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
 - take 1 of 2-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS and GLENN E. RICE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The death toll from flash floods rose to
seven Monday _ with two more missing _ as authorities began
assessing the devastation left by one of the worst floods in Kansas
City's history.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the area, heartrending stories surfaced as witnesses
told of using ropes, garden hoses _ anything they could find _ in
desperate attempts to pluck terrified victims from the raging
waters. Two of the victims were on their cellular phones calling
for help when they were swept away.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rain, as much as 7.7 inches in some areas, deluged
streets and businesses, closed highways and knocked out power.
</P>
<P>
   Destruction was widespread. Southwest Boulevard was swamped by
as much as 5 feet of water. Damage to the American Royal Building
could exceed $2.5 million. Brush Creek, at the top of its banks,
swept three cars off the Prospect Avenue bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross teams found waterlogged cars that had been tossed like
toys, dozens of basements filled with water and many homes with
structural damage, some with portions of their foundations washed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Emanuel Cleaver estimated the damage in Kansas City to be
in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of life we take very seriously,'' Cleaver said at a
news conference Monday afternoon. He said the city had documented
at least two dozen successful rescues.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also visited another hard-hit area, the Village Green
Apartments, 1500 E. 46th St., near the Country Club Plaza. More
than 100 units were damaged. Cars plastered with mud were stacked
two and three deep.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said city officials would meet to discuss the
possibility of applying for federal disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   The flood claimed victims throughout the area, five of them at
the Prospect Avenue bridge over Brush Creek. Those found:
</P>
<P>
   - Orlando Hudson, 27, of Kansas City, who had gone in search of
cough medicine and candles. His car stalled on the Prospect Avenue
bridge over Brush Creek and was swept away. He had a wife and two
children, ages 3 and 1 week.
</P>
<P>
   - Bonita L. Black, 43, of Kansas City, whose car was swept into
Brush Creek at the Prospect Avenue bridge.
</P>
<P>
   - Azalech Zewuda, 57, of Overland Park, Kan., whose body was
found late Sunday in the tennis court area of the Carriage Club at
5301 State Line Road.
</P>
<P>
   - John W. Parmerlee, 8, who drowned when the runoff from a cove
leading to Lake Jacomo overflowed behind his house in Blue Springs,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   - Walter Nott, 83, of Overland Park, whose car stalled at 103rd
and Connell streets. Witnesses said he tried to get out but was
swept away by rushing water.
</P>
<P>
   - Kenny W. Tucker Jr., 27, of Lenexa, Kan., who was found about
a half-mile from his car, which was in Mill Creek.
</P>
<P>
   - An unidentified body was found in Brush Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Those still missing:
</P>
<P>
   - Rushonda Talifero, 25, of Kansas City, who called her mother
on a cellular phone from the Prospect Avenue bridge and said her
Ford Explorer was going into Brush Creek.
</P>
<P>
   - Edna McNeal, 44, of Grandview, Mo., who was a passenger of
Talifero's.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, emergency sewer crews worked throughout the day
Monday, responding to reports of flooded basements at more than 70
homes. Flooding and electrical outages also shut down storm and
wastewater pump stations at Kemper Arena, on State Line Road and on
83rd Street early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from the Water Services Department erected 83 high-water
barricades early Monday to block motorists from 36 flooded
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the flooding occurred simply because the stormwater
system was overwhelmed. Some areas received rainfall of 7 inches in
an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kansas City sewer system isn't designed to handle this
much water,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Rick Brisbin said the Fire Department responded to about
50 reports Sunday night of persons trapped by water. About 35 of
the calls required the Fire Department's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going into areas where we typically respond to high
water,'' Brisbin said. ``But there are an awful lot of places we
responded to where we never had high water before.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the storm's intensity was second only to the
flood of 1977, when up to 16 inches of rain fell on the area in a
24-hour period, sending Brush Creek out of its banks and inundating
many Country Club Plaza businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That flood, which killed 25, displaced thousands and caused
nearly $100 million in damage. It was one of the worst natural
disasters in the area's history, and some of its victims were
missing for days.
</P>
<P>
   While more rain is expected, the worst may be over,
meteorologists said. The National Weather Service predicted light
showers for today and Wednesday, but said the moisture should not
cause more flooding. Partly cloudy skies the remainder of the week
should allow the area to begin drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Frevert, deputy public works director, said the city still
was assessing damage to the Prospect Avenue bridge late Monday
afternoon. Because of lingering high water, engineers could not
make a complete assessment of the damaged southeast corner of the
structure, Frevert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bridge will be closed for some time until we can assess
the damage and determine how much of it we can reopen,'' Frevert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wolf, public works director, said the damage at the Prospect
bridge was similar to that in the 1977 flood. The bridge is not
part of the Brush Creek flood-control project, but Wolf said the
city needed to consider adding it.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's family said the bridge should be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could save other people's lives,'' said Dorothy Hudson, his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   City crews also worked on a collapsed section of Brush Creek
Boulevard between Woodland Avenue and Bruce R. Watkins Drive.
Frevert said nearby concrete channel protection had collapsed,
causing soil under the roadway to erode. MORE

   PICKUP AFTER ``ROADWAY TO ERODE.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic for about three blocks of Brush Creek Boulevard has been
restricted to the two westbound lanes, one way in each direction.
</P>
<P>
   Frevert also said that crews would continue cleaning Southwest
Boulevard, with the street scheduled for reopening about 8 p.m.
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police and firefighters were credited with saving many lives,
and bystanders rescued stranded motorists. Some attempts, however,
were fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   LaKeisha Johnson and several friends were on their way to
Skateland in Grandview around 8 p.m. when they saw water rise along
Prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone yelled, `It's a car over the guardrail and bridge!' &UR; ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by grabbed ropes and garden hoses and tossed them to
persons in the vehicles. Authorities said one man thought about
diving into the water, but the currents were too strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water was cascading off the bridge like a waterfall,'' said
Clovis Hampton, who lives nearby on 45th Street and Chestnut
Avenue. ``I had seen it flood down here before, but never like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 9 p.m. Sunday, flash flooding collapsed a portion of a
bridge at Prospect Avenue and Brush Creek Boulevard, pushing two
cars carrying at least five persons into the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Currents were too strong for firefighters to ford the creek,
said Fire Department spokesman Brad Humston. Nearly 175
firefighters helped in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two persons were pulled from Brush Creek around 2
a.m. Monday, as emergency crews spent the day searching along the
banks of the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Howard, a diver with Recovery Inc., Underwater Rescue and
Recovery, based in Lee's Summit, said the water in Brush Creek was
moving about 7 knots, compared with the Missouri River, which
travels at 3 knots.
</P>
<P>
   As the water began to recede shortly after 4 p.m. Monday,
firefighters and police searching the banks of Brush Creek
discovered another victim.
</P>
<P>
   Covered with mud, the body was discovered about three blocks
away, face down in a muddy area in the middle of the creek just
west of Benton Boulevard. Underwater Rescue and Recovery teams
pulled the body to shore.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a tow-truck driver pulled a white Ford
Explorer from the murky water just east of Prospect Avenue. No one
was found inside the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers combed the creek throughout the evening for two
missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Monday expressed frustration that many drivers
failed to heed flash flood warnings. Several of the areas where
people drowned, particularly along Brush Creek, have been problem
spots for years.
</P>
<P>
   Humston said the city did not have enough barricades to block
off every area that floods.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials said people must rely on common sense and be
especially careful at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think they realize how deep the water is,
especially when they can't see,'' said Julie Llorente, Kansas
City's emergency preparedness coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about sirens, but we definitely don't want to use
those for flooding, because most people, when they hear a siren,
they're going to go to their basement, which is the last place you
want to be.'' &QL; 
Flood control
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers spent Monday monitoring
flood-control projects across the area and checking for signs of
potential flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting assessing the damage, Michael Bart, chief of
planning and hydrology for the corps, showed officials a film he
took of the flooding Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brush Creek came close to coming out of its banks,'' Bart
said. ``It had its problems. But the project appeared to do its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart said Indian Creek and the Blue River also were high, as was
the Kansas River.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the respite in the weather Monday, Col. George H. Hazel,
district engineer for the Corps of Engineers, said he was concerned
that more flooding might develop in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the lower reaches of the Missouri
River,'' Hazel said.
</P>
<P>
   Communities along the river were taking heed Monday. In
Jefferson City, the National Weather Service forecast that the
Missouri River would crest Thursday at 35.9 feet _ just two feet
lower than the highest crest of the flood of 1993.

BRADLEY TALKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WORLD FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND HIS
BASKETBALL CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ He talked about health-care policy, and he
talked about the international financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Bradley, the former National Basketball Association
star who served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey for 18 years,
knew what his audience really wanted to know Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John Havlicek was the toughest guy I ever guarded,''
Bradley said about the former Boston Celtics great Monday night at
Missouri Western State College's Convocation Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, no one in the crowd of 300 asked Bradley about
the best player he ever guarded during his pro career with the New
York Knicks. Bradley just threw out the answer as a quip because he
is asked that question so often.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowd asked him about another pressing matter
either, and the question hung in the air like a crucial shot in a
tie game with no time remaining: Is Bradley, who retired from the
Senate in 1997, running for president in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, at a news conference, Bradley said what every
likely candidate says about such things: He's weighing the decision
carefully. He'll decide by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   But judge Bradley not by what he says, but by his actions _ such
as his frantic, fast-break-like schedule in the Kansas City area
Tuesday. Following the college's annual convocation Tuesday
morning, Bradley was to hit the campaign trail _ not for himself,
but for several fellow Democrats in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Those candidates include incumbent state Sen. Sidney Johnson of
Agency, Mo., who was to meet Bradley at a Northland nursing home.
At an education rally in Lee's Summit, Mo., Bradley was to stand
beside state Senate contender Pat Starke.
</P>
<P>
   He'll was to cross the state line into Kansas to appear with
Dennis Moore, the Third District congressional candidate. In a
meeting at the Kansas City Club, the two were to discuss crime.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bradley is acting an awful lot like a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During his ranging, 45-minute question-and-answer session Monday
night, Bradley mixed stories from his days in sports with his views
on current affairs _ a combination that proved highly appealing
judging by the audience's rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   He was highly critical of the flat tax, the dramatically
simplified income-tax system touted by some members of both
parties. Calling it a ``rhetorical device'' invented by those
frustrated with the Internal Revenue Service, the former senator
said the plan would result in higher taxes for the middle class and
lower taxes for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon closer evaluation, people would find the flat tax
wanting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about athletes he admired, such as Dick Fosbury, who
reinvented the way to perform the high jump. He defined courage by
telling a story about another Celtics great, Larry Bird, who
retired just days before he was eligible for millions in an
automatic contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play, I'm not taking the money,'' Bradley quoted
Bird as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the worldwide monetary crisis, Bradley criticized
the Clinton administration for failing to act more quickly on bold
solutions, such as Bradley's call for an international commission
similar to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee
stock and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would use any so-called budget surplus money to save
Social Security unless the Federal Reserve Board fails to cut
interest rates further. If the board does not act, Bradley would
use the surplus to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was asked about Dennis Rodman, the controversial Chicago
Bulls' forward known for his rebounding and flamboyant lifestyle.
Calling Rodman a hustler, Bradley said, ``I only want to see Dennis
on the court, and I don't want to see him off it.''

MAN ATTACKED BY BOUNTY HUNTERS WANTS TO USE CASE TO MAKE HIS
ADOPTED LAND BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Martin Tong probably will get little of the
more than $1 million a judge awarded him on Monday. But he has a
new goal: to use his experience to help improve his adopted land.
</P>
<P>
   His case provides ammunition for state and federal lawmakers and
others who want tougher regulations on bounty hunters and bonding
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tong, 21, left Sudan for Kansas City three years ago to escape
civil war and to better himself in a new nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year two bounty hunters looking for a traffic offender
mistakenly kicked in Tong's door, chased him to his basement and
shot him three times. Tong turned to the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jackson County, Mo., Judge Lee E. Wells ordered the
bonding company and the bounty hunters to pay Tong more than $1
million. Tong, however, probably will get only a pittance. The
bonding company has gone out of business, and the two bounty
hunters have little money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should make it so things like this don't happen to
other people,'' Tong said.
</P>
<P>
   Tong's attorney, Rick Gepford Jr., said he and his client sued
mainly on principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to be done,'' Gepford said. ``We make fun of the
caning in Singapore and the cutting off of hands in the Middle
East, but here we shoot people for traffic offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonding agents are licensed, but they hire unlicensed,
unregulated bounty hunters to arrest persons who do not show up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation requiring bonding companies to train and license
bounty hunters failed this year and last in Missouri. Small bonding
companies said requiring them to deposit $25,000 to $100,000 with
the state would put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers say the state needs the deposits, in part, to pay
victims such as Tong. They promise to try again next year in the
legislature, and they wave Tong's case like a flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might finally wake people up,'' said Jackson County
Prosecutor Claire McCaskill. Mistaken identity Tong testified in
the civil hearing before Wells last month and has testified twice
in the bounty hunters' criminal trials. Court records and a recent
interview tell his story:
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 2, 1997, Arrowhead Bonding sent bounty hunters Terry
Woods and Donnell Phillips to Tong's home in search of William
Hernandez, who had jumped bond on Claycomo, Mo., traffic
violations. Hernandez had moved out and was in an Omaha, Neb., jail
that night.
</P>
<P>
   An armed bounty hunter banged on Tong's door and asked for
Hernandez. Tong said Hernandez didn't live there, locked his door
and ran to call police. The two bounty hunters kicked in the door,
and Tong ran to hide under a basement stairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot Tong in the foot. Tong pulled a steel bar off a
basement window and flailed at the men. Woods shot him in the wrist
and the ear. Phillips also tried to shoot Tong, but his pistol
jammed. Tong escaped out a basement window.
</P>
<P>
   Tong said the bounty hunters might have screamed ``bond
enforcement agents,'' but he said he did not know what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read a book that told everything about American culture,
but I didn't read anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County jurors last year convicted Woods, of Grandview,
Mo., of second-degree assault and trespass and recommended six
years in prison. A judge sentenced him to six years but released
him on probation after 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   Another jury last year found Phillips, of Kansas City, guilty of
the same charges and recommended a year in prison. A judge placed
Phillips on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Arrowhead and Phillips did not contest the civil lawsuit, but
Woods acted as his own lawyer in a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he was not at fault. The bonding company should not
have sent him to catch a man already in jail, and Tong should not
have assumed that the bounty hunters were a threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With reckless and evil intent, Mr. Tong attacked both myself
and Mr. Phillips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells on Monday ordered Arrowhead and Woods jointly to pay Tong
$350,000 and assessed an additional $605,000 in damages separately.
He ordered Phillips to pay $113,735. Phillips agreed to pay Tong
$75 a month. Woods has said he would appeal. He could not be
reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In another Jackson County bounty hunter case, Zebedee Collins of
Kansas City last month signed a confidential settlement agreement
with C&AMP;M Bonding. He sued after bounty hunters allegedly forced
their way into his house three years ago to look for another man.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents throughout the country illustrate problems with bounty
hunters. In Ohio, a bounty hunter last year was convicted of
abduction and burglary. He broke into a home, handcuffed a
17-year-old girl and forced her at gunpoint to help him find her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents have prompted calls for national and state
reforms. Reform efforts One federal bill would require background
checks on bounty hunters and provide model legislation for states
that want to license bounty hunters. Another would require bounty
hunters to follow the same civil rights laws as police do.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona this year made it illegal for bounty hunters to force
their way into houses.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Rep. Marsha Campbell, a Kansas City Democrat, said she
would again co-sponsor a bill next year to regulate bounty hunters
and bonding agents.
</P>
<P>
   More states also are requiring training for bounty hunters, a
move supported by bonding agents in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burton, director of the National Institute of Bail
Enforcement Agents, in Tucson, Ariz., is meeting with Missouri
bonding agents this month. His group provides legal training to
bounty hunters in several states. Burton cited a key first lesson:
``You can't go into a house unless you know for sure the bad guy is
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonding system works, Burton said, because 14,000 people are
licensed to write bonds nationwide and about 1,800 bounty hunters
serve them _ ``the largest private arrest army in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   They get bail jumpers 87 percent of the time, he said. Kicking
in doors is rare, because only three of every 100 arrests are made
in houses, Burton said. Good bounty hunters use brains more than
guns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who like to track human beings in what we
call the big chess game,'' Burton said. The job requires training
and good judgment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tong, he moved to an apartment north of the Missouri
River. Even before the bounty hunters broke his door down, burglars
had stolen all he had. At his new apartment, someone has already
stolen his car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had any luck in this country,'' Tong said.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to make his own luck. He attends school to earn a high
school diploma and works full time as a bell captain at a Kansas
City hotel. He wants to enter college soon and eventually become an
American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   His life in the United States can only get better, Tong said.

COMPANY AIMS TO BECOME LEADER IN CONVERTING WHEAT STRAW INTO
PARTICLE BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The idea sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Take wheat straw and convert it into particle board that can be
used as a wood replacement for furniture and other products. The
environment is protected as trees get saved, and farmers gain
additional income by selling their unneeded wheat straw. In
addition, furniture makers get a product that's touted as being
stronger, more water-resistant and lighter than wood particle
board.
</P>
<P>
   That's the proposition behind Harvest Board International Inc.,
a Kansas City-based start-up company aiming to become a leader in
an emerging industry.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board, which was formed last year, took another step
forward Saturday when it broke ground on a $50 million
manufacturing plant in Rawlins County in northwest Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials hope the plant, west of Atwood, Kan., will be
turning wheat straw into composite board panels by the fourth
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Harvest Board plants are on the drawing board for
northwest Kansas, bringing the total value of the investment to
$160 million. All three plants should be ready by the end of the
year 2000, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Hulshof, one of the company's founders and its chief
operating officer, said Harvest Board would be making its composite
panels at an optimum time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a declining supply of wood, especially in North
America,'' he said. ``At the same time, there's an increase in
demand for this product.''
</P>
<P>
   Particle board is used in ready-to-assemble furniture, store
fixtures, kitchen cabinets, countertops, millwork, manufactured
homes and consumer electronics equipment. One of Harvest Board's
first customers is Hallmark Cards Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hulshof said a trade industry group estimated that consumption
last year of particle board was about 6 billion square feet. By
2005, that number is expected to exceed 8 billion square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hulshof, who previously was with the Kansas City accounting firm
of Mayer, Hoffman, McCann LC, and others at the company have
researched the market for the particle board industry. They think
their agrifiber composite panel will fill a void created by
declining forest reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning dirt on its first plant, Harvest Board created
alliances with investors, farmers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The company got early, jump-start financing from its own
resources and business associates. Since then, however, Harvest
Board has brought on Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. Inc. as its
financial adviser. The Arlington, Va., investment banker was fourth
in dollar volume among issuers of initial public offerings last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Keeley, Friedman Billings' managing director, said
his company agreed to work with Harvest Board last year and helped
raise equity and debt capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an industry that made a lot of sense, using wheat
straw that otherwise would be burned,'' Keeley said. ``There's a
market for this type of product, and we were impressed with Harvest
Board's management team.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial assistance also came from Kirkpatrick Pettis, an
investment banking subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha. The firm helped
manage the sale of $100 million to $130 million in bonds for plant
construction.
</P>
<P>
   With Friedman Billings' assistance, Harvest Board has created
several partnerships with equipment suppliers, contractors and
others.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harvest Board's agreements is with Dow Chemical Co.,
which is providing the resin to process the fiber and convert it
into particle board. Harvest Board says the resin, a type of glue,
does not emit environmentally damaging toxins, unlike traditional
wood fiber products.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board also has supply agreements with farmers within a
60-mile radius of where its plant is being built. About 40,000
acres of wheat straw have been committed to supply the plant for
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not taking the entire stalk or root that provides
nutritional value,'' Hulshof said. ``We're leaving some of the
straw for the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   How will Harvest Board cope with adverse weather conditions that
don't yield a bountiful wheat harvest?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to make sure to locate in an area that has three
times the amount of straw we need for production,'' said Kenneth A.
Roberson, Harvest Board's senior vice president. ``So in case of a
weather event, it won't be a complete setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulshof added that each plant would have 1 times the amount of
straw needed for production at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The first plant is expected to produce 76 million square feet of
particle board, generating $23 million in sales. The goal for the
three plants combined is 228 million square feet of product and $70
million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board also is in the process of finding customers for
its product and says it has commitments for more than 80 percent of
what the three plants will produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harvest Board's first customers will be Kansas City's
Hallmark Cards, which has agreed to buy composite panels for one of
its manufacturing plants in Texas. Hallmark uses the particle board
for fixtures at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board's effect on rural Kansas could also be beneficial.
In addition to creating 60 jobs at each plant, Harvest Board's
presence means more jobs baling and delivering the straw, said
Arlene Bliss, economic development director for Rawlins County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will mean jobs for farmers and farmers' wives,''
she said. ``We also hope the jobs may draw some people to this
county.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss also noted that Harvest Board did not seek financial
incentives to locate in Rawlins County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of footwork to find out the interest among the
farmers here,'' she said. ``But we provided no formal incentives,
just our hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board estimates that buying raw materials from farmers
could add 10 percent to their income.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Bujold is president and chief executive officer of
Harvest Board. Bujold was with Alexander Proudfoot, a management
consulting firm, before joining Harvest Board last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Board's headquarters is a suite in the American Century
Towers, with six staffers. Hulshof said it was Bujold's idea to
create a company ``war room,'' where the company's progress and
goals are tracked to the smallest detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity that may come along once in a
lifetime,'' Hulshof said. ``It's a passion that drives this
company. A lot of blood, sweat and tears have been put into this.''

IMPEACHMENT PROCESS OFF TO A PARTISAN START 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Monday took the
first step toward the third presidential impeachment inquiry in
American history, voting along party lines to recommend that the
full House of Representatives approve a formal investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 21-16 more than 10 hours after the hearing began,
the committee adopted an impeachment resolution that allowed a more
open-ended inquiry of President Clinton. It came after several
failed attempts by the Democrats to narrow the focus on both the
timetable and the subject matter to just his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote on the resolution by Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans now will be allowed to consider other issues
that have dogged the president, including Whitewater, the travel
office firings, the White House's gathering of FBI files on
Republicans, campaign finance and missile sales to China. Except
for the missile sales, Congress already has examined all of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to decide whether or not to impeach Mr.
Clinton,'' Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican,
said as he opened the hearing. ``We are here to ask and answer this
one simple question: Based on what we know now, do we have a duty
to look further, or to look away?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation to the committee, David Schippers, the
Republican majority's chief counsel, alleged 15 offenses by
Clinton. A lifelong Democrat, Schippers spoke for an hour in
outlining charges that ranged from obstruction of justice to
witness-tampering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff and I have made a deliberate effort to discount the
political aspects of our examination and to ignore any partisan
tactics and strategy,'' he told the committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schippers dropped the abuse of power allegation in the 11-count
report to Congress by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. He added
others, including several that had to do with making false
statements and another alleging that Clinton had concealed a felony
concerning his knowledge of Lewinsky's false affidavit in the Paula
Jones sexual-harassment case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Democratic counsel, emphasized a point repeated
by several committee Democrats: that by beginning the inquiry
without first setting the bar for impeachable offenses was like ``a
ship's captain leaving on a difficult, uncharted voyage hoping to
find his or her compass somewhere along the way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the daylong debate, Republicans and Democrats on the
committee took note of the historical significance of the hearing,
even while they differed starkly on the need to conduct an
impeachment inquiry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They drew upon the Bible, the Constitution and the Federalist
Papers as guideposts for their deliberations. Overshadowing it all
was Watergate, the scandal that triggered the last impeachment
inquiry and led to the resignation of President Nixon in 1974. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
the senior Democrat, sounding a running argument of his party. ``It
is an extramarital affair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, echoed what has been the crux of the
division over the Lewinsky investigation _ that it was not about
sex, but about breaking the law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is not about the fact that President Clinton had
an affair with Monica Lewinsky and then lied about it,'' said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican. ``It is about Judge
Starr's finding that the president violated his oath to the tell
the truth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they had taken pains to follow the path laid in
1974 by Peter Rodino, Hyde's predecessor as Judiciary chairman and
a Democrat who steered the Nixon impeachment investigation. His
portrait loomed over the hearing room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, at least one Republican, though he voted for the formal
inquiry into Clinton's possible impeachment, said he was still
uncertain whether the president's alleged actions amounted to the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that the founders had envisioned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham,
a South Carolina Republican with a history of bucking his party
leadership. ``I don't know. If I followed the polls, I know what I
would do. Eighty-two percent of the people in one part of my
district want him thrown out of office. I want to be a good
congressman who 30 years from now, not just 30 days from now,
people thought did the right thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, various Democrats spoke of their
disappointment in the president but said they considered
impeachment too severe a punishment . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not proud of the personal conduct of the president that
has cheapened our national discourse'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, a
Florida Democrat. But he added: ``Impeachment is not about
adultery. The president had an affair. He lied about it. Does
anyone reasonably believe that this amounts to subversion of
government? Does anyone reasonably believe that this is what the
Founding Fathers were talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee sought an even-handed tone, and the debate had
little of the razor-sharp partisan rhetoric of recent weeks. But
for all the historical drama, the proceedings were largely
anti-climactic because, with a five-vote Republican majority, the
outcome was never in doubt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the White House could claim some measure of victory, despite
Clinton's lasting blemish of becoming just the third president to
face a possible impeachment vote. Besides Nixon, who would have
faced an impeachment vote had he not resigned, Andrew Johnson
survived a vote of impeachment in the Senate in 1868 by one vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, his supporters know they may lose the votes
of some Democratic members, particularly those in close re-election
races, when the resolution is brought up for a vote Friday in the
full House. But they successfully avoided any Democratic defections
in the committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart repeated
Monday: ``We don't believe there is anything here that rises to the
level of an impeachable offense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters have tried to paint Starr as an
overzealous prosecutor who set out to get Clinton and to portray
his report to the committee, and the committee's work itself, as
partisan efforts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same line of attack was evident in the presentation by
Lowell, who spoke of Starr's ``prosecutorial excess'' by detaining
Lewinsky for 10 hours, ``despite her asking for a lawyer,'' and his
summoning of her mother, ``who was brought to tears by their
conduct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said Schippers, by eliminating, revising and increasing the
offenses alleged of Clinton in Starr's report, engaged in a
``prosecutor's strategy which courts routinely disapprove by which
they divide what they believe to be a single offense into many
different charges. They do this to make the case look more serious
or foreboding.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schippers offered a catalog of alleged offenses that said
Clinton and Lewinsky might have been part of conspiracy to obstruct
justice in the Paula Jones case by giving false testimony and
withholding evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end, he offered what he called a brief personal
statement, one as ``a citizen of the United States who happens to
be a father and a grandfather'' in which he paraphrased lines from
a play about St. Thomas More: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect
the citizens from the winds of evil and tyranny. If we permit one
of those laws to fall, who will be able to stand in the winds that
follow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow Americans, many
of whom are reposing in military cemeteries throughout the world,
are looking down on you and judging what you do today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats protested the allowing of such personal comments, and
they were stricken from the record until Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican, volunteered to have the statement appear under his
name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has said he hopes to finish the impeachment inquiry by Jan.
1. But the no-limits nature of the impeachment inquiry resolution
worried Democrats, who saw it as a ``fishing expedition'' that
could continue interminably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, citing Rodino's concerns about time limits during
Watergate, said they were an ``invitation to delay'' and caused
``more stress and strain trying to get the job done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask you,'' the chairman said, ``to accept on faith that
we want to move this along.'' &QL;

POSTSEASON, SMOLTZ MADE FOR EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It had always been John Smoltz's plan to pitch for the
Atlanta Braves until he was 38 or 39 years old, then take it one
year at a time regarding career decisions. Retirement? The
righthander figured that was nothing but a speck on the horizon of
his glittering career.
</P>
<P>
   But Smoltz's career reached a crossroads May 24 when a strained
ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow landed him on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   It was Smoltz's second such stint this season. He spent almost
the entire spring recovering from an offseason arthroscopic
procedure performed last Dec. 13 by Joe Chandler, the team's
orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Two years removed from his Cy Young season of 1996, when he
posted a career-best record (24-8) and guided the Braves to a World
Series berth against the Yankees, Smoltz reported to Macon and was
shocked to discover that winning in the minor leagues was every bit
as challenging as in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   He began having doubts about himself. He wondered if he'd ever
make another start for the Braves. Soon thereafter, Smoltz's
self-doubt gave rise to thoughts of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   At age 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your livelihood is pitching and your arm hurts, then it is
going to create doubt,'' said Cubs manager Jim Riggleman, whose
team suffered a 7-1 loss to the rejuvenated Smoltz in Game 1 of
their National League Division Series. ``I'm sure that's where that
came from, but he overcame it and he got fixed up and he's 100
percent healthy now, I guess, because he's been outstanding the
latter part of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Smoltz doubts himself no more.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from his rehabilitation stint with great
trepidation, Smoltz settled down, adapted to a new pitching
strategy, and reestablished himself in the second half of the
season. Forsaking a split-fingered fastball in favor of more
breaking pitches, he posted a 17-3 record _ going 13-2 with a 2.51
ERA in 18 starts after coming off the DL June 20 _ to reclaim his
stature as one of the pillars of Atlanta's vaunted rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But the postseason? Ah, that's always been Smoltz's personal
playpen.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Smoltz became the winningest pitcher in
postseason history by registering his 11th triumph. He threw seven
innings of shutout ball before surrendering an eighth-inning
leadoff homer to Chicago's Tyler Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only blemish in Smoltz's latest postseason gem: 7 2/3
innings, five hits, six strikeouts, no walks. With that, he broke a
tie with Whitey Ford and Dave Stewart for the postseason victory
record, and he can further distance himself Wednesday night against
the San Diego Padres here in the opener of the best-of-seven NL
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was so special,'' Smoltz said. ``Dr. Chandler and
the trainers, really everybody here knows the history of the way
things have gone for me and the frustrating times. I have a lot of
pride, and there's been a lot of things said where I've been
humbled a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you have humility, you understand how to handle
adversity. This has been a year where I haven't had a chance to
enjoy too much the games I've pitched, but it's just allowed me to
handle the situations when they've come about. I've learned as a
pitcher that I don't care if I get the credit, but I think I've
shown the last couple of years that my pitching ability has
outshined my stuff, because I've had to adapt to a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Including a humbling experience in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tough time winning in the minor leagues,'' Smoltz
said, chuckling at the recollection. ``The low point was leaving
Macon and not really being sure if I was ready. We had set a
timetable, and in my mind, I wasn't having to learn how to pitch
again but I was going to have to learn to pitch different.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Bobby Cox, ``When John came off his rehab (April
15), he didn't pitch in spring training and didn't throw until the
very end. But he had better stuff than I'd seen all spring, from
our club and anybody else's. I don't know if it was as dramatic as
John makes it out to be down in Macon; I didn't see him pitch down
there. He's really throwing the ball well and he has changed his
pitching style to some degree, but basically, he's pretty close to
what he used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was a quick study. In his first appearance after coming
off the DL June 20, he posted a 5-1 victory at Montreal, going
seven innings and allowing one unearned run on four hits while
recording eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went up to Montreal, it worked faster than I
anticipated,'' Smoltz said. ``I didn't throw the ball very hard or
the effort wasn't the same, but I relied on breaking pitches and
spotting the ball. The better I felt, the harder I threw, and the
cycle repeated itself. I would say in Macon there was a lot of
self-doubt. I just decided to go up there and get it done. The
luxury for me was the great pitching staff we have and Bobby having
the patience to let me go out there and basically pitch and get
myself ready for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz says his arm feels fine. Now that the Braves are in the
playoffs after winning their seventh consecutive division title,
he's intent on following a simple strategy when dealing with his
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken the approach for about the last month and a half
that I'm just going to ignore it and I'm just going to do what I
have to do,'' he said. ``That's what I've done. When you try to set
a plan and you try to set what the next three or four (years) will
be, it doesn't go according to plan, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It amazes him that after contemplating retirement at Macon, he
could rebound in time to become a major league force so soon.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any lingering questions about his arm, Smoltz
certainly answered them with his win over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can't help but say that God's had a play in it,'' he
said. ``I mean, if it was up to me, there were many times in my
mind where I didn't think I was going to make the next start, that
I didn't think I was going to pitch in the postseason three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's been amazing, and that's all I can really say.
I've been through (the postseason) before, but it doesn't really
matter how many times you go through it because it doesn't get any
easier. Like I said, I've always wanted to pitch until I was 38 or
39, but there was a point where I was worrying about finishing this
year. I'm just going to keep doing what I've done all season, and
hopefully, we can celebrate a championship.''

 07-COX &HT;    SOME TEXAS DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT GOP IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTION
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Texas Democrats in the House will cross party
lines this week to support a Republican measure authorizing an
impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   With a vote expected Thursday, some have decided to vote in
favor of the inquiry, others against, and some remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Rockwall, and Rep. Jim Turner, D-Lufkin, said
Tuesday they would support the Republican resolution approved
Monday by the House Judiciary Committee on a 21-16 party-line vote.
The resolution provides for an open-ended investigation by the
committee into whether there are grounds for impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the vote is ``a once-in-a-lifetime call'' that should
be dictated by conscience and not by party affiliation. ``It's not
pleasant,'' he said, to vote against his own party on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Hall predicted that 30 to 40 Democrats would vote for the
resolution. ``I'd like to see 50 vote for it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the allegations made against the president are
serious matters that Congress has a Constitutional duty to examine.
``No one is above the law, including the president,'' he said in a
statement released Tuesday. ``It is in the best interests of the
nation that we move forward with fairness and diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Texans, such as Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, and Rep. Max
Sandlin, D- Marshall, said Tuesday they were undecided about their
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both expressed concern that the GOP resolution doesn't include a
deadline for completing the inquiry and doesn't limit the scope of
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that he is ``hesitant to write a blank check'' to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., to invest millions of taxpayer
dollars investigating allegations over the next two or three years.
He said he wants to weigh possible Democratic alternatives before
making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said he and his constituents would prefer an impeachment
inquiry that is limited in time and scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people are saying if we're going to have
an investigation, it shouldn't be a long-term, expensive rehash of
what's been done,'' Sandlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, who is retiring at the
end of this, his 38th year in Congress, was more certain of his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said impeachment is too serious an action ``to be
invoked on anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never intended to be addressed ... to personal,
behavioral matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who control the House floor, have decided to
allow only one hour of debate on the GOP resolution, and House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, said Tuesday that there would
not be a vote on a Democratic resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Armey said that the White House is putting pressure
on Democrats, and that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
threatening Democrats to ``stand by your man or else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the First Lady has made recommendations to
them regarding what they might lose by way of campaign assistance
and so forth,'' Armey said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Edwards said he questioned whether Armey was a
source of reliable information about Mrs. Clinton, because in the
past Armey has treated her in a ``very undignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the White House is polling everyone about the
upcoming impeachment vote, but that he had not received a call from
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't called me. I've heard of no threats,'' he said. ``I
guess they quit pressuring me a long time ago.''

American-Statesman, contributed to this report.

   Frank Parker, former CIA operative, is in the looney bin. Not
that he's crazy, just a little unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no time to be relaxing in the Padded Room of the
Haha Hotel. The president, vice president and speaker of the house
have been assassinated, and America needs somebody to go back in
time to undo this calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is our man in the ``Seven Days. He can go back no more
than seven days because a way-back trip would require a larger
reactor and a bigger supply of some rare fuel that was discovered
at the site of the UFO crash in Roswell, N.M., in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrives in the past, Parker knows more than his bosses,
putting him on par with the rest of us. It is his job to convince
them that a calamity is about to happen, and to help them head it
off at the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Though excessively violent and emotionally disturbing,
especially at 8 o'clock, ``Seven Days'' is well-conceived,
well-executed sci-fi that may attract a mainstream audience because
of sci that's not too dense and fi that's not too tense. (It's also
a good companion to ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' which is pre-empted
tonight to accommodate the two-hour premiere.)
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan La Paglia is perfectly laconic as the smirky, quirky
Frank Parker, and the chemistry between Parker and scientist Olga
Vukavitch (Justina Vail) is a gas. Fortunate casting also netted
Don Franklin, Norman Lloyd and Nick Searcy, all of whom make
``Seven Days'' a good week's work _ and a great escape.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionally speaking, Aaron Spelling's ``Charmed'' satisfies
the average teen male's recommended daily allowance of spaghetti
straps, saucy tees and cheesecake midriffs.
</P>
<P>
   The show is so Fox-y (think ``90210,'' think ``Melrose Place'')
that The WB must have found the key to the henhouse, which explains
the presence of Shannen Doherty and Alyssa Milano, alumnae of
Spelling's soapers on Fox. The addition of Holly Marie Combs
(``Picket Fences'') is harder to figure, although she and Doherty
are best buddies in real life.
</P>
<P>
   They play the supernaturally gifted Halliwell sisters _ Prue,
Phoebe and Piper _ in a tasty but not-too-filling hour of mind over
matters of life and death. They also may bring to The WB a slightly
older audience that the network tried to tap a few seasons back
with Spelling's steamy serial, ``Savannah.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB's youthful viewers didn't bite then, but the timing may
be more appropriate now. As Fox has demonstrated, younger viewers
tend to set the pace (think ``Buffy,'' think ``Dawson's Creek''),
and older viewers follow a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   If a more mature audience is to be charmed by the concept of
good witches, though, it will require a more concerted effort than
tonight's premiere. Of the three sisters, Doherty's Prue is the
most convincing. She is the oldest, the most practical and the most
reluctant to use her new-found power. (Prue can move things with
her mind, Phoebe can see the future, Piper can stop time.) As
free-spirited Phoebe, Milano, who replaced Lori Rom in the cast
after the original pilot had been shot, needs seasoning, and maybe
some warm clothes. Combs' Piper, the ``earthy and creative'' one,
simply seems uneasy as a witchy woman.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, practice is the best way to eliminate Spelling
errors.

SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS WHETHER HOUSE GUESTS HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL
PROTECTION DURING SEARCHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday cited examples from
poker buddies to the Avon lady as it considered which house guests,
if any, deserve constitutional protection from unreasonable
searches.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, hearing an appeal from Minnesota, questioned
attorneys for the state and for two drug dealers on whether a
police officer trampled on the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by
spying without a warrant on the men as they helped a woman bag and
tie cocaine in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court threw out the convictions of Wayne
Thomas Carter and Melvin Johns, ruling that Eagan, Minn., Officer
Jim Thielen violated their reasonable expectation of privacy as
house guests when he peered through a gap in the closed Venetian
blinds.
</P>
<P>
   Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom, urging the justices to
reinstate the convictions, said the two men enjoyed no Fourth
Amendment protection because they were merely ``brief, transient
visitors'' to Kimberly Thompson's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State Public Defender Bradford Colbert of St. Paul,
representing Carter and Johns, countered that a person's home is a
sanctuary and that even guests are entitled to the constitutional
safeguard against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   However, justices were skeptical of both arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter mocked the distinction Backstrom drew
between brief visitors, who have no Fourth Amendment protection,
and those who stay longer. Souter used the example of people who
meet for regular poker games, those who get together once a week at
someone's house and those who play more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play five times a week they have (protection),''
Souter said, summarizing Backstrom's argument. ``If they play once
a week, they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Backstrom responded that people who play cards at someone's
house would enjoy Fourth Amendment protection due to their
personal, rather than business, relationship with the home owner.
Carter and Johns, by contrast, were not social guests so much as
``business'' associates, whom the Constitution does not protect
from police searches in a home, Backstrom argued.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in apparent support of Backstrom's
argument, noted that home owners often use the Spanish phrase ``mi
casa es su casa'' _ my house is your house _ to make their social
guests feel at home. But seldom do owners express that sentiment to
people who are in their house solely to conduct business, the
justice added.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Breyer, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said, ``Maybe the
(Fourth Amendment) line should be business vs. social.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to Colbert's call for broad protection for all house
guests, O'Connor said she doubted whether the Fourth Amendment
applies to people delivering pizza or selling cosmetics in someone
else's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no expectation of privacy when the Avon lady comes
in,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Colbert responded, ``Any intrusion into the home should be
accompanied by a warrant'' unless an emergency exists inside the
house requiring quick police action.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Solicitor General Jeffrey Lamken, pressing the Clinton
administration's support for Minnesota, told the justices that the
police officer's observation of the cocaine packaging through the
blinds did not constitute an unreasonable search, as the state
Supreme Court had ruled. Lamken said the officer did not ``search''
the apartment but merely observed what was occurring as he stood in
a public area.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia apparently agreed, saying Carter and
Johns might have forfeited their expectation of privacy when they
left gaps in the blinds. ``I don't think that's a reasonable
expectation of privacy'' if you fail to close the blinds, Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case
by this summer. &QL;

KREMLIN MAKING SURE ECONOMIC PROTESTERS HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The water cannons and the riot troops will probably be
kept out of sight. And the listening devices most certainly will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of protesters are expected to take to the streets
Wednesday to call for President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation in a
nationwide protest against late wages and low living standards that
union leaders say will be the largest since the fall of Soviet
Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin does not plan to fight the demonstrators. It
plans to eavesdrop on them.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the largest bugging operation in history,
thousands of government agents and an array of cameras and special
listening devices will be positioned to pick up anything protesters
might say that could violate Russia's laws on sedition or racism.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's justice minister, Pavel Krasheninnikov, said officials
would be listening in at rallies planned all over the country to
make sure none of the speakers call for the violent overthrow of
Yeltsin or his government.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, Oct. 7 looked as though it would bring
apocalypse to Russia's streets. The ruble was in free-fall, prices
were in the process of tripling, banks were closed, the country's
leaders were quarrelling, Yeltsin was absent, and social unrest
seemed certain.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Sept. 12
has not solved all of those problems. But Primakov's arrival in
government with the blessing of Russia's main opposition party, the
Communists, and his choice of several Communist-backed officials as
senior economic advisers, has softened the opposition's traditional
antigovernment slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Primakov appealed for calm in an address broadcast on
Russia's major television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that many people who are going to demonstrate
tomorrow have reasons to be disatisfied,'' Primakov said. ``But I
want to call on all of you not to rock the boat we are all in when
the sea is already stormy.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to repay pension and wages debts ``down to the last
kopeck'' soon and free up the mass of debts that has paralyzed
factories, banks and businesses. But he added it would take a few
months before the government would be able to repay old debts.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are predicting that 28 million Russians will stop
work Wednesday to demand $5 billion in back wages. Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, who estimates 40 million Russians will turn out.
Other protest leaders have called for Yeltsin, whose term ends in
two years, to step down now. But Zyuganov has emphasized that
Yeltsin should resign voluntarily or face legal impeachment, not a
bloody revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been virtually absent for most of the crisis, and in
the past days has been portrayed by his press service as being
actively involved in mediation of the crisis in Kosovo. The Russian
leader is clearly unpopular, but analysts believe few Russians are
ready to fight for his ouster, and say opposition leaders are not
likely to push too hard for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition is linked with the regime and is no less afraid
of an uprising than'' the regime is, commented Alexander Tsipko, a
political analyst at the daily Nezavsisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   Krasheninnikov told reporters the government had asked Russia's
chief prosecutor to open a criminal investigation against two
speakers at a rally on Sunday who had called for Yeltsin's
overthrow by force.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers, General Albert Makashov, a Communist member
of parliament, also made derogatory remarks against Jews that the
Justice Ministry said constituted fomenting national tensions, a
criminal offense in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Krasheninnikov said he had held talks with main opposition
leaders, who had promised to maintain order over protesters and
refrain from making inflammatory remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, some 11,000 police and 4,000 Interior Ministry
troops will be on hand in Moscow alone, but officials say most of
the officers will be unarmed. The feared OMON riot police will be
held in reserve, a police spokesman said. Meanwhile, the fire
department Tuesday announced its trucks mounted with water cannons,
used against demonstrators in mass protests in 1993, will stay out
off the streets this time.

WHERE THERE'S A WILL...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The man who runs the Los Angeles Philharmonic is
scowling. Scratching his chin. Giving an Oscar-worthy portrayal of
utter confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In his hands, Willem Wijnbergen clutches an oversize,
color-coded chart that looks like the Periodic Table of Elements,
only with the words ``Haydn,'' ``Beethoven'' and ``Bartok''
substituting for ``Hydrogen,'' ``Zinc'' and ``Potassium.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a copy of the orchestra's 1998-99 season schedule, and
Wijnbergen makes no secret what he thinks of the brochure's
complicated design and the confusing message it sends to
``consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first question was, when I saw this, I said, `Gee, I have
to go back to business school to learn how to figure this out',''
Wijnbergen says in his impeccable Dutch-accented English. ``This is
the orchestra world gone berserk. And this is how all (orchestras)
do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not all. Wijnbergen intends for at least one
orchestra _ his _ to pay as much attention to its medium as its
message.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the former Procter &AMP; Gamble executive might put it,
selling classical music these days is as much a matter of
``packaging'' as ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost exactly one year since Willem Wijnbergen
(VIL-em VINE-ber-gun), a 40-year-old Amsterdam native, was named to
the L.A. Phil's top administrative post, succeeding the legendary
Ernest Fleischmann.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 years, the colorful, controversial Fleischmann ran the
orchestra with a tough, top-down management style. Yet few
questioned his energy or exacting artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   During his regime, the Philharmonic launched its ``Green
Umbrella'' new-music series, created the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra,
hosted world premieres and recitals by the cream of international
performers, and rose to the stature of one of the nation's top
half-dozen symphonic entities.
</P>
<P>
   So where does the L.A. Phil go from here? And what kind of boss
does this 6-foot-5-inch Dutchman with the Cheshire-cat grin,
artfully unkempt hair and business degree from Southern Methodist
University intend to be?
</P>
<P>
   Chatting last week in his minimally furnished office at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Wijnbergen acknowledged that his staff
is still adjusting to him. Though he's been on the job since March,
the new season that opens Thursday night will mark his first full
year at the orchestra's helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the staff has its difficulties with me because
I'm a very impatient, pushy guy,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``And
so they have to get used to that. Ernest was tough too, but
different. So I don't know which is better. You should ask them;
you would better get the answers there. But I have a different
style of managing, which seems to be rather informal, but then
again when I want results, I want results. And I think that's the
only way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forthright and opinionated, with a dryly playful sense of humor,
Wijnbergen has a reputation as a take-charge problem-solver. In his
previous job, as managing director of Amsterdam's distinguished
Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, he brought fiscal stability to an
institution that had run up a $3 million deficit after losing half
its government subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his graduate studies in business and arts
administration at SMU in Dallas (he's also a concert-level pianist
and former assistant conductor with the Rotterdam Philharmonic
Orchestra), Wijnbergen set up new fund-raising and marketing
programs at the Concertgebouw. While weaning the orchestra off the
public trough, he was able to build up its endowment, increase
subscriptions and expand its bookings.
</P>
<P>
   That track record, plus Wijnbergen's creative stamina, impressed
the L.A. Phil's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is very hands-on, as was his predecessor's, and very
imaginative,'' says board president Barry Sanders. ``Of course,
he's a relatively young man for this kind of role, and I'd say the
most important thing is his fresh approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Fleischmann, a native German who has lived in South Africa
and England, Wijnbergen also is an outsider with a large, expansive
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think L.A. is a place that likes stars. Ernest was one, and
I think that Willem may be one too,'' observes Peter Pastreich,
executive director of the San Francisco Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Wijnbergen says that ``I had no gameplan, quite frankly'' at the
time when the L.A. Phil approached him. Up to that point, his
career had been a series of intense, five- to seven-year intervals:
from the Music Conservatory of the City of Groningen, where he
earned degrees in piano performance and conducting; to the
Rotterdam Philharmonic; to SMU, where he was recruited by Procter &AMP;
Gamble to serve as a brand manager in its Rotterdam office; to the
Concertgebouw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just made a commitment to my wife where I said, `Let's
not change anything for a couple of years, let's just go on,' '' he
recalls. ``And I said that at a point where the real work of the
Concertgebouw Orchestra really had been done and I was ready for
some new challenges. Because I started in this business pretty
young, and I still felt that I was too young to sit there and be
the boss, which I don't care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience Wijnbergen has inherited is less ethnically and
economically homogenous than the one that greeted Fleischmann in
the late 1960s, though not necessarily as sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basically only the old supporters, the establishment
audience from Hancock Park and Pasadena when I arrived, and now
it's an audience from everywhere,'' Fleischmann says. Though its
tastes in new and contemporary music are broader, new audiences
often are not as familiar with the standard classical repertoire,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   This year's subscription renewal rate at the Dorothy Chandler is
running at about 88 percent, up from 86.4 percent last year. But
subscriptions now account for only about 60 percent of the Dorothy
Chandler's seats, down from 80 percent 10 years ago, said marketing
director Michael Buckland, who notes that other U.S. orchestras
have experienced similar dropoffs. The subscription renewal rate
for the Hollywood Bowl is about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't have ``any ready-made recipes,'' Wijnbergen and
his board have begun setting priorities and mapping out long-term
goals. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising the orchestra's endowment to somewhere between $150
million and $200 million. Currently, it stands at about $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   _Bringing more jazz and world music to the Hollywood Bowl. One
of Wijnbergen's first official acts was to take over management of
the Bowl from former general manager Anne Parsons, who subsequently
left the organization. Wijnbergen says his discussions with Bowl
Orchestra conductor John Mauceri about the orchestra's future are
``in the concluding phase'' and going well.
</P>
<P>
   _Moving the Philharmonic's administrative offices out of the
Dorothy Chandler in order to consolidate operations, which
currently are spread out over seven separate locations. Board
president Sanders says three sites _ two downtown and one in
Hollywood _ are being considered, and that a deal could come by
November.
</P>
<P>
   _Expanding Fleischmann's idea of having the orchestra perform
community concerts throughout the metro area, including San Pedro,
South Central, Koreatown, the heavily Latino Southgate area, the
San Fernando Valley and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _Promoting more cultural alliances with the Phil's downtown
neighbors, including the new Staples arena, currently under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   _Continuing to develop the ``Filmharmonic'' project, which pairs
Hollywood composers and filmmakers to create original, short music
pieces accompanied by films. The second ``Filmharmonic''
installment, a collaboration between director Renny Harlin and
composer Graeme Revell scheduled to premiere this week, has been
postponed while Harlin completes a feature film. In its place will
be a screening of the 1928, 70-minute silent film classic ``The
Wind,'' in sync with the orchestra's live performance of music by
Sibelius. ``Hollywood is not a four-letter word,'' says Winjbergen.
``Hollywood for me is part of a cultural phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   _Test-marketing ``mini-series'' of three and four concerts with
catchy themes such as ``The Magic of the Violin'' and ``This
Surprising Century.'' Wijnbergen believes this will help different
audience segments hone in on the music they like best.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Wijnbergen's most important assignment will be
finding new ways to capitalize on his dynamic and popular music
director. Salonen credits his new colleague with making ``a bold
move'' in coming to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the transition might be easier for him than it was
for me, but I knew from my own experience that it took me a couple
years to learn the ins and outs of the system,'' Salonen says.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief time he's been here, Winjbergen has fallen in love
with L.A.'s diversity, climate, easygoing yet restless ambience and
most everything except Westside housing prices. He and his wife,
along with their four children, have opted for a sprawling 1927
home in Hancock Park.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like, Wijnbergen says, grinning again. His kids
love the beaches and the hiking trails. His wife is coming to grips
with the new language. ``She never spoke much English, so for her
it's a challenge. And the kids don't speak English at all. But I
put them in an American school anyway. So they have to learn before
Christmas, I told them.''

EGYPT REMEMBERS `OCT. 6 WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Marking the 25th anniversary Tuesday of what Egypt calls
the Oct. 6 War, this country clings to the memory of conflict at a
time when the hope for Mideast peace is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled television's all-day coverage was a
barrage of black-and-white images of the 1973 Arab-Israeli
conflict. At a Cairo stadium, 20,000 veterans were decorated by
President Hosni Mubarak, a veteran air force commander. The
military staged a massive parade, the first of its kind in 17 years
since President Anwar Sadat was assassinated at such a display.
</P>
<P>
   At exactly 2:05 p.m., Egyptian radio broadcast the crackly
communique that a quarter century ago announced Egyptian troops had
stormed the Suez Canal. At night, fireworks burst over Cairo's
slums and its rich enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing captured Egypt's intense desire to remember this
war, or the way the war is seared into the nation's collective
consciousness, more than a chaotic scene Tuesday at the Oct. 6
Panorama.
</P>
<P>
   With the usual $1 fee at the war monument lifted for the
national holiday, a crowd swelled to more than 10,000. When
military police tried to hold the crowd back, people scaled the
10-foot high walls. Some forced open the building's huge bronze
doors. Police briefly wielded riot batons to bring the crowd under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he climbed the wall with his two sons, Magdi Shukri,
47, a veteran infantryman, said, ``I want them to see the glorious
victory we had on Oct. 6. We took back our land that was taken from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shukri sees a lesson in this war: ``We had to show strength to
achieve peace. I think the same is true today. We have to show
(Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu that there is a price
to pay for taking Arab land. He has not lived up to the agreements.
Only force will push him to.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria staged a surprise attack on
Israel. Egypt advanced deep into the Sinai. But by the time the
UN-arranged cease-fire took effect Oct. 22, an Israeli
counterattack had retaken most of the ground and actually pushed
deep into Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian history teaches that the war was a victory since Egypt,
after the 1978 Camp David peace accord, reclaimed land in the Sinai
captured by Israel in 1967. Israeli history, on the other hand,
teaches that the Yom Kippur War _ as Israelis call it because it
fell on the Jewish Day of Atonement _ caught its forces off guard
but that it ultimately staved off defeat. Since 1978, both sides
have maintained a ``cold peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still for Egypt, the initial rout of Israeli troops provides a
lasting psychological victory. That was evident at the packed
panorama Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, children merrily climbed all over Egypt's Soviet-made
Mig jet fighters and M-1 tanks. Inside, the revolving, circular
theater presented the action of the 1973 war in living color to a
wide variety of families.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers held sons on shoulders to watch model war planes glide
on wires across a dark sky, and little red lights flare to simulate
Egyptian air attacks on model Israeli planes.
</P>
<P>
   A painted battle scene depicted heroic-looking Egyptian troops
charging across a water-filled model of the Suez Canal and planting
the Egyptian flag on a hillside. The Israeli soldiers cowered in
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the theater seem to cast the war in religious terms.
Although Israelis at times also portray the 1967 Six Day War as a
divine miracle in the narrative of Jewish history, the Egyptian
government's memorial seemed perhaps more overt in its religious
references. As a deep-voiced narator describes advacing Egyptian
troops, dramatic music reaches a crescendo and a choros shouts
``Allah Akbar,'' ``God is great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something in the air on this anniversary,'' says
Walid Kaziha, political science professor at the American
University of Cairo. ``There is a growing feeling in Egypt that the
peace process has faltered, so the memories of the past are coming
flooding back: the sense of the Israeli threat and the question of
whether or not we are prepared for that again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A generation later, it is a way for the ruling elite that
fought this war to tell a new generation what it accomplished,''
adds Kaziha. ``They can't boast a strong economy, but at least they
can say they stopped Israel.''

SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS ON PRIVACY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court considered this question
Tuesday: If you're over at a friend's house for dinner, can you
expect the same right to privacy that you would enjoy at home?
</P>
<P>
   If not, would it be legal for a police officer to look through
the dining room window to see if anyone at the party was committing
a crime?
</P>
<P>
   These issues in a Minnesota drug case may lead the justices to
define privacy rights of guests in someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   The case also calls on the justices to decide whether a
Minnesota police officer engaged in an illegal search of a private
apartment when he looked through a gap in the blinds of a kitchen
window to see if cocaine was being bagged for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the officer argue that his actions were a search of
the premises without a warrant and, therefore, were illegal. The
state of Minnesota has contended that the officer was merely
viewing what any person walking by the apartment could have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the state, James C. Backstrom, a Dakota County
prosecutor in Hasting, Minn., argued that unless temporary guests
are staying overnight, they cannot expect the same protection given
to the homeowners under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   To back up his position, he cited a 1990 Supreme Court ruling
that an overnight guest in a private home has the same privacy
rights as the homeowner. In that ruling, the justices did not
consider whether such protection is enjoyed by guests who only stay
for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Backstrom's argument was met with resistance from several
justices, who suggested a number of hypothetical instances when a
person visiting someone's home might expect the same protection
against unreasonable police searches as would the owner of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about a person who comes over once a week to play
poker?'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. ``Can that person
expect privacy while their play poker?''
</P>
<P>
   Backstrom answered ``no'' but said a more frequent visitor might
have a stronger argument.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter questioned what role the frequency of
visits to a house had in the debate over privacy. ``If they play
(poker) five times a week, they get standing, but if they play
once, they don't?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Backstrom why privacy should be
denied to anyone who is invited into another person's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep coming back to the idea of ``mi casa es su casa _ my
house is yours,''' he said. ``If someone invited you there,
shouldn't you expect privacy?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested that a line could be drawn
between business guests and personal guests to determine who should
expect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why the Avon lady, with all of her products out on
the table, should expect more privacy in someone's living room than
at an office or a store,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a drug bust on the night of May 15, 1994, in
Eagan, Minn. At about 8 p.m., a police officer, James Thielen, was
tipped off by an informant that cocaine powder was being bagged in
an apartment down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Thielen went to the apartment complex to investigate the tip. He
walked up to the window and peered through a gap in the Venetian
blinds, which were down. Inside, he saw two men and a woman
measuring and bagging what looked like cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the two men walked left the apartment and drove
away, Thielen stopped and arrested the two men, Wayne Carter and
Melvin Johns. On the floor of the car, he noticed a handgun
sticking out of a zippered bag.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects _ who did not live at the apartment _ were
later convicted of conspiracy to commit a drug crime and aiding the
commission of a drug crime. They appealed, saying the police
engaged in an illegal search.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court last year threw out their
convictions, saying the two men could assert their Fourth Amendment
rights and that Thielen's action were an unlawful search.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Bradford Carter, representing the two men, told
the justices that Thielen's actions became illegal as soon as he
left the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an officer can see into the window from the sidewalk,
that's one thing,'' Carter said. ``But when he crouches 12 inches
from the window and peers through slits in the blind, that's
invading privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also noted the difference between an officer looking
into a window from the sidewalk _ where anyone would be able to see
into the apartment _ and an officer walking up to the window and
staring into an opening in the blinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A police officer can go to a residence with a closed blind ...
stoop down to peer between the cracks ... and that's perfectly
legitimate?'' she asked. ``Isn't that different in quality and
nature'' from simply walking by and seeing inside an open window,
she asked?
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey A. Lamken, who supported the
state of Minnesota, argued that it is not a search when a police
officer sees something that is exposed to outside view.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts have denied privacy protection for activities that
are easily observable by the public.

   &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's at the top of her form right now: Her movie,
``Beloved,'' is about to open, she's the richest and most
influential woman in entertainment, she's celebrated as a proponent
of reading and all things bright and beautiful, and she's on the
cover of the latest Vogue, looking terrific.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the story of her humble beginnings, her rise to
stardom, her longtime romance, her crash diets, weight regain and
much-admired, sensible decision to give up dieting in favor of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe being queen of the TV world isn't enough. Vogue's
 &UR; Anna Wintour &LR;  exults in the editor's note at the front of the Oprah
issue that the magazine staff was thrilled ``when we heard that
Oprah Winfrey wanted to be made glamorous. She knew she had to lose
weight, but she has done that before, and she promised she would
lose 20 pounds by our deadline. She did. ... Our fashion editor
said that she was so moved by the Polaroids taken during the shoot
that she went to her dressing room to be alone and came out with
moist eyes. There's something reassuring in the fact that Oprah,
one of the most powerful women in America, should nurture her own
dreams of perfect beauty and allure _ just like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Our instant minipoll of five women found that 100 percent found
nothing at all reassuring about it. A one-word description of their
assessment: bummer.

   &UR; ANOTHER DIETER MAKES GOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the premiere of her TV talk show, the  &UR; Duchess &LR; 
 &UR; of York &LR;  promised that she would be good. ``I'm not going to be
saying anything wrong or bad about the royal family,'' she told the
Telegraph of London.
</P>
<P>
   The show will focus on people, like herself, who have suffered.
``I want to talk to real, proper people who've been through hell,''
she said. ``People like my friend Irene, who lost her daughter at
14 through drugs. What was that like for her? I can think of
nothing worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know. I would hate it if my children took drugs or
got leukemia, so if I can help by spreading the word, it might ease
the drug situation or encourage people to give bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's first show featured a hit-and-run driver and a rape
victim; the second was about anorexia, the third about cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess dedicated Monday's program to the memory of her
mother, who recently died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Life in public isn't easy for her, she told the Telegraph.
``People who know me say `poor you' because they know I'm actually
a shy person. Not many people realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Elsewhere in the Chat-for-Hire empire,  &UR; Marie Osmond &LR; , who has
a new talk show, promotes it Friday with an appearance on the Food
Network, in which she tells host  &UR; Bill Boggs &LR;  of her suspicions
that  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  knew what was going on. ``Please,'' pleaded
Osmond. ``I'm a woman. Let's talk.'')

   &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's at the top of her form right now: Her movie,
``Beloved,'' is about to open, she's the richest and most
influential woman in entertainment, she's celebrated as a proponent
of reading and all things bright and beautiful, and she's on the
cover of the latest Vogue, looking terrific.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the story of her humble beginnings, her rise to
stardom, her longtime romance, her crash diets, weight regain and
much-admired, sensible decision to give up dieting in favor of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe being queen of the TV world isn't enough. Vogue's
 &UR; Anna Wintour &LR;  exults in the editor's note at the front of the Oprah
issue that the magazine staff was thrilled ``when we heard that
Oprah Winfrey wanted to be made glamorous. She knew she had to lose
weight, but she has done that before, and she promised she would
lose 20 pounds by our deadline. She did. ... Our fashion editor
said that she was so moved by the Polaroids taken during the shoot
that she went to her dressing room to be alone and came out with
moist eyes. There's something reassuring in the fact that Oprah,
one of the most powerful women in America, should nurture her own
dreams of perfect beauty and allure _ just like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Our instant minipoll of five women found that 100 percent found
nothing at all reassuring about it. A one-word description of their
assessment: bummer.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER DIETER MAKES GOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the premiere of her TV talk show, the  &UR; Duchess &LR; 
 &UR; of York &LR;  promised that she would be good. ``I'm not going to be
saying anything wrong or bad about the royal family,'' she told the
Telegraph of London.
</P>
<P>
   The show will focus on people, like herself, who have suffered.
``I want to talk to real, proper people who've been through hell,''
she said. ``People like my friend Irene, who lost her daughter at
14 through drugs. What was that like for her? I can think of
nothing worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know. I would hate it if my children took drugs or
got leukemia, so if I can help by spreading the word, it might ease
the drug situation or encourage people to give bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's first show featured a hit-and-run driver and a rape
victim; the second was about anorexia, the third about cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess dedicated Monday's program to the memory of her
mother, who recently died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Life in public isn't easy for her, she told the Telegraph.
``People who know me say `poor you' because they know I'm actually
a shy person. Not many people realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Elsewhere in the Chat-for-Hire empire,  &UR; Marie Osmond &LR; , who has
a new talk show, promotes it Friday with an appearance on the Food
Network, in which she tells host  &UR; Bill Boggs &LR;  of her suspicions
that  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  knew what was going on. ``Please,'' pleaded
Osmond. ``I'm a woman. Let's talk.'')

   _ Start reading now if you want to be hip: The inside pick for
this year's Nobel Prize for Literature, says the New York Post (as
much an authority on literature as is the New York Review of Books
on action flicks), is  &UR; Bill Auld &LR; , a retired Scottish schoolteacher
who has written 52 books of poetry in Esperanto.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several readers noted that a stamp honoring the circus had
featured a living person, clown  &UR; Lou Jacobs &LR; ; and  &UR; Jeremy Klein &LR; 
said that the stamp featuring the Iwo Jima monument in Washington,
based on  &UR; Joe Rosenthal &LR; 's war photo, included images of living
people, too. And this is not to mention moon-walker
 &UR; Neil Armstrong. T.S. &LR;   &UR; Bolton &LR; , who takes the Postal Service
seriously, is reeling from the news that Superman is dead.

   _ Watching the UCLA football game on TV over the weekend, &UR; Al &LR; 
 &UR; Guthertz &LR;  didn't feel exactly festive observing the moment of

described by the TV commentator as ``part of the halftime
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Supreme Court Justice  &UR; Joseph Teresi  &LR; has denied  &UR; Al &LR;

SCANDAL SEDUCES THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It took a mighty effort, but for a while there, those
disinclined to pay attention to that sort of thing could almost
ignore the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky mess.
</P>
<P>
   Just another tacky political soap opera, you could tell
yourself. There are more important things to worry about. I'll wait
for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed. Somewhere along the line Ken Starr's
crusade evolved (or devolved, depending on your point of view) from
inside-the-beltway business to genuine pop-culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Proof? Look no further than last week, when Roseanne, in her new
guise as a daytime talk-show host, offered Lewinsky upwards of $1
million to appear on her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pay her big,'' Roseanne said on CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' show, a real meeting of the minds. I can't believe I'm
saying it, but this almost made me miss Tom Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: I have not seen Roseanne's talk show, so I
can't say whether she's any good at her new job. But I'm confident
she's better at this than at her previous role as national-anthem
singer. For instance, I'll bet she doesn't grab her crotch on her
show.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, Oprah Winfrey took the high road, saying
negotiations to bring Lewinsky on her show fell apart over money.
Now that she has turned Monica down, she can get back to the
business of promoting sappy novels.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I don't blame Oprah. Although at first I thought of a
Monica interview as a bad investment. After all the releases of
reports and videotapes and transcripts, once you get beyond the one
obvious question _ don't you believe in dry cleaning? _ what else
is there that we don't already know?
</P>
<P>
   On further reflection, I realized the Monica interview would be
a gold mine. The romantic, afternoon-TV types would want to know if
the commander in chief closes his eyes when he kisses, and lowlifes
would want to know . . . well, most of what they would want to know
is already in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, though, Oprah's right _ paying for
interviews is normally frowned upon unless you work for a
publication that routinely runs stories with such headlines as
``Evidence of Bigfoot found in Martian crater'' and ``Elizabeth
Taylor speaks: My torrid affair with Nostradamus _ he anticipated
my every need.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that there aren't elements of the Monica
story that I wouldn't like to see Roseanne pay for. For instance,
whatever Roseanne's offering Lewinsky, she should pay Linda Tripp
double (begin ital) not (end ital) to talk. And a similar amount
for Tripp and her pal Lucianne Goldberg to fly back to the coven.
</P>
<P>
   More pop-culture saturation: Starr's report has been published
in three different editions, so that you can select the one that
most closely caters to your prurient needs. (Well, almost _ none is
illustrated. Be thankful for small favors.)
</P>
<P>
   And it's selling like ``The Bridges of Madison County''
(speaking of tacky soap operas), which makes you wonder about all
those polls that say Americans are sick of the whole, er, affair.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to admit to buying the report, mind you. It's like
getting caught in the checkout line of a mainstream bookstore with
a copy of ``Playboy.'' ``Uh, it's not for me! I'm buying it for a
friend. But it's nice seeing you, Father Doyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to wedge it in between copies of ``Ulysses''
and ``The Sound and the Fury'' and hope no one notices it.
</P>
<P>
   The whole sordid mess is rife with other pop-culture
possibilities. ``Love in the Oval Office (or right next door)''
would be a good name for a soundtrack album, pulling together songs
from the CDs the two traded as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of blue Gap dresses _ the Intern Collection _ could keep
the Home Shopping Network afloat for months.
</P>
<P>
   And I can't believe there isn't a designer line of ``message''
ties on the market already. Is the fashion world asleep at the
switch? No wonder models are always frowning.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Who knows? But the TV movie can't be far behind. &QL;

CONGRESS (Washington) - Could we be headed toward another
government shutdown at the end of the week? Republicans paid dearly
for the shutdown of 1995-96, and there are signs that they don't
have the stomach to do it again. At issue is a giant spending bill
needed to fund government operations when the current stopgap
measure expires Friday. GOP hard-liners want the measure to include
tax cuts and environmental provisions that President Clinton
believes are irresponsible. He'd veto the bill, and the government
would be forced to close. But many in the GOP seem to be leaning
toward a non-controversial bill that would send Congress home for
the elections without having to answer questions about who was to
blame for another shutdown. We'll get the views of Arizona members
as well as national leaders. By ADRIANNE FLYNN and JEFF BARKER.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EAGLE DIES (Undated) - JD _ Arizona's most prolific and
longest-lived male bald eagle _ has died, either of natural causes
or possibly because of wounds inflicted by another bird, wildlife
officials said Monday. He was 19, nearly twice the average lifespan
of desert-nesting bald eagles in the wild. JD's twin sister, known
simply as the Alamo Lake female, now reigns as Arizona's
longest-lived bald eagle in the wild. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL;

BOOK-NAVAJO (Undated) _ ``The First Eagle,'' Tony Hillerman's

missing woman and murder are blended in the mystery story that
stretches from a place called Yells Back Butte near Black Mesa, to
Kaibeto, Cedar Ridge and Flagstaff. They're familiar sites
throughout the land where my relatives have herded sheep for
decades. I wanted to like this story. By BETTY REID. Story moved in

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR; The  &LR; situation comedy ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' which has sparked two weeks of protest, earned
paltry national ratings with its Monday night debut.
</P>
<P>
   Some local viewers agree the show's future is dim, but more
because of its lack of humor than its controversial premise _ a
black butler working in the White House during the Civil War era.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom drew a national rating of 1.6 (percentages of
television sets tuned in) with a share of 2 (percentage of
television sets in use tuned in), according to Nielsen Media
Research. Those numbers are on par with the remainder of United
Paramount Network's (KCOP, Channel 13) Monday prime-time lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The show attracted its largest audiences in the nation's largest
cities. Its highest rating was in New York (4.1/6), followed by Los
Angeles (3.6/5). Its rating in the top 40 markets was 2.5 with a 4
share.
</P>
<P>
   Three protests at Paramount Studios in Hollywood led by the
Brotherhood Crusade, and the Los Angeles City Council's unanimous
vote last week condemning the show raised public awareness of the
brewing controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Parker of North Hills was among those who tuned in Monday
night after hearing about the protests. Her conclusion: Take the
show off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything racist about it,'' said Parker, who is
African-American. ``But I didn't find it funny. I didn't really
dislike anything in particular about the show, but it wasn't funny
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Williams of Palmdale also found the program unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it as offensive. I don't know why people are
having an uproar about it,'' said Williams, an African-American.
``I just found it disinteresting and boring.''
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom came under fire as soon as word spread that the
``Pfeiffer'' premiere originally contained a scene of two men being
hanged in Britain _ a parallel to lynchings of the time. The scene
was edited out long before the pilot ever hit the air, but
protesters, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, say depictions like
that trivialize the painful period of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   They are incensed that such a show dealing with a subject as
painful as slavery and oppression would be permitted on television
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all it was historically incorrect,'' said Mollie Bell
of Compton, who has attended all three rallys at Paramount,
including one on Monday morning. ``Our people did not keep diaries
in those days. It was against the law for us to read or write. I
find it very offensive. They should hear our cries and feel our
pain and do the right thing and take it off the air,'' said Bell,
an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting voice at Monday morning's demonstration was
Randolph Scott, an African-American Inglewood resident, who stood
with a sign supporting UPN in one hand and a red Doberman pinscher
_ for protection, he says _ in the other. He likes some shows on
UPN, he said, and would not criticize the entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, an actor who has appeared on a onetime UPN sitcom called
``Sparks,'' saw the original pilot, including the hanging scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with some of the situations, like the hanging,''
he said, ``but I think there is some funny stuff in the show. UPN
gives a lot of black actors work.''

HOUSE PAYS TRIBUTE TO RETIRING GERALD SOLOMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With numerous references to his famous temper and
even-handed tenure as chairman of the Rules Committee, lawmakers
across the political spectrum took to the House floor Tuesday to
praise Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., who is retiring after 20
years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In convivial banter that at times resembled a roast, lawmakers
took more than 90 minutes from a busy calendar in the final
scheduled week of the 105th Congress to say goodbye to Solomon and
hail his accomplishments during 10 terms.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, the 68-year-old lawmaker has represented a generally
rural and conservative upstate New York district that stretches 200
miles along the state's eastern border.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon has earned a reputation for passionate, often combative
politics, the ideological foundation of which was best articulated
by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Congress the same year as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and Solomon has been an able lieutenant in the
majority ever since the Republicans took control of the House in
the 1994 election and an ardent critic of most Clinton
administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., the ranking Democrat on the
Rules Committee, called the retiring lawmaker ``a tireless defender
of American veterans'' who has ``served with distinction and done
his party a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   While Solomon, a conservative loyal to Gingrich, and Moakley, a
liberal, are ideological opposites, Moakley said he considered
Solomon a very good friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon's one downfall, quipped Moakley, is that he can't
resist talking about his stint during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so proud of his beloved Marine Corps that he still gets
their haircut,'' said Moakley, referring to Solomon's crew cut.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Rep. Louis Stokes of Ohio, who also is
retiring, described Solomon as ``animated, passionate and a real
showman. No matter how much you disagree with him, you have to
admire him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Republicans and 17 Democrats are retiring from the House
or seeking other office this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Solomon has ``made a great
contribution to this House.''
</P>
<P>
   With Solomon seated nearby, House Majority Leader Richard Armey,
R-Texas, joked about the accolades. ``What a mark you've made,''
Armey said. ``People that hardly noticed you when you came here
have their hearts filled with joy (now) that you are leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   But most paid tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, told Solomon that ``at a time of overpowering cynicism,
you have proven by your 20 years here in Congress that politics can
be a noble profession because you brought some nobility to it. We
will miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are in the minority, numerous Democratic
lawmakers said Solomon had always been fair and allowed them a
voice on the Rules Committee, which has executed a conservative
legislative agenda since the Republicans took over control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon, a combative partisan, would never give too much,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry has a way of turning you down with a smile,'' said Rep.
Carrie Meek, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio: ``Oftentimes, when we get run over
by Jerry, he does it with style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My nickname for Jerry is `the battler,''' said Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, R-N.Y., the chairman of the House International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., said Solomon was a potent
political ally because ``if you are not (on the same side of an
issue) it's full combat.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's combativeness has ignited his well-known temper on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he apologized for saying on the House floor
that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ``ought to be horsewhipped''
for siding with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over the interests
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1996 debate on repealing a ban on certain
semi-automatic assault weapons, Solomon, who fought to repeal the
ban, became embroiled in a heated floor debate with Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., who was against the repeal. After their exchange,
Solomon continued the debate with Kennedy, 31, during which Solomon
was heard to say: ``Let's just step outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues and Solomon himself joked about that incident
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Solomon: ``I'm going to invite all of you ... to step
outside so that I can hug the women and shake hands with the men
and thank you,'' he said on one of his final appearances from the
House floor. ``I just love you all.''

CRITICISM BESETS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S KOSOVO PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon offered fighter planes for a NATO
attack to halt an offensive in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and
said that an international force of ground troops might be
dispatched as peacekeepers. But Congress and European allies
expressed doubts Tuesday about what a strike could accomplish. The
increasing criticism, coming from Republicans and Democrats alike,
jeopardized the Clinton administration's threats of an imminent
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration found itself thwarted by
the slow decision-making of the United Nations and NATO as well as
the political skills of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. As
he has after several attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
province, Milosevic kept negotiations alive Tuesday, tantalizing
Westerners who want a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After talking by phone to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Clinton said ``NATO is prepared to act'' with air power. Milosevic
can avoid an attack by halting his offensive against separatists,
allowing refugees to return home, giving aid groups free access to
villages that have been razed and starting real talks with the
separatists, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says time is running out because Milosevic's
forces have driven 250,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, to the
hills, where they face starvation and disease this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the ``arrogance'' of Milosevic, Defense Secretary
William Cohen said the US government has pledged to provide attack
planes to NATO if there is an air strike. NATO's plans for
Milosevic involve ``inflicting enough damage to reduce his capacity
to wage war,'' Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said a ground force of peacekeepers _ a smaller version of
the force that includes 7,500 American troops in Bosnia _ would be
``a possibility.'' But he added that the soldiers should Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Clinton's supporters, Carl Levin, the
highest-ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
called military action in Kosovo ``the best of a number of bad
options.'' Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, who chairs the
committee, was more critical. ``We have not considered the impact
of this decision on US and NATO (peacekeeping) forces in Bosnia''
who could be targets of retaliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran, dressed down
the Pentagon chief, saying, ``I have to tell you, Secretary Cohen,
right now many of us are very concerned'' about the prospect of an
attack. McCain said the administration suffers a ``credibility
gap'' because of a broken promise in 1997 to withdraw America
peacekeeping forces from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has put together plans for both a quick strike and a
prolonged strike, and a final approval from the 16 members is
expected this week. But Congressional aides who keep tabs on the
Pentagon and the State Department predicted that there would not be
an attack just yet, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've waited too long on Kosovo, and Milosevic has
basically been able to accomplish 90 percent of what he wanted
while NATO and the US were dawdling,'' said a foreign policy
specialist who works for a Congressional committee who did not want
to be named. ``And let's face it. we're in the middle of this other
mess (a debate about impeachment).''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members in Congress and humanitarian groups in Washington
complained that most European countries have given a tepid
reception to discussions about an attack on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's tough talk was contradicted by a flurry of
diplomatic efforts in New York, Moscow, Belgrade and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned that any NATO attack
would lead to ``serious international consequences.'' Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov announced that Russia would veto any effort in
the UN to authorize air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A military strike will not help normalize the situation but
will have the opposite effect,'' Iganov said in comments that
convinced other diplomats the UN Security Council will not agree to
a strike. Russia is one of five permanent members of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,
said legislators would call for a review of Russia's relations with
NATO if the alliance used force.

TUTU CHIDES US FOR FAILURE TO SETTLE RACIAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa spoke
Tuesday of the miracle of South Africa's peace, the promise of
Ireland's, and of the failure of the United States to come to terms
with its own racial struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have scored a great victory over Apartheid,'' Tutu said.
``Miracles do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, 66, has just completed some of the most emotionally
wrenching work of his life, as chairman of South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. The commission has heard testimony from
the victims of apartheid _ and from their victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, retired Episcopal archbishop of South Africa, won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his crusade against apartheid. He is
living in the United States for a year on sabbatical, and begins
teaching at Emory University in Atlanta in January.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Tuesday 25th annual meeting of the New Hampshire
Humanities Council, in the only state in the nation to fail to
enact a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's a great shame,'' he said of New Hamshire's
failure to enact the King Day legislation. ``And I would hope that
those who are able to do so would correct a very bad mistake as
soon as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu discussed his recent visit to Northern Ireland, where he
met with leaders of the Irish peace process.
</P>
<P>
   To the people of Ireland, Tutu said: ``keep on going on, and
hold on, because the prize is too precious. ...There is no doubt at
all. The Good Friday settlement is going to succeed. The people are
too determined for anything else to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu also said Tuesday that the United States must to come to
terms with its own ugly racial past, if wounds opened by slavery
and oppression are ever to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't dealt with the aftermath of slavery and the Civil
War,'' Tutu said. ``And there are pains in the pit of the tummy of
so may people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't healed,'' Tutu said of America's racial wounds.
``They've festered. Open them up. Cleanse them. ...You're
constantly, I'm afraid, going to be shocked by racial outbursts
until you find a way of trying to come to terms with your past.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu also expressed increduilty over the investigation of
President Clinton for his sexual transgressions. He recently signed
a letter of protest against special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation, which has cost American taxpayers more than $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am actually quite surprised by what seems an extraordinary
obsession,'' over the Lewinsky matter, Tutu said. ``To spend over
$40 million. ...'' Tutu burst into laughter. ``Forty million?''
asked Tutu, shocked. ``For what?! People are hungry, even in this
country. I would think $40 million could have been used in so many
more creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your president has done what it is very difficult to do when
you are wrong. I don't know about you, but I find it very difficult
even in the intimacy and privacy of my bedroom to say to my wife
`I'm sorry.' Can you imagine having to say it in the full glare of
television lights?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to rub his nose in the mud? Why do you want to
wipe your boots all over him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You (Americans) really are an incredible people,'' Tutu said.
``Generous and loving, and caring...but you are also very
strange.''

MARTINEZ, KENNEDY OFFER FUNDS TO SHIP RELIEF GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, Red Sox CEO John
Harrington, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy and Catholic Charities
stepped into the breach to pay between $30,000 and $40,000 to ship
supplies that have been stranded in Massachusetts to victims of
Hurricane Georges in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a report in Tuesday's Globe about difficulties
Dominican leaders are having sending tons of donated goods to the
Dominican Republic, Martinez, who is Dominican, announced he would
give $10,000 toward shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Harrington promised to match Martinez's gift with $10,000
from the team's Yawkey Foundation. Kennedy said from Washington
that he would donate funds through his Citizen's Energy
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities of Boston will collect the funds, adding a
gift of its own, according to Jack Dunn, the organization's vice
president for external affairs. The money will then go to Catholic
Relief Services, which will oversee the shipping.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Steve Cunningham of American Medical Resources
Foundation said his organization would pay to ship one or two
45-foot containers of merchandise to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Relief Fund, established by 35 local Dominican
community leaders, has collected enough donations to fill 15
45-foot shipping containers _ including everything from insulin and
baby formula to 500 beds donated by Holiday Inn. Most of the items
were donated by Latino communities in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The effort had come under criticism when organizers failed to
find a means for shipping the donated goods, which as of Tuesday
were being warehoused at a school in Lawrence, a Cablevision office
in Hyde Park and an Army base in Worcester. Some members of the
Dominican-American community questioned the committee's
professionalism for campaigning hard to collect items, without
having secured a means for transporting the merchandise ahead of
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlos Veras, assistant to the Dominican Consul in Boston
and one of the people who spearheaded the effort, defended his
group's actions, saying they had been working ``20 hours a day
since the hurricane hit'' to find transportation for the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just much, much more expensive than we realized,''
Veras said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Martinez has given money to causes in
the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he did after signing a $75 million
contract with the Red Sox was to build a church, school, day care
center and ball diamond in his hometown of Manoguayabo.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez told the Globe he still remembers the terror he felt
living through Hurricane David when he was 7. Citizens of
Manoguayabo reportedly used the church Martinez built as a shelter
during Hurricane Georges.

DALLAS INVENTOR WANTS HIGH COURT TO OVERTURN RULING, RESTORE
PATENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An inventor from suburban Dallas urged a skeptical
Supreme Court on Tuesday to restore his high-tech patent, which a
lower court revoked because he missed a one-year filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jerry Selinger, pressing the case of inventor Wayne
Pfaff, said the federal appeals court misread federal law when it
ruled that his client waited too long to seek a patent for his
invention after placing it on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Selinger said the one-year time limit begins only after an
invention has been finished, not when it is merely substantially
completed, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff's creation, a socket to hold computer microchips during
testing, was only in preliminary stages when he agreed to sell the
product to Texas Instruments on April 8, 1981, more than a year
before applying for a patent on April 19, 1982, Selinger added.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for a high-tech company that sells a competing
socket design and the Clinton administration countered that the
one-year clock begins before the product is finished.
</P>
<P>
   C. Randall Bain, who represents Wells Electronics, said the
clock starts when a proposed invention is sufficiently complete
that it would qualify for a patent. Assistant Solicitor General
Jeffrey Minear argued that an inventor runs afoul of patent law
when he advertises his still unfinished product for sale and then
waits more than a year before seeking a patent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the justices were critical of all the arguments,
questioning the attorneys' contrasting definitions of ``invention''
under the patent law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, noting that patents have been
awarded based solely on blueprints, said that the one-year limit
perhaps starts as early as when plans are drawn for an invention.
But Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether a sale can be made before
an invention is actually completed.
</P>
<P>
   Selinger responded that an invention, for patent law purposes,
refers to a new product that has progressed well beyond the
planning stages to something that has been ``reduced to practice.''
Congress did not intend for the one-year clock to start until an
invention is complete so as to allow inventors to test the market
for their ideas, the Dallas attorney added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bain countered that the one-year clock begins when an
invention, or the idea for one, has progressed to the extent that
it is capable of being patented. Congress intended the time
constraint to encourage inventors to apply for patents at the
earliest possible time, the Phoenix lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
   Minear defended his even broader definition of invention, saying
Congress intended to put the onus on inventors to finish their
proposed creations. When the one-year clock starts is solely ``in
the hands of the inventor,'' who puts the time in motion when he
places his prospective invention on the market, the government
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff so far has had mixed results in court. The U.S. District
Court for Northern Texas agreed with his claim that Wells
Electronics infringed on his patent, which was awarded Jan. 1,
1985. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
hears patent cases, reversed that decision, saying the one-year
clock was already running when Pfaff reached the sales agreement
with Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to render its decision by next
summer. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Next year will be the centennial of the birth of
Alfred Hitchcock, cinema's master of suspense, who was born on Aug.
13, 1899, and died in 1980. The Museum of Modern Art intends to
celebrate with a complete retrospective. From April to July, it
will show Hitchcock's 53 feature films and two shorts and exhibit
posters, photographs and papers relating to the life and work of
the man who made films like ``The 39 Steps,'' ``Rebecca,'' ``Rear
Window,'' ``Vertigo'' and ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Contenders

<P>
   The 1998 Nobel Prize season opens Wednesday in Stockholm with
the announcement of the award in literature. The six prizes _ in
medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and peace _ each carrying
an award of $938,000, will be announced over nine days ending Oct.
16.
</P>
<P>
   Because last year's Nobel laureate in literature, the Italian
playwright Dario Fo, proved a surprise, speculation is cautious
this year. But the French writers Michel Tournier and Jean-Marie Le
Clezio have been contenders for a decade, along with Gunter Grass
of Germany and the Dutch writer Cees Noteboom. Also mentioned are
the British author Salman Rushdie, the Albanian writer Ismail
Kadare and the Portuguese writers Jose Saramago and Antonio Lobo
Antunes.

   Five years after he stepped down abruptly as music director of
the Philadelphia Orchestra, Riccardo Muti was greeted with a
thundering standing ovation when he returned Monday night to lead a
benefit performance of Italian and theatrical works at the Academy
of Music in Philadelphia. ``This is a very short visit, but I
promise it will not be my last,'' he said. Muti, 57, is now the
music director of La Scala opera house in Milan.

<P>
   Road Trip

   With a performance Wednesday night in Rossiya Hall in Moscow,
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis, begins
its fall 1998 World Tour of 33 cities in Europe, the United States,
Canada and South America. Prior to many concerts, the orchestra
will offer educational programming that includes master classes,
clinics, lectures and workshops for students and others.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers
</P>
<P>
   Having already banned productions of the 16th-century opera
``The Peony Pavilion'' at Lincoln Center Festival '98 and at the
Paris Autumn Festival, Chinese officials have now forbidden the
Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to perform the opera at the annual
Hong Kong Arts Festival, opening in February. The 19-hour epic
deals with a young woman who meets her lover in a dream. Cultural
officials in Shanghai have deemed the production ``ideologically
unsuitable and pornographic.''

PRIME MINISTER APPEARS FOR CALM AS WORKERS PREPARE FOR NATIONWIDE
STRIKE S 
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Prime Minister made an extraordinary appeal
for calm Tuesday night as millions of Communists and trade
unionists prepared nationwide strikes over the ravaged economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way out of the crisis for Russia is in public order and
consent, stability and discipline,'' the prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, said in a televised address. ``I would to like call on
everybody not to rock our common boat in today's stormy seas.''
</P>
<P>
   And in case the summons to patriotism was not enough, Primakov
piled promise upon promise in a last-minute effort to win over
Russia's disaffected and dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two weeks in office, Primakov has yet to
complete a plan to drag Russia out of its economic distress. But
the strikes, planned for Wednesday, clearly weigh heavily on the
minds of Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   With prices soaring, the ruble sagging and a mountain of wages
due, the Communists, unions and an array of splinter groups are
flexing their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   They have already placed Communists at the head of the Central
Bank and at the helm of the government's economic policy. The
strikes appear aimed at maintaining the pressure on Primakov to
steer a leftward course and on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, boasted Tuesday that 10
million Russians would stop work and join in the protest over
overdue wages and a faltering economy. Millions more, he insisted,
would find other ways to show their support.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists have a record of exaggerating their numbers.
Moscow authorities, however, are taking no chances: An estimated
11,000 police officers and 6,000 interior ministry troops are ready
in the capital to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   The permits issued by the authorities for the protests specify
that the main demonstrations are to be held far from the White
House, the government headquarters, which is still a potent
emotional symbol for the left. The vast marble structure was
shelled in 1993 after Yeltsin called out tanks to quell a
rebellious Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and their allies insist that as many as 200,000
protesters will march toward St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square.
Protests are also scheduled in St. Petersburg, where demonstrators
plan to gather in front of the Winter Palace, which was the focus
of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and in other cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's speech was something of a national debut for
Primakov, 68. His career was built largely out of the public eye,
at the foreign ministry and as chief of the intelligence service,
and the role of national conciliator is a new one. It is a part he
is clearly still struggling to master.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has extolled Franklin D. Roosevelt and talked about the
need for a Russian New Deal. The intent of his address was to
uplift the nation, much as Roosevelt did with his ``fireside
chats.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many respects it appeared to be a heavy-handed government
production. The taped address was broadcast during prime time,
against a backdrop of Moscow evening traffic, as if to assure a
nervous nation that life in the capital was proceeding more or less
normally. The tape was heavily edited, with jarring transitions
between close-ups and longer-range shots of the somber Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he appeared to say what many Russians want to hear,
mainly by cataloguing measures that have already been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister promised to pay back wages to the army.
He promised Russians they would have sufficient fruit, vegetables
and potatoes through the winter. Rail tariffs for food are to be
slashed, and Ukraine and Belarus will be allowed to pay debts to
Russia by bartering food.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov even promised to return more than $1 billion worth of
equipment that was confiscated from tax delinquents in order to
help those enterprises make a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Having sought to placate the left, Primakov balanced his appeal
by saying that he did not want to insult the government of his
predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also said privatization would go on, the tax system
would be reformed and foreign and domestic debts would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say exactly how all this would be accomplished, but
insisted that he was being unfairly criticized for failing to issue
an economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov said his government could not complete his program
until it knew if the International Monetary Fund would disburse
billions in fresh funds. Such aid seems very unlikely until
Primakov demonstrates that he is prepared to take the tough steps
to build a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and my colleagues have been reproached for not producing a
complete, finished economic program within the government's first
few weeks,'' he said. ``There will be a program. But the financial
side of the program depends on negotiations we are conducting in
the country and outside it.''

LEYRITZ SURE, STEADY UNDER PLAYOFF PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I probably shouldn't be spilling trade secrets, but
they try to spoon-feed us when the big games come. Tuesday
afternoon they dragged the usual interrogation suspects to the
interview room. You know, there were the skippers, Bobby Cox and
Bruce Bochy. There were Wednesday night's National League
Championship Series Game 1 starting pitchers, John Smoltz and Andy
Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there was Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Who isn't even in the San Diego starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, the new Mr. October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always joked that I get paid for April and October,'' he
says. ``April, most of the guys are hurt coming out of spring
training and I get to play a little more. And I've had some success
in October.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean success as in three home runs in four games of the
Division Series against the Astros? You mean success as in the
three-run, game-tying, eighth-inning homer off Mark Wohlers in Game
4 of the '96 World Series? You mean success as in a 15th-inning,
game-winning home run in Game 2 of the '95 Division Series?
</P>
<P>
   I think, yes, that's what he has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz is one of those sports oddities who keep the entire
enterprise from ever becoming mundane. He is a career .270 kind of
hitter, a versatile guy who has played first, second, third,
outfield, catcher, and, of course, DH. He is a fielder of no
particular distinction, but he's good enough to get by.
</P>
<P>
   No manager has ever looked at him and said, ``This man is too
good to keep out of the lineup.'' The 114 games he managed between
the Red Sox and San Diego this year exceed his previous season high
by 19. But turn the biggest spotlight you've got on this guy, and
suddenly, he's Joe Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Jim Leyritz, but he's gotta have heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy performs under pressure the way he does,'' says
Bochy, the Padres manager, ``and comes through with the kind of
clutch hits he gets, it's obvious he's very relaxed and wants to be
the guy up there with the game on the line and he's got the perfect
makeup for it. He enjoys the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has an interesting theory about his ability to produce
the big hit. It starts with the fact that he was an undrafted
player coming out of the University of Kentucky. No one ever gave
him anything in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think some of the other guys understand what it's
like,'' he explains. ``I have always felt that I've had to prove
myself every single day. I've never had the luxury of being put in
the lineup for three weeks or a month and left alone. Every at-bat
I've ever had in the big leagues has been a big situation for me
because I never knew what the next day would bring. I've hit six
homers in a week and then not started the next game. That's why I
don't identify pressure, I guess. I always feel I'm under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows indignity. He wanted to go back to his senior year at
Kentucky in order to catch, but his coach, Keith Madison, told him
he was too small to catch, that he wanted him to play third. An
angry Leyritz turned around and signed with the Yankees because
they would let him catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madison was pretty mad,'' Leyritz says. ``I signed two days
before school started and he lost a scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the last time he irritated someone in the game of
baseball. He distinguished himself in New York by his constant
moaning about playing time, and when he hit that big homer against
the Mariners three years ago, there were a few mates who rolled
their eyes and sighed, ``Anybody but him.'' He wasn't happy in
Anaheim last year. He wasn't happy in Texas last year. And when he
left Boston June 21 this year, he was classically disgruntled over
not being used more.
</P>
<P>
   But he left his mark in Boston, all right, whacking eight homers
and slugging .519 in 129 at-bats. He was a central figure in the
memorable April run with timely long-distance hits. The trouble
was, he was doing it as a DH. He wanted to catch and he let the
manager and general manager know that.
</P>
<P>
   When he was traded, he predicted that the Red Sox would miss him
in time, and so it is natural to ask him if he let his thoughts
stray toward the Hub while he was smashing those big homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed them,'' he says. ``I enjoyed the 25 guys I played
with.'' (He cited Mo Vaughn, Damon Buford, John Valentin, and Jason
Varitek among those he considers friends). ``It was a problem
between me and the manager and the ownership as far as what my
playing time was. But as far as anything else goes, no. The 25 guys
I played with over there, I did miss those guys, and that was
unfortunate to see them lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still Jim Leyritz, and managers have him slotted. The three
home runs against Houston may have earned him applause and a spot
in the interview room ahead of eight-time batting champ Tony Gwynn,
but it can't get him into Wednesday night's lineup. Nor tomorrow's.
He is scheduled to catch Sterling Hitchcock in Saturday's Game 3.
Meanwhile, he waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double switches, pinch hitting, you never know when he'll be
used,'' points out Bochy. ``Don't forget, he can play a lot of
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a valuable guy to have around,'' agrees Atlanta's Cox,
who can still see Leyritz changing the course of the '96 Series
when he redirected that Wohlers heater into the left-field stands.
``A righthand bat like that is pretty powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, meanwhile, thinks he should be playing. He always
thinks he should be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying _ and everybody in else in the New York Yankee
organization would know I'd be lying _ if I said I'm happy about
it,'' he says. ``They'd know I'd be lying.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the original squeaky wheel. But come the ninth inning, Jim
Leyritz is the guy you want at the dish. Let him yap. The man can
rip.

GROUP SUES OVER COLLISIONS WITH WHALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An environmental group is suing the owners of two whale
watch boats that rammed whales off the Massachusetts coast last
summer, charging that the collisions are part of a pattern of
illegal harassment of the big marine mammals by whale watchers.
</P>
<P>
   GreenWorld, a group that has repeatedly filed lawsuits to oppose
whale watching, alleges that Boston Harbor Cruises violated the
Endangered Species Act when its boat struck and seriously injured a
humpback whale last August. The group also says a boat owned by
Hyannis Whale Watcher Cruises violated the law in September when
its boat killed a minke whale.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service is still investigating
both incidents, but GreenWorld Leader Max Strahan said the
accidents were inevitable with the growing popularity _ and light
regulation of _ the whale watching industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have whale boats that intentionally go after whales
on a daily basis, you are asking to have whales struck and
killed,'' said Strahan, a combative activist who calls himself
``The Prince of Whales.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges, in essence, that all whale watching boats
violate the Endangered Species Act, even when no whales are
directly injured, because the law prohibits both harassment and
pursuit of endangered species such as the humpback and Northern
right whales.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Boston Harbor Cruises said Strahan's lawsuit is
groundless, noting that some biologists believe whale watching may
even aid whales by building public support for their protection.
</P>
<P>
   But they also stressed that the company has already adopted the
strictest safety standards in the business, including a slowdown
zone that begins within three miles of Stellwagen Bank, a popular
whalewatching area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are operating with more caution than any other whale watch
out there,'' said Rick Nolan, managing partner of Boston Harbor
Cruises, adding that the humpback whale his boat struck apparently
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Hyannis Whale Watcher Cruises could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greenworld is known for taking extreme positions, the
lawsuit reflects growing concern over the safety of whales in the
wake of the two collisions. Animal welfare advocates are
particularly concerned about the Boston Harbor Cruises boat that
struck an endangered humpback whale. It is part of a new generation
of boats that go much faster than conventional whale watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be more of a potential for vessel
collisions'' than federal regulators had realized, said Doug Beach,
protected species coordinator for the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Gloucester. He said his agency is considering whether to
toughen its voluntary whale watch guidelines governing boat speeds
and distance from whales.
</P>
<P>
   And the co-chairman of a panel looking at how to prevent
collisions between whales and ships, said the National Marine
Fisheries Service needs to consider binding regulations on the
industry, valued at up to $60 million a year and growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any vessel out there poses a hazard to whales ... These
vessels in particular may pose an additional hazard because they
are whalewatching,'' said Bruce Russell, who heads a review of ship
strikes for the New England Implementation Team, an independent
panel carrying out federal plans to help endangered whale species
recover.
</P>
<P>
   However, National Marine Fisheries Service spokeswoman Teri
Frady said her agency's investigation of the two collisions had
revealed ``nothing unusual'' in the way the boats were operated
when the collisions occurred. Although the collision with the
endangered humpback is a technical violation of federal law, the
agency could choose not to prosecute, agency officials said.

BILL TO AID IRAQI OPPOSITION MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill that would allow the Clinton administration
to spend nearly $100 million to aid Iraqi opposition groups seeking
the ouster of President Saddam Hussein is moving rapidly through
Congress, with final approval virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill on Monday, by a vote of 360 to 38,
and passage of the so-called Iraq Liberation Act by the Senate is
expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is seeking some changes in the bill, including a
clearer definition of which groups would be permitted to receive
the aid and the scope of the assistance that could be given to
them. But administration officials say they are likely to support
whatever eventually emerges from Capitol Hill, especially since it
is not binding on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a time of domestic political turmoil, the White House
and Congress agree on the need for the United States to do what it
can to bring about the ouster of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would permit _ but not require _ the president
to spend up to $97 million in arms and other assistance to rebel
groups seeking to replace Saddam with a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   It would also provide $2 million to Radio Free Iraq, a broadcast
service that was set up under earlier legislation, and it calls for
the administration to press for a United Nations international
criminal tribunal to prosecute Saddam and other Iraqi leaders found
guilty of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will give our government additional tools with which
to confront the threat to international peace and security posed by
Saddam Hussein,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who is
chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that while they support the intent
of the bill, they are concerned about the mechanism for providing
money and arms to the Iraqi opposition, which includes dozens of
groups, many of them feuding. They said it might also weaken
support for international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should underestimate the difficulty of unifying the
Iraqi opposition,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the ranking
Democrat on the International Relations Committee. But he noted
that because the bill is nonbinding, it ``states the sense of the
U.S. Congress; it it does not change U.S. policy.''

DEBARTOLO PLEADS GUILTY TO ROLE IN ALLEGED EXTORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie DeBartolo has made his deal with the government, but not
with the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded
guilty Tuesday in Baton Rouge to failing to report an alleged
extortion. DeBartolo is expected to be a key witness in the
government's case against former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards
and his son, Stephen Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was fined $1 million, placed on probation, and agreed
to cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that for at least the
remainder of the 1998 season, all 49ers business will be conducted
by Denise DeBartolo York, Eddie's sister, and Larry Thrailkill, her
representative, who is currently running the team. Tagliabue also
said there is no understanding between him and Eddie DeBartolo
regarding his future status with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until our office is able to complete a thorough review of
today's agreements and related matters,'' said Tagliabue, ``I have
directed Mr. DeBartolo to continue his current inactive status with
respect to the affairs of the 49ers and the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   When it first came to light late last year that DeBartolo was
involved in the case, which centers around the granting of a
riverboat casino license in Louisiana, Tagliabue asked him to step
aside until it was resolved.

 &HT;    Celebrity stalker Ray kills herself

<P>
   HOTCHKISS, Colo. _ Margaret Mary Ray, who for years claimed to
be Mrs. David Letterman and repeatedly broke into the late-night
star's Connecticut home, killed herself near Hotchkiss Monday
afternoon by kneeling in front of an oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   Delta County, Colo. Sheriff William Blair said it appeared Ray
walked onto an isolated stretch of the railroad near an
intersection with Highway 133 at about 1 p.m. Monday, knelt down
and leaned over the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Ray left a note near the scene of the accident asking
police to contact a friend in town so that person could notify her
parents in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a short note saying, `Please contact this
person,''' Blair said. He would not release the name of the friend.
</P>
<P>
   The coal train heading northwest toward Grand Junction, about 60
miles away, was already going slow through the intersection and it
had applied the emergency braking system slowing down even more,
but engineers had no time to stop the 105-car train, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineer and conductor saw her, but there was nothing they
could do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman'' officials told Letterman of
the news Tuesday after a call from The Daily Sentinel to the show's
New York City headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Letterman released a one-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad ending to a confused life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 46, who was arrested seven times for trespassing at
Letterman's New Canaan, Conn., home, did not have a home in the
Hotchkiss area, Blair said, but moved around from house to house
living with friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   She did have a post office box in Crawford, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman may have been Ray's most celebrated stalking victim
but he wasn't her only one.
</P>
<P>
   The Danbury, Conn., native was released from a Kissimmee, Fla.,
jail in August, where she spent time in jail for stalking former
astronaut Story Musgrave. She spent 10 months in prison and 14
months in mental institutions for the Letterman stalking
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she was ruled incompetent to stand trial in the
Musgrave case by an Osceola County, Fla. judge.
</P>
<P>
   While incarcerated, she was to undergo psychiatric evaluation,
the Associated Press reported in a story last September.
</P>
<P>
   The Osceola County judge who sentenced her, the AP reported
then, wanted to send Ray to a mental hospital for five years. But
because the stalking charge was a misdemeanor, he could not do so.
</P>
<P>
   Her obsession with the star of CBS's ``Late Show with David
Letterman'' first made news in 1988 when she stole, then was found
driving, Letterman's Porsche through New York City. When she
couldn't come up with the $3 toll at the Lincoln Tunnel, she told
the attendant she was Letterman's wife, according to a ``Late
Show'' news Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he had met Ray on numerous occasions and thought she
was ``fairly laid back and quiet, but you could tell she had some
severe problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While she was in our area, I thought she did fairly well,'' he
said. ``It was when she went back to Connecticut _ that's what got
her in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair also said from what he knew of Ray, the way she killed
herself didn't necessarily surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a horrible thing to say, but this is kind of
Margaret Ray,'' he said. ``She wouldn't just go off and take pills
or something. This is kind of the way she would want to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Paonia Police Chief Scott Leon called Monday's scene
and the entire situation ``emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had the two people on the train who saw it and couldn't do
anything, Margaret knew in a few seconds the train was going to run
her over and you have all the officers who had to clean it up,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped that Letterman, who has been known to joke about Ray
during his late-night talk show, would treat this incident with
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Letterman will hear about it and probably breathe a sigh
of relief,'' Blair said. ``And I hope he understands she was a
human being with feelings too. Hopefully he won't make light of
it.''

brand is one of the most recognized in the world, a hallmark of
corporate stability and might. It is no longer enough. On Tuesday,
for the first time since the AT&AMP;T Corp. was founded in 1885, the
company introduced a brand that does not mention AT&AMP;T: the Lucky
Dog Phone Co. Television advertisements for the ``new'' company
began running on Tuesday in 18 big markets, including New York and
Los Angeles. Just as the advertisements for Red Dog beer do not
mention the Miller Brewing Co., which makes it, and those for the
10-10-321 phone service do not mention MCI Worldcom Inc., which
provides it, the Lucky Dog advertisements do not mention AT&AMP;T. By

EUROPE CHALLENGING U.S. ON HOW TO ADDRESS WORLD FINANCIAL CRISIS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a year on the sidelines, European
governments are challenging the United States over how to address
the world financial crisis, suggesting that new ideas and
leadership are needed as the turmoil persists and Congress
continues to block new funding for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In ways both subtle and overt, European officials have used this
week's gathering of finance ministers and central bankers here at
the IMF and the World Bank to remind the United States that they
represent an economic power to be reckoned with, and one with the
authority to be listened to on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   By flexing their muscles, Europeans are shedding their
traditional deference to the United States on global financial
policy as they prepare for a new era in which most of Europe will
be bound into a single economic unit by a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Consumed by high unemployment and other economic problems at
home, and unconvinced initially that the crisis that began last
year in Asia would have much effect on them, European countries
stayed largely in the background over the last year as the United
States worked closely with the IMF to keep the turmoil under
control.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several weeks and during the meetings here in
the past few days, they have proposed shifting more power into a
committee within the IMF, a move that could have restricted the
ability of the United States to exert its influence directly over
the fund's management.
</P>
<P>
   They have given far more enthusiastic consideration than the
United States to efforts by the World Bank to shift the focus away
from austerity programs to poverty-fighting and to challenge the
orthodoxy that controls on the international flow of capital are
always a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   With their own economies strengthening after years of
stagnation, European officials even dared to criticize domestic
politics and policy in the United States, which for the last five
years has not been shy about lecturing the rest of the world about
how to achieve prosperity and stability. At the top of their list
was the unwillingness of the Republican-controlled Congress to
provide the full $18 billion in new funding for the IMF requested
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's finance minister, pointedly
suggested that those countries who were willing to shore up the
IMF's financial condition act on their own without waiting for the
United States. He also suggested that the United States should
consider increasing government spending or cutting taxes to give a
boost to the American economy, given the flexibility created by the
Federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot really believe that if the slowdown in growth is very
important, the administration will not use at least part of the
surplus to sustain growth,'' Strauss-Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, where Europe has been seen as disengaged and reluctant
to commit money or political capital to dealing with a crisis that
has sent millions of people spiraling into poverty, Europe's
increased involvement is seen as long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they should realize there's no such thing as an
isolated country,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial
secretary, warning that the Europe's economy would inevitably be
harmed if the turmoil was not contained.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers played down any idea of a rift or
confrontation with Europe, saying there were many ideas that
deserved to be considered. But one American official involved in
Asia policy said the failure of the American-led effort to end the
turmoil ``further emboldened our European friends'' to mount ``a
more concerted challenge to the kinds of policy directions we've
been offering.''

 WASHINGTON: been offering.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some extent, analysts said, France, Britain and Germany are
stepping into a vacuum created by the lack of any obvious new ideas
about how to address a crisis that has proven resistant to the
traditional market-friendly cures favored by the IMF and American
policymakers led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly in the past the Americans had a free hand in setting
policy goals and the global investment agenda,'' said Stephan-Gotz
Richter, the president of TransAtlantic Futures, a Washington
consulting firm that tracks European-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the citadels of American power are shaken, and the
Europeans are now in a position to be a check and balance on
American influence,'' he said. ``It's not a concerted effort to
outflank the Americans, it's a competition of the best ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the bankers and government officials attending the
meetings and informal discussions here said Europe's assertiveness
is part of a broader desire on the part of France and Germany to
pound home the idea that the European Union is as big an economy as
the United States and should be afforded the same voice in global
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The planned start of the first phase of European monetary union
on Jan. 1, they said, has increased the feeling among Europeans
that their clout should be respected by the United States and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do see a new European self-confidence coming up here,
although I think we're slightly uncomfortable with it and don't
really know what to do with it,'' said Klaus Friedrich, the chief
economist at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is difficult to define a European approach to the
world's current problems. With Britain, France and Germany all now
having left-leaning governments, there is greater willingness to
consider intervening in markets, although no consensus about
actually doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The new German government in particular, although not
represented at this week's meetings, has made clear that it sees
controls on capital flows as a subject for serious consideration.
Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroeder, is scheduled to meet
with President Clinton here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Tietmeyer, the head of Germany's powerful central bank,
hinted here that the Bundesbank might now be willing to cut
interest rates to help avert a global downturn, a shift from his
previous insistence that a German rate cut was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has been pressing the
biggest industrial nations to rethink the structure and goals of
international financial institutions like the IMF and the World
Bank. Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, proposed
regular meetings of the fund, the bank and international banking
supervisors to coordinate worldwide regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The new coordinated effort would be intended ``not just to point
out weaknesses, but to insure that these weaknesses are addressed
and to identify systemic risks to the global financial structure,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn said France had come to the meetings with 12 points
it wanted the international institutions to consider, ranging from
requiring more disclosure by commercial banks and hedge funds of
their international business to creating a decision-making body
within the IMF with real political authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the ideas'' are now under consideration, Strauss-Kahn
said, ``so we think that what we did was useful.''

LYCOS BUYING WIRED DIGITAL INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. will pay $83 million in stock to acquire Wired
Digital Inc., one of the best-known brands in high technology.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, set to close by year's end, is the latest move in
Lycos' campaign to establish itself &UR;  &LR; as one of the Internet's most
powerful companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital employs 150 people and is based in San Francisco.
It was once owned by the founders of Wired, perhaps the most
influential print magazine covering computers and high technology.
Although it became the bible of young, affluent computer users,
Wired magazine was in constant financial turmoil. The print
publication was purchased earlier this year by Conde Nast
Publications Inc., publishers of Vanity Fair and GQ magazines. But
Conde Nast didn't want Wired's on-line properties, and they were
left behind as an independent, privately held firm.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Wired Digital, Lycos will add a number of popular
sites _ including Wired News, the HotBot search engine and the
satirical Web magazine Suck _ to its sizable stable of Web
businesses. Lycos already runs a major Internet search service of
its own, and the Tripod and Angelfire Web page hosting services,
and the WhoWhere Internet directory &UR;  &LR; of addresses and phone
numbers. The company's goal is to establish itself as an Internet
``portal'' _ a major gateway to the Internet. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lycos president Bob Davis said Tuesday that with Wired Digital's
audience, the Lycos companies are now closing in on the Yahoo
search service, one of the world's most popular Internet portals.
``We're just single-digit percentage points behind the leader, and
gaining rapidly on them,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis estimated that after the Wired transaction is complete,
Lycos properties will reach about 41 percent of all Internet users
at least once a month. According to the research firm Media Metrix,
Yahoo reached 40.4 percent of home Internet users in August 1998,
and 46 percent of business Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Charron, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass. thinks that Lycos still has a long way to go
before it can truly challenge Yahoo. Charron praised the Wired
Digital acquisition, but added, ``It takes more than a collection
of sites to be a portal.''
</P>
<P>
   Charron argues that companies like Yahoo have a unified brand
strategy. All of Yahoo's various on-line features are promoted
under the Yahoo brand, thus establishing the company's name in the
public mind. But Lycos runs its various Internet businesses as if
they were separate entities, thus doing little to enhance the value
of the Lycos brand.
</P>
<P>
   While Charron dislikes this independent approach, it suits Wired
Digital president Beth Vanderslice. She said that Davis' promise of
a hands-off approach was a key reason her firm agreed to the
acquisition. ``Certainly we had a variety of strategic
alternatives,'' Charron said. ``Lycos made the most sense because
we were confident we would be able to preserve our brand and our
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine and its Web site were founded by Louis Rossetto
and Jane Metcalfe, who aimed to create a publishing and on-line
empire to cover the Internet. Rossetto will not be involved in the
operation of the Wired Web sites under Lycos, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., closed down 1 13/16 at
30 1/8 on the Nasdaq.

`CHARMED': WITCHES AS BUBBLY BABES TOILING AWAY AT GOOD DEEDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody is calling the stars of ``Charmed'' lightweight, but when
three red-blooded young witches stand inside a circle of fire,
chanting to destroy an enemy, surely they should look and sound a
little fiercer than college girls playing ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   This WB series, which has its premiere Wednesday night, seems to
want to be a dark dramatic version of ``Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch
Grows Up'' or ``Bewitched: The Single Years.'' Unfortunately, it
just manages to make witchcraft look bland.
</P>
<P>
   The heroines of ``Charmed,'' familiar faces in prime time, are
Prue (Shannen Doherty of ``Beverly Hills 90210''), Piper (Holly
Marie Combs, ``Picket Fences'') and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano, ``Who's
the Boss?''), great-looking sisters in their 20's recently reunited
after a relative's death. They've just moved in together in a nifty
old house in San Francisco that has been in their family for
several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Things start to happen immediately. Their old Ouija board tells
them to check out the attic. There, a huge, dusty ``Book of
Shadows'' informs them that they are witches. Not just any old
broom-riding, nose-wiggling, eye-of-newt-adding practitioners, but
``the most powerful witches the world has ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe embraces this news and promptly saves two boys on in-line
skates by foreseeing an accident and preventing it. At cooking
school, Piper is a little shocked when she is able to freeze time
long enough to finish the port sauce and impress the teacher. Prue
is the stubborn one, skeptical even after asking for the cream and
watching the pitcher slide down the counter and pour a bit of its
contents into her coffee.
</P>
<P>
   This is all happening at a particularly bad time. As one
open-minded observer concludes, the recent wave of homicides in
which all the victims were young women means that somebody is
killing witches. The sisters' boyfriends, past and present, include
a policeman and a newspaper reporter, so naturally they're
interested in this crime spree.
</P>
<P>
   The killer's identity does come as a surprise, but where to go
from here? It would be nice if the women could grow in confidence
as the weeks go by, but it seems doubtful that they'll do it
convincingly. When Prue asks, ``I mean, do witches date?'' it's a
nice post-modern approach, but there's a little too much ``Ally
McBeal'' attitude for comfort. (What? Little insecure me a witch?)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be careful,'' vows Prue at the end of the first
episode, speaking for herself and her sisters. ``We're going to be
wise. And we're going to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But wouldn't it be more fun if Endora paid a visit and
turned Darrin into a horse?

PURPORTED EARLY PHOTO OF LINCOLN FAILS TO SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The much debated Hay Wadsworth daguerreotype, dated
1843 and thought by some to be the first image of Abraham Lincoln,
failed to sell at Christie's on Tuesday. The auctioneer started the
bidding at $110,000 and, after two bids, stopped at $150,000, below
the secret reserve price and the estimate of $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts had suggested that the image, if it were that of
the 16th president, could fetch $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   But experts have argued about whether the person photographed is
Lincoln ever since the consignors, Robert and Joan Hoffman of
Pittsford, a suburb of Rochester, unveiled it in 1993. The Hoffmans
got the three-and-a-half by three-inch leather-encased image from
the liquidator for the descendants of Lincoln's private secretary,
John Milton Hay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1843, 18 years before Lincoln became president, he was a
beardless Illinois state legislator who had not yet grown into the
man who appears on the $5 bill. To support their contention that
the daguerreotype sitter was Lincoln, the Hoffmans and several
other believers put the image through a range of analyses, from
criminal identification techniques to computer ``aging'' to
scrutiny of the vein patterns in the subject's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The doubters, including many Lincoln historians and artists,
simply pointed out the differences in facial features of the man in
the Hoffmans' image and the earliest documented likeness of
Lincoln, taken between 1846 and 1849 and now in the Library of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffmans, who bought the daguerreotype in 1993 for a sum
they will not disclose, decided during the summer to let the market
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry it didn't sell,'' an obviously disappointed
Hoffman said, adding, ``We wanted it to go to the next level of
custodians,'' preferably a public institution.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he still believed the image was Lincoln's. ``This is
an ongoing process,'' Hoffman said. ``We are talking about more
research _ there's a tremendous amount of new photo analysis coming
available in the next few years.''

FRENCH TELECOM IN INTERNET PROJECT FOR TECHNOPHOBES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ France Telecom, which pioneered the quirky
Minitel online information service years before anyone ever heard
of the World Wide Web, announced plans Wednesday to bring its aging
child into the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Working with IBM Corp., the French telephone company said it
would develop a network to let customers surf the Internet with
simple and cheap screen-based telephones, which would also be
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the new devices would give
technophobic customers access to the Internet without using a more
complex personal computer. Though the Minitel system would continue
to exist, with its homely little terminals and its proprietary
network, the company hopes many people will simply gravitate to the
newer system and its allure of worldwide access.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is supposed to deliver a prototype networking system by the
end of this year, and France Telecom officials hope to start
commercial service by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Minitel, which was begun 15 years ago by the French government,
was one of the first online consumer information services.
Conceived as a way to bring advanced communications to ordinary
people, the Minitel came before personal computers had Windows,
before America Online and long before the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And when the World Wide Web exploded in popularity, allowing
people to flit to computers around the world with a few mouse
clicks, the Minitel remained almost obstinately old-fashioned. It
remains slow, has no graphics and offers access to little outside
France. But it remains popular in its home country, where it has
about 15 million users and is host to about 25,000 services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of Minitel, but we have to prepare for the
future,'' said Jean-Jacques Damlamlin, vice president for
development at France Telecom. ``Some people are not willing to use
PCs for electronic commerce, but they are willing to see us provide
a substitute for their Minitels.''
</P>
<P>
   Minitel may be slow and dull to watch, but it is simple, cheap
and free from hackers. It generates billions of francs worth of
fees from electronic commerce, from train reservations to flower
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned or not, political leaders and many industry
experts worry that Minitel's enduring popularity has held back the
Internet in France. In a speech in August 1997, Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin startled many people by suggesting just that.
Minitel, he said, ``could be hindering the development of new and
promising applications of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, IBM is to develop a new
networking platform that connects a new generation of Internet
devices. Unlike most other Internet access providers, France
Telecom would take responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the
software on individual terminals. Most of the management and
navigational information, including profiles of users and their
bookmarks of favorite Web sites, would be held within the telephone
company's network rather than in the terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But France Telecom executives, who refused to say how much money
would go into the new contract, acknowledged there were many
uncertainties. The biggest is whether the new screen-based
telephones will be cheap enough to attract customers. With computer
prices low and falling, company executives say they still do not
know for certain whether the new devices have enough price
advantage to be economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   Though IBM, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., is developing the
networking system, France Telecom wants other companies to build
the terminals. Company officials say they want to encourage a wide
array of equipment manufacturers, and that one of the reasons they
chose IBM was that the American computer giant has very little
interest in building terminals. ``We want the system to be
completely open,'' Damlamlin said.

ALBRIGHT WARNS NETANYAHU AND ARAFAT TIME FOR PEACE IS RUNNING OUT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright issued a new
warning Tuesday that the time for negotiating peace was running
out. As both sides haggled over an interim agreement a far more
difficult subject, the permanent status of their relationship, was
barely broached.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing dangling dove earrings, a dove brooch and a dove
necklace, Albright was whisked from Jerusalem to Jericho and back
for separate meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. By late evening the two men
had agreed to a meeting with Albright on Wednesday morning at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   While a cloud of mistrust between the two sides still hangs over
the talks, all concur that the stonewalling has ended and
negotiations have a fresh momentum. Still, Albright's spokesman,
James Rubin, said this does not mean that an agreement is at hand
or even that the peace process is back on track _ but rather that
``we can see ahead of us a way to put it back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first visit here in more than a year, Albright said she
had spent ``one of the pleasanter mornings of my time in the
region.'' But she said ``much work'' needed to be done if an
interim agreement was to be finalized at a three-party summit
meeting in Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
   And then, she said, the more difficult final negotiations would
have to begin under extreme time pressure. The tentative peace
accord signed in Oslo expires in May, and Arafat has said he will
declare a Palestinian state then if an agreement has not been made
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the issues on the table now are important, the parties
need to reach agreement so they can move on to the more critical
issues regarding permanent status,'' Albright said, standing beside
Arafat and beneath a giant poster of him in a meeting hall in
Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   Both in Jerusalem and in Jericho, Albright reiterated the same
warning, word for word: ``We all know that time is not on our side.
If we don't move quickly, we may find ourselves without a process
of peacemaking, without an agreement, and without the hope of
achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state is spending two days here to pave the way
for the Washington meeting, at which, if successful, President
Clinton would preside over a breakthrough after 18 months of
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin played down expectations, however, saying the summit talks
were envisioned as ``an intensive multi-day exercise where some
heavy lifting is going to be required,'' adding, ``We do not
envisage it as a photo op where everything is prepackaged and
signed and sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gripping a podium in Jericho, Arafat spoke generally, applauding
``the American initiative to salvage the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   But each side professed skepticism that Albright could wrest
further concessions from the other during her visit here, and
continued the chronic exercise of blaming the other for
intransigence. Asked whether there had been any progress Tuesday,
Netanyahu's spokesman, David Bar-Illan, said, ``Nothing, nothing,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself said, ``I wouldn't say we are at square one,
but we are certainly not at the end of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the decided issues remain open. Netanyahu, for instance,
has agreed to turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians, but the wording of the agreement is still being
hammered out in a delicate process where ``words matter,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The key outstanding issue, though, is the negotiation of an
institutionalized, cooperative mechanism for cracking down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu claims that this is the Palestinians' obligation,
demanding that they dismantle terrorist cells, extradite 36 wanted
terrorists, including 13 whom the Israelis say are working as
Palestinian police officers, and confiscate illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that offended some Palestinian officials because
it seemed to echo Netanyahu, Albright Tuesday called a deal on
security issues ``the sine qua non'' of the overall agreement. The
Palestinians believe that the turnover of land is the essence of an
accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright went on to say that action needed to be taken by
both sides, and a senior State Department official suggested that
the Israelis willfully overestimate Arafat's ability to put a halt
to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, too, have security demands. They want the
Israelis to disarm radical Jewish settlers and to stop provoking
confrontations by expanding Jewish settlements in Palestinian
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that greatly angered them, Netanyahu, in a meeting
after his session with Albright, agreed to build permanent homes
for Jewish settlers who now live in a trailer park in the divided
city of Hebron. He promised to do so after an elderly rabbi was
killed there in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to comment on this move specifically, Albright
condemned ``unilateral actions that complicate the issues that we
are trying to deal with here.''

RUSSIA WARNS AGAINST NATO STRIKES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia vowed Tuesday to veto any attempt by the United
Nations to sanction air strikes against Yugoslavia and warned of
``serious international consequences'' if NATO proceeds with force
to halt the ethnic conflict in Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's stepped-up effort to insert itself into the diplomatic
wrangling over Kosovo comes as Russian officials in Washington and
elsewhere are pressing the West to rescue their foundering economy.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox was not lost on Russian commentators, who questioned
the timing of Moscow's latest bid to assert itself as a rival to
the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to act as a great power when you constantly
beg for aid,'' Georgi Arbatov, a retired foreign policy expert and
veteran of cold war diplomacy, told a Russian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest diplomatic stance comes in an atmosphere of
increasingly open hostility toward the West, which is often blamed
here for promoting policies that have led to the Russian economy's
near collapse. Despite the country's weakened position _ or maybe
because of it _ Russia's dialogue with the West has taken on a
sharper, even bullying edge, on issues ranging from bad debts to
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has opposed the use of force by Western allies in
previous diplomatic impasses, including against the Bosnian Serbs
in 1995 and last year against Iraq. With the architect of Russia's
hardline foreign policy, Yevgeny Primakov, now installed as prime
minister, that policy carries more weight than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But in lining up against the Western alliance, Primakov risks
antagonizing the governments whose economic help he is now seeking.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to avert a military showdown over Yugoslavia, Russia
is also seen as trying to reassert itself as an indispensable and
independent player on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday with the Russian news agency Interfax,
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia would ``definitely'' use
its veto on the United Nations Security Council to block any
U.N.-sanctioned strike against Yugoslavia. ``A military strike will
not help normalize the situation but will have the opposite
effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin also made a round of phone calls to
Western leaders and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urging them
to use diplomacy rather than force in stopping further bloodshed in
Kosovo, where Serbian forces, deployed by the government in
Belgrade, are accused of committing atrocities against ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In the Communist-dominated Russian Parliament, the tone was more
strident, and belligerently anti-Western. Parliamentary Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said Tuesday that the Parliament would move to
break its treaty with NATO if the alliance attacked Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start bombing, a war will simply begin,'' said
Seleznyov. ``Yugoslavia will respond accordingly and fire at their
planes, if they appear above Yugoslav territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has historic ties to Serbia, and Russian nationalists
have been quick to side with their Orthodox brethren against what
they see as the West's undiscriminating antagonism to Belgrade.
Russian diplomats have tried to use their influence on Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic to get him to back off his aggressive
strategies, and negotiate for peaceful settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev flew to
Belgrade for another meeting with Milosevic. A foreign ministry
spokesman said they warned him that NATO air strikes were likely
``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical
improvement of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In warning the West not to strike Yugoslavia, Russian officials
have issued vague threats of their own. Ivanov said in a television
interview on Monday that military action could lead to serious
consequences, while the deputy head of the armed forces general
staff, Col Gen. Vladislav Putilin, said the Russian military was
ready to carry out ``any order'' from the Kremlin over Kosovo. What
such an order might be, he did not say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent public statements, members of the Primakov government
have argued that the International Monetary Fund and other
institutions should give Russia more money to compensate for their
bad advice. Some have also tried more aggressive tactics, saying
that the Western banks and governments could find themselves stuck
with billions of dollars in Russian debt if more aid is not
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's current economic turmoil, and the uncertain
policies of the Primakov government, have undercut its
international standing, adding a note of bitterness to its internal
foreign policy debate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alexander Shokhin, a centrist politician who served briefly in
the Primakov government and heads the Our Home Is Russia party
faction in the Parliament, Tuesday called the crisis over Kosovo
``a dramatic turning point in defining Russia's role in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be taken into account in the world,'' said
Shokhin, ``we must learn to influence our allies, including
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov, former head of the Institute of U.S. and Canada
Studies, noted that Russia today is ``not in a position to expect
its opinion to be heeded,'' and should put its energies into
pressing Milosevic to change course, and not on the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many warnings have been given to the Yugoslav president by
Western countries,'' he said. ``Thus the West has gone very far,
and retreat would involve a loss of face.''

IMMUNITY LIFTED, LEPEN SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION FOR HOLOCAUST
STATEMENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The European Parliament Tuesday lifted the immunity of
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front,
allowing a German prosecutor to open a criminal investigation
against him on a charge of belittling the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney in Munich asked for a waiver of
parliamentary immunity after Le Pen, a member of the European
Parliament, said in Munich last December that the gas chambers in
Nazi concentration camps were ``a detail in the history of the
Second World War.'' A French court later required him to pay to
retract the statement in French newspapers that had quoted the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen denounced Tuesday's 420-20 vote against him at a session
of the European Union's parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg. ``Let
us not forget that I am the victim,'' he said afterward. ``It
wasn't I who invented the concentration camps, but the fathers,
grandfathers and uncles of my German colleagues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen denies that he is anti-Semitic, but he has called the gas
chambers a detail of history before, in 1987, and a French court
fined him 1.2 million francs, about $217,000, for it then.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has even stricter laws against belittling Nazi crimes or
repeating Nazi propaganda. The Munich prosecutor, Manfred Wick,
said in a telephone interview that he could open a criminal
investigation on a charge of ``incitement to public disorder or
racial discrimination'' after he received formal notification that
Le Pen's immunity had been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   If Le Pen is eventually charged and brought to trial, Wick said,
he could face a fine and up to five years' imprisonment if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in Strasbourg if he would obey a summons to go to Munich
to testify, Le Pen answered derisively. ``My condition is that they
guarantee I will not immediately be sent to Dachau or Buchenwald,''
he said, referring to the concentration camps Hitler built outside
Munich and near Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   In debate in the Parliament on Monday, Le Pen said, ``If these
comments have been interpreted in a way that made sincere people
suffer, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, who won 15 percent of the vote in a campaign for the
presidency of France in 1995, is a 70-year-old veteran of the
French colonial war in Algeria who founded his party, the National
Front in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was convicted of assaulting a Socialist politician who
was running against his daughter at a campaign rally during last
year's French legislative elections, he expected to head the
National Front's campaign for the European Parliament election in
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But a court in Versailles fined him 23,000 francs, or $4,150,
gave him a suspended three-month jail term, and deprived him of his
civil rights, barring Le Pen of running for office for two years.
</P>
<P>
   If an appeals court upholds the conviction next month, Le Pen
has insisted that his wife, Jeanne-Marie, should head the National
Front ticket for him. The party platform denounces the decline of
national sovereignty in the European Union and demands the
expulsion of millions of immigrants from Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Le Pen declined at first, saying she had never had anything
to do with politics and did not want to start now.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Megret, who is eager to give the National
Front a more moderate image, then said he thought he should step in
and head the ticket, but Le Pen swatted him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president decides and leads the ticket,'' he said. ``There
is no reason for this to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Megret has said he will take the issue to the National Front's
membership if Le Pen is barred from running.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were among the 11 National Front candidates who won
seats in the 626-member European Parliament in the last elections

ISTANBUL MAYOR GUILTY OF GODLINESS: WHAT NEXT FOR TURKEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Smiling broadly beneath her headscarf, Nafize
Cayer leaned over a table in front of Istanbul's City Hall on a
recent afternoon and signed a petition of support for her embattled
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is crying over what has happened,'' lamented Mrs.
Cayer, a 48-year-old housewife from a poor neighborhood. ``We are
very angry. His only crime was to work for God.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-month jail sentence against the mayor, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, for ``provoking religious hatred'' was recently upheld by
an appeals court. The sentence includes a lifetime ban on political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently Erdogan, 44, had been considered one of Turkey's
most promising young political leaders. He is the most popular
younger figure in the pro-Islamic political movement and the idol
of many believers.
</P>
<P>
   Until his conviction, he was considered likely to assume
leadership of the movement from former Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, 75, who was forced to resign last year because of his
advocacy of Islamic politics and who is now banned from political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Now Erdogan is Turkey's newest political martyr, the latest
victim of a military-backed campaign against religious
fundamentalism. His ostensible crime was making a speech last year
in which he read a verse from a poem written in the 1920s: ``The
mosques are our barracks, the minarets are our spears, their domes
are our helmets and the faithful are our army.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, he was brought before the National Security
Court, a military-backed tribunal that tries cases related to
subversion, and was convicted of having called for religious
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Saying or writing the wrong thing can still be dangerous in
Turkey. A historian is in jail for writing books supporting Kurdish
nationalism and blaming Ottoman forces for the mass killing of
Armenian civilians in 1915. A journalist is serving time for
comparing a Kurdish guerrilla leader to Garibaldi, and a playwright
was convicted of ``insulting the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances Erdogan would probably begin serving
his jail term in a few months. His is no normal case, however, and
political considerations could easily speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
   After he is imprisoned, the City Council is to choose a
successor to serve until the next election, which is scheduled for
April. His 10-month sentence means that he will probably serve only
about 18 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. consul in Istanbul, Carolyn Huggins, paid a call on
Erdogan after he lost his appeal last month, and was later quoted
in Turkish newspapers as calling the case ``a serious matter'' that
would ``weaken confidence in Turkish democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quick reply, the Foreign Ministry asked the United States
to refrain from commenting about what it described as Turkey's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Islamic political power has been the subject of
intense debate in Turkey for several years. Turkey was established
as a secular republic in 1923, and military commanders consider
themselves duty-bound to resist what they view as efforts to pull
the country back to its theocratic past. But leaders of the
religious party, formerly called Welfare and now known as Virtue,
say they are merely responding to the desire of many Turks for a
greater religious voice in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain when the police will knock on his door, Erdogan is
soon to begin an open-ended tour of Turkey during which he hopes to
give a last round of speeches that will keep his supporters
thinking of him while he is imprisoned. Military officers and
public prosecutors will be watching his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be very careful about what words I use,'' Erdogan
said at his City Hall office as people on the sidewalk below signed
petitions of solidarity. ``It is a very strange position to be
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Erdogan's office is curtained, and he cannot see the nearby
Roman aqueduct or any of the glorious Byzantine and Ottoman
buildings around it. Nor can he see the tables where his
supporters, many of whom are recent migrants from the more
traditional rural areas of Turkey, line up to sign solidarity
petitions. The lack of distractions apparently helps him cultivate
the private intensity that is one of his trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Turks on both sides of the widening chasm that
separates secularists from fundamentalists, Erdogan believes that
his true crime was not reading a poem, but emerging as crown prince
of the Islamic political movement. Military commanders and their
civilian allies in the government are determined to decapitate and
crush that movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poem was just pretext,'' Erdogan said. ``My prosecution
was aimed at blocking me or turning people against me.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, Turkish politicians convicted of serious crimes while in
office are forbidden ever to re-enter politics. In the past,
however, political bans have been relaxed or lifted after years
have passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No politician can be artificially removed from the scene,''
Erdogan asserted. ``The nation brings politicians up, and only the
nation can bring them down.''
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul neighborhoods where Islamic political power is
strong, banners have been hung that say, ``Poetry-Reading Man, You
Deserve a Medal.'' Posters bear Erdogan's portrait and the slogan,
from a speech he made to supporters after losing his appeal: ``This
song is not over yet!''
</P>
<P>
   The military officers who hold ultimate power in Turkey believe
that religious fundamentalism has become a social and political
cancer that must be excised if the secular republic is to survive.
They have supported a series of anti-fundamentalist campaigns,
including an unpopular ban on the wearing of headscarves by women
who are university students.
</P>
<P>
   Many political leaders, including Prime Minister Mesut Yalmaz,
have publicly expressed doubts about the campaign against
headscarves. Military officers insist that such campaigns are vital
if Turkey is to defend its secular democracy. Others warn that the
military is polarizing the country and will, in the end, turn
voters toward the Islamic movement rather than away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the army put its arms around the
fundamentalists and say, `Hey, we're all Turks, let's work this
thing out and live peacefully,''' said a foreign diplomat with many
friends in the officer corps. ``But that isn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One unexpected result of the campaign against fundamentalism
here is the effect it has had on the views that Islamic-oriented
politicians hold about human rights and democracy. They now speak
constantly about these issues, and about the need to build a
society in which every point of view is respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people know the United States and the West only
by certain stereotypes,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of political
science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ``Now they are getting a
different view of the West and the value it places on political
freedoms. It's a new factor for them.''

ADVERTISING: BIG CAMPAIGN FOR ELECTRONIC, INTERACTIVE BIT OF FUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his season of pre-holiday hype, every toy maker likes to
promote its newest plaything as the next Tickle Me Elmo or Beanie
Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Electronics Inc., which insists that it really does have
this year's likely winner in the toy wars, began a campaign
recently to introduce it: a sweet, if slightly scary-looking,
little playmate called Furby.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Vernon Hills, Ill., and best known for
electronic toys, is betting big on Furby and backing it with a
multimillion-dollar television campaign. The campaign includes
three commercials that began running Friday and will continue
through the holidays on network and cable channels. The spots will
run in various time slots, including those during such
family-oriented fare as Disney shows and programs on the Cartoon
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Tiger's advertising approach, it is important to
know that Furby has bug eyes, big ears and major attitude. It hit
store shelves last week, selling for about $30. It has a playful
voice, becomes snippy if not enough attention is paid, and will
even sneeze in your face.
</P>
<P>
   So what is all the fuss? Well, Furby combines the latest in
electronic wizardry and fur to create what Tiger hopes will appeal
to both the young consumers who could not get enough of virtual
pets last year, including Tiger's Giga Pets, and those who
preferred to snuggle up with a pile of Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   Furby is a fully interactive pet that will react to stimuli and
``communicate'' with its owner. It speaks both Furbish, an
imaginary language, and English, which it learns over time as a
child interacts with it. If Furby is scared or excited, the eyes
pop open and ears shoot up. Furby plays games and can learn tricks
and will even interact with other Furbies, all of whom have their
own names. If one Furby yawns or sings, for instance, its
fur-covered cousins do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's intent is to market Furby directly to children long
before the holiday shopping frenzy begins. The young consumers,
after all, will ultimately decide whether parents will be
scrambling for the last Furby on store shelves this year or whether
the toy will instead be relegated to the markdown aisle come
January.
</P>
<P>
   To sell youngsters on the toy, Tiger is using a 30-second spot
and two 15-second spots that bring Furby to life. ``I think the key
message we are trying to communicate in the commercial is Furby's
personality,'' said Stewart Sims, senior vice president for
marketing at Tiger. ``Furby speaks for himself. He has his own
unique language and, I think, interesting and amusing voices, so we
let Furby do most of the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tiger declines to say exactly how much it is spending to
promote Furby because it does not want to tip off Mattel and other
competitors, ``we think everyone will see the commercials,'' Sims
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spots, which use the tag line ``you keep amazing me,'' were
created by Posnick &AMP; Kolker in New York, the agency whose ads
introduced Cabbage Patch dolls. Posnick &AMP; Kolker also created the
spots for Tiger's best-selling Giga Pets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Furby commercials, the toy delights a group of youngsters
by batting its blue eyes, blurting out Furbish and saying such
things as ``me love you'' in English. Posnick &AMP; Kolker also tries
to get across the idea that as with Beanies owning more than one
Furby can be fun. The commercials show several Furbies interacting
with one another and the young actors and conclude with a girl
surrounded by a pack of giggling, furry friends.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, toys appeal to children in a narrow age range, such
as preschoolers or pre-teen-agers. And plush toys generally appeal
mostly to girls. In recent years, however, toy makers have broken
through gender and age barriers with such hits as virtual pets and
Beanie Babies. Those popular playthings proved that toys can appeal
to boys and girls and to elementary school youngsters as well as
children of middle-school age.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger and Posnick &AMP; Kolker are hoping for te same success with
Furby. The advertising, therefore, had to address different
audiences of young people while also solving the issue of how to
communicate the toy's range in a way that did not make children's
eyes gloss over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge probably with Furbies was trying to
decide on the balance between the combination of soft, cuddly plush
toy and the technology aspect,'' said Paul Posnick, executive
creative director for Posnick &AMP; Kolker. ``There aren't too many
toys that successfully combine this.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the creative team decided to show the technology in action
by showing Furby in action. ``Most kids in advertising don't care
how something works, they just want to know how to have fun with
it,'' Posnick said. ``Clearly, how we treated the combination was
going to make it successful or not.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: PHILIPPINE AIRLINES; FARE SALES; HOTEL UPDATE

   PHILIPPINE AIRLINES GETS NEW LEASE ON LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Like the announcement of Mark Twain's death, the report of
Philippine Airlines' demise was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's flag carrier shut down as threatened last
Wednesday, seemingly unable to resolve both a strike by its biggest
union and crushing debt, mediation proposed by the country's
President, Joseph Estrada, resulted in a settlement. A number of
the carrier's domestic flights will be reinstated tomorrow,
according to Minda Desantos in the airline's San Francisco office,
and there is talk of resuming flights as early as Oct. 15 between
Manila and Los Angeles and San Francisco, both of which have large
Filipino populations.
</P>
<P>
   When those international flights do resume, passengers can
probably expect discounts or attractive packages, but not the deep
fare discounts that would be offered if any United States carriers
also flew those routes. None do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to restoring its international route system, the
airline faces other hurdles, including restructuring its debt and
arranging with creditors how many aircraft to keep. Some analysts
think it likely that another airline will acquire a stake in the
Philippines carrier, possibly Northwest Airlines, UAL's United
Airlines, Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   More Fare Sales
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after coming off record summer passenger loads, a
number of airlines are offering another round of fare sales and
specials, with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier Airlines is offering round-trip fares as low as $398
between New York and Denver and $438 between New York and Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle-Tacoma. Travel will be good
from this Monday through Feb. 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   America West is offering $198 round-trip fares between Phoenix
and Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland, among other destinations, and
between Columbus, Ohio, and Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles, and San
Francisco, plus other cities. The sale ends Oct. 15, but is good
for travel through April 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines has more or less matched America West's $198
fare and time frame on competing routes from Phoenix and Columbus,
but its offer also includes flights to Nashville, New Orleans, St.
Louis and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines customers who make reservations and buy tickets
through the airline's World Wide Web site (www.delta-air.com) can
fly between Atlanta and Philadelphia or Washington for $118, round
trip, or Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for $138. Travel must be
completed by Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air has an unusual offer _ for residents of Alaska. For
$1,540 a person, Alaska residents can buy five round-trip tickets
between Anchorage and Seattle and Las Vegas and Reno, as well as
Orange County and San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego and Burbank, in
California. For an additional $100, Alaskans can add Tucson, Ariz.;
Colorado Springs, or Oklahoma City. Chicago can be added for $200.
The package is available from Saturday through Dec. 15; travel must
be completed by Dec. 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Aer Lingus has a four-day Ireland package for $499, good for
travel through Oct. 29. Reservations for the package, which also
includes hotel (with breakfast) and rental car, must be made by
Oct. 22. Departures are from Kennedy International Airport, Newark
International Airport and Logan International Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 30, 1999, shuttle passengers who belong to both
the frequent-flier programs of US Airways and American Airlines
will earn 500 miles in each program when they fly the US Airways
shuttle between Boston or New York and Washington. To receive
credit for miles on American Airlines, US Airways frequent-flier
members have to register before their first flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Brown Palace Hotel in Denver tracked the sale of
luxury items by guests over the last year, and found that although
the hotel's cigar bar restricts customers to one 1954 (pre-Castro)
Dunhill cigar, which costs $295 each, 23 of them were sold. It was
also discovered that the hotel's cigar sales, including those
priced from $48 to $60, increased almost 82 percent, and sales of
Dom Perignon Champagne _ at $195 a bottle _ rose by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Guests who stay 10 nights at any of the 2,200 Comfort, Quality,
Clarion or Sleep Inn hotels, four of the seven brands franchised by
Choice Hotels International, will receive their next stay free.

49ERS CO-OWNER ADMITS CONCEALING EXTORTION PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ After striking a deal to provide evidence
against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, San Francisco 49ers
co-owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty Tuesday to concealing
an alleged extortion plot by Edwards that involved the licensing of
a riverboat casino.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the proceedings began in federal district court
here, the 71-year-old Edwards _ tanned, silver-haired, unwrinkled,
and accompanied by his striking 33-year-old wife, Candy _ strode
into the courtroom, glad-handed with spectators, and took a seat
three rows behind DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 45-minute hearing, a bent knuckle pressed
against his lips, Edwards announced to reporters in a descending
elevator that his longtime friend had become ``the Linda Tripp of
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   For emphasis, he later added that ``I hope the 49ers lose this
Sunday,'' when they play the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   And noting that DeBartolo is worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, he scoffed at the prosecution's contention that he had
victimized DeBartolo: ``If I had victimized him, I would have done
it for a lot more than $400,000.'' That is the amount that all
sides agree DeBartolo paid to Edwards, in new $100 bills, for his
services in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, the 51-year-old scion of one of the country's most
successful shopping mall developers, softly pleaded guilty to one
count of misprison of felony, meaning that he failed to report what
prosecutors characterized as ``extortion and fraudulent conduct''
by Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   As per the plea agreement, Judge John Parker sentenced DeBartolo
to two years probation and ordered him to pay a $250,000 fine,
forfeit the $400,000 he paid to Edwards and provide up to $350,000
in restitution that can be claimed by anyone injured by the crime.
</P>
<P>
   After sentencing, Parker advised DeBartolo that his lawyer,
Aubrey Harwell, had served him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This criminal justice system rewards the fellow who gets to
the courthouse quickest,'' the judge said. `` And Mr. Harwell has
secured you a prime seat on this train that seems to be leaving the
station. In fact, you may have a private car.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, FBI agent Jeffrey Santini testified that
evidence provided by witnesses and wiretaps showed that Edwards and
his son, Stephen, had repeatedly sought payments from DeBartolo in
late 1996 and early 1997. The money, he said, was to insure that
the state Gaming Board would award the license for its 15th and
final riverboat casino to a consortium that included DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Edwards left office in January 1996, prosecutors say he
still maintained influence with the six-member Gaming Board through
other elected and appointed officials. Santini said that Edwards
put DeBartolo ``in fear of economic loss relative to the awarding
of his joint venture's license if he did not pay Edwards
substantial sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   First Edwards demanded ``a $50,000 per month sham consulting
agreement payable to Stephen Edwards and a price per head of each
customer aboard the riverboat,'' Santini testified.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked for the $400,000 lump sum payment ``by stating, in
substance, that he must have payment of that amount by March 13 or
there could be problems with the licensing.'' Even after that
payment was made, Santini said, the Edwardses ``sent DeBartolo yet
another proposed retainer agreement for $10,000 per month.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1997, DeBartolo gave Edwards the $400,000 after a
lunch in California. The next day, the Gaming Board granted the
casino license to Hollywood Casino Corp., the Dallas company that
had enlisted DeBartolo as an investor. The board later withdrew the
license after learning of the federal investigation. In late April,
federal agents raided Edwards' house and office and seized the
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors called DeBartolo's plea ``a major
development'' in their efforts to convict the former four-term
governor, a flamboyant charmer who twice escaped federal
convictions on unrelated charges in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in their right mind would underestimate
the value and significance of DeBartolo's cooperation,'' said Eddie
Jordan, the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans and the lead prosecutor in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the plea also raises questions about whether DeBartolo will
ever regain control of his beloved 49ers, the professional football
club he managed until last December. At that time, he stepped down
as chairman after prosecutors notified him that he might be
indicted. The team has been run ever since by DeBartolo's younger
sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who is chairwoman and chief
executive officer of the Youngstown, Ohio, real estate firm started
by their father.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the National Football League frowns on the ownership of
teams by felons, DeBartolo said Tuesday that he would immediately
``start the process of getting my football team back.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement Tuesday that
DeBartolo's plea agreement was not made as part of any arrangement
with his office. ``Until our office is able to complete a thorough
review of today's agreement and related matters, I have directed
Mr. DeBartolo to continue his current inactive status with respect
to both the affairs of the 49ers and the NFL,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Several league officials and team owners said Tuesday that
Tagliabue would have broad discretion to fine DeBartolo and suspend
him from team activities before allowing him to apply for
reinstatement.

GLENN ARRIVES AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER FOR FINAL PREPARATIONS BEFORE
LIFTOFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ The air was as thick with nostalgia as
with humidity and the sweet scent of palmetto Tuesday as John
Glenn, the 77-year-old Mercury astronaut turned U.S. senator,
jetted into the balmy realm of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, Glenn, who in 1962 became the first American to
orbit the Earth, will be among an international crew of seven
astronauts as they blast off aboard the shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's nine-day science mission will serve as a belated
encore for Glenn. His solo, five-hour flight on Feb. 20, 1962,
aboard the Friendship 7 Mercury capsule gave the United States a
much-needed foothold in space when the whole notion of rocket
travel was a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   With eight months of mission training drawing to a close,
Discovery commander Curt Brown and his crew will spend the rest of
this week at Kennedy preparing for their Oct. 29 liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   They will train to make the kind of hasty escape from their
towering 20 story, coastal launching pad that would be required if
an explosion, fire or toxic chemical spill occurred while they
awaited lift off. They will also don their bulky pressure suits
early Friday and board Discovery flight deck as if it was launching
to rehearse the busy final hours of their countdown with the launch
control team.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise has been repeated here by 91 previous shuttle crews
over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's presence, however, makes this one novel again.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and Spanish journalists mingled with dozens of news
photographers and reporters from the Cable News Network and other
major U.S. news organizations to capture Glenn's arrival.
Typically, only a handful of reporters would traipse to Kennedy's
runway tarmac to record such an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become more than a photo opportunity,'' said Bruce
Buckingham, one of the NASA public affairs staff tasked with making
the arrangements. ``It's become a news event.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking trim, tan and relaxed, Glenn and his colleagues climbed
from five sleek NASA T-38 training jets dispatched from Houston's
Ellington Field. Their departure from Houston's Johnson Space
Center, where they have trained for their flight, was delayed 4 {
hours by severe weather in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy to be down here in Florida,'' Brown said.
``The practice countdown always marks a big milestone in our
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was asked how he felt and replied, ``great, great,'' and
gave a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's lift off promises to rival any NASA spaceflight for
public attention, certainly Glenn's Mercury flight.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has received 2,500 requests for news media
credentials, more than four times the number who attended Glenn's
Mercury mission.
</P>
<P>
   If all attend later this month, the total will surpass those who
assembled to cover the Sept. 29, 1988, launching of Discovery on
the first U.S. human spaceflight in the wake of the 1986 Challenger
accident.
</P>
<P>
   It would also approach the number who attended the launching of
the Apollo 11 moon landing mission in July 1969 and the first space
shuttle launching in April 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Experts here estimate that Glenn's lift off will draw 250,000 to
300,000 tourists to the Cape Canaveral, Fla., area, twice the
normal crowd who line the beaches and highways of Central Florida
for a shuttle launch.
</P>
<P>
   The closest hotel rooms and condominiums have been booked since
July.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of tourists who contribute a half billion dollars to
the local economy are expected to spend $10 million on Oct. 29
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This interests more than just the elderly,'' said Rob Varley,
executive director of the Florida Space Coast office of tourism in
Cape Canaveral. ``The nostalgia thing has a lot to do with it. But
I also think it's the idea that someone close to 80 years old can
go into space. This fascinates people who think that by the year
2010 or 2020 we might actually have space tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's mission is multifaceted. But the opportunity to
participate in experiments that might help researchers compare the
physical effects of spaceflight to the bodily changes that
accompany aging prompted Glenn to mount a campaign to fly again.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiments will examine changes in the bones and muscles
of the shuttle astronauts as well as their sleeping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's primary payload is a reusable satellite called
Spartan that will be deployed and retrieved by the shuttle
astronauts. Equipped with telescopes and cameras, Spartan will
collect images of the sun's outer atmosphere during two days of
free flight. &QL;

DOCUMENTS CAST NEW LIGHT ON ICKES' TIE TO TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House panel investigating the Teamsters union
disclosed internal White House documents Tuesday that shed a fuller
and harsher light on an effort by Harold Ickes, former White House
deputy chief of staff, to resolve an agricultural labor dispute in
California in behalf of the union.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents are significant because they have surfaced at
a time when Ickes' truthfulness about his activities with the
teamsters is the subject of a 90-day Justice Department inquiry
that could lead to the appointment of an independent prosecutor.
Attorney General Janet Reno has until December to decide whether to
go forward with an outside inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is examining Ickes' statements last year to the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which first investigated the matter
in its campaign finance investigation. When Ickes was asked by
Senate investigators what the Clinton administration did regarding
the strike at the Diamond Walnut Growers cooperative, he replied,
``Nothing that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigations released a March 6, 1995, memorandum by Ickes to
Mickey Kantor, who was the U.S. trade representative at the time.
It said Ickes had met with a group of Teamsters officials and
wanted to meet with Kantor to persuade him to intervene in behalf
of striking Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the situation I would like to meet with you at your very
earliest possible convenience to discuss this situation,'' Ickes
wrote to Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   Additional documents released Tuesday showed that Ickes did meet
with Kantor on March 24, 1995, and followed up the meeting with a
thank-you letter on March 27, 1995. Then, on April 4, 1995, Kantor
telephoned William Cuff, the president of Diamond Walnut Growers.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes' efforts on behalf of the Teamsters occurred against the
backdrop of White House efforts to rejuvenate a relationship that
had cooled after the union supported Clinton and other Democratic
candidates in the 1992 campaign. The Senate inquiry found that in
the early months of 1995, Ickes considered several specific
proposals to enlist the Teamsters' support.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., said his committee would continue
to investigate the Teamsters, including the union's activities with
the Democratic National Committee and its dealings with Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel who was hired by the union when he
was a lawyer in private practice in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Robert Bennett, Ickes' lawyer, dismissed the
significance of the documents unearthed by the committee. Bennett
said Ickes did not interpret his meeting with Teamsters officials,
his memorandum to Kantor or even Kantor's telephone call to Diamond
Walnut as ``doing anything for the union'' because Clinton
officials did not take concrete action to pressure the company into
settling the strike.
</P>
<P>
   At a subcommittee hearing Tuesday, Kantor testified that his
call to Cuff was nothing more than a brief status inquiry. Kantor
said he asked ``for an update and what are the prospects for
settlement.'' Kantor added, ``I considered the call benign, part of
my job and of no great consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cuff testified Tuesday that he never before received a phone
call from such a high-ranking official. He said the inquiry
unsettled him enough to report the call officially to his company's
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no explicit threat,'' Cuff said. ``The
only thing I would say is that when you get a call from a senior
official of the administration you have to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I figured it was part of the ongoing significant
effort by the union to try to bring us to our knees.''

CLINTON WARNS FINANCIAL LEADERS `WE DON'T HAVE A MOMENT TO WASTE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called on financial leaders from
around the globe Tuesday to find new ways to tame the cycles of
boom and bust that are shaking economies from Asia to Latin
America, warning: ``We don't have a moment to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, addressing a group of finance ministers and central
bankers attending annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, urged world leaders to take ``urgent
steps'' to restore confidence in the world economy and to avoid
such painful economic and currency crises in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy simply cannot live with the kinds of vast
and systemic disruptions that have occurred over the past year,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by the collapse of the real estate market in the Thai
capital of Bangkok 15 months ago, the world financial and currency
crisis first ravaged the economies of East Asia, then attacked
Russia and is now hitting Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``When nations half a world apart face the same crisis at the
same time, it is time for decisive action,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of the world's largest economy also cautioned
against grasping at solutions merely to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not embrace false cures that will backfire and lead in
the end to less liquidity and diminished confidence when we need
more of both,'' Clinton said. But he added: ``We must _ we must _
keep working until we find the right answers.''
</P>
<P>
   While short on specifics, Clinton's speech was the latest in a
series of public statements designed to assure nervous investors
that the United States is actively engaged in trying to stem the
economic contagion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis poses a challenge not to any one nation but to
every nation,'' Clinton said. ``None of us _ none of us _ will be
unaffected if we fail to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address followed a more substantive speech last Friday
in which he called for the creation of new, emergency lines of
credit for countries caught up in the investor panic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged the most important thing U.S. officials can
do is ``keep our economy growing and open to other's products and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are mulling the possibility of holding a
summit of leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations to
discuss the economic crisis. The prospect of such a meeting was
advanced by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had said he would agree to a summit if the session could
be ``useful.'' Before such a meeting was called, there would almost
certainly have to be an agreement on Clinton's proposal or some
other high-profile plan.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in such a meeting is that it would raise
expectations, including in the market, and if a meeting did not
result in a definitive program there could be bad reaction. ``I'm
sure this will be batted back and forth,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not raise the possibility of a G-7 summit in his
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, reiterate his call for Congress to provide
nearly $18 billion in new funding for the IMF, the Washington-based
financial rescue fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the higher funding request, but
conservative opponents in the House _ led by Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving, and House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land _ approved
only $3.4 billion in funding.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are now trying to hash out a deal.
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday ``there are some
indications now that that position may be softening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and Friday,'' Lockhart added, ``it's our hope that
we get to the point where they can send us a bill that has the full
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said he is hopeful an agreement can be
reached to provide the full funding.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers have agreed to disentangle IMF funding from an
even more contentious issue, the use of U.S. foreign aid money by
international organizations that perform abortions or promote
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Embroiled in this domestic dispute over IMF funding, the United
States _ and Clinton in particular _ did not assume a strong
leadership role in the fight to stop the financial contagion until
the last several weeks, when the crisis threatened to wreck the
economies of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, however, the economies of East Asia had been
struggling with recessions and even depressions for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Clinton will travel to Malaysia for the annual
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Malaysia's
economy has been hard hit by the crisis, but its government has
exacerbated investors' concerns by arresting _ and allegedly
beating _ that country's leading proponent of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   After Malaysia, Clinton will go on to visit Japan and South
Korea, two other economies hurt by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the contagion, trade between the United States and
the affected economies of East Asia has dropped 11 percent over the
last year, the U.S. Treasury Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, events in Asia, Russia and Latin America are having a
direct impact on the prosperity of America's farmers, workers and
businesses,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said. ``The United
States has a very real interest in stemming the tide of global
economic turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks fourth in the nation in terms of exports to Asia,
with that region accounting for 20 percent of the state's
merchandise exports last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury report did not specify whether the Lone Star
State's overall exports to the region have actually declined. But
the study did note that exports of chemicals _ one of the prime
drivers of the Houston economy _ dropped 40 percent in the first
quarter of 1998, compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Texas exports to South Korea, one of the state's leading Asian
trading partners, were off 31 percent in the first quarter, while
sales to Indonesia fell 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California, the nation's leading exporter to Asia, experienced
an 11 percent drop in exports to the region in the first quarter,
with sales to Japan off 12 percent and exports to South Korea down
43 percent. &QL;

THE WORLD ECONOMY AND DOMESTIC CONFLICTS CONSUME A PRESIDENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's parallel universes have been
separated by a mere two miles the past several days, as
international financial leaders assemble in downtown Washington
hotels to address the spreading global crisis while Capitol Hill is
consumed by debate over whether to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton this week convened the top financial policy makers of
the leading economic powers to sound the alarm about the growing
threat of a global recession. At the very moment on Monday evening
that the House Judiciary Committee was completing its debate on
authorizing an impeachment inquiry, Clinton was engaged in a dense
discussion on market transparency, the legacy of Bretton Woods and
the need for a new global financial ``architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very focused,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, the financial
secretary of Hong Kong, who attended an emergency meeting of top
economic officials called by Clinton on Monday night. ``He was the
consummate moderator. He even picked up all of our odd jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Monday evening meeting at a Sheraton hotel here, Clinton
assumed the role he has played often in international gatherings
and round-table discussions at home _ the avid listener and
synthesizer. In public, at least, the president betrayed no
interest in or concern about the impeachment debate raging 22
blocks to the east in the chamber of the House Judiciary Committee,
a participant said.
</P>
<P>
   And well he might be focused on the threat of spreading global
contagion _ the health of the American economy is one of the chief
props supporting his continued public popularity. Were the market
and financial troubles of Asia, Russia and now Latin America to
drag down the domestic economy, Clinton could see his approval
ratings quickly erode and the prospects of impeachment grow more
serious.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that Clinton on Monday night seated
himself between Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, and Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman. Rubin and Greenspan
are given much of the credit for soothing American markets and
containing inflation as stock exchanges and currencies around the
globe have plummeted. If the rest of the world's troubles spread to
the United States, even they may not be able to save the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's focus on the world's economic troubles _ he has spoken
on the matter almost every day for the past week _ carries a risk.
If he cries ``fire'' and is then perceived as having done nothing
to douse the flames, he could be seen as ineffective, crippled and
distracted by his personal and political problems.
</P>
<P>
   The jarring juxtaposition of Clinton as leader of the global
economy and defendant-in-chief left many of the visiting central
bankers and finance ministers perplexed and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Among European officials, the spectacle of Congress considering
impeachment while the world is looking to the United States for
leadership in addressing the rapidly spreading financial crisis was
disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misperception here in town has to do with the impeachment
process, which the world regards as something totally bizarre,''
said Stephan-Gotz Richter, the head of TransAtlantic Futures, a
consulting firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with European policy makers over the past several
days, Richter said they ``feel Congress is going into a reckless
mindset while the rest of the world is burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, which is holding its annual meeting with its sister
agency, the World Bank, here this week, alluded gently to Clinton's
domestic problems in his address to delegates. He chided the United
States for failing to fulfill its $18 billion pledge to the fund,
making its job of rescuing struggling economies more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world of rapid change,'' Camdessus said Tuesday, ``in a
world where sudden market developments can destabilize even
well-performing economies, the fund needs adequate financing to
perform its mandate fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and
a former member of Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said
foreign leaders were angry that Clinton and Congress were indulging
in an obsession with private matters as millions of people around
the world were watching their dreams of joining the middle class
crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main view in the rest of world is they can't believe what
the United States is putting itself through,'' Blinder said.
``They're looking with wonderment, bewilderment at what America is
doing to itself and they can't understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, they're angry with us. They all know if there's
going to be any leadership in the world, it's going to come from
the United States, and they see that getting extremely difficult.
If the United States doesn't take the lead, nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is clearly trying to provide that leadership, using his
fabled ability to ``compartmentalize'' problems. As much of the
nation was devouring the transcripts of the salacious and
sophomoric Linda Tripp-Monica Lewinsky conversations, Clinton was
trying to master the intricacies of hedge funds and cross-border
capital flows. Congress, meanwhile, was engaged in a Jesuitical
disputation on what does and does not constitute an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Clinton has been able to temporarily wall off the
threat of impeachment from the problems of the global economy, the
midterm elections, Kosovo, the federal budget, the Iraqi nuclear
threat and all the other troubles that land on his desk. But it is
the nature of the presidency that he _virtually alone in the world
_ has to worry about all of them.

UGLY CARS AND THE BOTTOM LINE: GM APPOINTS A PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The naming of G. Richard Wagoner Jr. on Tuesday as
president and chief operating officer of General Motors shows how
the world's largest corporation is changing _ and how it is not.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that still views gray hair as a prerequisite for
serious responsibility, Wagoner is a brown-haired 45-year-old.
Wagoner made his reputation not in GM's established markets in
North America and Western Europe but in its highly successful
Brazilian subsidiary. He even plays basketball, not golf, and
watches the basketball games of his alma mater, Duke University, at
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways, Wagoner is a younger version of the many
finance-minded executives who have dominated GM since its inception
in 1908. He went straight from Harvard Business School to a job as
a financial analyst in the GM treasurer's office in 1977 and has
worked for the auto maker ever since. Unlike many executives his
age, he does not have a personal computer in his office; he relies
on his secretary to print out the occasional electronic mail that
he receives, although he does use a laptop computer at home.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he is sometimes criticized here for seeming to
be more interested in profits and costs than in designing cars and
light trucks that will fire customers' imaginations _ a terrible
offense for some in Detroit, but one that Wagoner says is only
partly true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know an ugly vehicle when I see one,'' he said while
cheerfully acknowledging that design is not his strongest suit.
``In third grade, I drew a tree that my teacher said looked like a
first grader's.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wagoner has one of the stronger track records among GM
executives. As treasurer, and then finance director and finally as
president of operations in Brazil in the 1980s and early 1990s,
Wagoner helped build a subsidiary whose vehicles were GM's most
profitable until the recent economic downturn there. More recently,
the North American operations have earned modest but growing profit
margins under Wagoner despite fierce competition and a generally
strong dollar, which makes it easier for foreign auto makers to
offer discounts in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by the GM board to combine international and North
American auto operations and to put Wagoner in charge of both and
promote him to president of the corporation did not register
favorably on Wall Street, where some had wanted the company to
bring in fresh blood. GM's shares fell $2.50, to $51.25, after the
announcement, while shares of the Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler
Corp. rose.
</P>
<P>
   As president of GM, Wagoner faces a tough task. The merger of
Chrysler and Daimler-Benz AG creates another global competitor for
GM.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dollar has slipped lately in currency markets, it
remains fairly strong against the East Asian currencies of GM's
main competitors. The company's market share in the United States
has been falling since the 1960s, while its long-profitable
international operations are suffering from weaker demand because
of economic turmoil in many overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   In combining its domestic and international auto manufacturing
and marketing operations under Wagoner, GM is giving him a
corporate empire with annual sales of $136 billion _ more than
General Electric, Intel and Microsoft combined. The only GM
businesses not reporting to Wagoner will be the vast auto parts
subsidiary, which is to be spun off next year, and the automotive
finance, heavy-truck transmission and railroad locomotive
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the domestic and overseas auto divisions will allow GM
to eliminate seven top-level councils that were intended to
coordinate the activities of the two operations. Wagoner said
senior executives would be able to spend less time in meetings and
flying to meetings and would be able to make decisions much faster
as a result.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   George Richard Wagoner Jr. was born on Feb. 9, 1953, in
Wilmington, Del. He is married and drives a GMC Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   His broad new role, which covers 76 percent of the company's
sales and includes a seat on the General Motors board, would seem
to make him the heir apparent to John F. Smith Jr., the chairman
and chief executive, who was president from 1992 until now.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith declined to say Tuesday whether Wagoner was in line to
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're saying today is Rick has been promoted,'' Smith said
at a news conference Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   One of Smith's closest personal friends, Louis Hughes, had been
executive vice president for international auto operations since
1992. Wagoner took over this responsibility Tuesday, and Hughes,
while remaining an executive vice president, was given the job of
handling the company's various partnerships with Toyota, Isuzu and
other auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 49, accepted this apparent demotion gracefully, praising
Wagoner's competence at the news conference and saying that he
looked forward to working with him. Hughes will continue reporting
directly to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   All 14 executives reporting to Wagoner will be Americans. In an
interview, Wagoner noted that many of these senior executives had
substantial international experience. That no foreigners made it
into this elite tier of management at the world's largest
multinational corporation, however, shows how slow GM has been to
open up to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we've got to move with more foreign nationals,''
Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few relative outsiders in GM's senior ranks, Ronald
Zarrella, a former president of Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc., was promoted
Tuesday to replace Wagoner as president of North American
operations. Zarrella had been GM's group vice president for North
American sales, service and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   At a company once led by hard-edged men who brooked no dissent,
Wagoner uses basketball terminology to call for a more cooperative
approach to management.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an analogy _ running a successful business today is a
team sport,'' said Wagoner, who is 6 feet 4. ``If the center
doesn't set the pick, the forward isn't going to be free to take
the jump shot.''

DOUBTS FLOURISH ABOUT IMF ABILITY TO EASE TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shocked by the descent of developing nations into
poverty and tumbling stock markets even in wealthy ones, much of
the world is placing its faith in a group of international agencies
meeting here this week to craft a solution to the global economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Tuesday told two of those agencies, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, that they have been
``vital to the prosperity of the world.'' On Monday, he told a
separate body of 22 nations that its work on the global crisis is
``perhaps the most important work the world can be doing at this
moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet in Congress, skeptism toward international agencies like
these is at one of its highest points since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, while the IMF and World Bank continue their meetings,
lawmakers only a few miles away will highlight the perceived
failings of the IMF at a public hearing. The Republican-led
Congress is deep into a debate with Clinton over whether the US
should pay $18 billion in commitments to the IMF. While Congress
moved closer to deal last night, Congress has so far said big
reforms are needed before they turn over the money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have also rebuffed Clinton's effort to pay back dues
to the United Nations. And distrust of free trade with Canada and
Mexico has prompted Congress to deny Clinton, on two seperate
occassions, ``fast track'' powers that have helped every president
since Gerald Ford negotiate new trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a split in Republican Party between
those who believe in engagement with the rest of the world and
those who believe in insularity,'' said Michael Krepon, president
of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a policy research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this split is heightened. At a time when we need to
engineer a new type of engagement abroad or reform the old
architecture, we don't have any master builders on Capitol Hill,
particularly in the Republican Party,'' Krepon said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some prominent Republicans are dismayed. ``We've got a
crisis on our hands right now, and it seems we ought to deal with
it before it becomes a worldwide recession,'' said Brent Scowcroft,
the retired Air Force general and national security adviser to
President Bush. ``Then we can say, `OK, how do we restructure our
international financial institutions?'''
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers bristle at any suggestion that they don't
see the world in its fullness. ``We are not trying to be
isolationist,'' said Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey
Republican who leads the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee.
``We want the IMF to work, and we are trying to evaluate its strong
and weak points and do something about them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hold-up in IMF funding threatents to undermine the
credibility of US finance officials trying to find a solution to
the global financial crisis. For example, Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese finance minister, responded to Clinton's proposal for a
new IMF program last week with a version of the American challenge:
Put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for a new program ``would not be very convincing
unless the United States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Democratic Party sometimes seem equally split on
whether to support global institutions and free trade. Its liberal
wing helped kill Clinton's ``fast track'' plans last year, and they
said the IMF should not offer aid to the likes of Indonesia while
its president kept a prominent labor leader in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, senior Democrats are pushing for full funding of
the IMF, while some senior Republicans are leading the charge to
block it.
</P>
<P>
   To some watching the developments, disputes like these stem from
a general decline in interest in foreign affairs. ``A lot of the
newly elected congressmen came to Washington with a specific
domestic agenda, be it right-to-life, a balanced budget, welfare
reform,'' Scowcroft said. ``Foreign policy is a distraction for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of House members were elected after the Soviet
Union collapsed, meaning they never shouldered the policy burdens
of the Cold War. As recently as a decade ago, Congress had a large
complement of World War II veterans, people who had visited foreign
lands in times of crisis. Among House freshman today, about one in
five has served in the armed forces, notes Norman Ornstein, a
political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute for Public
Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of them flaunt the fact that they don't have
passports, and use that as a signal that they are focusing on
issues of importance to their constituencies,'' Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Richard Armey, the number two House Republican, earlier
this year turned away suggestions that he visit Europe or Asia to
see how the IMF functions. ``I have not traveled outside the United
States since 1986,'' he told reporters. ``I've been to Europe once.
I don't have to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Joint Economic Committee holds its fourth hearing
this year on the IMF, a 182-nation agency that was created after
World War II. The IMF is charged with boosting the global trade in
goods by easing the occasional disruptions that develop in the
system of global currency exchanges, sometimes by offering
short-term loans to member nations.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has helped piece together rescue loans for four Asian
nations that were swept into the economic crisis, now 16 months
old, and it is working on other deals with Russia and Brazil. The
loans to South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia alone totaled $117
billion, of which about one-third came from the IMF itself and the
rest came from individual nations or other agencies and development
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $18 billion that Clinton wants for the IMF, the House
Republican leadership so far has agreed to only $3.4 billion, which
would pay the US share of a new emergency fund. The remaining $14.5
billion would be part of a $88 billion international effort to
replenish existing programs that have been straind by the recent
bailouts. Senate Republians are generally more supportive of IMF
funding than are their counterparts in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Clinton administration shares one of the key
criticisms of the Republicans who want to block IMF funding. Both
groups say that the IMF needs to reveal more about its workings,
including the terms of its loans to nations and the economic health
of its members. But the administration seems more willing to accept
the claims of IMF officials that they have already taken steps in
this direction.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics of the IMF also say the agency's rescue loans
to nations are counter-productive. Investors should know that
stocks and loans to companies in emerging nations are risky. The
IMF, with its packages that help bail out lenders, encourages
investors to take on undue risk and lend too much money in emerging
nations money that cannot be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Republican critics want the IMF to end to
subsidized interest rates and set a one-year limit on all loans.
While some lawmakers said a compromise was in the works to ensure
the funding, the war of words on the issue continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the IMF's role in the economic crisis, Clinton told
the annual IMF/World Bank meeting Tuesday: ``We can debate how to
reform the operations of the fire department, but there is no
excuse for refusing to supply the fire department with water while
the fire is burning.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Saxton later answered: ``Maybe the fire trucks should
stop pumping gasoline on the fire.''

KING RANCH SUES TO END EXXON'S EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO DRILL ON LAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A longstanding relationship that has brought much wealth to the
famed 1,300-square-mile King Ranch in South Texas and Exxon is on
the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   King Ranch Minerals Inc., a King Ranch subsidiary that controls
mineral rights to some of the property, filed a state district
court lawsuit here Monday seeking to end Exxon's exclusive rights
to drill on the land.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses Exxon of violating state law and contractual
obligations by mingling natural gas and oil production from varying
depths in Kleberg and Willacy.
</P>
<P>
   Different people own the mineral rights at different depths, the
lawsuit said, and Exxon must separate this production for them to
receive their proper royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon spokesman Dave Gardner said it does not comment on pending
suits and hopes it can work out its differences with King Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's corporate predecessor, Humble Oil &AMP; Refining Co., signed
a contract in 1933 giving it exclusive rights to drill for oil and
natural gas on the ranch's nearly one million acres. The area
included parts of Kleberg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Nueces, Brooks,
Hidalgo, Willacy, Starr, Jim Hogg, Goliad and Bee counties in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Worden, vice president and general counsel for King Ranch,
said King Ranch Minerals owns about 23 percent of the mineral
rights on the ranch, started in 1853 and still the nation's largest
cow and calf operation.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the mineral rights is owned by individuals,
Worden said, but any change in the contract between King Ranch
Minerals and Exxon can change Exxon's exclusive rights to drill on
the rest of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   King Ranch Minerals pays royalties to its 20 owners, and
royalties are paid to various people depending on the location and
depth of drilling, Worden said. He declined to name any owner.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is primarily producing natural gas in areas owned by King
Ranch Minerals, Worden said.
</P>
<P>
   He said King Ranch Minerals and Exxon have tried for more than a
year to settle their disagreement, and the suit was filed because
of an approaching statute of limitations deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and natural gas produced at King Ranch have brought a
``significant amount of money'' to the ranch and Exxon, Worden
said.
</P>
<P>
   King Ranch and Exxon co-developed the Kingwood subdivision
recently annexed by Houston, he said, but both have sold their
interests in it. &QL;

HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNDER PRESSURE TO VOTE AGAINST BROAD IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepares to vote Thursday on launching
an impeachment inquiry, Democratic leaders labored on Tuesday to
keep as many embattled Democrats as possible from voting for the
Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and Judiciary Committee members met throughout the day
to weigh a Democratic alternative they plan to offer this week, and
to consider bringing it closer to the Republican version in hopes
of appealing to a large bloc of nervous and angry moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But by nightfall, it appeared that they were leaning against
that approach and preferring to stay with a proposal Democrats
offered Monday in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever approach they chose, the White House was still bracing
for the desertions by anywhere from two dozen to several dozen
Democrats. The greater the level of defection, the harder it will
be to scoff at the vote as a partisan vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders, more concerned about their followers
than their president, were seeking a way to enable the rank and
file to say they voted for a reasonable proposal, but opposed a
Republican witchhunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, adopted Monday in the Judiciary Committee,
had no time limit on the inquiry and did not limit its focus to the
possible charges recommended by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, who dealt only with President Clinton's
attempts to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Committee Democrats sought to set a Thanksgiving deadline and bar
the consideration of additional issues.
</P>
<P>
   The possible revisions being floated include extending the
Thanksgiving deadline until the end of December, and specifically
allowing for the consideration of any new referrals from the
independent counsel, Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Democrats, the idea of softening the alternative could
sweeten the pot. ``I'm trying to avoid polarizing this thing as a
political decision, said Rep. David Minge, D-Minn. ``I'm searching
for ways to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the decision to vote for the Republican proposal
is all but a foregone conclusion. ``I'm going to vote for an
inquiry in order to move the process forward,'' said Rep. Chris
John, D-La. ``My district has consistently wanted to move this
along, and this is a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr., D-S.C., who is in a tight race for
re-election, said he favors an inquiry, but only one with a
deadline and a limited scope. ``If the Democratic alternative
fails, I've got a tough choice,'' said Spratt. ``I haven't ruled
out for the Republican motion.''
</P>
<P>
   All day, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and Democratic
whips tried to appeal to moderates by cautioning them that a vote
for the Republican proposal would doom the House to a long,
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry. But by evening, they seemed
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore placed a new round of phone calls to
House Democrats, including some committee chairmen, to lobby them
and to gauge the prevailing mood.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that they could lose as many as 80
Democrats or as few as a dozen on the vote, depending on how
invitingly they retool the party's alternative resolution. For
their part, Republicans have said that as many as 100 Democrats
could vote with them. But some on each side are playing the
expectations game, hoping to argue that they did better than
expected once the votes are cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote is coming awfully close to an election and a lot of
people are factoring that in,'' said a White House official.
``There will be a significant amount of people who will vote, not
based on how they feel, but on how they expect it to impact in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters for the White House and its allies,
the Republican majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, said on
Tuesday that Democrats would not be allowed to offer their own
proposal as a clear-cut substitute to the open-ended Republican
proposal. Instead, Democrats will have to bring up their proposal
under a parliamentary maneuver in which debate is limited to one
hour.
</P>
<P>
   And Armey again raised the possibility that the inquiry's scope,
under the direction of the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, could broaden to include allegations and evidence
from other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the House Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight, which is chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., is expected
to vote to release its interim report on 1996 Democratic campaign
finance abuses. A Republican aide to the committee said there were
no impeachable offenses in the findings, but at least one chapter
of the report contained information ``salient'' to the Judiciary
Committee's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The information deals mostly with ``White House stonewalling and
the abuse of executive privilege,'' the aide said, noting that an
estimated 80 witnesses took the Fifth Amendment or fled the country
in order not to testify before the panel, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me remind you again, one of the of the patterns that we
see, that I certainly see is stonewall, evasiveness, obstruction,''
Armey said. ``So I mean these things will be pursued by the
committee.''

ASIAN TURMOIL SPILLING OVER TO SINGAPORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ There has always been an element of fear _ some
would say paranoia _ in Singapore's 30-year effort to become one of
the world's most prosperous nations.
</P>
<P>
   Few expected the predominantly Chinese island state to survive
after it was cut loose from Malaysia in 1965. With few resources
and occasionally hostile neighbors, the fear of failure became a
major motivator for Singapore's hard-working population.
</P>
<P>
   That fear also helps explain why the tiny country of 3.2 million
people maintains a 300,000-strong military, including 250,000
reservists, and a paternalistic government that discourages
political opposition and public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fear faded as Singapore transformed itself into one
of Asia's most prosperous cities. The Asian economic miracle did
wonders for Singapore's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   The economic contagion sweeping across Asia has spread to
Singapore Inc. And to some extent, the fear is back.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months, more than 14,000 Singaporeans have
lost their jobs, bringing total unemployed to more than 30,000 in a
city that for years had to import thousands of foreign workers.
Property values have plummeted more than 30 percent in the past six
months. Tourism has fallen sharply, while domestic consumption and
investment have weakened.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the economic fallout, Singaporeans may have to
confront a host of new security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, Malaysia is struggling with continuing political
turmoil brought on by the economic crisis and Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's sacking of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, Indonesia's 200 million people are facing severe
food shortages, skyrocketing consumer prices, massive unemployment
and continuing political uncertainty as new President B.J. Habibie
tries to consolidate control.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fear further disintegration in Indonesia could
lead to a Yugoslavia-style breakup of the far-flung island nation,
posing a security threat to Singapore and some of the most
strategic sea lanes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview that
further instability in Indonesia would affect the rest of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened in the 1960s before Suharto took over,'' he
said. ``then, the center didn't really hold, leaving the outlying
parts of the country to do their own thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have problems, like illegal immigration and piracy.
There will be a climate of uncertainty and unease which will affect
the whole region. But I don't think it will be a military problem.
It's not that sort of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ministry of Defense official agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is worried that there could be a mass exodus of boat
people, refugees flooding our shores,'' said Chua Siew San, deputy
secretary for policy. ``We could also see an increase in piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From a security standpoint, Chua said, the government of former
Indonesian President Suharto was good for the region. She is not so
sure about Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia was always seen as the big guy in the neighborhood,
but Suharto didn't try to intimidate anyone,'' she said in an
interview. ``You can talk until the cows come home about his
corruption, but he was good for the region as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, on the other hand, ``doesn't like us,'' Chua said,
because of some negative comments Lee Kuan Yew made about Habibie
when it was rumored he would be named vice president by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   As to Malaysia, Singapore has a long history of tensions with
the nation dating back to Kuala Lumpur's insistence on race-based
quotas favoring Malays over Chinese, Chua said. Singapore officials
now fear those underlying tensions will be exacerbated by
Mahathir's current domestic problems and lingering jealousy over
Singapore's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore was in effect kicked out of Malaysia (in 1965) and
they thought we would not be able to survive, that we would die,''
Chua said. ``But we didn't. We survived and thrived and I think
there's some unhappiness over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past when there was trouble like this, Singapore has
been a pretty useful bogeyman for Malaysia. That sort of sentiment
is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Malaysia has barred Singapore air force jets
from flying over its territory and Mahathir issued a not-so-veiled
threat to sever a supply line that provides about half of
Singapore's water, Chua said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we need the Singapore armed forces,'' she said.
``We made it very clear to them that they can't break our
agreements (on water). Water is a matter of survival. Without it
you die. They have to think a lot harder about what kind of drastic
things that we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chua said relations between the two countries have reached a low
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' she said. ``Now the whole thing looks even worse
because of the internal problems there. The bilateral relationship
is as bad as it's ever been.''

FORMERLY STAID AT&AMP;T HATCHES SECRET OFFSPRING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than 100 years, the AT&AMP;T brand is one of the most
recognized in the world, a hallmark of corporate stability and
might.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the first time since the AT&AMP;T Corp. was founded in
1885, the company introduced a brand that does not mention AT&AMP;T:
the Lucky Dog Phone Co.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertising for the ``new'' company began Tuesday in
18 big markets, including New York and Los Angeles. Just as the
advertisements for Red Dog beer do not mention the Miller Brewing
Co., which makes it, and those for the 10-10-321 phone service do
not mention MCI Worldcom Inc., which provides it, the Lucky Dog
advertisements do not mention AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, include talking dogs, a $1 million sweepstakes
and the voice of Joe Lynn Turner, the former lead singer for the
rock group Deep Purple.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, AT&AMP;T sponsored the Bell Telephone Hour, a
television showcase for classical music. Then again, in the 1960s
AT&AMP;T enjoyed a legal monopoly on the provision of long-distance
phone service, and its brand was a leading symbol of reliability
and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's consumers, particularly the younger ones, could
hardly care less about AT&AMP;T's legacy; in fact, it may be a turnoff.
In today's communications marketplace, loyalty is low, competition
is high, and the last thing any company wants to be is staid.
</P>
<P>
   So AT&AMP;T has embraced the tools of modern marketers: a
``stealth'' brand that hides the identity of the parent company,
giveaway gimmicks, appeals to youth and even an anti-establishment
image. (This summer the company sponsored the 95th birthday of
Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle maker. After all, C. Michael
Armstrong, who took over as AT&AMP;T's chairman last year, owns two
Harleys.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a set of people out there who identify with that
young, fun company that we wanted to be able to tap into,'' said
Howard E. McNally, the AT&AMP;T executive who runs the Lucky Dog
operation. ``It's not so much that we want to be significantly
different from AT&AMP;T. We just wanted something new and young and
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to imply that AT&AMP;T can't be that,'' he quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucky Dog is more than a departure in attitude for AT&AMP;T,
which is still the nation's largest communications carrier. It
demonstrates a recognition that one of the company's crucial
decisions of the last few years was plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Lucky Dog advertisements, created by Young &AMP;
Rubicam in New York, are meant to pitch an AT&AMP;T ``dial around''
service called 10-10-345. Though the service will be available to
most United States consumers today, it will not be available in
some rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dial-around services allow consumers to gain access to special
calling promotions by dialing a code before entering a
long-distance number. Someone who normally uses the Sprint Corp.
for long-distance calls, for instance, can enter 10-10-321 before
dialing a number and that call will then travel over the systems of
MCI Worldcom. The customer, however, technically remains a Sprint
customer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, under the stealth brand of Telecom USA, the 10-10-321
service has been a big hit for MCI Worldcom, AT&AMP;T's biggest rival.
John Donoghue, a senior vice president for marketing at MCI
Worldcom, says that more than 85 percent of 10-10-321 users are
AT&AMP;T customers.
</P>
<P>
   But even when 10-10-321 started taking business away from AT&AMP;T
after its national debut in early 1997, AT&AMP;T maintained that
dial-around was a fad that would fade. It did not, and dial-around
options proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would come and go,'' McNally said. ``We
understand the market a little bit better now.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T seems to think it understands the market so well that it
has unsheathed a new weapon for the telecommunications wars: a big
sweepstakes. As part of a back-to-school promotion, MCI Worldcom's
1-800-COLLECT service is giving away 100 compact disks every day to
one customer picked at random. But Lucky Dog intends to give away
345 prizes every day _ including airline tickets, cruises and $345
cash _ plus a $1 million prize in January. Using the service
automatically enters the user in the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to Lucky Dog said that AT&AMP;T's market research
indicated that the cost-sensitive consumers who use dial-around
services also tend to enjoy sweepstakes. The executive also said
that the company would never associate a sweepstakes with the AT&AMP;T
brand.
</P>
<P>
   That has some consumer advocates worried. ``This creates a
situation where consumers might sign up just for the opportunity to
win,'' said Rebecca Sachs, a spokeswoman for the Telecommunications
Research and Action Center, a nonprofit communications research
group in Washington. ``We don't advise consumers to sign up for
programs where there are gimmicks like this involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shimojima, who helped market Diet Pepsi before joining
AT&AMP;T four years ago and creating the Lucky Dog concept, has a
different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an ongoing sweepstakes seemed like a great idea,'' he
said, ``and that would break through the clutter and inculcate the
customer into using it again.''

CANCER DOGS THE NATIONAL PASTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was one of us, a Massachusetts kid who made it all
the way to the big leagues. He once held the Boston Garden tourney
record for concutive free throws by a high school basketball
player, but baseball was his game and Mark Belanger became the
finest fielding shortstop of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, a Pittsfield native, died of lung cancer Tuesday at
the age of 54.
</P>
<P>
   If 1998 goes down as the Year Baseball Came Back and the Year of
the Home Run, then it also should be remembered as the year cancer
visited the National Pastime with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Charisse Strawberry, wife of Darryl Strawberry, threw out the
first ball before Tuesday night's ALCS opener between the Yankees
and Indians (``Darryl, our hearts are with you'' read the big board
in center). Four days ago, Darryl Strawberry had surgery to remove
a cancerous tumor in his colon. Strawberry's childhood friend, Eric
Davis, battled colon cancer last year and came back in 1998 with a
borderline MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week baseball has been hit with the death of
45-year-old former Royals reliever Dan Quisenberry (brain tumor),
the Strawberry diagnosis, Monday's news that Cal Ripken Sr. has
lung cancer, and Tuesday's sad news on Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Weaver was home in Florida Tuesday night, having dinner
with his wife when he took a call and got the news about Belanger
and Rip Sr. No one had to tell Earl that Belanger and Cal Sr. were
two of the worst chain smokers in baseball. Earl, who had a heart
attack last month, just quit the butts. Weaver used to joke about
exchanging 30,000 Raleigh coupons for a brass coffin. Nobody's
laughing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I'm not smoking now, but my wife is happy about
it,'' said Earl. ``Of course, with Mark it was different. He was
only 54. He could be my son. That's too young.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Singleton, Belanger's Baltimore teammate for several
seasons, who is working the ALCS as a commentator for Major League
Baseball International, said, ``Mark smoked too much. All the time.
Even in between innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger's nickname was ``Blade.'' He came to the majors in 1965
and eventually replaced Hall of Famer, Luis Aparicio, as the
Orioles everyday shortstop. He couldn't hit much, but alongise
Brooks Robinson he anchored the finest infield left side in
baseball history and appeared in four World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember this,'' said Weaver. ``There's be two men on base
and one out and somebody would hit a ball into the hole. We knew
the ball wasn't going through. Either Brooks or Mark would get it.
Doubleplay. So we're back in the dugout getting ready to hit and
another club would have one run in, and still be on the field with
only one out. That was nice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Belanger were never close. The Blade was the son of
Pittsfield union family and he never forgot lessons his parents
taught him about the General Electric company. Belanger's union
activity didn't win him many friends in the front office, but after
he retired he enjoyed a second career as lieutenant to Players
Association czar Donald Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger's union fanaticism almost overshadowed his extraordinay
baseball skills. Yankee shortstoop Derek Jeter, the sensational
Yankee shortstop who is re-inventing the position along with Alex
Rodgiguez and Nomar Garciaparra, sat in the dugout before Tuesday
night's game and said he'd never seen Belanger play. Jeter knew
Belanger only as one of his union reps.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter has more in common with the Blade than he knows.
Jeters uses a tiny fielder'mitt _ just as Belanger did. The Blade
would get mad if anyone put his hand inside his glove. He believed
it altered the mold made by his own hand. The little mitt won him
eight Gold Globes.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger was a lifetime .228 hitter, which keeps him out of the
Hall of Fame. Venerable Globe scribe, Clif Keane, described him on
these pages as a ``Coke and hot dog hitter.'' Belanger asked what
this meant and Clif told him, ``Because when you hit, fans are
comfortable going out for a Coke and a hot dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blade was an expert card-player, taking fistfulls of cash
from Oriole rookies in a floating low-stakes game called ``pluck.''
He was proud of his Western Massachusetts connection and once
dedicated a rare Fenway homer to Rep. Silvio Conte. Belanger owned
Nolan Ryan and Weaver always had him bat second against the
strikeout king.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good friend and a very good teammate,'' rememebered
Singleton. ``And he was as good a shortstop as I ever saw. Today's
shortstops, like Jeter, are more offensive. But I never saw Mark
make a bad throw to first. And his hands were so quick, it looked
like he never got a bad hop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blade passed away Tuesday, much too young, another baseball
cancer victim of 1998.

COMMENTARY: CAPITAL SHRINK RAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's other legacy _ not that anyone who hits 70 home
runs needs another one _ could be his casual aside to
sportswriters: ``Hey, everybody needs therapy!'' He was
exaggerating, of course, but the message was clear. The guy the
nation grew to worship _ the man who fought his way to the top from
a messy divorce and career setbacks, the devoted single father, the
surrogate brother to Sammy Sosa and the Maris family _ is someone
who conquered his demons with the help of four years of psychiatry.
In a culture where therapists and their patients alike are always
good for a laugh, a heroic jock's openness about his own history
may well encourage others who need help to seek it out.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Washington. There the prevailing attitude remains
that ``real men don't get on the couch'' _ as a George Bush
spokeswoman joked during the '92 campaign. Bill Clinton is
apparently less embarrassed about his cigar _ and surely this is
one instance in psychoanalytic history when a cigar is not just a
cigar _ than he would be about seeking counseling from anyone other
than the clergy. On the day of his prayer-breakfast mea culpa last
month, the president's spokesman took pains to deny that Clinton
was under treatment ``for any psychiatric or mental condition'' _
as if this was supposed to be reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's fear and ignorance of mental illness has led to
private local tragedies (the untreated Vincent Foster's suicide)
and shoddy public policy, which then leads to preventable national
tragedies (the seriously ill but insufficiently treated Russell
Weston Jr.'s murderous rampage at the Capitol). And you have to
wonder if the Washington mental-health learning curve is getting
worse. Among the many rights of privacy to be abridged in
Monicagate can now be added the confidentiality between therapists
and their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The patient in this case is Monica Lewinsky, who, not without
reason, sought the help of two different therapists during her
adventures with the two big creeps, Clinton and Tripp. As part of
the bargain Kenneth Starr drove in his immunity negotiations with
Lewinsky, she agreed to grant a limited waiver freeing both her
therapists to corroborate her accounts of presidential sex in
interviews with his investigators. One of the therapists, Irene
Kassorla, specifically asked, however, that ``the details of her
interview not be made public'' _ a doomed, almost poignant, request
in our Salem of 1998. Both her interview and that of the other
therapist, Kathleen Estep, became part of the latest Judiciary
Committee document dump last Friday, with minimal redactions.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no information in either interview remotely
germane to the investigation that hadn't already been summarized in
the previously released Starr report and documents, there was no
need to release the complete interviews; there was no previously
unmined news in them at all, as witness their scant press coverage
over the weekend. What was added to the record, though, were her
therapists' diagnostic speculations about Lewinsky's possible
clinical ailments and their connection to her ``relationship with
her father.'' Ho-hum stuff, perhaps, but surely the patient's
private business and utterly irrelevant to an impeachment
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In his posthumously published memoir, Arthur Liman, the chief
counsel in the Iran-contra hearings, recalls that ``suggestions in
the press that (Oliver) North had undergone psychiatric treatment
at a military facility'' prompted him to ``subpoena those
records.'' But after soul-searching, he concluded that North ``was
entitled to the same privacy as an ordinary citizen.'' Such concern
for the niceties of privacy sound absolutely quaint now.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if today's Washington would even muster the same
outrage once provoked by one of the most unsavory incidents of
Watergate _ the White House ``plumbers'' break-in to the Beverly
Hills office of Daniel Ellsberg's therapist in a failed effort to
burglarize his psychiatric files. When the Nixon aide John
Ehrlichman was sentenced to prison for his role in this incident,
the judge, Gerhard Gesell, called it ``a shameful episode in the
history of this country.'' When last Friday Congress blithely
released psychiatric musings on a private citizen, posting them on
a government Web site for all the world to see, it was simply
business as usual. (BOX)

WHITE HOUSE MANEUVERS TO DEFLECT IMPEACHMENT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Democratic leaders struggled
Tuesday to rally last-ditch support for President Clinton, an
effort aggravated by election-year fears among many House Democrats
that they will be attacked as apologists for the embattled
president.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prepares to vote Thursday on opening a full-scale
impeachment inquiry into Clinton's sex scandal, limiting Democratic
support for the Republican-sponsored proposal is crucial to
Clinton's survival plan of portraying the historic proceedings as
the product of a partisan vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   The intense effort to prevent widescale Democratic defections
played out behind the scenes as party leaders tried to craft an
alternative to the Republican impeachment plan that would satisfy
as many of the 206 House Democrats as possible.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican majority virtually united, the White House
Tuesday expressed hopelessness in trying to block the first
presidential impeachment inquiry since the Watergate hearings in
1974. ``There is a certain sense that the die is cast,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials tried to contain the political damage
by accusing GOP leaders of creating a national crisis for partisan
gain. ``Rather than being designed to be fair and somber and
befitting of the constitutional importance it takes,'' Lockhart
said, the GOP impeachment effort ``has been driven more by politics
_ maybe not politics, but partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas,
disputed the White House assertion and said he expected Republican
members to back the impeachment measure without pressure from GOP
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't create this problem,'' Armey said. ``We are appalled
by it. We are saddened by it ... . None of us want it. We are going
to move on it professionally and responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey added: ``The fact of the matter is, it is about
obstruction of justice. It is about lying to the American people.
It is about using all the instruments, and many of the people in
the White House ... to go out and tell a story that the president
himself knew to be untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Democrats, who last week predicted more than 50
Democratic lawmakers would support a full impeachment probe,
expressed cautious confidence Tuesday that the number will decrease
by tomorrow. Their goal is to limit the number of defectors to 25
or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum is swinging so that it's coming down by the
hour,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan and other lawmakers said an unspecified number of uneasy
Democrats felt less inclined to break with party leaders after
watching the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee pass the GOP
impeachment measure and defeat two Democratic alternatives on
Monday. All the votes were along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, Democrats in tight races who watched the debate on
the Judiciary Committee came away feeling better about the
Democratic alternative,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the effort to boost support for Clinton is likely to
turn on the Democratic alternative, which would be voted on after
the Republican measure passes Thursday. The alternative, which is
expected to be defeated, would instruct the House to send the
impeachment plan back to the Judiciary Committee with instructions
to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Republican proposal, the Democratic plan is expected
to call for imposing a deadline on the inquiry and limiting its
scope to events stemming from Clinton's affair with former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Two variations of the plan were
rejected by the Judiciary Committee on Monday along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, with one eye on helping and the other on
trying to recapture the House in next month's elections, were
meeting privately last night to try to develop their final
alternative plan. They also hoped to recruit some Republicans,
although that prospect was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan sets no deadline and leaves open the
possibility that the inquiry could be expanded to such issues as
the Whitewater real estate venture, the White House travel office
firings, and campaign fund-raising abuses in the 1996 elections. If
the House passes the GOP proposal, the Judiciary Committee would
launch an investigation and open hearings after the Nov. 3
elections. Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois has said he hopes the
inquiry would be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we always need to look at ways to generate Democratic
support for the inquiry,'' said Representative W. Asa Hutchinson,
an Arkansas Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ``But we voted
out a fair resolution that followed the Watergate model with broad
support and we need to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the White House and Democratic leaders, the major challenge
is convincing some moderate Democrats they will not pay a hefty
political price for appearing to condone Clinton's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and senior
member of the Judiciary Committee, said some Democrats facing
election opponents fear attack ads accusing them of protecting
Clinton from a legitimate inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said many Democrats believe the impeachment process could
eventually backfire on the Republicans. ``They are riding a
tiger,'' he said, ``and after the election they have to figure out
how to get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans acknowledged the potential for trouble, even as
they prepared to vote to launch the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dangerous political ground that both Democrats and
Republicans must tread,'' said Representative Charles F. Bass, a
New Hampshire Republican who is the GOP whip for New England.
``There is a general perception on the part of the electorate that
this is going on too long,'' he said, referring to an extended
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Bass and other House Republicans said GOP leaders have applied
no pressure for them to back the inquiry. But members of both
parties said there is more than enough pressure as the House vote
occurs less than a month before their elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controversy is the enemy of the incumbent,'' said
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican.
``Everyone is uneasy about this. In the end, I only make enemies on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee's chief Republican
investigator, David P. Schippers, called a news conference to
defend his report on Monday that laid out 15 counts of possibly
impeachable offenses against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have privately criticized Schippers for being
too soft on Clinton, and many Democrats have accused him of
inappropriately ``piling on'' the president by raising four
allegations that were not in independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played it straight down the middle,'' Schippers said. ``We
could have been a lot harsher if we wanted to be, if we wanted to
take the role of a prosecutor.''

COMMENTARY: TRAPPING GIG YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So I was having a light lunch of sweet potato fries
and sour cream with a couple of girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't trouble ourselves with the silly impeachment
hearings. All that fake solemnity and pretense of openmindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Congress, which has boasted more concupiscent hypocrites
pouncing on more nubile office girls than any institution in
history except maybe Mitsubishi, and they're ready to string up
Bill Clinton over sex?
</P>
<P>
   We spent our lunch on truly weighty matters, like how much we
had lost on mutual funds. Things have gotten so bad, my stockbroker
calls me asking for money, uttering the dread words ``margin
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Where, we fretted, would we ever come up with a pot o' cash to
finance our new fall wardrobes? Heaven forfend that we keep wearing
black, now that Seventh Avenue has declared gray the new black.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it dawned on us. Larry Flynt! The publisher of Hustler
had put a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Sunday offering
``up to $1 million'' to anyone who could provide documentary
evidence of ``an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member
of the U.S. Congress or a high-ranking government official.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded easy enough. We could hunt down some hypocritical
official, trap him into an encounter, and get the bounty. All we
needed to do was follow the game plan for snagging powerful,
clueless men set out in old Hollywood capers like ``How to Marry a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Or we could just follow the man-trap techniques used by Monica
Lewinsky to bag the leader of the Free World. Her romantic gambits
could have come straight out of those '50s movies. She is a girl
who cries out for Technicolor, not black and white.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1954 ``Three Coins in the Fountain,'' Maggie McNamara's
character catches an Italian prince by researching his tastes, from
wine to opera, and then pretending hers are the same. She even
feigns a passion for the piccolo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1959 ``Ask Any Girl,'' Shirley MacLaine snares Gig Young
by stealing his little black book and aping his favorite dates. He
likes red hair? She dyes hers. He likes a certain perfume? She buys
it.
</P>
<P>
   Monica's seduction methods were based on the old-fashioned
premise that men (and fish) are attracted by bright, shiny objects.
She stationed herself, in flashy dresses, on rope lines and in the
path of the presidential motorcade. She studied her prey's
preferences in books and accessories, and even called an
antiquarian bookstore in Annapolis, Md., where the president had
browsed, to see what he had lingered over. Told it was a book about
American presidents, she bought it for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1953 ``How to Marry a Millionaire,'' Bacall, Monroe and
Grable set their ``bear trap'' _ ``All you need is just one big,
fat one,'' said Miss Bacall _ by hanging around Bergdorf's mink
department.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt is clearly looking for a deliciously high duplicity
level. If we wanted that million, we would need a big, fat
Republican bear.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to trap Republicans, you have to hang out at the
D.C. steak house the Capital Grille, or at Christian Coalition
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The come-hither lines would have to be issue-oriented. Trent
Lott would melt if you purred: ``I loved your muscular stance on
fast track.'' You could bewitch Dick Armey, an economist, with
sweet nothings about more supply and less demand. And you could
sidle up to Mitch McConnell and coo, ``Soft money is soooo sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Naughty Newt Gingrich, the thrice-married nut Bob Barr and
confessed philanderer Henry Hyde didn't pose enough of a challenge.
We needed a real shocker.
</P>
<P>
   We would have to bag someone like...Bill McCollum, the
transcendentally geeky Florida Republican on the Judiciary
Committee who seems to think impeachment is too kind and that the
president deserves a good jolt from Old Sparky. The thought of ``an
encounter'' with the bespectacled congressman snapped us out of our
man-trapping '50s reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCollum is no Gig Young.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we already know that Congress is the biggest glass
house in the world when it comes to misbehavior. And it would be a
waste of time trying to embarrass the Republicans on sex when they
are doing such a fine job of embarrassing themselves.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES RETURNS TO PROFITABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported an
unexpected return to profitability in its third quarter Tuesday,
helped by strong sales of the company's K6-2 microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second chip company to provide an unanticipated bit
of good news about earnings, a possible sign of a rebound in the
chip industry. Motorola Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro officials said the K6-2, which offers similar
performance to Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips but at a lower price,
was being used in the majority of personal computers selling for
under $1,000. They said PC manufacturers appeared to have worked
through an inventory glut, which had depressed microprocessor sales
in previous quarters. Sales of non-microprocessor products were
flat, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro, which had not expected to make money in the
quarter, reported results after the close of the market. Advanced
Micro shares closed at $19.88, up $1.50, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares also rose Tuesday after the company said late
Monday that chip sales would rise next year and that it was on
track to meet fourth-quarter earnings estimates. Motorola said it
expected chip sales to increase 7 percent to 9 percent worldwide in
1999, compared with an 11 percent drop in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the
positive reports from Advanced Micro and Motorola were evidence of
a turnaround in the chip industry, particularly for those companies
that supply personal computer manufacturers. ``Motorola reported
orders up 5 percent from the previous quarter,'' he said.
``Motorola has not reported sequential order growth in the third
quarter in any other year this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   For AMD's third quarter, which ended Sept. 27, the company
earned $1 million, or 1 cent a diluted share, compared with a loss
of $31.7 million in the comparable period a year ago. Sales
increased 15 percent, to $685.9 million, from $596.6 million in the
third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Advanced
Micro to post a loss of 11 cents a share.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a strengthening of the market worldwide in PCs,''
said AMD chairman and chief executive W.J. Sanders in a telephone
conference call with securities analysts. ``The worst is behind us.
We're gaining market share because of the superior technology we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders quoted a report by PC Data, a market research firm in
Reston, Va., which said systems powered by AMD-K6 family processors
captured 31 percent of the total U.S. retail market for desktop
systems in August, the latest period for which data were available.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly growing market for sub-$1,000 systems, PCs
powered by AMD-K6 family processors captured a 54 percent market
share, the highest penetration the company has yet achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone said that on a global basis, Advanced Micro's share of
the total microprocessor market was in the low teens, and that the
company shipped about 4 million microprocessors in the quarter,
compared with about 23 million for Intel. But he said Advanced
Micro had gained share and would continue to do so at least in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they will continue to take share in the fourth
quarter,'' he said. ``Then the question is will they have the
necessary infrastructure,'' to support new products in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   AMD also said Tuesday that Sony Corp. planned to use its K6-2
microprocessor in new Vaio computers to be introduced later this
month in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sony Vaio Combo will feature the K6-2 350 megahertz
processor that has enhanced audio and video technology, Advanced
Micro said. It is the first time Sony has used an Advanced Micro K6
chip.

STOCKS MIXED IN ACTIVE TRADING; NASDAQ DOWN, DOW UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Tuesday in a volatile session as
the technology-heavy Nasdaq declined for a second consecutive day.
Traders and analysts said investors remain nervous about a number
of outstanding issues threatening the global and domestic economy,
and are using brief rallies as an opportunity to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks looked like they might be poised for a strong rally,
because many of the elements that previously might have triggered
waves of buying were evident early in the session: a strong
performance on foreign equity markets and better-than-expected
third-quarter earnings reports from Aluminum Company of America and
Motorola, two big, globally-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors did in fact propel prices higher in the early
hours; at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was up 154
points and the Nasdaq composite index was up 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow managed to generate a small gain, broader indexes
registered declines, especially the Nasdaq. The Dow rose 16.74
points, or 0.22 percent, to 7,742.98. But the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 3.97 points, or 0.4 percent, to 984.59. The
Nasdaq composite index declined 25.80, or 1.68 percent, to
1,510.89. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 4.25
points, or 1.26 percent, to 332.55, its ninth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is nervous,'' said Alan Ackerman, an executive vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at continuing fear of a world recession, and an
erosion of confidence that it can be staved off. Growth is slowing
in world markets, and needs to be stimulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares bore the brunt of the concern about a global
economic downturn and weakening earnings, as high-profile,
market-moving names like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Intel were
battered again. ``The technology stocks are discounting the
possibility of a global recessionary environment in 1999,'' said
Michael Molnar, a managing director in sales and trading at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``The mind-set that people have is to sell any
strength in technology, and the most vulnerable stocks are the ones
with maximum global exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco fell 2[, to 46 3/16; Microsoft dropped 3 9/16, to 97|, and
Intel lost 15/16, to 79|.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which released third-quarter earnings that were better
than expected after the market closed Monday, was an exception,
rising 3\, to 41 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, was the catalyst
behind the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Its shares
jumped 4 5/16, to 72{, after its earnings exceeded analysts'
expectations. The company said that cost-cutting had helped to
offset lower metals prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores reported better-than-expected sales gains for
September and said that it intends to open, remodel or relocate as
many as 426 stores next year. Shares of Wal-Mart gained 2\, to 59{.
</P>
<P>
   Some other big retailers also rallied. Dayton Hudson rose 1
7/16, to 35 13/16, and Sears, Roebuck gained 1 3/16, to 43}.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, however, continued to be beat up.
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. fell ~, to 79. Citicorp lost 1, to 85 and Merrill
Lynch lost 1, to 41 15/16. ``The financial sector is usually a
market leader at both tops and bottoms,'' said Gail Dudack, chief
investment strategist at UBS Securities. ``I haven't seen them turn
yet, and that makes me nervous. I will need to see the whole
financial sector sort of stabilize before I change my view that we
are out of a bear market.''

CRITICISM BESETS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S KOSOVO PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon offered fighter planes for a NATO
attack to halt an offensive in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and
said that an international force of ground troops might be
dispatched as peacekeepers. But Congress and European allies
expressed doubts Tuesday about what a strike could accomplish. The
increasing criticism, coming from Republicans and Democrats alike,
jeopardized the Clinton administration's threats of an imminent
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration found itself thwarted by
the slow decision-making of the United Nations and NATO as well as
the political skills of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. As
he has after several attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
province, Milosevic kept negotiations alive Tuesday, tantalizing
Westerners who want a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After talking by phone to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Clinton said ``NATO is prepared to act'' with air power. Milosevic
can avoid an attack by halting his offensive against separatists,
allowing refugees to return home, giving aid groups free access to
villages that have been razed and starting real talks with the
separatists, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says time is running out because Milosevic's
forces have driven 250,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, to the
hills, where they face starvation and disease this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the ``arrogance'' of Milosevic, Defense Secretary
William Cohen said the US government has pledged to provide attack
planes to NATO if there is an air strike. NATO's plans for
Milosevic involve ``inflicting enough damage to reduce his capacity
to wage war,'' Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said a ground force of peacekeepers _ a smaller version of
the force that includes 7,500 American troops in Bosnia _ would be
``a possibility.'' But he added that the soldiers should Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Clinton's supporters, Carl Levin, the
highest-ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
called military action in Kosovo ``the best of a number of bad
options.'' Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, who chairs the
committee, was more critical. ``We have not considered the impact
of this decision on US and NATO (peacekeeping) forces in Bosnia''
who could be targets of retaliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran, dressed down
the Pentagon chief, saying, ``I have to tell you, Secretary Cohen,
right now many of us are very concerned'' about the prospect of an
attack. McCain said the administration suffers a ``credibility
gap'' because of a broken promise in 1997 to withdraw America
peacekeeping forces from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has put together plans for both a quick strike and a
prolonged strike, and a final approval from the 16 members is
expected this week. But Congressional aides who keep tabs on the
Pentagon and the State Department predicted that there would not be
an attack just yet, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've waited too long on Kosovo, and Milosevic has
basically been able to accomplish 90 percent of what he wanted
while NATO and the US were dawdling,'' said a foreign policy
specialist who works for a Congressional committee who did not want
to be named. ``And let's face it. we're in the middle of this other
mess (a debate about impeachment).''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members in Congress and humanitarian groups in Washington
complained that most European countries have given a tepid
reception to discussions about an attack on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's tough talk was contradicted by a flurry of
diplomatic efforts in New York, Moscow, Belgrade and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned that any NATO attack
would lead to ``serious international consequences.'' Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov announced that Russia would veto any effort in
the UN to authorize air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A military strike will not help normalize the situation but
will have the opposite effect,'' Iganov said in comments that
convinced other diplomats the UN Security Council will not agree to
a strike. Russia is one of five permanent members of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,
said legislators would call for a review of Russia's relations with
NATO if the alliance used force.

BOND PRICES SAG

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices ended lower Tuesday for the first time in
six trading sessions, reflecting some gains in battered overseas
stock markets that diminished demand for Treasury securities as a
safe haven investment. The 30-year bond fell 8/32, to a price of
112 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction
from the price, rose to 4.73 percent from its 12-year low of 4.72
percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the enormous gains over the last few weeks in the bond
market as investors sought a safe-haven from tumbling stocks,
analysts said it was understandable to see a pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed
income at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla.,
said bond prices have risen so quickly and yields fallen so much
that the market is now vulnerable to sudden sell-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors realize that we are at very lofty prices levels,''
he said. ``With the government long bond yielding in the
neighborhood of 4.70 percent, the market is susceptible to any kind
of negative news.''

PADRES FACE A BRAVES TEAM AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Same old Atlanta Braves. They don't get older and
weaker. They just get better.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the National League Championship Series with the
San Diego Padres, you heard this a lot. Facing 17-game winner John
Smoltz in his home park is asking a lot of the NL West champions.
Knowing that 20-game winner Tom Glavine will follow Smoltz is just
plain cruel. And don't even mention Greg Maddux and Denny Neagle,
who will pitch in San Diego over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are in the NLCS for the seventh straight time since
1991 (there were no playoffs in 1994 because of the player's
strike). They are healthy and have depth and experience on the
pitching staff. There has been as much praise for rookie reliever
Kerry Ligtenberg as for veteran Dennis Martinez. The offense is
clicking. You don't win 106 games with a club that has a glaring
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   After losing last year to the eventual champion Florida Marlins,
the Braves are eager to get back to the World Series, especially
after the embarrassment of being beaten by a wild card team and one
that had been in the league only since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But San Diego is a mirror of the Braves in many areas. With
pitcher Kevin Brown leading the way, they are a legitimate threat
to reach the World Series for the first time since 1984. If the
Braves aren't worried, they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Florida was a conglomeration of high-priced talent
gathered from all the clubs in baseball,'' said Braves general
manager John Schuerholz. ``They did a good job in deciding how they
would put the club together. And they beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we're rock solid. The key is our pitching. It's
always there. In addition to the starters, young guys came through
for us in the bullpen and did a good job. We had more balance. The
new guys, Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss, contributed mightly.
Weiss solidified the infield early and made the All-Star team.
Andruw Jones emerged as the finest center fielder in baseball. And
our defense led the National League for the first time in 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres and Braves have not met since mid-August, when
Atlanta won three of four to take the season series, 5-4. With a
huge lead in the NL East, the Braves then went into cruise control.
San Diego, meanwhile, had to fight off a September bid by San
Francisco before winning the division by nine games. The Padres
lost eight of their final 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   But in the division series, the Padres played mistake-free
baseball and beat Randy Johnson twice, ousting the Central champion
Astros in four games. Brown logged two victories, the second on
three days' rest. He is scheduled to work Game 2 of the NLCS, after
Andy Ashby (17-9, 3.34) opens the series Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing is to stay away from a big inning,''
said Ashby. ``I looked back to my game against Houston, where a
double and a walk helped create two runs. I'm saying to myself, `Go
out and get ahead and try to minimize your mistakes.' With our
offense, if you give them a chance, they can bust out anytime. The
time I get into trouble is when I try to be too fine instead of
aggressive and letting the ball move the way it was earlier in the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have manager Bobby Cox singing their praises, and
that is rare. He likes the fact that his lineup is balanced and he
has his best bullpen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some great additions,'' said Cox. ``We were able to
get Andres Galarraga to play first. Nothing against Fred McGriff,
who got us to many playoffs, but it changed our lineup because he
is righthanded and he's had a super year here. Walt Weiss had a
great first half until he got hurt. I think one of the factors
overlooked is Ozzie Guillen being able to pick up for Walt when he
couldn't play. Walt is better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg may not be well known, but he had 30 saves and filled
the void left by the demise of Mark Wohlers, who is not even on the
playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they've all heard of Trevor Hoffman and the job he's
done for San Diego,'' said Cox. ``But these guys can get the job
done. Ligtenberg was playing in an outlaw league in Minnesota. John
Rocker never did shoot the lights out in our organization, but he
went to the fall league in 1997, went through the draft, and now he
is a dominating lefthanded pitcher. Don't forget Dennis Martinez.
He's 43 years old and can still come in and get ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bullpen that is very functional, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz takes nothing for granted against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of veteran experience,'' said Smoltz. ``People
talk about pressure, but it is only being in a situation you have
not seen before. A lot of us have been in these situations before,
which is why people think we have the edge. We still have to go out
and execute.''

U.S. INTENSIFIES THREAT TO USE FORCE AGAINST SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Tuesday intensified
its threat to use force against Yugoslav military and police as
diplomacy continued to try to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic
to end his crackdown in Kosovo and to maintain NATO unity behind
military action.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to NATO's 15 other members over the weekend,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged the allies to take the
next step and vote to give NATO's commanders the authority to use
force. But some of the allies have resisted that step; a vote,
which was to take place in Brussels on Wednesday, has now been
delayed to the end of the week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans allies are insisting that NATO make another effort
to persuade Russia to go along with the possibility of NATO
intervention in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia on Tuesday vowed to veto any attempt by the United
Nations Security Council to authorize the strikes, warning of
``serious international consequences'' if NATO used force without
such authority. The Europeans are prepared to risk a Russian veto,
but want to avoid one if possible. They do not want to stir up
Russian anger at NATO, and in addition the Russians may be in a
position to influence the Serbs, with whom they have friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has argued that NATO has the legal right to
intervene in Kosovo because the fighting there is a threat to
European stability. The NATO allies remain concerned, however,
about the lack of clear legal authority for a military attack
against a sovereign country trying to suppress an insurrection
within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate goes on internationally, there is disagreement
even within the administration about how best to pursue and
ultimately enforce a resolution to end Milosevic's crackdown in
Kosovo. The rift emerged over the possible use of American ground
forces to enforce any cease-fire in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen told the Senate's Armed
Services Committee that he opposed placing American troops on the
ground in Kosovo, though he said some sort of international force
might be necessary to ensure stability. That puts him at odds with
Albright and other members of the administration, who did not rule
out the use of ground troops on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a ground component is required, it is my recommendation _
and I would almost say insistence _ that it be largely, if not
wholly European in nature,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks surprised officials within the administration
and NATO. NATO's commanders have drafted a plan to send as many as
26,000 troops to Kosovo to enforce a cease-fire and support
humanitarian relief for ethnic Albanians driven from their homes by
Milosevic's crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said no decision had been made on using
American ground forces, but Albright and others have refused to
rule out the possibility, should Milosevic agree to halt the
violence in Kosovo. The internal rift underscores the extent to
which the administration is still scrambling to forge its policies
toward Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to President Clinton said on Tuesday that they still hoped
to persuade Milosevic to accept a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke,
met with Milosevic for a second day in Belgradeon Tuesday.
Holbrooke pressed Milosevic and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians to accept an interim agreement to give Kosovo a limited
form of autonomy but puts off a final decision on the province's
status, according to a draft of the agreement provided to The New
York Times. It is not clear whether either side would accept the
agreement, which provides Kosovo less autonomy than in the former
Yugoslavia before 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the meeting of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday, Clinton called on Milosevic on Tuesday to
accept U.N. demands spelled out in a resolution passed by the
Security Council last month, including a withdrawal of Serb police
and military units from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''

   KAPELL-MUSIC (Undated) _ By the time William Kapell died in a
plane crash in October 1953, at 31, he had already come to be
recognized as the finest pianist America had produced. The popular
pianists at the time were foreign-born: Horowitz, Rubinstein,
Brailowsky, Hofmann. As an artist he was stupefyingly gifted, and
everyone knew it. By his mid-20s he had a major career, a contract
with RCA Victor, dates with Ormandy, Stokowski, Reiner, Monteux and
Steinberg. His recording of Khachaturian's Concerto with
Koussevitzky became a jukebox hit. Then he died, and as often
happens, the fame faded. His recordings went out of print by 1960,
and after that only a few were available occasionally. Pianists
still talked of him as an icon who had paved the way for the first
generation of Americans to make a mark on the international scene.

<P>
   ZONCA-FILMS (Paris) _ Erick Zonca, 42, the French movie
director, first film ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' closes the New
York Film Festival on Sunday. It is, so to speak,
post-autobiographical. Nonetheless, it is a first film in that it
came out of nowhere: even in the French movie business, few people
had heard of Erick Zonca. Until, that is, ``The Dreamlife of
Angels'' was given a 12-minute ovation at this year's Cannes
International Film Festival and Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier,
who play the lead roles, went on to share the festival's best
actress award. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   JANE-ADAMS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ A profile of Jane Adams, 32,
the star of Todd Solondz's ``Happiness.'' Comic and unsettling,
``Happiness'' (which opens on Friday) takes three sisters (Ms.
Adams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia Stevenson) in suburban New Jersey
and peels the lid off their apparently ordinary lives to reveal a
microcosm of modern-day isolation. By Margy Rochlin.
</P>
<P>
   SO-CALLED-LIFE-VIDEO (Undated) _ As they say, the good die
young. But in television the good can sometimes enjoy an afterlife,
and so it is with ``My So-Called Life'': six hourlong episodes
(including the pilot) will be released on video on Tuesday by BMG.
Critics weren't universally in love with the series, but most
acknowledged its realism and strong individual voice. By Peter M.
Nichols.

   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (New York) _ Theater reviews: ``The Mystery of
Irma Vep'' and ``Communicating Doors'' By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   RIDGE-THEATER (New York) _ The Ridge Theater is an avant-garde
company with the unbuttoned charm of ex-hippies who have made a
name in experimental theater for staging multimedia spectacles with
tidy, Swiss-watch precision. ``Looking at us, you'd think we're
aging slackers,'' says Bob McGrath, 43, the group's artistic
director. Finding order in ``Chaos,'' a new opera the Ridge is
staging at the Kitchen, through Oct. 24, seems a suitable task for
the company, which for 11 years has favored stories that accent the
sinister side of popular culture. By Steven Drukman.
</P>
<P>
   DAVIS-THEATER-ARTIST (Undated) _ In Paul Davis's theater
posters, one can see the essence of the original performance: the
arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the Knife in ``Threepenny
Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in ``Hamlet,'' the
Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The Cherry Orchard'' and
the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as Hamlet, Richard III
and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of Penzance. As an artist,
Davis made his reputation with these posters and others he drew for
Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York Shakespeare Festival
in the 1970s and 1980s. By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTER-HENLEY-THEATER (Undated) _ If Holly Hunter and Beth
Henley had not been stuck in an elevator together 16 years ago on
their way to an audition for Ms. Henley's play ``The Wake of Jamey
Foster,'' the two would have found each other eventually. Ms.
Hunter has appeared in six Henley plays and on Thursday she will
open in the seventh, ``Impossible Marriage,'' a production by the
Roundabout Theater Company at the Laura Pels Theater. By Robin
Pogrebin.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PUBLISH (Undated) _ Historically, getting a musical
composition published was more than a practical way of putting a
new score into circulation. It was a tangible sign that a composer
had arrived on the scene and was to be taken seriously. That
situation has changed. The music publishing business was already in
crisis some 15 years ago, when personal computer programs enabled
composers to create manuscripts as attractive and legible as
engraved published scores. Now that such programs have become less
complicated and more flexible, the computer-generated score is the
standard. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Playing Beethoven is one of the two
most important things a symphony orchestra has to do, along with
performing new works. We need to keep going back to Beethoven. And
we need to keep thinking about why we need to keep going back.
Opportunities to go back, but not so much to think about why, were
recently offered by the New York Philharmonic and its music
director, Kurt Masur. Their season-opening Beethoven cycle was,
remarkably, the Philharmonic's first compact presentation of the
Beethoven symphonies since Toscanini conducted the works in the
orchestra's centenary year, 1942. A lot has happened since 1942.
Increased knowledge of Beethoven's contemporaries has enhanced our
awareness both of how far he stood apart and of how close he was to
other composers of his age in his Romantic urgings and his
revolutionary hopes. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN-1966-MUSIC (Undated) _ Things got ugly when Bob Dylan
performed on May 17, 1966, at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester,
England. A good part of the audience was actively hostile to
Dylan's non-protest songs and his bluesy electric band: catcalling,
shouting insults, clapping in an attempt to drown out the music. It
was all duly recorded by Columbia Records, which finally releases
Dylan's ``Live 1966'' (two CDs) this week. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   BETTY-CARTER-APPRAISAL (Undated) _ Jazz singer, composer,
arranger nonpareil _ Betty Carter, who died on Sept. 26 at the age
of 69, was all these things. But along with her own music, she
leaves another significant legacy with the musicians she nurtured,
the careers she helped shape. Over the last two decades, her band
was an incubator for jazz talent, and many young musicians who
honed their skills with Ms. Carter are now making their mark as
leaders. Eight almuni recall the lessons they learned from a
beloved teacher and inspiring taskmaster. By Fletcher Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   APPLE-BERLIN-ARTS (Berlin) _ Reunification has reshuffled the
artistic deck in Berlin. The scaffolding surrounding the great
Pergamon Altar, a masterpiece of Hellenistic art from the 2nd
century B.C., has come down. One of the main attractions on the
Museum Island, where other museums are also under repair, it
reopened to the public in August, cleaned and restored, though work
remains to be done. The big event of the summer was the opening in
June of the new Gemaldegalerie, or picture gallery, where the
Prussian state collection of Old Masters _ divided by the Cold War,
like Berlin, between East and West _ has been reassembled. By R.W.
Apple Jr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AGA-KHAN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Aga Khan: the name shimmers
with glamour. Fabulous wealth. Palatial houses. Racehorses. Yachts.
Jewels. Royal prerogative. As if that weren't enough, the Aga Khan
is also the most important figure in the world of architecture
today. In a ceremony at the Alhambra in Spain last Friday, Prince
Karim Aga Khan honored seven buildings and urban plans, winners of
the 1998 Aga Khan Awards for Architecture. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-PROGRAMMING (Undated) _ One of the few traditions left in the
television programming business is the premiere of new shows each
fall. Since the advent of cable and satellite distribution, the
addition of quasi-networks like UPN and the WB, and the dispersal
of the old network audience across a wide range of other interests
and technologies, there is no longer a fixed schedule for the debut
of new product. Shows pop up on the prime-time schedule year round
now, each one vying to find an audience, fast, in a world of
hairtrigger remotes and short attention spans. By Jeff MacGregor.

CHICAGO PROGRAM INCREASES VACCINATION OF POOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Chicago program has significantly improved the dangerously low
immunization rates among the city's poor children through
incentives that require parents to report to authorities monthly,
instead of quarterly, to receive federal food vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children receive the appropriate vaccinations, the
parents are allowed to return to quarterly vouchers, under an
interagency program that for the first time links local
immunization efforts to federal food distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the project were reported in Wednesday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Immunization rates among the 13,760 children, all two years old
or younger, increased from 56 percent to 89 percent over the 15
months when parents or guardians were required to report monthly to
receive the vouchers. The ongoing program began in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When the parents report to authorities to receive their
vouchers, health workers warn them about the risks children face
without immunizations and tell them where the children can receive
free shots. Sometimes the shots are even provided at the same
office.
</P>
<P>
   But among a comparison group of 2,821 children whose guardians
had to report only quarterly to receive their food vouchers, the
immunization rate remained substantially unchanged over the 15
months, even though that group received the same counseling and
services, according to the journal report. Since the results were
documented, those children and their families have been moved to
the monthly incentive program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Hoekstra and Dr. Charles LeBaron of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who conceived and
helped coordinate the $271,000 Chicago project, said in the journal
article that the agencies' staffs were crucial to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, LeBaron said in an interview, government agency
collaboration had been difficult for various bureaucratic and
budgetary reasons. ``This program shows,'' he said, ``that with
such collaboration some very simple methods can have a major impact
on health.''
</P>
<P>
   The perils of low immunization rates became clear in the 1989-91
measles epidemic in the United States when 55,000 people contracted
the disease and 130 died from it. Since then, immunization rates
have risen in much of the nation, an average of more than 80
percent, but lag behind in some poor urban communities, where the
rate is as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's immunization project was run by the city's Department
of Public Health and the agency known as Supplemental Nutrition for
Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. The WIC program, set up in the
1960s, is coordinated by the United States Department of
Agriculture, which makes available surplus farm products. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceived the incentive
program and assisted local officials in carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and head of the Department
of Community and Preventative Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York, praised the results. ``The lesson,'' he said,
``is that if this program of incentive intervention and cooperation
between government agencies can work in Chicago, it can be exported
and used elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Wood of the Shriners Hospital for Children in
Tampa, Fla., and Dr. Neal Haflon of the School of Medicine at the
University of California at Los Angeles, in an accompanying journal
editorial, cautioned against quick generalizations about possibly
expanding the program. They said a number of special circumstances
might have been at work in Chicago, including close interagency
cooperation, that could be difficult to duplicate elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wood said in an interview, ``The need for what was
accomplished in Chicago was just huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The program includes vaccinations against whooping cough, polio,
mumps, diphtheria and tetanus.

WALTON FOUNDATION GIVES $50 MILLION TO ARKANSAS U. BUSINESS
SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest single gift to an American business school _ $50
million to the College of Business Administration of the University
of Arkansas _ was announced Tuesday by the Walton Family Charitable
Support Foundation at a ceremony at the university's Fayetteville
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which was created in 1987 by Sam Walton and his
wife, Helen, supports charitable organizations like the University
of Arkansas. Walton, who died in 1992, was the founder of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. He graduated from the University of Missouri at
Columbia in 1940 with a degree in business.
</P>
<P>
   Other major gifts to business schools, according to the American
Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, include $40 million
to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania earlier
this year; $35 million to the Gordon S. Marshall School of Business
at the University of Southern California in 1997; and $33.5 million
to the Owen Graduate School of Management of Vanderbilt University,
also in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas gift also ranks as one of the 40 largest gifts to
higher education since 1967, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education, a weekly publication serving colleges and universities.
Emory University tops that list as the recipient of $295 million in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Williams, dean of the College of Business Administration,
said that after being used to increase the school's endowment, the
money would in large part go to retaining and attracting faculty
members of national stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present,'' Williams said, ``our School of Business, which
has approximately 2,600 undergraduates, is ranked in the third
tier, and our M.B.A. program, which serves about 150 master's
students, is among the top 100 in the nation. This gift will
catapult the college into the highest rank. Within five years, we
will be among the top 25 schools of business.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, S. Robson Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart
Stores and Sam Walton's eldest son, said: ``As a young man Dad's
dream had been to go to the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania, but that was in the 1930s and he couldn't afford it.
But he certainly recognized how going to an outstanding business
school could give anyone a leg up, and he would be pleased by our
making this gift.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Arkansas chancellor John A. White said he would
recommend to the university trustees that the business school be
renamed the Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration. The
trustees are expected to act on the proposal next month.
</P>
<P>
   With the $50 million gift, Walton family contributions to the
University of Arkansas come close to $64 million for a wide variety
of programs, including two endowed faculty chairs, the Sam M.
Walton Leadership Chair in the College of Business Administration
and the Wal-Mart Chair in Marketing; the Walton Family
African-American Future Educator conference; the Great Expectations
of Arkansas Program, and the Helen Robson Walton Reading Room in
Mullins Library.

JEROME WEIDMAN, 85, AUTHOR OF NOVELS AND PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Weidman, the prolific and popular novelist who
wrote ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale'' and also won a Pulitzer
Prize as the author (with George Abbott) of the Broadway musical
``Fiorello!,'' died Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In his two prosperous careers as novelist and playwright,
Weidman often wrote about the rough underside of business and
politics _ and daily life _ in New York, the city where he was
born. His first novel, ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale,''
published in 1937 when he was 24, teemed with the life in
Manhattan's garment center, telling about the rise of the ragingly
ambitious Harry Bogen. Along with the title character in Budd
Schulberg's ``What Makes Sammy Run?,'' Harry became an archetypal
figure in American literature: the abrasive young man who would do
anything to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Weidman wrote 22 novels, many volumes of short stories, several
plays and screenplays and, in 1986, a memoir, ``Praying for Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale'' was a striking debut. The reviewer in The New York
Times said that the author ``knows his subject about as well as
Ernest Hemingway knew the Paris cafes, James M. Cain the postman
who always rang twice, John O'Hara the life and death of Julian
English.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel made his reputation and became his longest running
success. Transformed into a Broadway musical in 1962 (with a score
by Harold Rome), it starred Elliott Gould as Harry Bogen, and was
the show in which Barbra Streisand made her Broadway debut (as the
secretary Miss Marmelstein). ``Wholesale'' was also the source of a
1951 movie, which retained very little of the book except for its
title and gave Susan Hayward the central role as a female version
of Harry Bogen. The book was followed by an equally hard-driving
sequel, ``What's In It for Me?''
</P>
<P>
   The musical ``Wholesale'' came after ``Fiorello!'' and
``Tenderloin,'' both with book by Weidman and score by Jerry Bock
and Sheldon Harnick. In addition to winning the Pulitzer Prize,
``Fiorello!'' _ a musical about Mayor La Guardia of New York _ won
a New York Drama Critics Circle award as best musical of the
1959-60 season and tied with ``The Sound of Music'' for a Tony
award that season.
</P>
<P>
   Weidman's first novel became the hallmark of his career, and
also a subject of controversy. There were those like Meyer Levin
who thought of him, along with Schulberg, as examples of ``the
self-hating period in writing,'' as novelists who wrote too
negatively about their Jewish backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novelist is not a propagandist,'' said Weidman in an
interview in 1978 with Richard F. Shepard in The Times. ``I have
lived all my life with Jewish people, and I have to paint them,
warts and all. My beat is the beat that Sinclair Lewis took, life
in America.'' He added: ``I admit that some of the people I write
about are not of the most estimable character. I am never
apologetic about it.'' His was an insider's report on life as he
saw it. Weidman said that Hemingway thought of him as the American
Balzac, and wrote, in a letter, ``Don't let them get you down, kid,
because I think you can write just a little better than anybody
else that's around.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next five decades, Weidman continued to write his novels
and stories. Though his literary reputation wavered, and some
critics felt that he had written his best work at the beginning of
his career, he retained his audience. Many of his books were best
sellers. The author responded philosophically to adverse criticism.
Commenting on ``the number of geniuses that flared and faded'' in
his time, he was proud of his ability to survive as a writer and to
be continually productive.
</P>
<P>
   His claim was more that of an entertainer and an artisan. As he
said: ``I know how to handle my bag of tools. I can write a story
about anything under the sun.'' To some, his stories, along with
``Wholesale,'' were at the core of his career. Reviewing one
collection, a Times critic wrote of the book's ``savage
brilliance'' and called it a ``splendid exhibition of Weidman's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiction was often drawn from the life of the author. Before
he wrote ``Wholesale,'' he worked in the garment district, and
``The Enemy Camp,'' which was about anti-Semitism in suburbia,
paralleled his own life, as a New York Jew who moved with his
family to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Before You Go'' in The Times in 1960, Charles Poore
said this novel about World War II was ``bound to be one of the
outstanding successes of the year,'' and added it that it was
``about passion, ambition, heartbreak and revenge'' and ``traces
the rise in New York's mean streets to glamorous toughness on the
world's high, mysterious peaks of decision.'' Except for the
mysterious peaks, something like this could have been said about
many other Weidman novels.
</P>
<P>
   Weidman was born on April 14, 1913, on the Lower East Side, a
son of immigrant parents. After he graduated from De Witt Clinton
High School, he moved with his family to the Bronx and took a job
as an office boy in the garment district, where he immediately
began gathering material. Later he studied at City College of New
York. At 17, he sold his first story, to the American Spectator. He
soon had stories in Story, The American Mercury and The New Yorker,
where 23 of his stories appeared between 1936 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   While studying at New York University Law School, Weidman wrote
his first novel, which he called ``Ten O'Clock Scholar.'' After
many rejections, it was published as ``I Can Get It for You
Wholesale.'' Weidman quickly followed it with its sequel. In 1939,
Alfred Kazin reviewed Weidman's first collection of stories in The
Times, calling the book ``a snarling, joyous, rambunctious carload
of sound effects in the best Seventh Avenue New Yorkese.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Weidman's other novels were ``The Third Angel,'' ``The
Enemy Camp,'' ``Before You Go,'' ``The Sound of Bow Bells,''
``Other People's Money,'' ``The Temple,'' ``A Family Fortune'' and
``Counselors-at-Law.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize-winning ``Fiorello!'' added a new dimension to his
career. In addition to ``Tenderloin'' and ``Wholesale,'' he wrote
the book for Duke Ellington's ``Pousse-Cafe'' and a Broadway
comedy, ``The Mother Lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Peggy of Manhattan; two sons, John
of Manhattan, and Jeffrey of Kansas City, Mo., and two
grandchildren. John Weidman is the author of the books for two
Stephen Sondheim musicals, ``Pacific Overtures'' and ``Assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, Weidman looked back on his beginnings as a New
Yorker and as a writer: ``Living as part of the sweaty traffic of
New York's East River docks in the early part of this century was
for me a time of excitement I did not think about, much less
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until he read Mark Twain that he realized he could be
a writer. As he said: ``Life for me on East Fourth Street when I
was a boy was not unlike what life on the banks of the Mississippi
had been for young Sam Clemens of Hannibal, Mo. Guileless,
untrained and unself-conscious, I put the stories down on paper the
way I learned to walk.'' Soon he was running.

INVESTORS FRET AS BRAZIL SOFT-PEDALS NEED FOR AUSTERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ In gatherings with financial officials
and international investors in Washington, Brazilian officials have
been pledging drastic, if unspecified, measures to cut spending by
$25 billion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Brazil, the message has been far softer. And
investors are beginning to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Here, officials shun the word ``package'' _ with its whiff of
sacrifices that would drastically worsen people's lives _ to
describe the set of government spending cuts that will be needed to
put Brazil's fiscal house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me there will be no shocks or surprises,'' President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso told voters last week in his final
televised address before appearing to squeak through to re-election
Sunday. ``With me, there'll be no package.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was repeated by presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral
on Monday night. ``I reiterate that there will be no economic
package, for the simple reason that there are no measures that
taken together would amount to a package, and because the president
does not consider that the way to conduct economic policy,'' Amaral
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman cited a speech the president made two weeks ago,
outlining fiscal belt-tightening measures, a crackdown on tax
evasion and possible tax increases. That, he said, made ``very
clear what the government will do.'' And government officials said
Tuesday that broad measures would be made over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wall Street and at the International Monetary Fund
meeting in Washington on Tuesday, where the consensus spread that
Brazil's economy was too important to be allowed to collapse,
expectations ran the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny that people there don't want to use the term
`package,' '' James Barrineau, a Latin American equity strategist
at Salomon Smith Barney, said. ``That's exactly the word they're
wanting to hear in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, everybody has the sense that it has to be a big and
credible package, without a lot of wiggle room for the states to
siphon off money from the federal government,'' Barrineau said.
``People are waiting to see what is Brazil's goal for 1999, how
will it get there, how can it assure us that it's not going to
backslide, and how does that help the sustainability of the
economic plan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that the poor performance of the Brazilian market, which
fell 4.47 percent Monday, reflected the ``less than rousing
mandate'' won by Cardoso and the unexpectedly strong showing of the
leftist Workers Party in senatorial and gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of the returns counted by Tuesday afternoon,
Cardoso had won 52.5 percent of the vote, while his rival, Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party, had 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, markets rose 3.48 percent on the decision by Spain's
central bank to cut interest rates by half a percentage point,
which investors took as a sign that Europe would begin taking steps
to alleviate the crisis threatening Brazil, the world's
ninth-largest economy. By late afternoon, market sources said, $120
million in foreign reserves had left Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is the linchpin of the world financial system right
now, and the effort to put together credibility for the Brazilian
bailout is central to the world financial system now,'' said one
Latin American investment strategist, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``No matter what happens, Brazil cannot go down.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between domestic and international messages is
not new. Buffeted by the Asian crisis last November, the Brazilian
government announced some 51 spending cuts and new fees to raise
$15 billion. It went ahead with the measures that raised cash but
quietly dropped more politically sensitive efforts to cut spending
including, for example, laying off tens of thousands of civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Barros, publisher of a newsletter based in Brasilia,
Early Warning, said investors were willing to give Brazil some time
to work out its plan of action, but not much. Brasilia is rife with
rumors of a U.S.-led line of credit being extended to Brazil,
perhaps as a backup to an IMF package.
</P>
<P>
   But Barros said that investor patience could turn to panic in
less than two weeks. ``People expect the fund and Brazil to at
least come to terms about what they're going to do, and they're
frustrated that nothing solid has come out of the meetings so
far,'' he said.

RACIST E-MAIL IS SENT TO 13 AT BOSTON COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It took minutes for a racist e-mail message to land in
the mailboxes of 13 minority students at Boston College last
Thursday. It took a few hours more before the whole campus knew
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by phone calls and fliers that asked ``Will U stand for
this?'' more than 1,000 students overflowed an auditorium that
night to condemn the act and scrutinize the e-mail, sent to leaders
of minority organizations on campus. Of the college's nearly 9,000
undergraduates, about 1,600 are members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were screaming, yelling, crying,'' said Annelice
Morales, who received the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The message said ``BC is for white men'' and included slurs
against people who were Asian, black, Hispanic and gay. ``You all
need to go back where you came from,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The university police are investigating whether someone may have
used another Boston College student's e-mail account to send the
message. The sender, if a student, could face expulsion or
suspension, Reid Oslin, a Boston College spokesman, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders were encouraged by the strong turnout for the
meeting, which included many white students. But the meeting also
revealed what Ms. Morales called a hidden tension on campus. Six
racist, sexist or anti-gay graffiti have been reported in the
dormitories since the beginning of classes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Boston College as a whole was aware of how often
these things happen,'' said Ms. Morales, a sophomore. ``I know in
two or three months it's going to be forgotten and things will be
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College is the latest of several colleges and
universities to see hateful e-mail sent on their systems in recent
months, including the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the
University of North Carolina. At the University of Maine at Orono,
a student was ordered to do community service and had his computer
account suspended after he posted a threatening message last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Congress passed a bill that would require colleges
and universities to expand their reporting of hate crimes to
include biases based on sex or disability. Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., who sponsored the original bill, also wanted to require the
reporting of harassment and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately those were stripped out of the bill during
conference,'' said Joy Howell, a spokeswoman for Torricelli. ``We
still think it's a problem that needs to be addressed.''

CLINTON, DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO LIMIT DEFECTIONS DURING IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House stepped up criticism Tuesday of the
Republican drive to begin an impeachment inquiry against President
Clinton as Democrats scrambled to limit defections when the issue
comes to a vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders who control the House said Tuesday that
debate would be limited to one hour on a GOP resolution to begin
only the third presidential impeachment investigation in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republicans turned down a Democratic
request to offer an alternative resolution that would set a
deadline for finishing the inquiry and limit it to the president's
effort to cover-up his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the right resolution,'' said House Republican
leader Dick Armey of Irving. ``I think it is just time to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution calling for an open-ended impeachment
investigation cleared the Republican-controlled House Judiciary
Committee late Monday with all 21 GOP members supporting the
proposal and all 16 Democrats in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   By identical party-line votes, the committee rejected two
Democratic proposals _ each calling for an investigation but with
limits on the scope and duration.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart accused the
Republican leadership Tuesday of using the impeachment issue ``to
embarrass the president'' and to win votes in the Nov. 3
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does appear after watching this for the last month that the
(GOP) leadership is pursuing a strategy for electoral advantage,''
Lockhart said. ``There is a certain sense that the die is cast on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by House Republican leaders to limit debate and not
allow a Democratic alternative to be discussed drew criticism, even
from some conservative Democrats who plan to vote for an unlimited
investigation that could lead to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hour of debate seems a little peculiar to me on something
as important as the possible impeachment of the president of the
United States,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Stamford. ``There
are a lot of viewpoints that need to be heard on this, and I'm not
sure it can be done in one hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., complained that Armey ``wants to
make it appear there is no alternative'' to the GOP resolution and
predicted no Republicans would vote against an impeachment inquiry.
``They see the House as a grand jury and they're ready to indict
and send it over to the Senate for a trial,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, said an effort will be made to
limit the Judiciary Committee's ability to expand its impeachment
investigation beyond the Lewinsky affair. ``This is what we should
be addressing and not every gripe the Republican leadership may
have had with the Clinton administration in the last six years,''
Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
House membership is not near unity on the issue of an impeachment
investigation. Liberals from safe seats generally oppose any type
of inquiry, moderates see the need for a limited inquiry and
conservatives _ such as Stenholm, Jim Turner of Crockett and Ralph
Hall of Rockwall _ and others facing tough re-election battles are
ready to side with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House allies were
calling Democrats Tuesday trying to bolster support for the
president. But Democratic House members said they were being told
by Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri there would be no
arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats are hoping to keep defections to a minimum to
keep Republicans from putting a bipartisan spin on their open-ended
investigation, preliminary vote counts Tuesday indicated an uphill
battle. Republicans counted a minimum of 21 of the 206 House
Democrats ready to vote for the Republican resolution. Democratic
tallies put the number of defectors at ``around 50, down from about
120,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the liberal advocacy group the People
for the American Way unveiled a television advertisement aimed at
pressuring Congress to put the sex scandal aside and ``move on'' to
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Showing photos of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
television evangelist Pat Robertson and independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, the 30-second advertisement says: ``Some in Washington are
listening to the religious right _ not the people. It's time to get
back to what really counts: first-rate schools, Medicare and Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said the $1 million advertising campaign, which began
airing Tuesday on CNN and in eight U.S. urban markets, but not in
Texas, was designed ``to give voice to the millions of Americans
who have told pollsters that they are sick of the scandals and want
to see Washington dealing with real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the National Republican Congressional
Committee announced its own advertising campaign, which defends the
GOP-controlled House and Senate, and took a swipe at the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the public may not have read about it in newspapers, or
heard about it on the TV news, the Republican majority has been
working overtime on behalf of America's working families,'' said
Rep. John Linder, the NRCC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are reaching out to find solutions to the problems
families face, like a $500-per-child tax credit ... even a budget
surplus that's helping save Social Security,'' says one of the ads
that began airing in 30 states, including some areas of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Paula Jones, whose sexual harassment suit
against Clinton provided the setting for the president's initial
cover-up efforts, were considering his latest settlement offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has rejected the offer,'' said John Whitehead of the
conservative Rutherford Institute, who serves as one of Jones'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead dismissed a media report that Jones had rejected a
$700,000 offer from White House attorneys and said negotiations
were continuing. Jones offered to drop her appeals several weeks
ago for $1 million. &QL;

AFTER BEATING PACKERS, VIKINGS TALK SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ While the Green Bay Packers spent Tuesday
morning recovering from the hangover of one of the worst losses in
the history of their franchise, the Minnesota Vikings were looking
ahead. They are not content with beating the Packers. They will not
be happy with winning the National Football Conference Central
crown.
</P>
<P>
   They want it all, and some on the team are not shy about
mentioning the ``S'' word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a Super Bowl team,'' said the team's new owner,
Red McCombs, in a quiet moment away from hugging Vikings players
and coaches after Monday night's 37-24 victory over Green Bay.
``Right now, you'd have to say there is not a better team in the
NFC. We played a great team, and it was total domination. We took
complete control of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota hammered the top-ranked defense in football for 442
yards passing, the most ever given up by the Packers. Quarterback
Randall Cunningham, who several years ago was out of football and
working in a quarry cutting granite, torched one of the best
secondaries in football with four touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   All those bombs were not just an impromptu game of catch between
Cunningham and the rookie wide receiver Randy Moss, who had 5
catches for 190 yards and 2 touchdowns. They were a crucial part of
Minnesota's game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive coordinator, Brian Billick, is one of the best in
the business. And he told Cunningham, who has 10 touchdowns and no
interceptions, that if he ever noticed the Packers using single
coverage on Moss, to throw the ball deep and let Moss leap for it.
Incredibly, Green Bay used man-to-man coverage a lot on the
6-foot-4-inch Moss. When the Packers did, Cunningham spotted it
immediately and threw the ball up for grabs. Moss would come down
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Billick believes that if you throw 10 deep balls to Moss, he
will catch 9 if he is working against single coverage and catch 7
if he is double-teamed. To Billick, Moss is Michael Jordan and
Cunningham is a point guard who lobs an alley-oop for the dunk.
Most of the time, Jordan will make that shot.
</P>
<P>
   Moss had a lot of big catches against Green Bay: 52 yards, 41
yards, 46 yards and 44 yards. A 75-yard catch for a touchdown was
negated by a holding penalty and another long pass to Moss was
dropped. That was his only mistake of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Vikings surprised that Moss, perhaps the best athlete
on the field, got so much single coverage? ``Not really,'' Cris
Carter said. ``We have three Pro Bowl receivers, which means to
really stop us you need three good cornerbacks. Most teams barely
have two. So I guess they figured that Randy was the weak link. I
guess they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green had another explanation. ``The
Packers use a lot of man-to-man, and teams can't change their style
in a matter of days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is also interesting about the Vikings is their brash
attitude as players who have had a chip on their shoulder all
season. In the locker room after the game, they chastised members
of the Minnesota news media for picking the Packers to win.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a player to say ``I told you so'' after a
big victory when some members of the news media picked them to
lose. But the Vikings gloated a little extra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay is not ready to concede the division title _ or a
return trip to the Super Bowl _ just yet. The Packers are already
looking to the rematch at Minnesota on Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings won this one fair and square,'' Green Bay coach
Mike Holmgren said. ``But, like I said, we have another crack at
them.''

MILOSOVIC RESISTS HOLBROOKE'S EFFORTS TO EXTRACT CONCESSIONS  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The American envoy Richard Holbrooke has
so far failed to extract concessions on a pullback of troops or
return of refugees in Kosovo during talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, diplomats said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appeared to be resisting in the face of demands from
Washington that he comply with a U.N. Security Council resolution,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader maintained, the diplomats said, that the
Yugoslav Army and Serbian police forces are back at their bases in
Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia, where a conflict
between ethnic Albanian separatists and Milosevic's forces has been
under way for six months.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time there were signs that the nature of Holbrooke's
mission had changed from giving Milosovic a stern message that he
must comply with the resolution to starting a round of negotiations
of the kind that helped bring an end to the ethnic conflict in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night American officials said it was possible that
Holbrooke might stay in Belgrade Wednesday, lengthening his visit
beyond the original timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said Monday that he had not set a precise deadline for
Milosevic's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The measures in the Security Council resolution, which
Washington says Milosevic has failed to meet, center on a pullback
of Serbian forces, encouragement to 250,000 refugees to return to
their homes and the start of serious political talks on the future
status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appeared to be playing for time and calculating that
the longer the sessions with Holbrooke go on, the more difficult it
will be for NATO to intervene, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many possibilities of delay _ Milosevic can say
I'm pulling back, I'm discussing _ and that makes it more difficult
for NATO,'' a Western diplomat said. ``My guess is that Milosevic
will buy time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also using a threatened NATO attack to consolidate
support among Serbs. The state-controlled Serbian television said
Tuesday night that in contrast to the ``aggression'' from the West,
Milosevic was in favor of a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating Washington's hard line with Milosevic is
the valuable support he won from Russia, a traditional ally of
Serbia, which makes up the dominant portion of Yugoslavia. Moscow
announced Tuesday that it would veto any Security Council
resolution approving air strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Western diplomats said Tuesday, Holbrooke's diplomatic
task is becoming less to do with what is going on in Kosovo than
the credibility of NATO's military threats and its willingness to
carry them out after strong pronouncements. Washington also has to
assess if it wants to go ahead and punish Milosevic with air
strikes in the face of Russian opposition, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke returned to Belgrade Tuesday night after a quick visit
to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. There he met with ethnic
Albanian political leaders and members of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission, who include American, European Union and Russian
military experts.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he had heard nothing good from the experts, even
though the mission's daily written reports over the last five days
have given details of Serbian withdrawals and a sharp reduction in
attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Yugoslav military is far less visible in Kosovo
than it was a week ago, NATO military officers say it is in a
position to unleash tanks and artillery at short notice. In his
talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke is trying to get him to pull more
troops out of Kosovo and to have those troops that remain in Kosovo
more closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Also under discussion is a political plan for Kosovo, drafted by
the State Department with input from the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians, that calls for broad autonomy for the province.
Milosevic scrapped that autonomy in 1989 and has since kept the
ethnic Albanian population, which outnumbers Serbs nine to one,
under the authoritarian rule of the Serb police. Ethnic Albanian
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army are fighting to make
Kosovo independent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees said Tuesday that an
estimated 50,000 of more than 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees had
returned home in the week since the fighting quieted.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the agency in Pristina, Fernando del Mundo,
stressed that there were still tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees camped outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   These people whose homes had been burned by Serb forces during
the tank and artillery offensive ordered by Milosevic to quell
separatist guerrillas were still too scared to return their
villages because of the Serb police, Del Mundo said.

`THE CIRCLE HAMLET': TO BE, OR WHATEVER, IN A SHAKESPEAREAN
FRACAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The aim of the new theater company Public Domain in
its first production, ``The Circle Hamlet,'' is to sharply focus
the attention of the actors, and thus of the audience, on the words
of the play, a slightly trimmed version of Shakespeare's
``Hamlet,'' with occasional variations of familiar lines and
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   One device it uses is seating the audience in a single row
around and only a few inches from a large rectangular stage raised
only inches above the floor. Taking viewers that close to the
action _ in effect putting them onstage _ certainly concentrates
attention. But does it focus the mind on the play?
</P>
<P>
   It is notorious that the people at greatest risk of losing sight
of the whole play during a performance are members of the cast.
There are times during this performance when for the audience the
play simply disappears among the details.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is lost in manipulations of the text by Derek Lucci,
one of the two directors, who also takes the title role. Most
annoying is his assignment of the last lines to Hamlet's friend
Horatio rather than to Fortinbras, the claimant to the Danish
throne. This effectively obliterates the political framework of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   In this conception, ``Hamlet'' is very much a man's story. M.J.
Karmi's Gertrude has sufficient strength of personality to be a
force in the action, but in all the frantic tussle called for by
the directors she is all but shoved into the wings. Jenni Blong
does not project the emotional power needed to make Ophelia a
tragic figure, and none of the characters around her demonstrate
much affection for her: not her father, not her brother and
certainly not Hamlet; when he says after her death, ``I loved
her,'' no one watching will be naive enough to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Lucci's Hamlet is a whirlwind. There is not a moment's
introspection in him. In his mouth ``To be, or not to be'' could be
a joke in a ``Seinfeld'' episode. As he dashes around the stage
threatening the king, terrifying his mother, taunting courtiers and
bullying Polonius, he seems to spin other characters around him in
a funnel cloud. On the other hand, Louis Vuolo as the ghost is a
real player _ at last. Although some characters cannot see him, he
is not the shadow on the parapet of most productions; he is often
the engine of the relentless movement of the play and a threatening
presence to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Next to this Hamlet, King Claudius (Joe Muzikar) looks quite
dignified. You don't like what he has done, but you doubt it is
reason enough for regicide. Muzikar has picked up some of the
brooding indecision Lucci shed from Hamlet, so his king is a bit
puzzling, but very interesting. And Christopher George as Laertes
is a worthy foe for Lucci's Hamlet; he is out to get him from the
beginning, and when the two are dying he seems deeply satisfied to
know he is not going alone.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that while this company emphasizes the text,
10 of the 11 actors betray no mastery of the cadence or meters of
Shakespeare's verse. That failure is pointed up by the 11th person,
who is both Polonius and the gravedigger, David Saire. He creates
two warm, delightful characters. Saire, who was trained in British
theater and had a London stage career, possesses a repertory of
long-proven theatrical gestures and poses that grab audiences _
something the others in this cast lack _ but much of his
distinctive presence is shaped by his knowledge of how to speak
Shakespeare's lines. It makes a lot of difference.

LIBERAL AND GOP GROUPS LAUNCH ADS FOCUSING ON ISSUES, NOT SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Party organizations and a liberal
advocacy group Tuesday unveiled television advertising campaigns
that seek to energize voters by emphasizing issues and not the
White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee and the
Republican National Committee began broadcasting a 30-second
advertisement in about 40 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The spot is intended to counter assertions by Democrats that
Republicans in Congress have not accomplished much. In the
commercial, the narrator says over shots of a family at breakfast
that ``Republicans are reaching out to find solutions to the
problems families face.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new advertisement, the committee Tuesday
began broadcasting 15 commercials specific to House districts.
Those advertisements either raise questions about Democratic
opponents or discuss issues like family values.
</P>
<P>
   Another nationwide campaign was opened Tuesday by People for the
American Way, a liberal group. Its advertisement features Carole
Shields, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   As her 4-year-old grandson, Donny, sits in her lap, Ms. Shields
says: ``Let's move on. That's what the American people are saying
loud and clear. But some in Washington are listening to the
religious right, not the people.'' Small photographs appear on the
screen of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Christian Coalition founder
Pat Robertson and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   While both groups' 30-second commercials are intended to
embolden voters on opposite parts of the political spectrum, they
are similar in reflecting a sense in both parties that President
Clinton's troubles may not be enough in themselves to motivate
people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Republican Congressional Committee, officials
said their polling had shown that voters had grown weary of hearing
about the White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to turn on your TV these days without seeing
something about the president,'' said Todd Harris, a spokesman for
the congressional committee. ``We didn't need to use our national
advertising campaign to pile on top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While voters may not want to hear more about the scandal, Harris
said, ``it doesn't mean they want it swept under the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the Republican
congressional committee, acknowledged the risk of a backlash
against Republicans. ``If we came out as a national campaign, and
just came out against the president,'' Linder said, ``I think it
would be viewed as overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said the budget for the campaign begun
Tuesday was about $7 million and was part of what Republicans said
was an overall $25 million advertising drive to help House
candidates. A month ago, Linder said the goal for the campaign was
$37 million. Tuesday, party officials insisted that they did not
need to spend as much as initially planned but did not explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said, ``The NRCC is perpetually inflating their
electoral prospects _ and now they have to admit they've been
inflating their issue-ad budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican committee's overall advertising budget
dwarfs the amount Sallick's committee is expected to spend on
advertising this year, which is roughly $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Taking issue with the message in the Republican commercials,
Sallick asserted, ``This has been a do-nothing Congress that had
failed to act on health reform and failed to improve public
education and failed to shore up Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   When People for the American Way disclosed its advertising plans
last week, it drew attacks from Democratic officials who feared
that the committee was competing within the party for tight
advertising money. But the group went ahead with its advertising
plans, although officials there indicated that it might not have
been as ambitious as initially planned. The budget for the first
week is nearly $1 million, according to the group.

 &HT;    Vols' starting lineup sprinkled with players from Georgia
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE _ Cosey Coleman remembers his first meeting with
Rodney Garner, the man who would convince him to sign with
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a Parade All-American from Atlanta's Southwest DeKalb
High, told every recruiter who walked in his door (and there were a
lot of them) that he wanted to play defensive tackle in college.
</P>
<P>
   Garner did something recruiters rarely do: He told the prospect
he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Garner looked Coleman in the eye and told the 6-foot-5,
315-pounder that his professional football future was as an
offensive linemen. ``A good defensive tackle in the NFL makes
$200,000 per year,'' Garner told him. ``A good offensive left
tackle makes $2 million a year. Which would you rather be?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Garner underestimated the earning power of starting
defensive tackles (their average salary in the NFL is about $1
million a year), Coleman saw the light. And after a strong
flirtation with North Carolina, Coleman decided he would rather be
at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with mixed emotions that Coleman, now an All-SEC
candidate on the Volunteer offensive line, returns to his native
state Saturday when Tennessee meets Georgia at Sanford Stadium.
There will be lots of family and friends to greet him and wish him
well. That will be fun, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garner, the man who originally led him to Tennessee, will be
on the other side of the field. Last January, he left Tennessee to
become Georgia's defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different, seeing Coach Garner over there,''
Coleman said. ``But I've got a job to do. There was a reason he
recruited me to come to Tennessee. I want to remind him that he
made a good decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Tennessee starters, both sophomores, were also
recruited out of Georgia by Garner to play for the Vols in 1997.
Running back Jamal Lewis of Douglass High in Atlanta was a freshman
All-American last season after rushing for 1,364 yards. Defensive
back Deon Grant of Augusta's Josey High moved into the starting
lineup this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is out for the season with a knee injury. But Grant, 6-3,
190, is considered one of the rising young stars in the SEC. He is
second on the team in tackles with 29 and made one of the most
athletic plays of the year on Sept. 19 with a one-handed
interception in the 20-17 overtime win over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coleman, Grant said he is looking forward to coming home on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends who are coming to the game and there
are a lot of guys I know on the Georgia team,'' Grant said. ``Any
time you leave some place and then go back, you want to show people
that you can do the job. I'm really excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The three sophomores are among six Georgians listed on
Tennessee's starting 22 players. Senior Mercedes Hamilton of Burke
County, Ga. will start at one of the guards, and Griffin, Ga.'s
Fred White and Steve Johnson of Powder Springs, Ga. join Grant in
the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   All of the players said this week that they have had this date
circled on their calendar for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is I can't get enough tickets,'' said White, who
has over 30 requests from friends and family members. ``It's going
to be like a big family reunion out there on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Georgians make up almost one-third of Tennessee's
starting lineup is a sore point with many Bulldog fans. They
believe that the key to Georgia's future success is being able to
keep this kind of blue-chip talent from leaving home. It is just
one reason head coach Jim Donnan hired Garner away from Tennessee
and made him recruiting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   That Georgians play significant roles on the Tennessee football
team is nothing new. Georgia has long been a fertile recruiting
ground for the Vols, who have been able to sign All-Americans like
Chip Kell, Willie Gault, Dale Carter, Antoine Davis and Chuck Smith
out of the Peach State.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, games like Saturday's between Georgia and
Tennessee, have an impact on impressionable recruits. That's just
another reason the stakes are so high. Georgia plans to invite
approximately 100 recruits to Saturday's game and for a player
looking at both Tennessee and Georgia, the winner has a slight
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this can always have some kind of impact on
recruiting,'' said Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer. ``We recruit all
of the contiguous states and when you play those teams it is a
factor. You don't worry about it, but it is part of the process.''

 &HT;    Tech secondary excited about challenge of lightening bolt Holt
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when Georgia Tech was enjoying a nice little run
of playing solid pass defense, here comes Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's senior receiver is playing like he's one of the
best in the country. He's second in the nation averaging 148.5
yards receiving yards per game and ninth averaging 7.3 receptions
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Against Ohio University in the season opener, Holt had a 62-yard
touchdown catch and followed the next week with a 63-yard TD catch
and a 68-yard punt return TD in the upset win over Florida State.
Against Baylor, he had an 80-yard touchdown catch and finally
against Syracuse, the Orangemen ``stopped'' him - holding him to
161 yards receiving and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Tech secondary seems excited about the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about that (Monday),'' cornerback Jamara Clark
said. ``This is the game you wait for, against one of the best
receivers in the nation. This is the chance you've got to show how
good you are and what Georgia Tech is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play a Torry Holt every week. It would make me a
better player. It would make us a better defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech players and coaches are not divulging any plans they have
for stopping No. 81. And they may not have any.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been covering receivers pretty good, so why change?''
free safety Travares Tillman said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mix of man and zone coverages, Tech has limited its
opponents to 170 yards passing per game. That's after giving up an
average of 296.3 per game last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach George O'Leary has said no one in the country can cover
Holt man-for-man, so don't expect to see Tech defensive backs left
alone much to deal with Holt. But the Yellow Jackets also know that
too much emphasis on Holt and receivers Chris Coleman or Eric Leak
can beat you too.
</P>
<P>
   Clark (5-8, 170) and Jason Bostic (5-9, 181) are both giving up
size to Holt (6-2, 188), but they will rely on their improved
technique under defensive coordinator Randy Edsall's tutelage,
decent speed and help from their safeties to stay with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know where (Holt) is in the sets and make sure
your players understand what's going on,'' O'Leary said. ``He's
going to get his plays, just like any good receiver. You just can't
give up and lot of big chunk plays. That's what he's gotten in
every game I've seen on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing where to find Holt in a set should be easy enough to
pick up. As for what kind of routes Tech is expecting from Holt?
Deep ones. With his 29 catches for 594 yards and four touchdowns,
Holt is averaging 20.5 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   He has got all the tools, with speed, size, great hands and
smarts. But his biggest advantage is his speed. Don't give him a
big enough cushion and he'll blow by defenders. Give him too big a
cushion he'll cut a crossing route in front of the secondary and
beat everybody for a big gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first few steps are really fast, so it's hard to press
him,'' Tillman said. ``He's a Peter Warrick type receiver.
Explosive, that's a word for him, explosive.''

 &HT;    Watson battles distractions
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Watson, 49, has been on a mental roller coaster in
1998. At his high point, Watson won the Colonial Invitational May
24, renewing thoughts of pushing back a move to the Senior Tour
when he turns 50 next September. Contrast that with a missed cut at
the PGA in August _ his fifth straight in a major. Not what you
would expect, even at 49, from a player with five British Open
wins, two Masters and a U.S. Open. Last week before missing the cut
at Callaway Gardens, Ga., Watson admitted that going through a
divorce this year from his wife of 23 years, Linda, has been ``a
huge distraction.'' Watson also has quit drinking for unexplained
reasons. ``Life's full of ups and downs,'' he said. ``You just have
to hope it goes back up again.'' Cementing his position in the Tour
Championship would help, but Watson is 27th on the money list and
might need one more decent check to be safe. He ``very much'' wants
to make the 1999 Ryder Cup team that plays Europe at The Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., next September. Watson discovered
recently that he's been aiming too far left on his putting ``for
probably much of my career'' _ as much as three inches off line on
a putt of eight feet.

   Duval: 'Union' misleading players
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say enthusiasm for the proposed ``Tournament
Players Association'' organized by Larry Rinker, Mark Brooks and
Danny Edwards is muted. They so far appear to be a bunch of
``have-nots'' trying to capitalize on the ``haves.'' At this stage,
it doesn't appear the TPA will be getting a $1,000 dues check from
leading money winner David Duval, who feels the group is misleading
the public and the players. ``I think it's misleading to say they
don't want an adversary role when they hire a counsel (Leonard
Decof, who successfully represented Ping in its ``square grooves''
suit against the PGA) who has had an adversarial role in the
past.'' For what it's worth, Duval, a member of the 16-man Player
Advisory Council, which acts as a representative arm beyond the
four players on the PGA Tour Policy Board, said, ``None of those
three players has come to me on the PAC this year with a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Had Buick Challenge winner Steve Elkington gone into a playoff
with Bill Glasson Sunday, considering their laundry list of medical
problems, they would have needed an ambulance to follow them.
Elkington even played with a new injury, having cut the palm of his
left hand while gardening the previous week. . . . Albany's Ed
Everett finished ninth in his defense at the Senior Club
Professional Championship at Ibis Golf and Country Club in West
Palm Beach, Fla., five shots behind winner Wes Smith of Cooper
City, Fla. . . . The LPGA has added a tournament in Austin, Texas,
The Phillips Invitational Honoring Harvey Penick, starting next May
20-23.

 &HT;    Fall brings nervousness to many fringe golfers
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apologies officially are extended to all those who
play golf solely for the love of the game. At this time of the year
in professional golf, it is about cold, hard cash and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the bubble'' is the operative phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Players are on the bubble _ particularly the ``top 125 bubble''
_ when they don't know if next year they will be playing golf on
the PGA Tour or on their home computer. Those finishing among the
top 125 moneywinners in three weeks gain fully exempt status for
1999 events. Those without even limited status might head for the
dreaded PGA Tour Qualifying School, which is sponsored by Mylanta,
Goody's Headache Powders and the National Shock Therapy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Even recent PGA Tour event winners such as D.A. Weibring, the
1996 Greater Hartford Open winner, are in the sweaty palms portion
of the season. At 158th with $143,504 earned, Weibring needs a good
week of, say, $60,000 just to reach the bubble area of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up against the wall,'' Weibring was saying at Callaway
Gardens Sunday after a final-round 74 allowed only a tie for 27th
and $11,100. ``It probably hurts my pride more than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one spot higher, at 157th, is Columbus, Ga. native Hugh
Royer, who also needs a fast finish to avoid Q-School. Fairly
prominent names are teetering on the edge such as David Ogrin
(129th), Clarence Rose (134th), Chris Smith (137th) and former
Masters champion Sandy Lyle (140th). Veteran Blaine McAllister, who
needed Q-School last year to get exempt, is 121st, but must earn
enough now to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Though more of a bonus bubble and without the financial
ramifications, there's also one for the top 30, which allows entry
into the Tour Championship in four weeks at Atlanta's East Lake
Golf Club. Just making the top 30 earns a minimum check of $64,000
at East Lake. The winner pockets $720,000; the runner-up $432,000.
Third at the $4 million tournament gets $276,000 _ a bigger check
than many that accompany trophies during the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about it,'' Andrew Magee, No. 29,
said at the Buick Challenge _ and that was before he missed the cut
and dropped two spots. ``No, I don't feel safe at all.''
</P>
<P>
   East Lake members Stewart Cink (32nd) and Billy Andrade (42nd)
have different tasks. Cink needs one relatively high finish, but
Andrade probably needs two in the top three.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior PGA Tour's exempt list is the toughest to crack in
all of golf. Unlike the PGA Tour, where a win brings two years of
eligibility, the Senior Tour allows only a one-year pass. A finish
among the top 31 moneywinners is needed to gain full playing
privileges for 1999. The LPGA'S exempt list already is finalized,
with players securing full status through a finish in the top 90.
The Nike Tour's top 15 moneywinners earn PGA Tour cards for 1999,
so that puts Savannah's Gene Sauers on the spot. He's 18th and just
over $6,000 from the cutoff point. Casey Martin is 26th, about
$22,000 out, and in need of a win.

 &HT;    Petit Le Mans notebook
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unlike most major races in the Atlanta area,
Saturday's Petit Le Mans field will feature four types of cars
rather than one.
</P>
<P>
   They are: World Sports Car; Le Mans Prototype; Grand Touring 1
(GT1) and Grand Touring 2 (GT2).
</P>
<P>
   World Sports Cars are open-cockpit, closed-wheel prototypes with
engines from Oldsmobile, Ferrari, Ford, Chevrolet, Mazda and BMW,
with a top speed of 180 mph. Le Mans Prototypes are two-seaters
with open cockpits. No minimum production is required.
</P>
<P>
   GT1s are production-based, tube-frame cars with engines over 3
liters. Models include Panoz Ford, Porsche, Olds Aurora, Dodge
Viper, Mustang and Camaro with a top Speed of 175 mph.
</P>
<P>
   GT2s are stock-based unibody cars with turbo-charged or normally
aspirated engines based on an equivalency formula. GT2 engines are
up to 4 liters and non-turbo models are up to 8 liters. Porsche 911
GT2s and Dodge Viper GT2s are included in this class. Top speed is
170 mph.
</P>
<P>
   All will be at Lenox Square in Atlanta today, from 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m., undergoing ``scrutineering,'' or inspection. In the
tradition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, scrutineering is done in
public rather than a garage area in order for fans to see the cars
and meet the drivers. The winning car from this year's 24 Hours of
Le Mans, the No. 26 Porsche 911 works car to be driven by Yannick
Dalmas, Le Mans winner Allan McNish and Uwe Alzen, is scheduled for
inspection at 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   today.
</P>
<P>
   Local connections
</P>
<P>
   In an event named after a race in France, metro Atlantans might
draw a blank about which car to cheer for in Saturday's
1,000-mile/10-hour Petit Le Mans, but there are some cars with
Atlanta connections in the field. First, there are the entries by
Team Panoz _ No. 4 GT1 driver by David Brabham, Scott Pruett and
Andy Wallace; No. 5 GT1 driven by Eric Bernard, Johnny O'Connell
and Jamie Davies; and the No. 07 Panoz hybrid GT1 driven by John
Nielsen, Doc Bundy of Gainesville, Ga. and Christophe Tinseau. In
the World Sports Car field, the No. 7 Ferrari is co-sponsored by
Atlanta-based Lease Plan; the No. 63 Mazda Kudzu was built and will
be driven by Atlantan Jim Downing; the No. 39 Carolina Turkey
Ford/R&AMP;S Mk III will be driven by David Murry of Atlanta; the No.
88 Ferrari 333 SP will be driven by Anthony Lazzaro of Atlanta; and
the No. 8 GT2-SC Porsche 968 Turbo RS will be driven Atlantans Jeff
Purner and Joe Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket update
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 advance tickets have been sold, but no one at Road
Atlanta is worried, said spokesperson Claudette Ashman. ``It's rare
that we get more than 3 percent advance sales,'' she said. Another
sign that something is happening in the area is that all lodging
close to the track _ from Commerce, Ga. southward _ is sold out on
Oct. 10. Some could be because of another event, the
Georgia-Tennessee game. To order tickets or for race information,
call 1-800-849-7223. . . . BellSouth Mobility will distribute
coupons for free paddock passes, a $20 value, at its Atlanta-area
stores. The coupons can be redeemed for a paddock pass at the Road
Atlanta gate with the purchase of a four-day or Saturday-Sunday
ticket.

 &HT;    Woman finds herself in hot water with town
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, England _ A few weeks ago, a divorced mother of three
named June Wilson _ born in the proud old city of Norwich _ wrote a
letter to a local newspaper complaining that her city and the whole
rural county of Norfolk were ``very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   A TV personality had been making Norfolk jokes again, and the
locals had been rising to their shire's defense. Now up popped
Wilson, a local herself who lives on Magpie Road, agreeing with the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norwich is very boring,'' she wrote to the tabloid Evening
News, ``and the great majority of Norfolk people are also very
boring.'' She added that they were backward, rude and apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Like vast stretches of America, Norfolk has been the target of
such pokes for years. In the 18th century Horace Walpole called the
people of Norfolk ``roast beef in human form.'' Londoners sometimes
call the locals ``carrot crunchers'' and other names suggestive of
turnpike stupidity. And a Len Deighton novel once characterized
East Anglia (an old historic zone bigger than Norfolk but centered
here) as ``the lost continent of Great Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   But reaction to Wilson's letter was loud and swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had endless phone calls, though many are from people who
support me,'' said Wilson, 49. ``And I've had these short,
anonymous letters telling me to go back from whence I came. But of
course I'm from here!''
</P>
<P>
   One piece of hate mail seemed threatening enough that Wilson
called the police. They in turn announced firmly that she had a
right to her opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wilson began showing up on TV. And by early last week a few
national British papers were making the story sound as though the
Salman Rushdie tragedy were being replayed as grim rural farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, no, no,'' Wilson said when asked about the threats.
``The (London) Telegraph went rather over the top with the story. I
didn't make a formal complaint, and I didn't end up with
bodyguards. I merely informed the police. The whole thing just got
blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's sticking to her guns on the subject of Norfolk. She
lived in Germany five years, in South Carolina for six months (her
ex-husband was in the military there) and in California six months.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Norfolk is one of England's fastest-growing counties, but
it was hard for Wilson to come home after years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English are very reserved, and Norfolk people are even
worse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What's so extra-boring about Norfolk or the city of Norwich, a
little more than 100 miles north of London?
</P>
<P>
   ``People move here from London, which is a ratrace, and they
think the pace here is perfect. But it's like a tortoise. It has
two speeds, slow and stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Norfolk's recreational distinctions probably do leave
some people cold while enthralling others: North Sea beaches, a
huge lavender farm, a narrow-gauge railway, birdwatching and a
ranch for retired horses. The web of streets that twist away from
the great Norman castle in the heart of Norwich (which rhymes with
porridge) appears to be very quiet at night, though, in the wee
hours, rowdy youths sometimes howl as they leave the pop music
clubs. And the once-beautiful village of Wroxham, on the River
Bure, has learned to attract tourists by selling plastic fast food.
</P>
<P>
   But Norfolk is home to beautiful villages, old pubs, countless
medieval churches built of fist-sized pieces of flint and rolling
green farmland.
</P>
<P>
   In typical British style, history suffuses the place: In the
first century A.D., for example, a Celtic warrior-queen named
Boudicca swept out of Norfolk with her army, torched London, killed
tens of thousands of Romans _ and lost. Lord Nelson (the naval
hero), Thomas Browne (the essayist), Dame Julian of Norwich (the
medieval mystic), the artists John Crome, John Sell Cotman and
others of the Norwich School, Robert Walpole (Britain's first prime
minister), Abraham Lincoln's ancestors . . . the list of Norfolk's
famous folk is long.
</P>
<P>
   And a large number of non-boring women also are associated with
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Not just the warrior-queen or medieval mystics, not just Anne
Boleyn and Katharine Howard (two of Henry VIII's wives), but also
Anna Sewall (who wrote ``Black Beauty''), Fanny Burney (a novelist
friend of Samuel Johnson), Edith Cavell (a World War I nurse in
Belgium executed by the Germans for helping British soldiers escape
imprisonment) and other social reformers, artists and free spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe June Wilson is another. In any case, the bitterness of her
fight got a bit sweeter late last week when her most threatening
correspondent wrote a second anonymous letter to apologize. She'd
been joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have certainly learnt my lesson,'' the deflated fatwa-writer
of Norwich wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And the police say they hope the matter will now be closed.

2 BIG ON-LINE MUSIC STORES SAID TO BE DISCUSSING MERGER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first big combination of Internet retailers, the two
biggest online music stores are in the final stages of negotiating
a merger.
</P>
<P>
   N2K, of New York, and CD Now of Jenkintown, Pa., are preparing
to merge, people involved in the negotiations said Tuesday. The
deal will be structured as a merger of equals, with management
shared between the two companies, they said, declining to discuss
the financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies were once the darlings of Internet investors, but
in recent weeks their stocks have fallen not only below their highs
but well below their initial offering prices. CD Now's stock ended
at $7.9375 Tuesday, up 43.75 cents, giving it a market
capitalization of $139 million. N2K's stock closed at $4.50, down
25 cents, giving it a market capitalization of $64 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are both online music stores, the two companies
are very different in terms of history and style.
</P>
<P>
   N2K was founded by Larry Rosen and David Grusin, music industry
veterans who founded the GRP record label. The company has
emphasized deep content and information about music through various
sites devoted to genres such as Rocktropolis and Jazz Central
Station, as well as sites devoted to individual artists like
Leonard Bernstein. All of these sites linked to Music Boulevard,
its online store. Playing off the experience of its founders, N2K
had started a record label as preparation for the day when music
can be downloaded directly to users, bypassing CD manufacturing
altogether. But recently, the company pulled back from this
business, halted the signing of new artists and laid off some
staff.
</P>
<P>
   CD Now was founded by Jason and Mathew Olim, 29-year-old twins.
Its business has been much more streamlined, emphasizing a simple
fast way to buy music. Increasingly, it has added tools to help
users find music they like by showing them choices of other people
who have similar tastes.
</P>
<P>
   CD Now has been much more aggressive in signing up
``affiliates'' _ that is, other web sites about music _ often run
by fans, that refer surfers to their store in return for a
commission. CD Now has 100,000 affiliates, while N2K has about
7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies offer essentially the same stock because they
both use the same wholesale distribution firm, Valley Record
Distributors, to warehouse the CD's and ship them to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   CD Now is bigger with sales of $11 million in the last quarter.
N2K had sales of $10 million, but it is growing faster. CD Now said
it has 569,000 customers and N2K said it has 522,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two companies has raised money in public stock
offerings and spent much of it to secure the rights to be the

   Combined, the two companies would have about 45 percent of the
online music market, according to industry estimates. One important
source of competition is Amazon.com, the pioneering online

   Advisers to the transaction do not expect any antitrust problems

 &HT;    Keys to Braves wins, losses
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Braves will win if...
</P>
<P>
   _ John Smoltz keeps it going. The Cubs saw him at his worst on
May 23 _ two innings, two runs in a no-decision _ the day before
Smoltz hit the DL the second time. Since then, he has gone 13-2
with some of the most effective work of his career. Smoltz has a
15-4 career record against the Cubs, and if there is a Game 4,
Smoltz has a career 2.73 ERA at Wrigley Field. The Cubs haven't
beaten him the last 10 times they've faced him, dating to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves can keep the Cubs out of the big inning. When it
absolutely needs to score, Chicago has had trouble manufacturing
runs, which favors Atlanta in a close game. The Cubs are ranked
11th in the league in sacrifice flies, 11th in sacrifice bunts and
15th in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta's bullpen can maintain its late-season surge. While
the Braves were finishing with a 14-2 run, the relievers performed
about as well as they have all season. The bullpen allowed only
nine runs in its last 44 2/3 innings (1.81 ERA), and five of those
runs came in one inning, on Sept. 13 against Florida. Braves
relievers struck out 40 batters in the last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs maintain their Atlanta profile. Chicago has not fared
well in Georgia in recent years, going 7-17 the last four seasons.
Turner Field had posed a particular hurdle. The Cubs lost nine of
their first 10 games at the Braves' new home, until they swept a
two-game series July 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greg Maddux maintains his mastery over his former employer.
Since leaving the Cubs after winning the 1992 Cy Young award,
Maddux is 7-1 against Chicago. The only defeat came in his last
start, on July 21. In 11 career starts against his old team, Maddux
has given up only 16 earned runs in 84 1/3 innings (1.71 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Braves will lose if....
</P>
<P>
   _ They allow the Cubs to hammer them as they did all summer.
Chicago's .271 team average was tied with Colorado's for the
highest against Atlanta pitching this year. The 50 runs were the
second-most scored against the Braves. The Cubs also homered 11
times off Atlanta, and that was with Sammy Sosa sitting out two
games with a bad hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs remain patient at the plate. Chicago is ranked sixth
in the NL in walks, but the team was far better than that against
the Braves. No one walked more against Atlanta than the Cubs' 36
times, which worked out to once every 3.9 innings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary Gaetti realizes that it's October. The veteran third
baseman has a .192 career average (15-for-78) against the Braves
since coming to the National League three years ago. But in the
1996 postseason, while with St. Louis, he hit .292 against the
Braves in the NLCS, including an eighth-inning grand slam in Game 2
off Maddux at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium that broke open an 8-3
Cardinals victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Tapani continues to baffle Atlanta. Though he has a
career 4.50 ERA against the Braves, he has two wins in three starts
against them this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ They don't get improved performances from second baseman Tony
Graffanino and right fielder Michael Tucker. Both have struggled
much of the year and finished hitting a combined 57 points below
their career averages. But both have had excellent years against
Chicago: Graffanino is hitting .500 and Tucker .321 with three
doubles, a triple and eight walks.

 &HT;    Braves by position
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIRST BASE/Andres Galarraga
</P>
<P>
   The Braves managed to get through the first round without an RBI
from their most productive hitter. Andres Galarraga has one homer
dating back to Sept. 7, which means two things: This is a lengthy
power slide, and it won't last forever. He loves to face Andy
Ashby, owning a .417 career average with four homers against him.

<P>
   SECOND BASE/Keith Lockhart
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart went into the LDS as Atlanta's chief question
mark and came out the club's top hitter. His right hamstring made
it through a 40-degree night at Wrigley. Lockhart now has a .353
career postseason average. Mark Lemke, whom Lockhart replaced,
owned .273 postseason average.

<P>
   THIRD BASE/Chipper Jones
</P>
<P>
   One of the heroes of Game 2 of the LDS when his RBI single in
the 10th won the game, Chipper Jones had a superb season (.394)
against the Padres with six extra-base hits. How he stacks up
offensively against Padres' third baseman Ken Caminiti can
determine where this NLCS is headed.

<P>
   SHORTSTOP/Walt Weiss
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Walt Weiss's sore quadriceps is functioning at
nearly 100 percent. The bad news: His hitting has shown some rust
accumulated during an idle September. His .154 LDS on-base
percentage was some 230 points below his season average. Will Ozzie
Guillen get a start against a Padres right-hander?

<P>
   LEFT FIELD/Ryan Klesko
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko had as many RBIs in one swing against the Cubs with
his Game 1 grand slam than he did in his last 24 at-bats of the
season. The Braves needed more production out of the position and,
including pinch-hitter Gerald Williams' RBI single in Game 3, the
team got it. Klesko has a .333 career average against Ashby.

<P>
   CENTER FIELD/Andruw Jones
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a postseason this far. This is the same player who
went for extra bases 11 times in his last 22 regular season hits
while stealing four bases. Andruw Jones did draw three walks in 13
plate appearances against the Cubs, commendable work for a player
who struck out 129 times this season.

</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD/Michael Tucker
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker had just one single after his second-inning
two-run homer got Game 1 off to the Braves' advantage. But that
shot off Mark Clark might well have been Tucker's most important
swing of the second half. This is the same right fielder who
entered the month with a career .125 postseason average.

<P>
   1998 .244 101 13 46 8
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER/Javy Lopez
</P>
<P>
   They might not have hit for average, but Braves catchers mauled
Chicago, Javy Lopez and Eddie Perez teaming for two homers and five
of Atlanta's 14 RBI in the LDS. The flip side is both were mauled
by the Padres during the regular season, hitting a combined .091
(3-for-33) against San Diego pitching.

<P>
   BENCH
</P>
<P>
   Braves reserves hit .286 (2-for-7) against the Cubs, and that's
with .364 pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn going 0-for-2. With
left-hander Sterling Hitchcock slated for Game 3, Atlanta will use
its right-handed platoon for the first time this month Saturday in
San Diego. Gerald Williams hit .400 against the Padres this season.

<P>
   GM.1 STARTER/John Smoltz
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz's last victory gave him a record 11 in the
postseason, matching the Cubs' October total for the last 80 years.
He continues to pitch as well as he ever has and might have shut
out the Cubs in LDS Game 1 except for a random Tyler Houston homer
in the seventh. He is 8-0 against the Padres in his last 10 starts.

</P>
<P>
   GM. 2 STARTER/Tom Glavine
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine allowed three hits in seven innings against the Cubs
and took a no-hitter into the sixth. He also struck out eight, a
measure of how well he has located the ball. In his last 21
innings, Glavine has struck an uncharacteristically high 19
batters. The Padres hit .157 against him this year.

</P>
<P>
   GM. 3 STARTER/Greg Maddux
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the LDS clinch game, Greg Maddux made a positive
response to critics who wondered how he frittered away his fifth Cy
Young with a losing second half. For his next trick, Maddux will
attempt to win in consecutive starts, something he did only once
after the break (Aug.18-23).
</P>
<P>
   Maddux/W-L/ERA/IP/BB/KO

</P>
<P>
   GM. 4 STARTER/Denny Neagle
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Denny Neagle should be pretty fresh, after being
limited to two starts the final month with some left shoulder
tendinitis. He will work Sunday's game at Qualcomm. Strange things
have befallen Neagle on the road. He is 7-8 away from home, despite
posting a 2.74 ERA, more than 1.7 runs lower than at The Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle/W-L/ERA/IP/BB/KO

   Atlanta relievers have now gone three postseason series without
allowing a run, a string of 17 innings. They were remarkable
effective against the Padres this season with a 1.37 ERA in 19 2/3
innings. At the same time, San Diego's vaunted bullpen accumulated
a 4.64 ERA against the Braves.

 &HT;    10 questions with Chipper Jones
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper Jones, who had the game-winning hit against
the Cubs in Game 2 of the division series, is playing in his fourth
postseason. The third-baseman, who is batting .385 in the NLCS,
wants redemption after a mistake at third and a base-running
blunder against the Marlins last year. In the regular season, Jones
had a career year with highs in home runs (34), games (160), hits
(188), runs (123) and average (.313).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you have to do to win the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think our pitchers are going to have to throw eight
shutouts (laughs). That will pretty much assure us of winning a
World Series. Certainly that's a tough task, but our pitching's
capable of shutting anybody out on any given night. And hopefully
our offense will squeeze out just enough runs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Going into the season, with so many different players, what
was your outlook?
</P>
<P>
   A: I thought if we kept everybody healthy, we'd be back in the
World Series. Obviously, the acquisitions of (Andres) Galarraga and
(Walt) Weiss are huge. You throw Galarraga into the middle of our
lineup with all our lefties, and all of sudden we 've got a pretty
versatile lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the high point of the season for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The game-winning hit against Chicago in Game 2 (of the
division series). Not often do you get a chance to come up in a
situation like that and do some damage, and then come through.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the low point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably three weeks before the season was over, and we lost
eight out of 10 and were really kind of dead in the water. We
weren't playing very well at all, but we've turned that around. You
always have doubts; you wonder if the guys are on the same page you
are, but luckily the higher-ups got together, we had a team meeting
and got everybody on the same page, and we've been playing great
since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is this team different from last year's?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we're a little closer as a team. The guys all pull
for each other. We're not family, but when we're in the clubhouse
and the dugout, we are family and the guys act like it. They show a
lot of love toward each other. They're the first ones to pat each
other on the back, and when somebody needs talking to, somebody
will talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How fired up are the Braves?
</P>
<P>
   A: We got pretty excited in the Chicago series. I thought we
matched their emotion pitch-for-pitch. When good things happened,
we got as excited as anybody. We're going to have to do that again.
This business-type attitude has not gotten the job done the last
couple of years, so we're going to have to pump it up a little. I
fully expect every time we do something great for guys to get up
off the bench. I think this team needs to thrive upon those
situations, to let off a little steam and once we do it, relax.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it more exciting in the postseason compared to last
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't say that. It's a situation where you go into every
postseason like it's your last, and that's the only way you can
play your best. If you go into a postseason nonchalant, relaxed,
you're going to get beat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this the kind of stuff you dreamed about as a kid, playing
in October?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think you start playing this game unless you have
some dreams of playing in October at baseball's highest level. It's
quite an honor to don one of these major league uniforms. The
competitor in all of us wants to be in these clutch situations in
October, vying for a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see Game 1 against the Padres, with Andy Ashby
pitching instead of Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ashby's been just as tough on us as Kevin has. Since I've
been in the big leagues, I don't ever remember this team beating
Ashby. He's been as quality a pitcher as Kevin Brown. We've just
got to be patient, go out and put the ball in play. Ashby is a lot
like Brown. The ball moves all over the place; he throws hard; he's
a tremendous competitor. He's as much a thorn in our side as
Brown's been.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have one eye on the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think any time you get a chance to watch the other team on
TV and do a little scouting yourself, you take advantage of it. Not
so much the Yankees as the Yankees and the Indians. This is a funny
game. You never know which one you're going to play.

 &HT;    Five keys to a Padres pennant
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Get into the Braves bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   This might be easier said than done, as John Smoltz, Tom Glavine
and Greg Maddux rank as the best 1, 2, 3 combination in the game.
Best hope might be that the Braves are put in position to pinch-hit
late in the game. Kerry Ligtenberg saved 30 games after Mark
Wohlers unraveled, but he and setup guys Rudy Seanez and John
Rocker are green and untested under the glare of post-season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ride the right arm of Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Padres would love to get Brown three starts, but
that's not likely to happen with him being held back to Game 2 .
Brown is the equal of Smoltz, a dominant right-hander who thrives
in the post-season _ twice beating the Braves in the '97 NLCS. The
rest of the staff feeds off his no-nonsense demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn up the offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   Against Houston pitching, journeyman Jim Leyritz was another Mr.
October in the NL Division Series, but his was the only bat that
consistently made any noise. The Padres struggled to score runs
late in the season and hit just .216 against the Astros. They
collectively hit an even worse .209 in the regular-season against
Atlanta pitching. So it's pivotal that the big bats of Tony Gwynn,
Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn come alive.
</P>
<P>
   4. Make the Braves play little ball.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego did just enough offensively in the Houston series,
while holding the league's top run producing team to a single run
in three games. The potent Killer B's (Craig Biggio, Derek Bell and
Jeff Bagwell) were transformed into fleas, hitting .146 with a solo
home run. The Atlanta sluggers need to be kept in the park to avoid
any big innings. The Padres will have to scrap for runs in hopes of
winning low-scoring ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   5. Be in position to turn it over to Trevor Hoffman.

   Hoffman nailed down 53 of 54 save opportunities during the
season, and that dominance makes him among the favorites for the Cy
Young award. Stat to remember: Padres were 85-0 when leading after
the eighth inning this season, 174-0 since July 24, 1996.

 &HT;    10 questions with Tony Gwynn
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tony Gwynn, the Padres' elder statesman, is one of the
greatest hitters of his generation _ .340 lifetime and winner of
eight batting titles. Gwynn discussed the NLCS playoffs after the
division series victory over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the NL Division Series against the Houston Astros?
</P>
<P>
   A: In that series, nobody gave us a chance. People wrote us off
because we weren't doing anything offensively. And here we are. We
like the fact that nobody thinks we're (good). And I think when
you're the underdog, you have a chance to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can the underdog prevail against the Atlanta Braves?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this series, we've got to be a lot better offensively.
Against their pitching staff, it's going to be tough. I just feel
we're going to find a way to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does advancing to the NLCS mean to the San Diego
franchise?
</P>
<P>
   A: When we went to spring training, I thought we had a chance.
Now, we've gotten out of the first round in the postseason, and I'm
thrilled for this organization, for this city. The organization has
gone out and gotten quality guys. Going into the championship
series is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your perspective on the Atlanta Braves pitching staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're the best in the business. (John) Smoltz is throwing
the ball extremely well. They all are. Going into the series, we
just have to find a way to get some runs on the board. I'm feeling
the heat already. But on the other side, our pitching isn't bad,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you get ready for Smoltz &AMP; Co.?
</P>
<P>
   A: With me, it'll be a lot easier. I didn't have that many
at-bats against Randy (Johnson), because he was over in the
American League. Against Atlanta, I've faced that staff so many
times. I've got a lot of video and notes that I can go back and
review. I've never faced them in the postseason, so it might be
different. But I said all year that the road (to the World Series)
goes through Atlanta. I know they're the team of the '90s. I know
they've been to the World Series. They have plenty of postseason
experience, but we can't worry about it now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As good as they pitch during the season, do you think the
Braves take it up a notch in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   A: They definitely pitch even better. They know how to focus, to
concentrate. You know in the postseason that there are not going to
be many balls middle of the plate. So you're going to have to hit
the pitcher's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What influence did Kevin Brown's ability and mental toughness
have on the Padres pitching staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kevin Brown is very intense on game day. The other guys on
the ballclub benefitted from seeing him do his thing. He and
(pitching coach) Dave Stewart have been a big influence on our
staff. I mean, our staff has been great all year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the American TV audience ready for the Padres?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't care if the people know about us. We're in prime time
now. There are only four teams left. I know people know about Kevin
Brown. They probably think of the rest of us as just West Coast
guys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had an un-Gwynn-like series against the Astros (.200,
3-for-15). What's that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: My timing is off right now. I'm just not seeing the ball
good. I'm out in front of balls. My discipline is just gone. So I
have a lot of work to do, because I want to be better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've had problems with an Achilles' and a thumb injury.
What's your physical status?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm good. We've had a couple days off, so I should be good
come Wednesday. What I like is there's no Astroturf.

NO, ANGELA, LIFE ISN'T FAIR, EVEN YOUR SO-CALLED KIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one said as much, but ``My So-Called Life'' was probably done
for from the beginning. ``The first sign of trouble was the
reception the network gave the pilot when we turned it in,''
recalled Marshall Herskovitz, one of its producers. ``Very mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   In that initial episode, in 1994, an edgy, questioning
15-year-old named Angela Chase, played with a nicely dark
naturalness by Claire Danes, dyes her hair red and says she can't
look at her mother without wanting to stab her repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show quickly took to Angela's cogent assessments of
family, life and love. But ABC remained ambivalent, and low ratings
were the clincher. With a rabid following growing slowly and its
producers protesting heatedly, the series expired after 19
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   As they say, the good die young. But in television the good can
sometimes enjoy an afterlife, and so it is with ``My So-Called
Life'': six hourlong episodes (including the pilot) will be
released on video on Tuesday by BMG.
</P>
<P>
   Critics weren't universally in love with the series, but most
acknowledged its realism and strong individual voice. Nineteen
episodes weren't enough, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show never got a rhythm that allowed people to get into
it,'' Herskovitz said. ``It was kind of doomed in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he and the director Ed Zwick, his partner in
Bedford Falls, a production company, made news by striking a
pioneering development deal with ABC and Fox. In return for
relinquishing huge up-front payments for series they produce in the
future, they will gain a share of the shows' revenues. That might
have paid off handsomely in the case of ``Thirtysomething,''
another Herskovitz-Zwick collaboration. It would not have been the
way to go with ``My So-Called Life.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of target audience, the series was about two years
early. ``We created a show whose major constituency was teen-age
girls,'' Herskovitz said. That wasn't exactly a crime, but until
Ms. Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio came along in the film ``Romeo and
Juliet'' (1996) and young girls flocked to a slasher movie called
``Scream,'' the networks didn't regard the female half of the
teen-age population as an audience worth pursuing. ``Now they're
this huge economic force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danes had just turned 14 when the series was made. Angela is
as much a wily and honest observer as she is a confused and
insecure teen-ager. ``Sometimes it feels like we're living in some
kind of prison,'' she says in an episode about looks, ``and the
crime is that we hate ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion she ruffles a teacher and classmates by
saying she kind of envied Anne Frank in the attic because at least
she was cooped up with a boy she liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted everybody to meet this real person who happened to be
15,'' said Winnie Holzman, who was the primary writer on the show.
Ms. Holzman had worked for Herskovitz and Zwick on
``Thirtysomething.'' The idea for ``My So-Called Life'' was theirs;
the characterizations were largely hers.
</P>
<P>
   Angela's mother (Bess Armstrong) is a hand-wringing fuss-budget,
an obsessive worrier and controller. Her father (Tom Irwin) is an
affably ineffectual sort who should have gone to cooking school and
become a chef but instead works for his wife as a printing salesman
and ducks issues and confrontations by saying that he's not
entitled to tell Angela what to do or how to think.
</P>
<P>
   Though uncertain on many matters, Angela does her own thinking.
Honesty was paramount. ``We pitched it that way to ABC,'' Ms.
Holzman said. ``When you tell the networks you're going to be
honest, they nod and smile, but they really don't believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   No one said no to the pilot. No one said anything. ``They
couldn't say no yet because the show had this undeniable gripping
quality,'' Ms. Holzman said. ``Claire was so charismatic, so much a
star right from the get-go, it was hard to turn away and say no.
But at the same time they thought it was all terribly odd.''
</P>
<P>
   It would take ABC a year to order further episodes. Content per
se wasn't the problem. ``The main thing was that they had no idea
who would watch the show,'' Herskovitz said. ``They didn't think
adults would watch it and they didn't think the kid audience was
very valuable at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Placed opposite ``Friends'' (in its first season) on Thursday
nights, ``My So-Called Life'' never surfaced with a large general
audience. As it turned out, the show caught hold with segments both
young and adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were 15 or 30, you could watch it on your own terms,''
Ms. Holzman said. ``I think adults got a lot about the show younger
people couldn't get.''
</P>
<P>
   Did ABC quit on it too soon? ``Seinfeld'' took a while to build
an audience So did ``Cheers'' and ``Thirtysomething.'' In the case
of ``My So-Called Life,'' Ms. Holzman said, ``you knew it would
have grown if they had left it on the air _ kind of a duh, I
thought.''

   FIRST BASE
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joynrer/Jim Leyrtiz
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner gets the start. But the 36-year-old Joyner is
getting daily treatment for a shoulder injury, while Leyritz is
already being dubbed Mr. October Jr. for his postseason power
works. Leyritz, the Yankees castoff whose dramatic three-run blast
off Mark Wohlers in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series, tied a game in
the Houston series and won another with home runs. Leyritz and
Joyner could be in the lineup together, with Leyrtiz behind the
plate _ particularly for Sterling Hitchcock in Game 3.

</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE: Quilvio Veras
</P>
<P>
   A solid leadoff guy and a good glove around second base. Not a
marquee name, but he took a step up in his second year playing
every day and hit a career-best .267 and scored 79 runs. The Padres
only serious base-stealing threat, the ex-Mets farmhand swiped 24
bases in 33 tries _ the third time in four seasons he's topped 20
steals.

</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP: Chris Gomez
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors of the Padres shopping for a replacement
from time to time, though Gomez continues to hold down the job with
his steady play. He hit a career-high .267 this season, bolstered
by a .346 average the last two months. The bad news is the Braves'
pitching staff has been the toughest on him throughout his NL
career.

</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE: Ken Caminiti
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Mr. Caminiti? To make something of the series, the Padres
have to juice up their offense, and Caminiti needs to play a big
role. The concern is he slumped to .177 in September and then was a
non-factor in the Houston series with two singles. He was the
league MVP two years ago, but he's had shoulder surgery and his
numbers are down. Still, a rugged competitor.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD: Greg Vaughn
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your comeback of the year story. The Padres tried to
unload him on the Yankees last season, but a shoulder injury caused
him to flunk their physical. Rather than go into a funk, Vaughn
took it out on NL clubs this year by smacking a club-record 50 home
runs. He also drove in a career-best 119 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>

   1998 .272 156 50 119 11
</P>
<P>
   '98 Postseason .333 5 1 1 0
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: Steve Finley
</P>
<P>
   He provides the Padres a Gold Glove-caliber center fielder, but
he's not in the class of Andruw Jones. His offensive numbers were
down considerably off the last two seasons, and hit a woeful .188
against left-handers. Look for ex-Yankees farmhand Ruben Rivera to
possibly draw the start against lefty Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Finley Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>

</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: Tony Gwynn
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're pulling for the Braves, you want to catch Gwynn
work his magic at the plate. The best pure hitter since Ted
Williams, he owns eight batting titles second only to Ty Cobb's
dozen and a .339 lifetime average. He's hobbled by a tender
Achilles', but he loves the limelight and he's handled Braves
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn Avg. H HR RBI SB

<P>
   '98 Postseason .200 3 0 2 0
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER: Carlos Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   A nice player, but the Braves own a huge advantage in Javy
Lopez. He's coming off his most productive season, with nine homers
and 52 RBIs. He deserves credit for handling the Padres pitching
staff. Jim Leyritz will likely be behind the plate when Sterling
Hitchcock starts.

<P>
   BENCH:
</P>
<P>
   With the late-season heroics of Leyritz, he's a threat off the
bench or playing first or behind the plate. That makes Wally Joyner
available to pinch hit or as a late-inning defensive sub at first
base. Ruben Rivera could get a start in center against Tom Glavine.
Mark Sweeney and John Vander Wal, a late season pickup are
left-handed bats off the bench _ with Vander Wal saved for key
late-game situations.

   Gm. 1 STARTER: Andy Ashby
</P>
<P>
   If the Padres can steal a victory with Andy Ashby in Game 1,
then we may have a series. That's a huge ``if.'' The jury remains
out on his effectiveness. He enjoyed his best big-league season,
winning 17 games, but that isn't what matters now. He was the NL's
first 16-game winner on Aug. 12, then experienced a hip injury and
proved to be a different pitcher in his next seven starts _ 1-3,
7.75 ERA. He didn't remove the doubts with a three-run, four-inning
performance in Game 2 against Houston.

</P>
<P>
   Gm. 2 STARTER: Kevin Brown
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown doesn't have name recognition of Atlanta's Big
Three, but he's in the same class _ especially in the postseason.
His fastball registers in the high 90s, and he's resilient enough
to pitch on three days rest _ though he's being held back here to
Game 2. He beat the Braves twice last year in the NLCS, and he's on
a roll again, striking out 16 in a matchup against Randy Johnson in
Game 1 of the NL Division Series.

</P>
<P>
   Gm. 3 STARTER: Sterling Hitchcock
</P>
<P>
   The only lefty starter the Braves will face. It might figure to
be a mismatch opposite Greg Maddux, but Hitchcock threw one of the
games of his life for the Padres to get here, taking on Randy
Johnson in the decisive Game 4 and coming out with a 6-1 victory.
Posted a career-best 3.93 ERA this past season. He works with
ex-Yankee teammate Jim Leyritz, who claims Hitchcock's downfall has
been a lack of confidence to throw strikes and thus getting behind
in the count.

<P>
   Gm. 4 STARTER: Joey Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   If the Padres need a fourth starter, Hamilton get the nod, and
he'll work out of the bullpen early in the series. The Atlanta
resident is a solid third or fourth starter _ going 13-13, 12-7 and
15-9 the past three years. What's deceiving about his wins this
season is his run-support of 3.4 a start was second fewest in the
NL. The Braves have knocked him around pretty hard.

   BULLPEN: Trevor Hoffman
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have the game's best closer in Trevor Hoffman, who
converted 53 of 54 save opportunities. One of the reasons San Diego
acquired Randy Myers and his $6 million contract was a fear that
the Braves might get him. Well, the veteran lefty didn't face a
hitter in the just completed series. Instead, the main setup man
for Hoffman has been righty Dan Miceli, who pitched out of trouble
in three games against Houston.

   ATLANTA _ They didn't walk a picket line. That was never their
intention.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't pound on the front door and scream, ``Let me in!''
The gymnasium at Life University is always open.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Hawks players and free agents were able to
present their points of view Tuesday as they vented over the NBA's
lockout, now in its 98th day.
</P>
<P>
   On the day training camps were to have opened, union officer
Tyrone Corbin said, ``We want the fans to know we're ready to play
and we don't want this.''
</P>
<P>
   A free agent who hopes to be back with the Hawks, Corbin will
accompany fellow vice president Dikembe Mutombo of the Hawks to New
York for a scheduled negotiating session Thursday. The league
recently made a detailed new proposal to the players association
and Mutombo predicted its restrictive language would not hasten a
settlement one bit.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo said that the prospect of a hard salary cap remains
onerous to the players, even if the cap is set at a high figure.
``You could make it $40 million (it's now $26.7 million) and It
still comes down to forcing too many players on a team to slice up
a small piece of the pie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the league is not putting enough of its
income into the pot for distribution to salaries and he said the
league under-estimates its potential for income from foreign
markets. ``The whole world is hungry for NBA games.''
</P>
<P>
   The league, on the other hand, says the players are not
realistic about costs, over-estimate income potential and insists
upon instituting controls on the cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more
than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of
$750,000,'' NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik points out.
``Unfortunately, the union leadership has been unwilling to give
any serious consideration to what we have offered.''
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA may have gained some public sympathy, Mutombo said
players were offended by new restrictive rules of conduct and
increased fines for missed practices or exhibition games or
unacceptable forms of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While the players agreed on a more inclusive drug policy,
Mutombo said, ``By injecting this now they are treating us like
gang members. There are a few young guys who have problems, but
you're talking about more than 420 guys and most of us live a very
quiet lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand Tuesday were Hawks veteran Steve Smith, free agents
Alan Henderson, Pig Miller and Ivano Newbill and rookie Shammond
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Players from New York, Washington, Milwaukee, Indiana, Portland,
Houston, Denver, Miami, Philadelphia and Charlotte were also at
practice sites Tuesday.

 &HT;    Falcons say their offensive line starting to gel
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday was a lot different this week for Atlanta
Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler _ he could walk and talk without
grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was sacked just once in Sunday's 51-23 wipeout of
Carolina, a stark contrast to being sacked seven times the previous
week in a 31-20 loss to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's offensive line was that much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of a game really shows how everybody plays,'' said
Chandler, who last week was limping with a sprained ankle and
favoring a wrist/forearm injury. ``When we win by the score we did,
it generally means everybody played good.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (3-1) allowed just two sacks Sunday, including a late
drop of reserve Steve DeBerg, a dramatic improvement over last
month's game at Carolina, when Chandler was sacked six times.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday against the Giants (2-3), the Falcons will face a
4-3 alignment rather than Carolina's 3-4, but New York still brings
a lot of pressure. The Giants are tied for second in the NFL with
19 sacks, and end Michael Strahan has six.
</P>
<P>
   To prove Sunday wasn't an aberration, left tackle Bob Whitfield,
left guard Calvin Collins, center Robbie Tobeck, right guard Gene
Williams and right tackle Ephraim Salaam will have to show
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson, who has the first back-to-back
100-yard games of his career after rushing for 117 Sunday, says the
line is playing better because the players are closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working harder as a unit,'' Anderson said. ``The
little things they do together, like going to lunch, doing stuff as
a unit on the road . . . all that factors into how well they play
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield said that when the line gets it done, the running game
gets going, and a defensive line can't pin back its ears and rush
the passer.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, the only rookie in the unit, agrees with that, and with
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great game plan. We ran a lot, and ran hard and
well,'' he said. ``You fight harder with your family. There's a
sense of pride. The more we work together, the better we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam has drawn the most attention on a unit that allowed 16
sacks in the first three games. Sunday, he worked against outside
linebacker Kevin Greene, who had both sacks, both coming, however,
when receivers were covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still got a long way to go,'' he said. ``But we were more
aware, reading keys and communicating better. When they would bring
the strong safety down, or move the (middle linebacker) over
(tipping potential blitzes), we noticed things like that, and we
were making calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly: The Falcons are finalizing arrangements with Furman
University in Greenville, S.C., to have training camp there next
summer, with options to hold camp there in 2000 and 2001. Furman
was the site of Falcon training camps from 1971-77. . . . Former
Falcon DT Nathan Davis, a second-round pick in 1997 who quit the
team on the second day of camp, signed a one-year deal with Dallas.

 &HT;    School president has vision of 'world house' environmentBy Ernie
Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Walter Massey, a veteran of the California
affirmative action wars, convincing people that there is diversity
on the campus of Morehouse College shouldn't be that hard a task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been emphasizing diversity here,'' said Massey, the
president of Morehouse. ``But what does diversity mean to a
historically and predominantly black college that is all male?''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath a photo of Martin Luther King Jr. in the
visitors' center of the slain leader's national historic site,
Massey explained Morehouse's mission toward diversity by stressing
his school's most famous graduate's desire for a ``world house,''
in which different cultures could come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have stressed is diversity isn't just black and
white,'' said Massey, who was the provost of the University of
California System when affirmative action was being challenged in
the mid- 1990s and eventually overturned in 1996, after he had
left. ``We have to live with people of all cultures _ racial,
ethnic and gender related.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey was on hand Tuesday, along with Emory University
President Bill Chace, to discuss the results of the Campus
Diversity Initiative, commissioned by the Ford Foundation to gauge
the attitudes of people regarding diversity and diversity education
in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 registered voters, including 200 Georgians,
participated.
</P>
<P>
   The survey concluded that 70 percent of Georgians think it is
very important that colleges prepare graduates to get along in a
diverse society. Another 54 percent said every college student
should have to study different cultures in order to graduate, and
by a margin of four to one, those who have an opinion say that
diversity programs in colleges and universities raise, rather than
lower, standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all of education is formed by having students
face-to-face with the unfamiliar,'' Chace said. ``This is the
nature of education. People don't come here to relearn that which
they already know. People come here to deepen what they already
know or to be thrust into circumstances with which they have no
familiarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chace said students at Emory get that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'' recently ranked
Emory first in the country among high-ranking liberal arts colleges
for black enrollment, reporting that 10.2 percent of Emory's
students are black, up from 3 percent in 1980. As late as 1967, no
black had ever graduated from Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Chace credits that to a concerted effort by Emory to attract
more blacks and minorities. About 30 percent of Emory's students
are minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it not been for affirmative action programs and our focus
on having an African-American community, we wouldn't have (an
African-American community), '' Chace said. ``Only that kind of
constant application and focus can explain our meteoric rise.''
</P>
<P>
   While, Emory is more diverse on the surface than Morehouse,
which is about 98 percent black, Massey said his students hail from
each of the 50 states, and several foreign countries. Earlier this
semester, the BBC was on campus filming a documentary on British
students at Morehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are part of a diverse community here,'' Massey said. ``And
in order for diversity to really work, diversity must occur within
the racial, ethnic and gender boundaries. It begins with diversity
among yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents agreed that the results of the survey didn't
signify an end of anything or a specific turning point, therefore,
neither would adopt a ``where do we go from here,'' approach,
instead opting to continue in the direction they are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for constant applications and focused
efforts,'' Chace said. ``If we say we are finished, we are done.''

 &HT;    PSC gives OK to gas companies
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Public Service Commission gave the go-ahead
Tuesday to 19 companies to start selling natural gas in Georgia at
decontrolled prices, and one marketer immediately offered onetime
$50 discounts to every customer it signs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic moment in Georgia and for the gas
industry,'' Chairman Robert Baker said as the PSC approved all of
the certification applications.
</P>
<P>
   But commissioners put the marketers on notice that there will be
zero-tolerance for ``slamming'' _ changing a customer's service to
another provider without permission _ or other deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan of Arc might think she had it good compared to the first
company found guilty by this commission,'' Commissioner Stan Wise
said.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties will include fines of $15,000 for each incident of
slamming and $10,000 for each day it continues. Companies who
engage in such practices, which have marred telecommunications
deregulation, could also have their operating certificates revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers can immediately begin quoting prices and making
deals to supply gas starting Nov. 1. Consumers must sign up with a
marketer by Oct. 25 to receive gas on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light Co., which is getting out of the gas sales
business, will continue supplying customers while deregulation is
fully phased in. But consumers who do not choose a marketer other
than AGL eventually will be assigned to one by the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors are in various stages of developing their
marketing plans and rates to lure 1.4 million residential and
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still assessing whether to even make major efforts.
Most TV and radio ad campaigns are not expected to start until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 days, Atlanta Gas Light is scheduled to distribute
computer discs to marketers that include customers' names,
addresses and gas usage histories. Some companies said they will
not be able to quote specific prices until they receive such
information from the gas company or consumers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren A. Darby, senior vice president in charge of Georgia
operations for SCANA Energy, said his company would immediately
offer $50 discounts on the first month's bill of residential
customers who sign up with the South Carolina-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Darby also promised an additional 5 percent reduction on what
residential customers currently pay Atlanta Gas Light. The PSC says
bills now average $520 a year. SCANA's reduction on that average
would be about $26 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gunther, president of Georgia Natural Gas Services Inc.,
a subsidiary of AGL Resources Inc., which is Atlanta Gas Light's
parent, said his company is prepared today to offer a market price
close to what consumers are currently paying. Other pricing
options, such as a fixed rate over a 12-month period, will also be
available. The company will launch a statewide TV and radio ad
campaign next week, Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Raymond, president of Houston-based Shell Energy Services,
said the Shell Oil Co. subsidiary will also launch its ad campaign
next week and be ready to quote prices at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Dish, a spokeswoman for Columbia Energy Services, said the
Ohio-based firm plans a mass mailing to 1 million consumers. The
company, however, has not yet set prices.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Latham, president of Optimum Energy Sources, said her
Roswell-based company, which will operate as Peachtree Natural Gas,
is prepared today to sign up customers who call electric membership
corporations with which it has formed marketing alliances. Optimum
has agreements with the Coweta-Fayette, Walton, Jackson and Sawnee
EMCs.
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree will offer a flat monthly rate that includes a
guarantee against weather-driven price fluctuations, Lahtam said.
But she added it would be difficult to quote prices until the
company receives gas usage information.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC scheduled a meeting Friday to discuss a number of
unresolved deregulation issues. That could include possible
measures to protect personal privacy and proprietary information
for businesses when the gas company turns over customer information
to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission may also revisit a 2 percent rate increase
awarded Atlanta Gas Light Co. earlier this year for transportation
of gas and rule on a proposed $12.3 million two-year public
education campaign by AGL on deregulation that ratepayers would be
billed for.

 &HT;    Re/Max offices join to form mega-brokerage
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fourteen Atlanta area Re/Max franchises have merged to
form a new company, Re/Max Greater Atlanta, now one of the largest
real estate brokerages in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Once three new offices open, the new brokerage will employ up to
1,100 agents.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Finch, who will be chairman of the new company,
the new offices will be in the Vinings, North Point Mall and Duluth
areas of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, also the current president of the Atlanta Board of
Realtors, and real estate veteran Tim Lennon owned Re/Max North
Atlanta, with eight locations and $1.3 billion in closed sales
through August. They expect combined closed sales for all of 1998
to be more than $3 billion, Finch said. Closed sales represent
consummated transactions, Finch said, and is usually a lower figure
than gross sales, which may include transactions that were not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The other brokers involved in the deal will be partners as
brokers/owners in the new company. They are: Mary Ann Frolik, who
owned Re/Max Achievers and Re/Max Intown, and Denny Jones and Ben
Christopher, who co-owned Re/Max Northwest in Cobb County and
environs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of this transaction, Re/Max franchises have
considerable visibility in the metro area. There are still about 50
others ringing Atlanta, from Griffin to Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Finch acknowledged that the Re/Max Greater Atlanta combination
is part of a general trend toward consolidation in the industry,
adding that it gives the new company far greater reach and market
share. But, he added, in this case there are special elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the name recognition. But we also have productivity
per office and productivity per agent that will be at least twice
what any of our competitors have.''
</P>
<P>
   Such productivity, he explained, is measured by transactions per
agent tracked from third-party sources such as the multiple listing
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Finch did not rule out the possibility of forays into
subdivision development, he said the new company's immediate goal
is to acquaint every agent with its computer lab and
real-estate-specific learning modules.

 &HT;    Foundation's dealings with Republican party may violate status
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation may
have violated its tax-exempt status with a fund-raising appeal that
was too closely allied with the Republican party, according to two
tax experts.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old public interest law firm has recently raised its
profile by successfully challenging in federal court the Clinton
administration's plans to use statistical sampling to get a more
accurate count of minorities in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   But a letter from Amos McMullian, a foundation board member and
chief executive of a south Georgia baking company, soliciting money
for the suit may have crossed the line that keeps charities out of
political activities.
</P>
<P>
   McMullian, chairman of the board and CEO of Flowers Industries
of Thomasville, Ga., asked business executives in a Feb. 18 letter
to give between $5,000 and $50,000 to Southeastern Legal for its
lawsuit. Contributions are ``completely tax deductible,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The part of his letter that has raised concerns is his reference
to an analysis of the partisan impact of census sampling provided
by the Republican National Committee (RNC).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton Census plan could provide Democrats the crucial
edge needed to take over Congress and also prevail in close
contests to control several state legislative chambers,'' McMullian
wrote, enclosing a copy of a memo written by RNC chairman Jim
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Nicholson said census sampling was ``an issue of
unusual importance to the future of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   When shown the letter, Greg Colvin, a San Francisco tax
attorney, said, ``The letter, with the memo, is designed to
motivate a giver on partisan ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, chairman of an American Bar Association committee on
political activities by tax-exempt organizations, said the
fund-raising appeal may not have raised objections if it had not
included the RNC memo and references.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Hill, a University of Miami law professor, agreed. ``The
central bad fact is that Nicholson's memo is part of the
solicitation,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax status enjoyed by the Southeastern Legal Foundation
allows donors to claim tax deductions for their contributions and
exempts it from most federal taxes. In return, the organization
agrees not to take part in partisan political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who has written about the political activities of
charitable organizations, said she sees similarities to the case of
the American Campaign Academy, a Virginia trade school formed in
1986 to train top managers for political campaigns. Joe Gaylord,
Speaker Newt Gingrich's top political adviser, helped organize the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The academy closed its doors in 1989 after the U.S. Tax Court
upheld an IRS ruling that the academy did not qualify for
tax-exempt financing because it primarily benefited the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter in this matter is important because it suggests
that the benefit to the Republican party was more than incidental
to the lawsuit,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, the foundation's president, denied that there were
partisan motivations behind the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Republican in the White House was trying to do the same
thing, the Southeastern Legal Foundation would still be filing a
lawsuit,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said McMullian wrote the letter on his company's
letterhead, not the foundation's. But McMullian wrote that he was
acting at the foundation's behest, and Marta Turner, a spokeswoman
for Flowers Industries, referred all questions about the letter to
Glavin.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation raised $20,000 from McMullian's appeal, Glavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Frank Keith said he could not discuss whether the
agency is looking at Southeastern Legal's tax-exempt status. Glavin
said his organization is not under investigation. ``We haven't done
anything wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMullian is a longtime political supporter of Gingrich. His
company has contributed regularly to GOPAC, the Republican
political organization Gingrich once ran and remains close to.
Flowers has contributed $25,000 this year, GOPAC records show.
</P>
<P>
   McMullian also noted in his appeal that a separate letter from
Gingrich on behalf of the foundation prompted him to donate money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have contended that opponents of the administration's
census plan are driven mainly by their concern that sampling, a
scientific method of adjusting the population without actually
counting every person, would add millions of people to the
populations of traditionally Democratic areas. ``From the
beginning, the opponents of a scientific census have had only a
political agenda,'' Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said at a recent
congressional hearing on the census. Maloney first called attention
to McMullian's letter.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, two federal courts have unanimously agreed with
opponents of sampling that it is illegal. A month before
Southeastern Legal won its lawsuit, a federal court in Washington,
D.C., ruled in favor of Gingrich in a suit he filed as part of a
compromise with the White House to seek a speedy legal resolution
to the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the sampling
issue on Nov. 30.

MARKET PLACE: PERILS OF ALL-STOCK MERGERS WITH FOREIGN FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The financial bane of Detroit automakers has been the
laggard shares of their stocks; those have tended to sell for only
seven to nine times their earnings per share, less than half the
market average for big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have feared the American auto industry's reputation
for faltering badly during each recession and have refused to pay
higher multiples of earnings even as automakers have amassed huge
cash reserves and cut their long-term costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Chrysler Corp., which has a particularly bad
reputation for encountering trouble during recessions, seemed to
have found a nifty way around investor distrust. It agreed to merge
with Daimler-Benz AG, which has traded at a higher multiple in the
German market, where investors have regarded auto stocks more
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the merger broke on May 6, Chrysler's shares
climbed to 9.5 times its expected 1998 earnings _ up from 8.1 times
earnings the day before. Daimler's American depositary receipts
rose to a price-earnings multiple of 25.8 from a multiple of 24.3.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains have proved temporary. While investment bankers
and auto analysts still expect the deal to be completed, the weak
performance of Chrysler's stock since May is an unusual example of
the perils of an all-stock merger with a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler shares closed at $40.8125 Tuesday, down 62.5 cents from
where they had been the day before news of the merger first
surfaced six months ago. Chrysler's stock is now trading at 7.5
times the consensus forecast of its 1998 earnings, according to
earnings estimates from First Call Corp., which tracks stock
analyst opinions. Daimler's stock is now trading at 16.1 times its
expected earnings this year, though a small part of its drop since
May reflects the payment of a special dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Auto stocks have dropped since May, and German auto stocks in
particular have suffered as consumer demand in Europe begins to
weaken and the strengthening German mark of the last two weeks has
eroded the value of car exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Chrysler-Daimler deal is a transaction in which both
companies' stockholders exchange their shares for stock in a
combined company, Daimler's difficulties combined with a fall in
American auto stocks have left Chrysler's shares right back where
they were before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on
Daimler's stock to a buy from a strong buy, partly because the
company's huge revenues from selling Mercedes cars in the United
States were being hurt by the mark's growing strength. Since
Chrysler's stock now moves in tandem with Daimler's stock, the
recent weakness of the American dollar is thus hurting Chrysler _ a
paradox for any American automaker, which normally tends to profit
from a weak dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's price-earnings multiple of 7.5 is now slightly less
than Ford Motor Co.'s multiple of 7.9. The multiple for General
Motors Corp. is 11.9 when calculated with its strike-depressed 1998
earnings, but only 6.5 when calculated with its expected 1999
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's stock now has the lowest average recommendation from
analysts of any of the Big Three automakers, though the difference
is fairly small, according to First Call. But anyone who believes
that the combined company, DaimlerChrysler AG, will thrive should
buy Chrysler stock rather than Daimler shares, said Mark Rowen, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. That's because Chrysler is selling
at a 10 percent discount to Daimler, based on the conversion ratios
used in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sign that the problems at Chrysler and Daimler
will derail the transaction, which has already been approved by
both companies' shareholders and was always intended as a strategic
move rather than as an outright sale of Chrysler. The only
remaining step in the merger is for Daimler stockholders to tender
their shares for exchange. If less than 90 percent of the Daimler
shares are submitted, the deal will receive less favorable tax
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But the fall in Daimler's stock since the merger announcement
makes Chrysler more attractive to German shareholders and the
merger even more likely to take place. A person involved in the
merger said that there had been no discussions about reworking the
terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, traditionally active in arbitrage trading of merger
stocks, appear to have suffered little harm from Chrysler's
difficulties, said Tom Burnett, the director of Merger Insight, a
New York firm that researches mergers for institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Hedge funds tried to borrow Daimler stock
and sell it short to protect themselves against any breakup of the
deal. But few Daimler shareholders have been willing to lend their
shares, preferring to keep them and exchange them for shares in the
combined company. So hedge funds and other arbitragers have been
cautious about holding Chrysler shares, Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler and Daimler are seeking to minimize taxes by treating
the deal as a so-called pooling of interests. The rules for such
transactions require Chrysler to undo the effects of its recent
stock repurchases by selling 30 million shares _ an unenviable task
in a market so weak that Goldman, Sachs just postponed its own
plans to become a publicly traded company for fear that its newly
issued shares would command a meager price.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's difficulties have attracted little comment on Wall
Street, and its need to sell a lot of stock is part of the reason.
Big investment banks are lining up to handle the transaction,
particularly as other stock issuances are drying up, and the banks'
analysts are reluctant to offend Chrysler by discussing its
problems publicly.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only automaker that seems to have found a way to
push its price-earnings multiple out of line with the industry is
Ford. The automaker posted a $15.95 billion one-time accounting
gain in the first-quarter when it revalued its 80 percent stake in
the Associates, a consumer-finance company, before spinning off its
stake in the business to Ford shareholders. None of the analysts
following Ford have included this non-cash gain in their
calculations of the company's price-earnings multiple. But at least
one financial information service does so, assigning a
price-earnings multiple of less than 3 to Ford as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Little, Ford's manager of corporate accounting and
financial reporting, who calculated the one-time gain to comply
with an obscure tax regulation, said that her role had prompted
some jokes at the office, such as a suggestion that she deserved a
raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of bragged to our CFO that I produced more earnings
than anyone else in the company, but he didn't really buy that,''
she said.

PAUL DAVIS: MAKING ART THAT LASTS OF THEATER THAT DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Okla.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Paul Davis' theater posters, one can see the
essence of the original performance: the arrogant charm of Raul
Julia's Mack the Knife in ``Threepenny Opera,'' Sam Waterston
crying out his rage in ``Hamlet,'' the Orientalized elegance of
Irene Worth in ``The Cherry Orchard'' and the full range of Kevin
Kline's virtuosity as Hamlet, Richard III and the Pirate King in
``The Pirates of Penzance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Davis made his reputation with these posters and
others he drew for Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York
Shakespeare Festival in the 1970s and 1980s. Sitting in his East
Village studio, surrounded by examples of his work, he recalled a
Papp prediction: ``He said that someday all that will be left of
these plays will be the posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those portraits remain at the core of his art, Davis
has produced an astonishing variety of work, political as well as
theatrical and cinematic, including covers for news magazine and
books, murals and advertising layouts.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty sampling from all stages of his 40-year career is on
exhibit through Oct. 30 at the School of Visual Arts (209 E. 23rd
St). The pictures in the exhibition, about 200 items drawn from the
collection of Davis and his family, include figure drawings he made
during his residency last year in Italy as a Prix de Rome winner.
They are, of course, signed with his distinctive, carefully
curlicued signature. Davis, a graduate of Visual Arts, is an
instructor at the school and, at 60, is this year's recipient of
its Master Series Award.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Davis has drawn from life. Kline, the most
frequent subject of Davis pictures, would come to his studio and
perform scenes from the plays while the artist photographed him in
action. Then, using the photographs as a guide, Davis made his
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has had to work at a distance, especially when
doing political figures. Naturally, Che Guevera did not pose for
Davis' posthumous portrait. When Davis drew Nelson Mandela for a
Time magazine cover, the subject was still in prison; Davis had to
draw from old photographs and from Winnie Mandela's description.
She would tell him things like ``he has pain in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he paint pain? Through instinct and with painterly
technique. Although he has done still lifes and landscapes, like a
70-foot mural of the seasons for the Arcadia restaurant on the
Upper East Side (removed after the restaurant's recent closing), he
specializes in portraits of people. He has been drawing faces since
he was a child in Tulsa, Okla. The title of his 1985 book was
``Faces,'' the faces ranging from Papp as a swaggering song and
dance man (with cigar) to early portraits of the Kennedy brothers,
looking extraordinarily youthful _ and thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   One key to his portraits is in the eyes. A face, he said, can be
immobile, but you can see ``the life of a person through their
eyes.'' Often, as in his painting of Laurence Olivier as King Lear,
the eyes have a searing intensity, as if the actor were staring
right through the viewer of the picture. Or in the case of Jack
Nicholson, the eyes signal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to artists like Al Hirschfeld who work with line,
Davis paints in color with brush strokes. ``I always felt the need
for light and shade,'' said. He describes his work as
``illusionistic,'' and it is filled with allegories and symbolism _
the Rolling Stones as stones rolling down a hill; Darryl F. Zanuck
as the logo of 20th Century Fox, with starlets in his sunglasses
and a dollar sign in his cigar smoke. ``It was Picasso who said
most good portraits have a lot of caricature in them,'' Davis
recalled. ``You're trying to represent people, but you're also
trying to enlarge on those aspects that make them more like
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, ``A true poster is meant for the street,''
he said. ``The whole point is to get somebody to do something _ a
call for action.'' By definition it is political. A theater poster
is intended to sell tickets, an advertising poster is intended to
sell a product, and ``a political poster is supposed to make you
aware of an issue or a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in the right hands the poster is, of course,
an individual work of art, which is one reason Davis shies from
being called an illustrator. As he said: ``Illustrations are made
to accompany something _ a text. A lot of the work I've done is
meant to stand on its own, as itself.'' Similarly, he objects to
the distinction made between high and low art. He prefers to make
distinctions between good and bad art. That difference is not
always accurately defined by those who commission the art. Some of
his strongest pictures have been rejected by magazines for various
editorial reasons. He is undeterred by that fact: he has the
portrait to show for it _ and also a healthy fee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also sells his drawings for around $1,500, his paintings
for as much as $40,000. Occasionally he does private portraits on
commission. Although he has galleries handling his work in other
countries _ two in Japan and one in Italy _ he is not represented
in New York. He handles his own sales, and his work sells well.
</P>
<P>
   With enthusiasm, he often paints on surfaces other than canvas:
his Ralph Nader is on a shopping bag, Dr. Spock on a baby bottle,
both Madonna and Ronald Reagan on blocks of woods. Wood, in fact,
is one of Davis' favorite surfaces. ``It's hard, but it absorbs the
paint,'' he said. He concedes that women are more difficult to
paint than men. ``Sharp edges are easier to paint than soft
edges,'' he said. ``Craggy is easier to do. I've always tried to
paint beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book that describes 25 outstanding American illustrators,
he lists more than 50 people who had a great effect on his work.
The list includes ``Miss Ownby,'' his eighth-grade art teacher in
Oklahoma; Silas Rhodes, the head of the School of Visual Arts,
which he attended on a scholarship; Milton Glaser and Seymour
Chwast, who gave him his first job at their Pushpin studio,
enabling him to paint rather than having to support himself by
teaching. As he said, ``First you succeed, then you teach.'' Also
in the pantheon are Marcel Duchamp (the influence of Surrealism),
Mark Twain, several Japanese painters, Balthus and Giotto (his two
favorite artists) and Walt Kelly, the creator of Pogo.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his fondness for Kelly, Davis said he had started out
wanting to be a cartoonist. ``If I could have been Walt Kelly or Al
Capp or Chester Gould, I would have been delighted,'' he said.
``But I had to settle for something else.'' Cartooning appeals to
the storytelling side of his art. Despite the apparent pictorial
realism of his work, it is, he said, ``more fanciful than a
photograph,''
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, he still occasionally tries to draw cartoons
and has become an expert at computer animation, examples of which
can be seen in the exhibition. Calling up one of his abstract
shorts on a computer screen, he demonstrated the transformative
power of this process. Suddenly a Paul Davis cartoon morphed into a
Picasso _ and then just as quickly returned to a Davis, and seemed
to dance around the screen. It was the animation equivalent of a
jazz improvisation, adding an extra dimension to the artist's
visceral sense of theater.

 &HT;    Tough-district Democrats feel dual pressure
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing for tomorrow's historic vote on opening
an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton, Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill scrambled to keep members in line.
</P>
<P>
   With congressional elections just a few weeks away, the House
vote could be a test for many Democrats facing tough re-election
bids.
</P>
<P>
   If they vote for a GOP resolution calling for a Watergate-style
inquiry, they could face the wrath of their party. If they vote
lockstep with their party leaders and oppose the inquiry, they
could face the wrath of voters in their district.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans aren't making it any easier for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said that he had no
intention of giving Democrats a chance to vote on their own
resolution, which would offer cover for Democrats in tight
re-election bids since they could vote for an investigation
sanctioned by their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who control the House floor, have decided to permit
debate _ one hour's worth _ only on a GOP resolution author- izing
the Judiciary Committee to launch an open-ended impeachment inquiry
reminiscent of the 1974 Watergate inquiry into former President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the right resolution,'' Armey told reporters.
``I think it is just time to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides and Democratic leaders reached out to about
35-55 Democrats who they fear might support the Republican
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee did not mince words
in attacking the Republican way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not allow an alternative to be debated would be the
grossest form of partisanship,'' said Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a
member of the House Judiciary Committee, which will oversee the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Republican majority in the House, it is all but a
foregone conclusion that an impeachment inquiry will be approved
tomorrow, for only the third time in the history of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for a Judiciary subcommittee to hold a
hearing on October 22 to determine what constitutes an im-
peachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is controversial.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Republicans Charles Canady of Florida and Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas held a press conference to announce the
parameters of that hearing, the chief democrat on the subcommittee
sent out a media advisory suggesting that he had not been
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that we would be able to bring a level of
bipartisan- ship to the subcommittee hearings that had been absent
from the full committee considerations of the impeachment issue,''
said Rep. Robert Scott (D-Va.) in a letter to Canady. ``If we can't
even show fairness to each other in the simple activity of setting
a date for a hearing, I am concerned that we will be hampered in
our efforts to show fairness throughout the proceedings.''

 &HT;    GOP softens ads to avoid backlash
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearing public revulsion at political attack ads,
the Republican House leadership unveiled a $7 million round of
national advertising Tuesday filled with smiling faces and talk of
tax cuts and budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertising is designed to highlight congressional
accomplishments in contrast to the Clinton sex scandal, just as
House Republicans are on the verge of beginning an impeachment
inquiry against the president, said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.),
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated that Republicans have had problems drawing
attention to anything other than the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the GOP pursues an open-ended inquiry with no time limit
in the Clinton investigation, Linder said polls and focus groups
have convinced him the public is ``sick of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   When focus groups had a look at more negative ads, Linder said,
``We got our head handed to us. It was stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue advertising is running this week in 42 congressional
districts, including southwest Georgia's 2nd District, where
Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop faces Republican challenger Joseph
McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   It features three ``Republican solutions'': giving families a
$500-a-child tax credit, using the budget surplus to ensure the
solvency of the Social Security system and allowing employees to
retain their health insurance when they switch jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Linder also announced the debut of new advertising in 15 other
districts that is specific to those races.
</P>
<P>
   The cost equals the entire issues ad budget of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. The Republicans are in the midst
of a $37 million fund-raising campaign, of which they already have
banked $22 million, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those contests, including the Georgia race, are
``longshots,'' Linder conceded. But he said the party would spend
money in any district where the Republican candidate had any
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.), Linder's Democratic counterpart,
said the new Republican commercial is evidence that the GOP has
more money than it knows what to do with and has nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Because it technically does not endorse or oppose a candidate,
the advertising is not subject to federal election law spending
limits. But like virtually all so-called issue ads, it leaves
little doubt which candidate it prefers.
</P>
<P>
   In southwest Georgia, for example, the ad ends with the
McCormick campaign phone number and a suggestion to call the
candidate and ``tell him solving family problems is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop also can plausibly lay claim to each of those issues,
said his press secretary, Selby McCash. ``In a sense, they're
endorsing his record on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder said the ad was well received when it was tested, and he
suggested that tougher ads would have energized Republican voters,
but at a cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have moved our base big time if we were out there
attacking Clinton, but we'd lose everyone else,'' he said.

FRENCH TESTS FIND TRACES OF NERVE GAS CHEMICALS ON IRAQI WARHEADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ French tests have found traces of chemicals
linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, confirming earlier
American test results, according to several weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats also charged that the French had delayed
releasing the final results because they did not want to undermine
Iraq's push at the United Nations this week to lift economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   French officials denied that they were deliberately withholding
test results, and a French diplomat said on Tuesday that the
results are expected to be ``completely consistent'' with earlier
tests that found no traces of the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is mounting between the United Nations and Iraq, which
has refused to cooperate with U.N.weapons inspectors and has sent a
high-level team to the United Nations to argue that Iraq has
released enough information about its weapons program to justify
lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which has denied putting VX on weapons, disputed earlier
American test results finding traces of VX on warheads and asked
for further tests, conducted in France and Switzerland over the
summer. Preliminary French and Swiss test results found no traces
of VX.
</P>
<P>
   But if final French tests do find VX components on the warheads,
Iraq's credibility and case for lifting sanctions would be further
weakened. France, which like Russia has considerable commercial
interests in Iraq, has argued that the United Nations should move
faster to ease sanctions imposed after the Gulf War. To begin
lifting sanctions, all Iraqi biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons, as well as certain missile systems, must be destroyed, and
inspectors must be confident Iraq could not rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   Several weapons experts said that during a technical meeting in
September of international weapons specialists, French technical
experts had said that four or five of the samples taken from
chemical warheads had VX components on them. But at higher-level
meetings later that month, these results were not discussed,
according to diplomats and weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   According to several diplomats, French Defense Ministry
officials told European officials that this was too sensitive a
time to publicize results that would be damaging to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, say that
there are no more prohibited weapons of any kind to be found and
that the Security Council has a ``legal and moral'' obligation to
lift sanctions. Weapons inspectors reply that there are too many
outstanding questions, and missing documentation, on issues like VX
and a host of biological compounds to justify relaxing restrictions
on President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Aziz angrily lashed out at the United States and the
weapons inspection system, suggesting that he was meeting
resistance in both the secretary general's office and the Security
Council in his demands for a new look at sanctions in return for
Iraq permitting the resumption of on-site arms inspections, which
Baghdad ended on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-month report sent to the Security Council on Tuesday,
Richard Butler, the chief of the program to inspect Iraqi arms,
said that the Iraqis were close to meeting requirements in
ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs. But the report
noted that ``the level of verification of precisely how much VX was
produced by Iraq is not satisfactory.'' The report also noted that
Baghdad continues to deny that it loaded warheads with VX, contrary
to mounting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also not submitted a second final report
on the warhead samples, according to officials of the United
Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq
and preventing it from rebuilding its weapons programs. It was the
first American report, in June, that revealed the presence of
components found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed by
Iraq and dug up in April by U.N. weapons inspectors. That report
led to Iraqi demands for laboratory studies outside the United
States. Tests in France and Switzerland followed in the summer. The
Swiss tests, all agree, appear to be negative, with no traces of VX
components found.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts and diplomats said on Tuesday that a technical
team assembled in New York two weeks ago by the Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, expected to be able to discuss final results from
Switzerland, the Untied States and France. The Americans and the
French did not have results ready.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding
information because its scientists did not find VX components or
precursor chemicals on its second batch of samples, so as not to
put its first tests into question.
</P>
<P>
   France told the UNSCOM technical experts that it had four or
five more samples to test. On Tuesday, experts said that there is
strong evidence that those outstanding samples had revealed two
chemicals found in VX _ though not only in VX. But the Iraqis would
be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on
warheads that Iraq said contained other substances.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi warheads being studied were discovered at a
weapons-demolition site north of Baghdad. Commission officials
haggled with Iraqis for weeks before being allowed to take some
metal fragments from the shells out of the country in May for
testing in the United States.

 &HT;    Philanthropy stamp unveiled today in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cause of philanthropy is getting a boost today
when it gets its own 32-cent stamp from the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The commemorative stamp will be unveiled this afternoon at a
ceremony at the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta, kicking off the annual
conference of the National Committee on Planned Giving.
</P>
<P>
   Being issued in an initial release of 50 million, the stamp
pictures a bee pollinating a flower, with the words ``Giving &AMP;
Sharing: An American Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is happier about the release than Milton Murray, a
professional fund-raiser who's been fighting for the philanthropy
stamp since 1969 and will be recognized for those efforts today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been collecting stamps since I was 8, and working
professionally to help people and organizations share with those in
need, so I thought why not have a stamp that addresses giving and
sharing and compassion?'' says the 76-year-old resident of
Beltville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy process. Murray talked to fellow fund-raisers
and nonprofit foundations. He wrote letters and lobbied the Postal
Service, Congress and White House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray knew he was fighting an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider that the post office receives 50,000 letters a year
urging subjects for stamps, that at any given moment they are
considering 2,000 subjects, and that they only issue 35-40 new
stamps a year,'' says Murray. ``And then, it's difficult to sell a
subject people don't see as exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray says that until last week he's been more relieved than
elated about the stamp's debut. ``But I got goose bumps when I
walked into my local post office Friday and a lady behind the
counter yelled out, `We've got your stamp in.'''

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Brown slated for Thursday start
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Brownout, if it comes at all, won't happen until
Thursday, at the earliest. Kevin Brown won't start for San Diego
until Game 2 of the NL Championship Series. Not that that'll make
tonight's opener easier for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since I've been in the big leagues,'' Chipper Jones said, ''I
don't ever remember this team beating Ashby.'' That would be Andy
Ashby, the Padres' 17-game winner who faces John Smoltz in Game 1
tonight at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming the NL's first 16-game winner on Aug. 12, Ashby
finished the season in a 1-3, 7.75 ERA slump over his last seven
starts. In Game 2 of the Division Series, he lasted just four
innings against Houston, giving up six hits and three earned runs.
But it's the pre-Sept. Ashby Jones recalls, and likens to Brown.
And not just because that, at 6-foot-5, Ashby's a tall
right-hander, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been as quality a pitcher as Kevin Brown,'' Jones said of
Ashby, who beat the Braves twice this season. He went eight innings
in a 3-2 win here May 8, scattering nine hits. On Aug. 12 in San
Diego, Ashby struck out eight in seven innings of a 5-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ashby's scheduled to start Games 1 and 5. While a win in
the opener would be beneficial, Jones knows this NLCS mustn't
duplicate last year's, when Brown pitched for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to do what we didn't do last October, and
beat Kevin Brown at least once,'' Jones said. ''It's going to be
tough to beat San Diego if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Personnel
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox will go with the same lineup tonight that he used in
Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series against Chicago. Michael
Tucker will be in right field, batting eighth, just behind Andruw
Jones at No. 7. Until the LDS, Cox had used the lineup (including
Keith Lockhart at 2B, batting second, and Ryan Klesko in left,
hitting fifth), just once all season _ Sept. 25, in a 6-5 win over
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As for his post-season roster, Cox said during Tuesday's
workout, ''I don't think we're going to tinker with the roster
right now. We'll wait until after the workout, see how everybody
is. But I don't think we're going to take anybody off and add
anybody that's traveling. But the same guys will travel, if we're
fortunate enough to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, getcha tickets
</P>
<P>
   According to Braves officials, there are once again ''several
thousand'' tickets available for Games 1 and 2 of the LCS. Most are
$45 seats in the upper level and outfield pavilion, but some $60
seats in the lower level remain. Tickets are available at Turner
Field ticket windows, from 8:30-5:00. Cashier's check, money order
or cash only. Also, tickets can be purchased by phone through
Ticketmaster (800-326-4000) via credit cards only. Remember the $3
per ticket ''convenience charge'' with Ticketmaster.

 &HT;    Bullpens a study in contrasts
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The styles can be no more divergent than they are in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium shakes between the mournful chimes
of AC/DC's ``Hell's Bells'' blasting from the sound system as
Trevor Hoffman storms his way to the mound. In Atlanta, Kerry
Ligtenberg is like the little kid next door practicing a violin.
Someday, he may learn to play the thing, unless someone breaks it
over his head first.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions matter. When the NLCS commences tonight at Turner
Field, perhaps the most critical component over the next few days
will be the relief work. Behind Hoffman, Padres general manager
Kevin Towers assembled five new relievers _ Dan Miceli and Randy
Myers foremost _ who helped the club post a 3.46 ERA, the
fourth-lowest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we've shortened the game to seven innings,'' said
Towers.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have blended three rookies with a Nicaraguan
grandfather, a journeyman laboring with his seventh organization
and the major leagues' most precise sideburns. What has developed
is a bullpen that allows a lower batting average than the Padres'
(.230 to .232). Posting a 4.06 ERA at the All-Star break, Atlanta
relievers had a 3.54 second half and the five out there now
(discounting converted starter Kevin Millwood) stand at 3.00 since
the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bunch of guys nobody really ever heard about,'' said
Ligtenberg, ``so it's probably easy to say we're a vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we've proven in the last two or three months that
we can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Ligtenberg do Hoffman's job? After the All-Star break,
Hoffman converted 29 of 30 save opportunities with a 1.03 ERA. At
the same time, Ligtenberg, closing for a team that led the majors
in complete games, converted 21 of 23 with a 1.13 ERA. That violin
does not screech.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know them,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said. ``They've all heard of Trevor Hoffman and Mark Wohlers but
these guys can get the job done. And they got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The style has varied far more than the substance. Towers warned
his bullpen in the middle of last season that performance had to
improve. It did not and within a year, Sean Bergman, Doug Bochtler,
Tim Worrell and Pete Smith were all gone. Miceli, Donne Wall and
Brian Boehringer were all dealt for, and Myers was plucked from the
waiver wire Aug. 6 (just before the Braves had a shot at him).
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of good arms,'' Miceli said of spring training.
``They had an established closer, and you build around Trevor,
learn off him and take his lead. Our guys learned off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five have posted 20-save seasons, giving the Padres
a closer mentality long before the ninth. They struck out 389 in
421 innings, and in addition to Hoffman's NL-record 53 saves, they
won a major-league high 31 games. Dating back to July 24, 1996, the
Padres are 174-0 when leading in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've got is guys who throw strikes,'' said Towers,
``guys who have more than one pitch, sliders or forkballs, guys who
have more than one above average pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were not quite so picky when the team convened in
February. From the bullpen that broke camp, only Ligtenberg and
43-year-old marvel Dennis Martinez remain. Adding hard-throwing
rookies John Rocker and Odalis Perez (major league experience: 10
games) to Rudy Seanez, who hadn't appeared in the majors since
1995, Cox had a group of fastballers.
</P>
<P>
   The missing ingredient came in through the clubhouse window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the portrayal or the way people were talking
about our bullpen,'' said Martinez, whose two saves this year gave
him a total of three in the last 12 years. ``I didn't enjoy it and
I know the others didn't. Everyone was hollering to the roof and we
thought we didn't deserve that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we should be treated that way as pitchers and
when we took it that way, I think it became more of a positive
mode. We tried to prove everyone wrong, try to make things happen
and to prove we could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   They will get no better chance this month. Since the night Jim
Leyritz took Mark Wohlers deep in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series,
Atlanta relievers have not allowed an earned run, a span of 18
innings that has done nothing to remedy the franchise's bullpen
stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody notices until they give up a run,'' said John Smoltz.
``They didn't give up a run to the Florida Marlins, didn't give up
a run to the Cubs. But all we got is a maligned bullpen, untested.
It's a shame. Maybe they can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   They can now. Those are the bells of October and they ring for .
. . whom?

 &HT;    Joyner says it's good to be back in October
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wally Joyner hasn't played in a league championship
series since 1986, when his California Angels lost to Boston. And
the Redan High graduate has never returned to his old stomping
grounds in a baseball uniform after September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wondered what it was like in October here,''
Joyner said Tuesday, before the Padres' workout at Turner Field.
``It's fun to be back. It's fun still to be playing. We thought in
spring training that this team was good enough to go somewhere in
October. We had a very good series against the Astros, played very
well, our pitchers were incredible and they won the (division)
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner, whose immediate family no longer lives in the area, will
start at first base. His earlier shoulder problems are no longer a
concern, and the left-hander's bat is needed against Braves
right-handed pitcher John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out and do the job,'' said Joyner, who is ranked
second in baseball with a .412 average with runners in scoring
position. ``It's not going to be handed to us. The thing about
Atlanta is they have a game plan. If it's not working, instead of
panicking the first couple or three innings, they're going to stay
with it. What they know is eventually it's going to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on the mound
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown said he was ready and willing to throw, but the
Padres opted to go with Andy Ashby for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kevin was more rested, because he is our ace, he would have
been the guy,'' said pitching coach Dave Stewart. ``He said,
`Whatever you need me to do, I'll do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, this would have been Brown's third consecutive start on
the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he did it, he was outstanding,'' Stewart said.
``His second time out, I thought he threw the ball with great
velocity and had good stuff, but I thought his command was a little
bit off _ he walked five people. Even though he feels he is capable
of doing it, at some point we have to take responsibility as his
coach and his manager to look out for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is less accommodating with the media. He gave curt answers
about his Georgia Tech career in the clubhouse, then as he ran onto
the field he told a reporter, ``I've been turning everybody down,
it's a clean sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   On the mound
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was thrilled when Padres manager Bruce Bochy told him in
Houston that he would open the NLCS against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing for me is just control my emotions and
excitement to a point where I can go out and do my job and be
effective,'' Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Braves are similar to the Houston lineup in that
``they've got speed at the top and a lot of power. But I think the
main thing is just stay away from the big inning. . . . Bochy said
right-hander Joey Hamilton, who lives in Atlanta, is a possible
Game 4 starter, depending on whether he is used in the bullpen in
the first three games.

WORLD BANK CHIEF BREAKS RANKS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL ILLS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton argued anew Tuesday that ``we
must find a way to temper the volatile swings of the international
marketplace,'' the president of the World Bank publicly broke with
the approach that the United States and the International Monetary
Fund have taken in managing the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the finance ministers and central bank governors
from 182 nations meeting in Washington, World Bank president James
Wolfensohn said that in the rush to stabilize currencies and bring
about economic reform, too little attention was being paid to the
growing ranks of unemployed and the risks of undercutting political
stability. ``The poor cannot wait on our deliberations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn's warnings underscored the extraordinary dissension
and disagreements at this year's meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund over whether the strategy for stopping
the global turmoil has been misguided.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund and bank often disagree privately, Tuesday's
speech brought into the open months of tension between the two
sister institutions over the right strategy for dealing with the
crisis. The tension is so great that Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said Tuesday that the two huge institutions must to settle
their many differences.
</P>
<P>
   Little progress was made Tuesday on forging short-term
solutions. President Clinton, in his second speech on the world
economic crisis in two days, repeated his proposal that the major
nations of the world set up a ``precautionary lines of credit''
that would help countries that are taking the needed tough economic
steps but nonetheless are caught up in the wave of financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also said Tuesday that it was holding
preliminary discussions to schedule an emergency economic summit
meeting in London next month, as suggested by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, if it takes place, is intended to follow up on some
of the few concrete recommendations to have emerged from this
meeting. There is clear consensus for one: a series of global rules
on ``transparency,'' requiring countries to make public reports of
far more information about their foreign currency reserves and
other data that would tip off investors that trouble might be
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   There is far more dispute, however, over whether those rules
would also apply to private entities, especially hedge funds, the
huge investment pools that are blamed by many for exacerbating the
crisis with huge bets on the currencies of small countries. Nor is
there agreement yet on rules that would force big lenders _ banks
and other investors _ to pay a far greater share of the burden of
bailing a country out of financial trouble.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What we want to focus on are funds that attack a currency with
a view to toppling it,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, the finance
secretary of Hong Kong. But he said that there was still
considerable argument over how far governments should go in such
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debacle at LTC helped,'' he added, referring to Long Term
Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund that required
a Wall Street bailout two weeks ago, organized by the Federal
Reserve. ``Suddenly there was a recognition in this country that we
are all in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn, an Australian-born former investment banker known
for speaking his mind, painted a bleaker picture than did IMF
managing director Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in 1928,'' Camdessus declared Tuesday, with his
very comparison sending a chill through the vast hotel ballroom
where the officials of the 182 nations were meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep a steady nerve, if all countries pursue
stability,'' he insisted, the world will not slip into recession
and ``this crisis can be overcome.'' But he insisted that the
burden of economic reform falls on individual nations. And he made
specific reference to Russia, saying that the IMF could not resume
funding to the country until its new government embraces reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn's criticism of the IMF's to the crisis echoed a
frequent criticism heard during the meetings: that the focus on
stabilizing currencies and balancing budgets, the usual IMF
prescriptions, was causing far too much pain to the poor and the
middle class. Wolfensohn contended that with millions of people
slipping below the poverty line in Indonesia and with many Russians
unable to afford basic commodities, the risks of political upheaval
are greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not have greater equity and social justice, there
will be no political stability,'' he said. ``And without political
stability, no amount of money put together in financial packages
will give us financial stability.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that before the world can turn to building what the
Clinton administration calls a ``new international financial
architecture,'' it must adjust its approach to the crisis so that
``mathematics will not dominate humanity.'`
</P>
<P>
   Without building political support for the bailout programs that
have led to government austerity and unemployment, Wolfensohn said,
``we may build a new international financial architecture. But it
will be a house built on sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn's critique struck to the heart of the complaints from
many nations _ especially Indonesia and Russia _ that have found
fault with the Fund's priorities. But officials of the IMF and the
U.S. Treasury _ which strongly influences its policy _ say that
Wolfensohn has not come up with alternatives that would reform sick
economies fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for the bank to play the good guy,'' said one
finance minister in Washington on Tuesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity, ``because helping the poor is a lot more popular than
convincing the Russians to collect their taxes and crack down on
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials here, though, describe the problems differently.
At a meeting of 22 nations with Clinton on Monday night, Thai
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda tried to focus the
discussion on short-term issues that need immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first is the drying up of all investment in the emerging
markets,'' he said in an interview this evening. ``And the second
is spurring growth in the largest countries,'' which buy the goods
of Thailand and other nations. Tarrin said that Clinton led ``a
very good discussion,'' but that ``we didn't get very far on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   European nations, Tarrin and other Asian leaders said, are
complacent, since they have been hurt the least by the global
troubles. He said they are immersed in the launch of their common
currency, the Euro. The spending limits European countries have
placed on themselves to make the currency strong has limited their
ability to spend more money to stimulate their economies, Tarrin
noted.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, he noted, is also limited, by his continuing effort
to get Congress to approve $18 billion to support the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a big limit on the U.S.'' Tarrin said, because
it has prevented Clinton from proposing any short-term cures that
involve spending more U.S. funds.

EX-WORKER WOUNDS SIX IN CITY HALL SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ A man armed with a pistol and years of anger
about his dismissal as a part-time city parks employee burst into a
meeting room at City Hall here Tuesday morning and opened fire,
wounding the mayor and two members of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a postal worker identified as Joseph L. Neale Jr., 48,
then barricaded himself in the room with Mayor Ron Loveridge and
several council members as the police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as the police began breaking open the locked door
with a crowbar and a sledgehammer, Neale opened fire through the
door, police said. Officers then stormed into the room, just off of
the council chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, three officers were wounded in the
hail of gunfire as the officials took cover. One officer, Sgt.
Wally Rice, a 20-year police department veteran, was hit in the
abdomen. Another officer was hit in the hand and a third was struck
by a round that slammed into the front of his bulletproof vest,
leaving him bruised but otherwise unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Chuck Beaty, 63, was shot in the face and
the shoulder; he was listed in critical but stable condition.
Loveridge was grazed by a bullet. Councilwoman Laura Pearson was
hospitalized with a hip wound; Councilwoman Terri Thompson was not
wounded but was treated for unspecified pain. None of the injuries
were considered life threatening, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neale was hit at least twice by police gunfire and fell to the
floor. He was taken to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Neale had been dismissed by the city in 1994 from his job at a
local community center, where he had established and coached a
chess team. Since then he has been fighting to get his position
back.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited team members from the struggling neighborhoods of
the city's East Side. He said he saw chess as a way to develop
young minds and keep youths off the streets and away from violence.
</P>
<P>
   Neale, who is black, sued the city in 1995 for wrongful
termination, citing age and race discrimination. The city denied
the charges and a judge dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   Neale also said that the city had tried to deprive him of his
right of free speech. That part of his case is scheduled to go to
trial on Oct. 19.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is unclear why Neale was fired, but during his several years
at the center, he was a prolific letter writer, asking local
merchants for donations to the chess team, The Press-Enterprise of
Riverside reported in an extra edition Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neale also sent copies of a 54-page letter he wrote to local,
state and federal officials, including President Clinton, bemoaning
what he said was the lack of educational and employment
opportunities for black and Hispanic teen-agers. In his suit, Neale
contended that he had been fired because of that letter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Neale had frequently been seen sitting quietly
in the back of the City Council chamber during council meetings,
The Press-Enterprise said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, several City Council members, the city manager and
the city attorney were in the room Tuesday morning, preparing for
the day's regularly scheduled council meeting, when Neale burst in
and began shooting, said police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surrealistic, something you would see in a movie,'' a
shaken Loveridge said shortly after being treated for the graze
wound to his shoulder. ``You realize you may not leave that room,
that may be your final testimonial, lying on the floor of that room
behind council chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the police not gone into the room when they did, ``there
very possibly would have been some deaths,'' said Police Lt. Pete
Esquivel. ``There was blood all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no metal detectors in the building. ``Prior to this,''
said Det. Steve Johnson, ``we never felt metal detectors were
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The month before Neale was fired from the youth center, he
received a letter from Loveridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am impressed with your personal effort to help the youth of
this community,'' the mayor wrote. ``You must have invested
hundreds of hours working with these young people and, it is
obvious you have reached many of them.''

HOUSE GOP MAY SOFTEN ON SPENDING TO CLEAR DECKS FOR CLINTON
INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With four days until temporary financing for the
government runs out, House Republican leaders Tuesday demonstrated
a new willingness to resolve several of the spending issues that
had pointed toward a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to keep the spotlight on the impeachment
investigation of President Clinton and are therefore eager to brush
away any matters that might interfere. They indicated Tuesday that
they intended to drop their hard-line positions on matters ranging
from less money for the International Monetary Fund to a weakened
Federal Election Commission to a denial of political amnesty for
40,000 Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these signals distressed House conservatives, who said
their leaders were sacrificing their principles to milk all
political advantage from the spectacle of impeaching the president.
But they ceded to their leaders' belief that if they could keep the
focus on impeachment, Republicans would win substantial majorities
in the November elections and then be able to push through their
conservative agenda next year with greater ease.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey led the way Tuesday saying he
was dropping his insistence on school vouchers in the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked away, for now, from my school-choice bill,'' he told
reporters. ``One of the reasons we are so comfortable with this is
that we know we will be back next year with an even larger majority
in both the House and Senate, and those things that perhaps we
don't get done this year, we can get done next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., said his provision to weaken the
Federal Election Commission ``could be dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said he ``could
support a compromise'' on amnesty for the Haitians, which he had
adamantly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The conciliatory moves came as Republican leaders prepared to
meet Wednesday with Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, in
the first high-level negotiating session on the spending bills,
which must be passed by midnight Friday to keep the government
running and performing functions like issuing Social Security
checks and keeping the national parks open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is movement,'' said Livingston, the chairman of the
appropriations committee. ``Tomorrow is a critical day.''
</P>
<P>
   With Senate passage Tuesday of the agriculture bill, Congress
has completed work on 5 of the 13 spending measures, with perhaps
two or three more in sight before Friday, when the stopgap bill
expires. Another stopgap measure would be necessary if lawmakers
went beyond the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he expected Congress to negotiate into the wee hours
Friday and into Saturday but to pass the spending bills in time for
Congress to depart Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members are eager to get home by Monday to campaign in local
Columbus Day celebrations and to avoid the blame they took at the
polls for partial government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans sounded somewhat less promising about
wrapping up on time. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told
reporters he was worried that the president wanted to veto some
bills to distract from his woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that they are thinking about a domestic `Wag
the Dog,' take advantage of, you know, some way to change the
subject or distract attention from the administration's problems by
not coming to an agreement on this omnibus bill,'' he said. He said
he had not talked to the president since Aug. 20 but that
Wednesday's meeting was important ``to see what they really care
about, if anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's skepticism reflects the fact that even as some issues
appear to be falling away, others remain to be resolved between the
House and Senate and then with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   One is the census, a seemingly arcane matter but one that both
parties seem ready to go to the mat over. Republicans want the
census to be based on an exact count of every citizen; Democrats
say that would miss millions of people in the inner cities and
rural areas and that the count should be based instead on
statistical sampling. The difference is crucial to both parties
because the census influences federal aid and helps determine the
drawing of congressional boundaries, which in turn influences the
makeup of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most bitter disputes have been between conservative
Republicans and their moderate counterparts. Conservatives, who
were balking over more than a dozen issues, essentially hoisted the
white flag Tuesday, offering a compromise to agree to keep the
government running but also asking that negotiations continue on
the matters most important to them.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of the 40-member
Conservative Action Team in the House, said conservatives were
worried that Republican leaders appeared intimidated by the
president's veto threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to the leadership that if they give up
everything to the president and the liberals, we're not sure
they're the right people to be leading us,'' McIntosh said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives are most concerned about breaking the spending
caps set in last year's balanced-budget agreement. They say that
Clinton's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending,
for matters like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the
year 2000 computer bug, are not true unforeseen emergencies and
should have been included in the president's budget request. They
want both Congress and the president to make cuts elsewhere in the
budget to make up for these nonemergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are also convinced that spending $18 billion on
the International Monetary Fund is a waste of money, but Democrats
are adamant that the money be provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to leave here without it,'' said Rep. David
Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the appropriations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders said they expected five spending bills
to be especially difficult to negotiate and that they would
probably be wrapped into one big omnibus package at the end of the
week and sent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The bills most likely to end up in that package, all of which
have drawn veto threats from the administration, have not yet been
agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators. Those bills would
finance the following departments and areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Commerce, State and Justice Departments. This bill includes
the census, perhaps the most contentious issue between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foreign Operations. This bill contains financing for the
International Monetary Fund and would restrict United States aid
for overseas family planning groups advocating abortion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service. The four
contentious provisions attached to this bill would block amnesty
for the 40,000 Haitians, require federal health plans to pay for
contraceptives for women who are federal employees, impose federal
standards for day care on state and local governments, and weaken
the Federal Election Commission by limiting the term of the general
counsel and staff director to four years, unless four of six
commissioners approved a re-appointment. Democrats said that
measure was aimed at removing the current general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, deeply divided over these issues, prevented the
House from debating this bill last week, and a conference Tuesday
failed to resolve anything, although various Republicans said later
that they could compromise on some provisions. Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., said the bill would have the best chance of passing if it
were stripped of everything except the measure for contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments.
This bill contains millions of dollars sought by the administration
for education programs, including 100,000 teachers and expanded
after-school and summer-school programs. It would also pay for fuel
assistance for low-income families and job-training programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interior Department. Republicans have attached provisions that
the president deems to be anti-environment.

GOP SAYS DEMOCRATS SHOULD RETURN $1.7 MILLION MORE IN CAMPAIGN
MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee investigating campaign finance
abuses has concluded in a report that the Democratic Party should
have returned up to $1.7 million more in potentially tainted
contributions than the $3.2 million the party gave back after
President Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by the Republican majority on the House
government Reform and Oversight Committee, said that investigators
had found hundreds of thousands of dollars in questionable
donations beyond the contributions returned by the Democrats, all
of which had come from well-known figures in the inquiry like James
Riady, head of the wealthy Indonesian banking empire, and John
Huang, the fund-raiser with close ties to the Riady family.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that the potentially illegal
contributions were made between 1992 and 1996 in the form of
donations funneled to a variety of entities like the Democratic
National Committee, Democratic state parties or other party
fund-raising committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again the DNC received information regarding the
illegality or inappropriateness of contributions but failed to take
the appropriate action of returning or disgorging them,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that when the Democratic National
Committee was unable to fully investigate a questionable
contribution, officials often chose to keep the money.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Democratic committee, Rick Hess, said that
the report's claims were wildly exaggerated and that the timing of
the release of the report was intended to damage Democrats in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican's claims are simply illegitimate,'' Hess said.
``The DNC has returned every donation deemed illegal or
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is to be made public later this week, began
circulating Monday evening on Capitol Hill as the committee
distributed the document to lawmakers on the panel. It reflects
months of work by a Republican-led committee frequently shattered
by partisan fights.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has been expected for weeks, is being made
public as members of Congress weigh whether to expand the
impeachment inquiry approved on Monday by the House Judiciary
Committee beyond the issues stemming from President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report does not accuse Clinton of engaging in wrongdoing
or of knowing of any specific crime nor does it accuse him of
committing an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, congressional aides said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
the committee chairman, would send the report to the Justice
Department and the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that $600,000 beyond the amount returned
by the Democrats was clearly improper and another $1.1 million
highly suspect, based on the investigators' analyses of bank
records, wire transfer reports and statements by witnesses who
appeared before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has repeatedly attacked Clinton. It was Burton who led
the committee's vote to cite Attorney General Janet Reno with
contempt for her refusal to turn over reports from FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance investigative team, urging her to
seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to look into how
the Democrats financed Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The Burton committee report complained that it was unable to
fully examine the facts because nearly 120 witnesses refused to
cooperate or fled the country. The committee faulted the White
House for delaying the campaign finance inquiry and it criticized
foreign governments for what the panel called a ``a total lack of
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess, the spokesman of the Democratic National Committee,
complained that the Republican majority on the panel had produced a
tract intended to damage the Democrats in the midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is going to adjourn this weekend so he's got to get
this out there,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Binger, chief of staff of the Burton committee,
dismissed the accusation that the report, an interim document that
could be augmented later, was timed for its political impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have published this report a long time ago if we had
had more cooperation from the DNC and the White House,'' Binger
said.

GOP FUND-RAISING TACTIC TARGETING DOCTORS: BAIT AND SWITCH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn
Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete,
even as a registered Democrat. ``Speaker Newt Gingrich's office,''
it said, was calling to discuss a ``national leadership award.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rymer has won acclaim as the director of a prominent
stroke-treatment center, but this proposition seemed particularly
grand. When she returned the call, she said she was told she would
also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee to advise
Gingrich on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Too good to be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have to pay her own
way if the committee should actually meet, and as an honorary
committee chairman, she discovered, she would be a member of a
committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to
``help our efforts,'' according to a transcript of a similar chat
with another doctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns
out that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which
supports candidates for the House, has been sponsoring similar
calls to tens of thousands of small-business owners, including
doctors. With this and other fund-raising programs, the committee
says it has amassed $62 million for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign finance watchdogs say the solicitations mark a new
departure in political fund raising, one they call akin to the
practices of marketing companies like the Publishers' Clearing
House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar windfalls
to induce them to subscribe to magazines. By citing the speaker and
promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls are a
bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who might
otherwise hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. So was Dr. Stanley Turecki, a
child and family psychiatrist in New York who votes as an
independent and was also called. ``I was absolutely outraged,'' he
said. ``Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category
of consumer fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election
law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, said,
``I have never heard of that particular device.'' But it doesn't
appear illegal, he said, adding, ``It's a fund-raising gimmick to
get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit,
nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, ``This is a
new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer
beware.''
</P>
<P>
   When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations.
``But this isn't going to be investigated because it's members of
Congress who are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any
complaints and that there was no intent to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national leadership award is a part of what we call donor
and member fulfillment,'' Harris said. ``It's part of bringing them
into the process. It's important that they be recognized for the
support they give the party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no quid pro quo'' that people solicited could receive
awards for past contributions, he added.
</P>
<P>
   What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki is the message left with
secretaries and answering machines invoking Gingrich's ``office''
and proposing the award. They say they envisioned a senior aide at
a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The calls, however, are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by any
of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people
with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management
Corp., a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate
1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. ``Every word in the
script is approved by our clients,'' the company says on its Web
site. ``Every conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful
rebuttal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides telemarketing for businesses, said Jamie Blair, a
supervisor at the center, ``we specialize in helping the Republican
Party and conservative political groups.''
</P>
<P>
   However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers are
instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional
Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor in Kansas City, Mo., who is a registered Republican and
who declined to be named, dialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644)
left on answering machines and secretly recorded the ensuing
discussion, which is legal in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker,'' says
a woman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy.
``He is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by
as much as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut
capital gains to a single rate of 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   To assure passage of the legislation, the speaker wants to
increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, ``To help us do
that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals such
as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on his
advisory council.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy continues: ``There will be correspondence with the
speaker, such as conference calls. It's a great way that he can get
your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern you. Or
maybe surveys or questionnaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Nancy says: ``As a member of his committee, you would be
receiving from the speaker our national leadership award, which is
really quite an honor. And to be honest, he will be asking each of
our chairmen if they could help our efforts to increase our
majority with a one-time contribution of $500 or $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that would be used on the nationwide media campaign that
Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really need. And as
someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could I tell the
speaker he could count on your help?''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor demurs. ``I am a registered, you know, Republican in
Kansas,'' she tells Nancy. ``Probably if I were to do something it
would be to go through my own representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy is located. ``Is
this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking to?'' the
doctor asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy. ``This is the speaker's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That I'm talking to,'' says the doctor, double-checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' Nancy replies.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits political fund-raising calls from federal
offices. Vice President Al Gore is under a Justice Department
investigation for fund-raising calls he allegedly made from his
office in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the calls can be made from just about anywhere else,
including campaign offices. Harris said the calls are ``in no way
related to the speaker's OFFICIAL office.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What is more important is not where the calls get
routed. People are more interested in an award with the speaker's
good name on it than whether the call gets routed to Washington or
Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Turecki disagrees. ``I see it as basic sleaze,'' he said.

MARK BELANGER, 54, ORIOLES SHORTSTOP KNOWN FOR FIELDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass., N.Y., Calif.)   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Belanger, the smooth-fielding Baltimore Oriole
shortstop of the 1970s who won eight Gold Glove awards, died
Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
Belanger, who lived in New York, was 54.
</P>
<P>
   He developed pneumonia after having suffered from cancer,
according to the Major League Baseball Players Association, for
whom Belanger had worked since his playing days ended in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't much of a hitter _ his career batting average was .228
and he had 20 homers in 18 seasons _ but Belanger was the premier
fielder among the American League shortstops of his era. Displaying
excellent range, quick hands and a strong arm, he captured the Gold
Glove award in 1969 and 1971 and then won it for six consecutive
years, beginning in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by the Orioles for a $35,000 bonus out of Pittsfield
(Mass.) High School, Belanger sparkled in his first professional
season, in 1962. ``When I first managed Mark at Bluefield in the
Rookie League, I could see he was a natural,'' Billy Hunter, a
former major league infielder and later an Oriole coach, would
recall. ``At 18 there wasn't much anyone could teach him about
playing shortstop. If anything, he was too smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Belanger considered himself better at basketball
than baseball, and he later said that his ability to move so well
laterally stemmed partly from basketball, where he reacted
instinctively. He also credited Ron Hansen, a Baltimore shortstop
in the early 1960s, with helping him get a jump on batted balls.
``He taught me to stand up straight and then take a few short steps
in as the ball is pitched,'' Belanger explained.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger played with the Orioles from 1965 to 1981 and appeared
in four World Series. In the early 1970s, he was part of an
outstanding infield that had Brooks Robinson at third, Davey
Johnson at second and Boog Powell at first. He was a link in an
Oriole tradition of superb shortstops, taking over for Luis
Aparicio and giving way to Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger felt that his Orioles career ended the day in September
1981 when he publicly criticized manager Earl Weaver. ``I ripped
Earl for not managing basic baseball,'' he said. ``I said that I
thought he'd lost a lot of his managing prowess and that it was not
something that had just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that soon after that, general manager Hank Peters told
him the club ``had decided to go with young kids'' and did not plan
to sign him. The Orioles did, however, give him a night in his
honor before he left as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1982, then retired.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger had been the Orioles' player representative and was
among four players who negotiated alongside the union staff, headed
by Marvin Miller, in the 1981 strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an education,'' he said during the talks, ``and
I may be able to use some of it. I have had a course in negotiating
_ free, but expensive, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger put his education to use upon retiring as a player and
had been a special assistant to the union's current executive
director, Donald Fehr. He was a liaison to the players, gathered
data on player contracts and planned the union's annual executive
board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia; two sons, Robert and
Richard; his parents, Edward and Marie Belanger; a brother, Al, and
two sisters, Jeanne Heil and Linda Thornton. &QL;

NBA PLAYERS COURT PUBLIC AS CAMPS STAY CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a
striking longshoreman demanding health benefits. ``I'm not going to
try and put it in dollars and cents.'' But Ewing, president of the
National Basketball Association Players Association, played the
public-relations game Tuesday by expounding on the themes of labor
unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin, players
from across the country held news conferences in 14 NBA cities to
proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the public that we, as players, want to
play,'' said Ewing, who was flanked by five teammates. ``Today is
supposed to be the start of training camp. We want to practice and
we want the season to start. But unfortunately, the owners have
locked us out and the season has been postponed.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners and players are scheduled hold their first bargaining
session since Aug. 6 on Thursday in Manhattan. Neither side is
predicting progress toward signing a new collective bargaining
agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on Monday.
Next week, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season
games in league history.
</P>
<P>
   With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion annual
income should be distributed, both sides have privately said they
don't expect to play a regular season game before December.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer
of hope. He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick
resolution. Standing a few feet away from Ewing, he said, ``I hope
the owners and commissioner have gotten the message: that we're
serious about a deal. I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. I don't
think we're that far off. I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of
rhetoric and a lot of games being played. But if and when the
owners decide they want a deal, then they'll get one.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, he began lambasting the owners' latest proposal,
which includes the eventual phasing out of the Larry Bird exception
_ the clause that enables free agents to earn unlimited salaries
from their current teams. That clause represents the major rift in
negotiations. Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary
cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can
earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy
resolution,'' Ewing said. ``They're entrenched with what they want,
which is a hard cap. And we feel with a hard cap, we as players,
cannot survive. We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept
that deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunter, ``If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke.
It's a step backwards. I cannot understand it. If the intent was to
reach an agreement at this late stage or to negotiate in earnest,
this was the wrong way to go about it.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials did not respond to the players' comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're trying
to take that away from us,'' Ewing said. `There's a perception that
we're on strike. It's the other way around. We've been locked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ewing, the other Knicks included former union president
Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston
and John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed up briefly. When the
media horde closed in, however, the third-year forward went to look
for his late-arriving teammates inside the practice facility. He
was stopped at the gym door, which was locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They locked us out,'' said Rockets forward Mario Elie.
``Everybody's got to get that corrected. It's not on us. They're
the ones that closed us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has elicited talks of possibly bringing in a
mediator in the coming weeks, as Major League Baseball did in 1994
to help solve its labor dispute. But the players are convinced
commissioner David Stern and the owners are set on testing their
resolve before any genuine headway can be made in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   That means missing paychecks in November, something Ewing said
the players are prepared to do. Both sides are still awaiting the
outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18.
Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more
than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should
be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Feerick's decision could give new leverage to one side. But if
the players lose the arbitration, more than 400 athletes _ many
with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations _
will have their allegiances instantly tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they want to see how strong we are,'' Ewing said.
``Based on the proposals we've received, we're very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it seems as though the NBA is dug in on their
position,'' Buck Williams said. ``I don't think they're too
concerned at this point about making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right
now.''

EDITORIAL: BUDGET SHOWDOWN IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere already bitter over impeachment proceedings,
President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders are heading
toward another nasty confrontation on the budget that threatens to
shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   In this dispute, however, the White House has a strong hand.
Despite his political problems, Clinton is right to insist on
legislation free of objectionable attachments to keep government
operations going past Friday. The most offensive riders under
consideration would damage natural resources, cut programs for
schools and the poor and impose mischievous new curbs on abortion
and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the latest battle is that Republicans in Congress
have been mired in their own budget disputes all year, with
hard-line conservatives favoring domestic spending cuts, moderates
loath to provoke a veto by Clinton and their leaders reluctant to
hand him a fight that draws attention from his sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Clinton's continued leverage, the Republicans caved
in Tuesday on the ill-advised $80 billion tax cut approved last
month in the House, which was to have been paid for out of this
year's budget surplus. The question now is whether they will come
to their senses on other destructive measures.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of grave financial crisis around the world, for
instance, it would be foolish to reject full funding for the
International Monetary Fund, which the Senate has already approved.
House Republicans should also back down on cuts in education
programs, fuel assistance for low-income people and gratuitous
gestures like the attempts to weaken the Federal Election
Commission or limit contraceptive coverage in federal employee
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As they have done in the past, Western Republicans in the Senate
have added more than 20 last-minute riders to the Interior
Department spending bill that would weaken protections for
fisheries, wilderness areas and national forests. House Republicans
have badly shortchanged the Everglades restoration program. Can
lawmakers be so out of touch that they would try to capitalize on
the president's political difficulties for a backdoor attack on the
environment?
</P>
<P>
   One of the more absurd contentions by Republicans is that they
need to cut programs to make funds available for such emergencies
as assistance to farmers, the troops in Bosnia and the crash
program to update the government's computers for the year 2000. But
Congress has long recognized that emergencies may be met without
cuts in spending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending and environmental areas, at least, Clinton has
set out the right priorities. He should stick to them even if it
means vetoing unacceptable legislation and provoking a fight that
lawmakers do not want.

IN BERLIN, A RESHUFFLING OF THE ARTISTIC DECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Almost 40 years ago, when I was a young journalist
working at NBC News, I bought a woodcut of a church from print
dealer Sylvan Cole. It showed a church tower, viewed as through a
disturbing prism. I recognized it as the work of Lyonel Feininger,
for whose art I had developed a no doubt superficial appreciation
while at college. The fact that it was an artist's proof and that
Feininger had inscribed it in pencil to his wife gave it added
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades now, I have looked at it every day,
except when I was traveling. It has hung on the wall of my studies
on four continents, and I find new things in it, new insights into
the distortions of the modern world, at least once a year. I long
ago learned that it depicted a church at Gelmeroda, and that
Feininger almost obsessively drew, painted and made prints of the
church for many years. But I never knew where Gelmeroda was.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day five years ago, my wife and I turned off a potholed
autobahn in southeastern Germany and headed into Weimar. A minute
or so later, I saw the sign _ small, simple, just the name
``Gelmeroda'' in black block letters. Could it be? I looked up, and
just to the left, over there above the trees, was my spire. I was
as excited as if I had stumbled into Brigadoon.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two hours south of Berlin, the church still
stands at the center of its higgledy-piggledy village. When I made
my discovery, the old East Germany was just dying. There were no
road markers, no plaques, no tourists. But times have changed. Now
there are signposts on the autoroute, brochures in the church
itself and concerts in the nave in the summer. We went to one,
given by young musicians from Heidelberg, one night last July.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification has reshuffled the artistic deck in Berlin, too.
The scaffolding surrounding the great Pergamon Altar, a masterpiece
of Hellenistic art from the 2nd century B.C., has come down. One of
the main attractions on the Museum Island, where other museums are
also under repair, it reopened to the public in August, cleaned and
restored, though work remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The big event of the summer was the opening in June of the new
Gemaldegalerie, or picture gallery, where the Prussian state
collection of Old Masters _ divided by the Cold War, like Berlin,
between East and West _ has been reassembled. The new building is
inoffensive from the outside, though it faces a windswept plaza
with all the charm of an airport concourse; inside, a vast, beige
central hall, filled mainly with columns, is more banal than
restful.
</P>
<P>
   Those are quibbles, though. The gallery, part of the
Kulturforum, neatly fills a gap between other museums, and when the
immense, multibillion-dollar construction project at nearby
Potsdamer Platz is completed in 2000, and the spindly little trees
have put on some heft, this area at the center of the new Berlin
will regain the focus and animation it had before allied bombers
and artillery devastated the city and the Wall knifed through the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   No museum has better Germanic pictures: Cranach, Holbein,
Memling and Duerer, including his almost supernaturally luminous
``Virgin and Child With the Finch.'' Van Eyck, Petrus Christus, van
der Weyden and other Netherlandish masters are abundantly
represented. First-rate Raphaels, Titians and Carpaccios as well,
to say nothing of the ``Man With the Golden Helmet,'' as popular
now that the savants say it's not by Rembrandt as when they said it
was.
</P>
<P>
   And less than a block away, in Mies van de Rohe's New National
Gallery, my man Feininger was having his days in the sun as well.
</P>
<P>
   Feininger was forever betwixt and between. Born in New York in
1871, the son of prominent classical musicians, he spent 50 years
in Germany, returning to the United States, an awkward stranger in
his native land, when the Nazis came to power. They posed a threat
to Feininger's art, which they classified as ``degenerate,'' and to
his wife, Julia, who was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliated with the Bauhaus throughout its troubled existence in
Weimar, Dessau and Berlin, he at the same time admired and
sometimes emulated two great romantic painters, the Englishman
J.M.W. Turner and the German Caspar David Friedrich. He was a
contemporary and friend of the artists of the Blaue Reiter and the
Bruecke, especially Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, though like Max Beckmann
he held himself aloof from the mainstream of German Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   The retrospective in Berlin, which ran through Oct. 11, opens
Nov. 1 in the Haus der Kunst in Munich, where is will remain until
Jan. 24, shows Feininger encountering and digesting these
influences and many more. More than 130 works, including most of
the artist's major canvasses from European and American museums,
have been brought together in a show that displays Feininger's
characteristic crystalline forms to remarkable effect.
</P>
<P>
   This is reality disassembled and reconstructed, as in the Cubist
pictures by Braque and Picasso that Feininger saw at the Salon des
Independants in 1911. But in his hand, Cubism became something very
different. Colors are more vivid, forms are more angular, and the
subjects of the paintings _ a church or a bird, a bridge or a ship
_ retain their basic outlines more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   As his main motifs, Feininger chose large, public, architectonic
objects, unlike the small, domestic, painterly objects _ guitars
and pipes and water carafes _ favored by the Cubists. That was the
Bauhaus influence at work, as was his vibrant pallette, which
reflected his close relationship with the skilled colorist Johannes
Itten, another pioneering Bauhaus instructor.
</P>
<P>
   It was while working in Weimar before World War I that Feininger
first spotted the little church in Gelmeroda. He wrote at the time:
``There are church towers in God-forsaken places that are among the
most mystical things I know of.'' He was impressed by the surreal
character of the old building, and especially the wooden tower, as
sharp as a fencer's epee, with a clock face on one of its sides.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some early Gelmeroda paintings, the church looks like a giant
wearing a helmet, with the clock face a single eye, gleaming
green-blue. Later, the rustic Gothic building takes on a modern
form, as glisteningly transparent as the Crystal Cathedral in
Orange County, Calif., as structurally pure as Mies at his best.
Idealizing the primitive, Paradox cloaks it in machine-age garb.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven Gelmerodas in the show, including three
especially luminous images from American museums, one each from the
Metropolitan and the Guggenheim in New York and the Rhode Island
School of Design in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up painting ``as a jolly old gent of 36,'' as he himself
put it, after a successful career as a cartoonist, Feininger
brought to his new trade a gift for suggesting motion. ``The White
Man'' (1907) is an absurdly tall figure, hands in pockets,
shoulders slouched, loping like a stilt-walker through Paris. ``The
Bicycle Race'' (1912) seems about to burst out of its frame down
the road, with the hunched bodies of four riders depicted as
geometric, Futurist blocks of color above black slashes suggesting
the bikes' frames. ``The Bird Cloud'' (1926) has all the thrust of
a Concorde lifting off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Enthralled by things mechanical _ he rode a bicycle himself,
imagined space vehicles and studied locomotives _ Feininger turned
them into part of a fantasy world. Many of the earlier pictures,
and a few towards the end of the artist's life retain the
exaggeration of caricature, which verges on the grotesque. The
``Woman's Head with Green Eyes'' (1915), a feline portrait seen
from above, could be an advertisement for a revue at Isherwood's
Kit-Kat Club in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of World War I, or perhaps because of it, the
human figure has been de-emphasized in favor of transcendental
visions of sea, sky and sail, with thin blocks of color laid atop
one another, and prismatic views of churches and other buildings.
These are most successful, in my view, when Feininger was working
from memory, often long after last seeing a subject. Time and
distance refined impurities from the images, lending them an
otherworldly clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The series called ``Calm at Sea'' (1926-1929) shows Feininger at
his most commanding. In ``Calm at Sea II,'' three sailboats and
four figures on the shoreline in the foreground occupy perhaps a
tenth of the canvas; the real subject is the azure-blue sea and the
copper-hued sky. In ``Calm at Sea III,'' however, the focus is one
of three sloops, painted plum red against a sky divided by its
sails into blocks of gold and midnight blue.
</P>
<P>
   When Feininger tried working from photographs, as in a series of
portrayals of the city of Halle, the precision is there, but it
doesn't add up to nearly as much _ which is paradoxical, since
Feininger was a skilled photographer, and his brother, Andreas, was
one of the stars of Life magazine's photo team.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in New York in 1937, he at first refrained from
painting. But eventually he found in the skyscrapers and street
canyons of Manhattan some of the eerie romance he had felt decades
earlier in the alleys and the churches of Thuringia in southern
Germany. Using spidery lines that recall Mark Tobey and Paul Klee,
he painted canvases that reflected not only the menacing clamor
that he found in New York, but also something of its star-spangled
glamour.

WILLIAM KAPPELL: A LARGER, TRUER VISION OF A PASSIONATE MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time William Kapell died in a plane crash in October
1953, at 31, he had already come to be recognized as the finest
pianist America had produced. The popular pianists at the time were
foreign-born: Horowitz, Rubinstein, Brailowsky, Hofmann. Then
Kapell appeared, out of nowhere, it seemed, the son of a couple who
owned a bookstore on Manhattan's Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He was strong-willed, insecure, compulsive, combative, a
neurotically driven New Yorker. In photographs he looks a little
like Olivier in profile. As an artist he was stupefyingly gifted,
and everyone knew it. By his mid-20s he had a major career, a
contract with RCA Victor, dates with Ormandy, Stokowski, Reiner,
Monteux and Steinberg. His recording of the Khachaturian's Concerto
with Koussevitzky became a jukebox hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then he died, and as often happens, the fame faded. His
recordings went out of print by 1960, and after that, only a few
were occasionally available. Pianists still talked of him as an
icon who had paved the way for the first generation of Americans to
make a mark on the international scene _ Kapell was Van Cliburn's
hero, for example, and many of those who heard Kapell in concert
could, half a century later, still recall the experience as if it
were yesterday _ but the public mostly forgot him.
</P>
<P>
   So a new boxed set of nine CDs, containing not only previously
released commercial recordings but also numerous recordings never
before issued (RCA Red Seal 09026-68442-2), should come as a
revelation to many. It is a landmark among piano recordings, and I
suspect that anyone who hears Kapell for the first time will find
his playing simply mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   We are confronted here with an artist we now recognize as
modern. He was a modern pianist of his generation, as Rubinstein
was in the previous generation. Virgil Thomson once said that
Kapell ``was afraid of nobody because his heart was pure.'' What
made him modern wasn't just the fact that over the objections of
his cautious managers he championed living American composers and
played their music with conviction. It was also that in the context
of Lhevinne, Cortot, Friedman and other performers of the Romantic
and virtuosic repertory whose esthetic roots were still in the late
19th century, Kapell represented a different approach: his
performances were close to the score, balanced, architecturally
sound while still being passionate.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly passionate. He had one of the great electrifying
techniques (not even Horowitz played Liszt with more wry gusto),
but he was in the end a poet. Dinu Lipatti, the ultimate
pianist-poet, who also died young, makes a useful point of
comparison: roughly the same age as Kapell, he played with a
divine, almost unreal perfection and a precise moderation that we
might now call post-Romantic, but he was a more strictly lyrical
pianist than Kapell, whose style encompassed a singular degree of
raw, demonic energy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recorded interview, excerpted on one of the new disks,
Kapell remarks how an ``older school'' of pianists ``overplays the
so-called Romantic aspects'' of Chopin. He says that they favor
``excessive rubati and a general weakening of the form more than
anything else, and a weakening of transitional, cadential strengths
in the music.'' Then, quickly, he adds, ``the danger is too much
objectivism, so to speak.'' And this, in a nutshell, was Kapell's
genius: always, or almost always, to grasp the necessary balance,
which is why pianists like Schnabel (who taught him for a while)
and Rubinstein (with whom he had an on-and-off friendship) could
claim him as an heir.
</P>
<P>
   John Pfeiffer, one of his producers, once described how Kapell
would do take after take after take in the studio, sometimes dozens
at a time. ``There was never a moment when you could just sit down
and relax and enjoy the atmosphere or anything of that sort,''
Pfeiffer said. ``It was all extremely intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other great artists, Kapell was a perfectionist. He
practiced eight hours a day, even on the day of a recital. He
recorded Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Prokofiev, Khachaturian and
Beethoven. But some pieces that he performed he never recorded
commercially, because he didn't get around to them or he felt he
wasn't yet ready. Others he recorded, but the recordings were never
released: evidently, he found them unacceptable or they were not
complete (a Bach partita with the gigue missing).
</P>
<P>
   So his recordings languished in the BMG/RCA vaults until Jon M.
Samuels, the producer of the new set, began to hunt through them.
He discovered a trove of fresh material. Some private recordings
turned up, along with an invaluable tape of a WNYC radio broadcast
of a Kapell recital at the Frick Collection in 1953, which included
Copland's Piano Sonata, the only recorded performance of the piece
by Kapell.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels put together a variety of music in addition to what had
previously been released: works by Bach, Abram Chasins, Debussy,
Mozart, Scarlatti, Schubert, Schumann and so on. There were also
cello and violin sonatas with William Primrose and Jascha Heifetz.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What results is, if not a radically new vision of Kapell, a much
larger, truer sense of his legacy, and a moving portrait of a young
musician in the midst of change.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, we hear Kapell playing different versions of the
same work. Compared with his 1947 recording of a Schumann Romance,
the version he recorded in 1949 sounds much smoother, more serene,
with gorgeous long lines and a steady beat. One version of a Bach
allemande is grave and heartbreaking; another, earlier one is
brisker, less reflective. Kapell was turning more to Bach before he
died, and the affinity was so natural, the playing so original
(listen to his D major Partita) that had he lived, he might have
reshaped the public's notion of Bach's keyboard music as much as
Gould did (and Kapell was never willful).
</P>
<P>
   What if? Kapell since his death has been one of music's
conspicuous what if's. He would now be 76, so it is conceivable
that he might still be playing. The set shows an evolving
sensibility, one that had not always perfectly formed. Having
established himself in big Romantic music, he took sabbaticals to
study Mozart and Schubert, and what we hear in his recordings of a
couple of movements from Mozart sonatas, for example, is charming
but precious and unsteady. Kapell couldn't play an unmusical note,
but he doesn't yet wholly inhabit this music either.
</P>
<P>
   One attribute of the set is that it includes music, like the
Mozart, with a few slipped notes and unresolved ideas, which,
paradoxically, make the young Kapell seem more impressive. He is
revealed to be an artist in progress: spontaneous, thinking, taking
risks, sometimes impatient; nothing is ever automatic or dull.
</P>
<P>
   And to judge from his performance of the Beethoven Second
Concerto (with Vladimir Golschmann and the NBC Symphony), he was
capable of playing the Classical repertory as well as anyone. I can
imagine that he might have become a Mozart and Schubert player akin
to Clifford Curzon, given time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he didn't have time. About what he did do, I take for
granted the basics: that his performances of Chopin and the
Russians are among the best on record. There isn't a more Herculean
or amusing version of ``Pictures at an Exhibition'' than the one
here from the Frick recital. Kapell, unlike most pianists, plays
``The Great Gate of Kiev'' as marked, Allegro alla breve, not
pompously slow. ``The Ballet of the Chicks,'' besides being fast
(he plays it presto then adds an accelerando), is a riot.
</P>
<P>
   What is not often said about Kapell is that he could be very
funny. His version of several Shostakovich preludes manages to
sound wicked and jaunty while somehow remaining, deep down,
melancholic. The Chopin mazurkas are full of wit and variety. He
brings to the second theme of the one in C major (Op. 33, No. 3),
for example, a kind of quizzical tone, moderated, not forte, as
marked; and to the familiar Mazurka in G sharp minor (Op. 33, No.
1), just enough reserve to make you hear it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for his version of Rachmaninoff's
Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with Reiner and the Robin Hood Dell
Orchestra. The work's hackneyed slow variation comes across with
such restrained emotion and elegance that it made me weep.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens Kapell wrote in his diary in 1943, on the day
Rachmaninoff died, that he ``worked a couple of hours on the
`Paganini Rhapsody' and cried all the way through it because I
realized that the great master was no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added what we might also say about him, through these
recordings: ``I am comforted that every day I can open the covers
of some wonderful and magic world that he expressed in music. He
shall never die for those who can play his works or for those
fortunate enough to want to hear them.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans' chief investigative counsel said
Tuesday that his recasting of the possible impeachment case against
President Clinton was not intended to diminish the charges proposed
to Congress by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative counsel David Schippers explained in a briefing
Tuesday that in his presentation on Monday to the House Judiciary
Committee, he had made a judgment call to omit Starr's assertion
that Clinton had abused the power of his office by invoking various
legal privileges. But Schippers, a former prosecutor, virtually
called on the committee to investigate further, saying the abuse of
power accusation was still ``something that should be looked into
in an inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, a Democrat who will be the Republicans' senior aide
in the investigation of the president, had expanded the list of
possibly impeachable offenses to 15 from the 11 presented by Starr,
and included a broad new accusation of a conspiracy to obstruct
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in omitting two of Starr's most controversial charges _
abuse of power and obstruction of justice when Clinton delayed
appearing before a grand jury _ Schippers said he ``did not intend
in any way to cast doubt'' on Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts and House Democrats said Schippers, by
referring to false statements under oath instead of to perjury, had
turned to less serious charges requiring a lower threshold of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be a fallback on the part of the Republicans
by charging acts that are easier to establish,'' said Jeffrey
Weiner, a Miami lawyer and past president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``But it could backfire
because the question becomes, `Do these lesser crimes rise to the
level of a high crime or misdemeanor?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers said Tuesday that he had chosen specific language
to make the case ``a little more understandable'' and that he was
still looking at violations of perjury statutes. He also noted that
some aspects of the case, particularly his exploration of whether a
conspiracy had been committed, could be more difficult to prove
than a straightforward charge.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the conspiracy charge, Schippers said ``there was
evidence tending to prove'' that at least the president and Monica
Lewinsky had conspired to obstruct justice by giving false
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of where the congressional inquiry is likely to move,
Schippers said he believed that several other individuals were
involved in the conspiracy but did not have sufficient evidence to
name them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he bolstered his conspiracy accusation by using phone
logs compiled by Starr's office that documented a flurry of calls
back and forth shortly after Clinton's deposition in the Jones case
on Jan. 17. The calls were between the president, his friend Vernon
Jordan, his secretary Betty Currie; the White House counsel's
office; and Ms. Lewinsky's pager. Democrats say the calls were
simply efforts at political damage control because of an expected
spate of news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have accused Starr of omitting from his report
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony before a grand jury that no one had told
her to lie about her relationship with Clinton and that no one
promised her a job for her silence when she filed a false affidavit
in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one asked her to tell the truth, either,'' Schippers said.
``Based on my reading of the record, `no one asked me to lie' is a
term of art.''
</P>
<P>
   While he provided a framework for the investigation into
Clinton, several Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said
Tuesday that the committee _ and not Starr or Schippers _ would
ultimately decide what charges, if any, would be brought against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bound by either interpretation,'' said Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., a former judge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former federal prosecutor, said:
``There are three major areas here, allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice, abuse of power. Any good prosecutor might
break that down in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that despite Schippers' detailing of 15 charges
against the president, Republicans still had a political problem
because the charges all revolved around Clinton's efforts to cover
up his affair.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said of the 15 possible charges:
``It looks like a recipe book with 15 ways to cook spinach. But
it's still about spinach. This is still about sex.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Democrats and legal experts also said Schippers had
stretched in making some charges. They pointed to the charge that
Clinton might have engaged in ``misprision'' of a felony in Ms.
Lewinsky's submitting a false affidavit. The crime is a common law
crime against someone who knows a felony has been committed and
fails to report it to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, the Miami lawyer, said that while the charge was still a
federal crime, it was no longer used in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though many lawyers don't know what this is because it's
so rare,'' he said, ``the Republicans must be using this because
it's so simple to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers Tuesday that such a crime was ``charged quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Michael Fortier, who had not warned anyone of the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, pleaded guilty to misprision of
felony. Fortier had heard of the bombing plot from his friend,
Timothy McVeigh, but did not tell the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   And in a high-profile case in Louisiana on Tuesday, San
Francisco 49ers co-owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty to
misprision of a felony for failing to tell the authorities about a
supposed plan by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards to extract
payoffs for a riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers rebutted the suggestion that he had stacked up several
felony charges for the same action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aiding and abetting a felony,'' he said, ``is different than
committing the felony yourself.''

DISNEY TAKEOVER OF ANGELS BALLCLUB LIKELY AFTER AUTRY'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. is expected to take full control
of the Anaheim Angels by next baseball season after last week's
death of longtime owner Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant bought a 25 percent interest in the club
in May 1995 for an estimated $30 million from the husband-and-wife
team of Gene and Jackie Autry. The deal made Disney managing
partner of the American League team and included an option to buy
the remaining 75 percent once Gene Autry died.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokesman said Autry's passing triggered a 180-day
period in which Disney can exercise the option.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said no decision had been made yet, but sports
consultant David Carter believes Disney will buy the rest of the
team. ``It will be very routine for Disney to exercise the option
because they already have the operating rights,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Bonham, president of the Denver-based Bonham Group sports
consulting company, agreed. ``It's almost guaranteed that Disney
would make a serious attempt to buy the rest of the franchise,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has never disclosed terms for the 1995 deal, but its
payment for the full franchise is likely to represent a major
bargain. Prices for baseball teams have soared in recent years due
to the increasing value placed on sports programming by operators
of TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports still delivers that coveted 18-to-34-year-old male
demographic,'' Carter said. ``Professional sports is the best place
to find that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, based in suburban Burbank, owns the ESPN sports networks
and has operated the Mighty Ducks hockey franchise in Anaheim since
1992. It is paying a whopping $9.2 billion for eight years of
broadcast rights for pro football games on ABC and ESPN, and
recently agreed to spend an estimated $600 million for five years
of National Hockey League broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmarks for franchise values jumped earlier this year with
News Corp.'s $311 million purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers and
$1 billion buyout of the Manchester United soccer team, along with
the $530 million paid for the Cleveland Browns football franchise.
Cablevision Systems recently made a reported $500 million offer for
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can definitely say that the $30 million that Disney paid
in 1995 was a terrific deal,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham said the recent sales of franchises have thrown the
market into chaos because of the recognition that franchises can be
used as part of an overall corporate strategy to achieve sales and
marketing goals.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said it is likely that Disney's final price will include
credit for the estimated $70 million it spent renovating Anaheim
Stadium, which has been renamed Edison International Field. Total
value of the Angel franchise is probably in the $200 million range,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham said the franchise is worth $150 million
``conservatively, factoring in the sale of the Dodgers and
refurbishment of the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham also said it was likely that the 1995 deal included a
provision to determine the price for the remaining 75 percent. ``I
would not have allowed my client to sign an agreement without a
valuation formula,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry bought the Angels for $2.5 million before the team's
inaugural season in 1961. The club won division titles in 1979,
1982 and 1986 but was never able to advance to the World Series.

RECALLING BETTY CARTER, MENTOR TO A GENERATION

   (italics)Jazz singer, composer, arranger nonpareil _ Betty
Carter, who died on Sept. 26 at the age of 69, was all these
things. But along with her own music, she leaves another
significant legacy with the musicians she nurtured, the careers she
helped shape. Over the last two decades, her band was an incubator
for jazz talent, and many young musicians who honed their skills
with Ms. Carter are now making their mark as leaders. With the
death of the drummer Art Blakey in 1990, Ms. Carter became the dean
of what insiders considered jazz's finest university. Here, eight
almuni recall the lessons they learned from a beloved teacher and
inspiring taskmaster. (Their ages and time spent with Ms. Carter
are noted below their names.)(end italics) Fletcher Roberts &QL;

   BRUCE FLOWERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist, 28. 1996-98 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Betty had a way that she liked to tell us how to play ballads.
We'd get finished playing something really fast and furious and
then we'd be trying to play a love song. And one night we were
playing, I think it was ``You Go to My Head.'' And right in the
middle of taking a solo, she comes over to the piano and she
whispers to me, ``Make love.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time I ever heard her say that, so I cracked
up. But it really made me aware that this wasn't about a show of
technique or anything complicated. It was just about the emotion.
And then right after that she said, ``for the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is just to bring home the point that music is also for
females. She would always talk about that. And how if you really
want to reach everybody, you've got to think about women and
include them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACKY TERRASSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist, 32. 1993-94 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We used to do this tune, ``Lover Man,'' a duo, just me and her.
There was no particular arrangement, but every time we would try to
take it to another direction, and that was what we were looking
for, the mystery. I remember one time I was kind of playing some of
the obvious changes, and she was like ``uh, uh, uh, uh.''
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to make sure that we stayed in the area where we
weren't very sure where we were going to go and where it really
kept spontaneity going. She didn't want me to play the obvious
chord or the obvious change. She would just turn back and go ``uh,
uh, uh,'' you know, like play that funny stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of what I like doing anyway, so I was really
grateful to be able to share that with a singer, because a lot of
singers don't really like that. But Betty Carter was not only a
singer, she was more like part of the band, especially since she
improvised so well.
</P>
<P>
   I've worked with a lot of singers and I would say she's probably
the most honest of all the singers I've worked with because in her
area she had it all. So she had nothing to prove, you know. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BENNY GREEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist, 35. 1983-87 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Betty had a reputation among musicians for having a bit of a
temper, but she could also show compassion. It was the summer of
'83. I'd been in her band for less than a year and I inadvertently
left her entire book of piano music in the back seat of a taxi in
the Village. And I didn't get a receipt from the driver.
</P>
<P>
   There was no name on the folder, no telephone number. There was
absolutely no way to recover this folio. And I called Betty that
evening, as soon as I got home. And Betty answered the phone, and I
said, ``Betty I have some bad news.'' And she said, ``What's wrong,
are you all right?'' I said: ``I'm fine, but I've lost your book of
piano music. It's gone. I left it in a taxi.'' Betty said: ``Oh,
O.K., as long as you're all right. We'll be able to put the music
back together.''
</P>
<P>
   I was just shocked, speechless. I think most people would have
panicked under the circumstance, and it was remarkable what a cool
head she kept. I think she cared about me and she treated me as
family. I think the side of her that I saw at that moment was there
for so many of her musicians. It's very easy to look at the surface
and see only a volatile personality. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   XAVIER DAVIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist, 27. 1994-96 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd been in the band about a week or so. We opened up for her
every night, whether it was the trio or quartet, if there was a
horn player. I decided this night we were just going to do a
standard called ``Remember.'' And so we didn't really have an
arrangement or anything, we were going to play the tune and just
try to swing and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   So we played it and we got through the whole show and everything
had actually been cool. I had heard that she could be hard to work
with, but I hadn't experienced any of that. She was always really
encouraging and everything.
</P>
<P>
   But that night, we were at this place called Catalina's Bar and
Grill in Los Angeles, and it's relatively small. The backstage was
separated from the dining area by just a little door. After the
performance, she came backstage and just went off on us. I don't
know if I can really say what she said in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   She said you can't just go out there and play a tune without
putting some thought into it. The audience doesn't just want to
hear a jam session. She said if you ever open up like that again
... I was like, Wow. I'm about to get fired. And I've only been in
the band about a week. Betty wanted us to respect the audience.
</P>
<P>
   As jazz musicians there's a large repertory of tunes that we can
just play. And everyone knows the tunes and you don't necessarily
have to rehearse to play these tunes. So when we played this tune,
we played it well and we enjoyed it and we were swinging and
everything. But we (italics)were(end italics) treating it like a
jam session.
</P>
<P>
   Betty was telling us to think about the fact that the audience
had paid money to see us, and even if we've done something a
hundred times, the audience is usually hearing it for the first
time. &QL;

   JAVON JACKSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saxophonist, 33. 1994 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was making my first album, ``When the Time Is Right,'' which
Betty was the producer of, and there was a particular composition
we were doing, a standard, ``If Ever I Would Leave You.'' And we
did it pretty straightforward, and after we finished everybody in
the recording area kind of thought we had a pretty good take, and
Betty comes in, as only she could, and said it was ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   And so we all kind of looked around, and she said, ``You know,
you guys have got to put more of you into it, make it a little bit
more distinctive in terms of your own delivery of it as a group.'
She suggested that maybe I do an intro and then go into the melody.
We did it again, and it was definitely a different version. I think
some of us probably still preferred the other version, but I began
to understand how unique musicians like Betty go at things.
</P>
<P>
   They try to find what is not there or the subtleties, really
trying to pull that out. And that was something that I learned from
that recording session. Betty was very, very unique, and she wanted
things to be as personal as possible. I think that experience has
helped me as a musician to try to be a little different. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WINARD HARPER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drummer, 36. 1984-88 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We really hit it off. I think it was because our work ethics
were kind of similar. We used to spend a lot of time together when
we were on the road, off the bandstand. She and I would sometimes
go to the movies together. Or shopping or just checking something
out.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one time in particular in New Mexico when I had
recently joined the band, Benny Green, Terry Shaw and myself and
her, we all went shopping. She took us to this hat shop in New
Mexico and everybody bought these black hats with wide brims.
Spending time together off the bandstand was important for me
because I wanted to understand her, her thinking, her approach to
music.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, for me, having some sort of camaraderie is a big part of
my playing because I like playing with people that I know, that I
have a lot of respect for. It's like you're all there trying to
create and make something that's of one mind and if you happen to
all be on the same wavelength or have some things in common, it
makes it much easier. And sometimes more magical. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CYRUS CHESTNUT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist, 35. 1991-93 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Betty always encouraged me to write a lot of music, try to come
up with something new, something different. Never just do something
just to get by or use tricks or gimmicks. One of her basic rules
was she didn't want to hear standards because she had already heard
them all.
</P>
<P>
   So one night I didn't think. I played the opening for ``If I
Were a Bell'' _ `ding-dong-ding-dong, ding-dong-ding-dong.'
(Laughs.) What did I do that for? Boy. Afterward she pulled me
aside and she gave me a lecture. She said: ``Why keep playing
something that's already been played? Why don't you think? You need
to think. I want people around me that think. Keep moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   So on and so on for half an hour. No one had ever jumped on me
with such great intensity before. So I mean it was like, you know,
Wow. But I always look at it like this: She knows what she wants
and she'll get it, I mean, you know, either pleasantly or
unpleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   She was in charge. No matter what we did, Betty was still in
charge. We may have opened up the set or whatever happened, but
when she came on, it was Betty time. And when she wanted something
different, boom, we were supposed to give it to her right then and
there. &QL;

   We'd just played in Slovenia, which was part of Yugoslavia. And
we were on our way to Verona, Italy. We were on a tour doing
one-nighters, like six weeks of one-nighters. We had crossed the
border to Italy. I can't remember the town.
</P>
<P>
   The train was there so we got on, got our seats and realized
there was a train strike. So hours went by, man. It must have been
like 10 hours. The band started getting flaky, you know. Many
people started coming to the station. Must have been over a
thousand people at this point, trying to get a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wanted a seat on this particular train. So Betty told
us, ``Look, you all have your money. If you all want to get a hotel
room, go get yourself a hotel room. I'm waiting on the train.'' We
were young and inexperienced. So we said ``O.K.,'' and went and we
found a hotel. There was one room. So we came back to the train and
told Betty: ``Look, we found a hotel room. You can have the bed,
and we'll take the floor.'' And Betty was like, ``No, I'm staying
on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   So of course we decided not to take the room. A couple hours
later the strike was over and the train left. We basically had to
stand up for maybe five hours on the train. We get to Verona just
in time to go to the venue and do the gig. The whole time no one
has had any sleep or anything. We get to the place, do the sound
check and change our clothes and do this concert. The band was just
whipped. We wanted to sleep. But Betty was a serious trouper.
</P>
<P>
   She could've easily canceled or postponed but she decided to do
this concert without any rest or anything. You know, she was very
professional. I carry that attitude to my own band. Musicians have
to cope with all kinds of circumstances. It's not all glamour, you
know. But Betty had a way of turning on the charm and really
blocking everything else out and dealing with the music.

WHEN DYLAN'S GENIUS BURNED BRIGHTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things got ugly when Bob Dylan performed on May 17, 1966, at the
Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England. A good part of the audience
was actively hostile to Dylan's non-protest songs and his bluesy
electric band: catcalling, shouting insults, clapping in an attempt
to drown out the music. During a pause while the band tuned up, one
heckler shouted ``Judas!,'' as if Dylan was both apostle and
traitor to his true disciples. Dylan declared, ``I don't believe
you,'' told the band to play loud and turned ``Like a Rolling
Stone'' into both an exultant accusation and a disillusioned
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   It was all duly recorded by Columbia Records, which finally
releases Dylan's ``Live 1966'' (two CDs) this week. Proving once
again that he's a lousy judge of his own music, Dylan was quoted in
Ice magazine saying, ``If I'd thought this record was any good, it
would have been released a long time ago.'' Luckily, bootleg
recordings emerged anyway. And because the initial bootlegs were
billed as the concert from the Royal Albert Hall, where Dylan ended
his European tour 10 days later, the album is subtitled ``The
Bootleg Series Vol. 4: The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert.''
</P>
<P>
   (Columbia has tentatively scheduled three more finds from the
Dylan archives for release next February, with expanded versions of
``Oh Mercy,'' ``The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' and ``Blood on the
Tracks.'')
</P>
<P>
   When he performed in Manchester, Dylan was on tour between the
release of ``Highway 61 Revisited'' and ``Blonde on Blonde,'' and
his audiences represented two camps. Along with the rock listeners
who had turned ``Like a Rolling Stone'' into a hit, there were folk
fans who had wanted him to keep writing protest songs and who
considered his electric guitar and his rock backup band to be a
sellout and a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It was musical taste as a political and generational schism: an
early sign of the rift between the doctrinaire, puritanical old
left, which wanted straightforward agitprop for the masses, and the
more amorphous, hedonistic counterculture that considered having a
good time to be an insurrection in itself. The two sides were as
dedicated as they were naive; capitalism would soon turn them both
into market segments.
</P>
<P>
   Folkies and rockers both came to hear Dylan in concert, and
Dylan was willing to meet old fans partway. For the first half of
the concert, he brought out his acoustic guitar and harmonica to
play solo versions of ``She Belongs to Me'' and ``Desolation Row''
along with brand new songs like ``Visions of Johanna'' and the
hilariously deadpan ``Fourth Time Around.'' Everyone was happy with
those, even if Dylan was teasing them with odd inflections and a
drawn-out harmonica solo in ``Mr. Tambourine Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the second half, Dylan reappeared with the Hawks (who
would, with a different drummer, go on to become the Band), and the
uproar began. Plugged in to a powerful sound system, Dylan and the
Hawks riled the folk fans, as they knew they would. Folkies had
been booing Dylan since his Newport Folk Festival appearance with
the Butterfield Blues Band in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan was too smart and too stubborn to let hidebound
listeners prevent him from making the best music of his career. And
in the alchemy of live performance, the crowd's reaction
intensified the music. ``Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat'' and ``I Don't
Believe You'' taunt their listeners, while ``Ballad of a Thin Man''
was made to perform in the faces of people who knew something was
happening but didn't know what it was. And in ``Tell Me, Momma'' _
a song that had not been officially released before, though a
variant of its lyrics was published in ``Bob Dylan: Lyrics,
1962-1985 (Alfred A. Knopf, 1985) _ Dylan sang words that could
apply to himself circa 1966: ``Everybody sees you on your window
ledge/ How long is it gonna take for you to get off the edge?''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the songs and style are no longer new, as
folk-rock soothes baby boomers on lite-rock stations. But the music
Dylan made with the Hawks remains vital and startling and
indelible, charged with the strangeness of the moment and the
timelessness of genius. Dylan and the Hawks confronted their
listeners with music that was at once deeply grounded and untamed,
as trusty as the blues and as reckless as a band of sleepless,
cocky, drugged-out renegades could make it. Speaking between songs,
Dylan sounds logy and spaced-out; whether that's a put-on or a sign
of fatigue is impossible to tell. But whenever the music kicks in,
his voice is clear and invincible: scathing, funny, seductive,
bleak, furious and preternaturally knowing.
</P>
<P>
   On the road with the group, D.A. Pennebaker was making a
documentary to follow up ``Don't Look Back,'' the film of Dylan's
English tour a year earlier. The 1966 footage, edited by Dylan and
a cameraman, Howard Alk, became ``Eat the Document,'' a rarity that
has resurfaced for screenings at the Museum of Television and Radio
through Nov. 20. Amid its fractured continuity, it shows Dylan
pursuing music onstage and off, with quick glimpses of concerts and
of late-night songwriting sessions with guitarist Robbie Robertson;
whenever Dylan has a guitar in his hands, his concentration never
wavers.
</P>
<P>
   But when he isn't making music, the camera follows an
increasingly drawn, desolate figure, under pressure from all
directions. In one truncated scene, Dylan is in a car with John
Lennon, sitting with his head in his hands as Lennon tries to jolly
him out of it. Bob Spitz's biography, ``Dylan'' (W.W. Norton,
1989), describes the outtakes that continued that scene, showing
Dylan drugged, incoherent and sick. He was headed for burnout, and
for the motorcycle accident in July 1966 that ended his most
intemperate, most inspired years, when he burned as brightly as any
great artist could.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is evidence. Drawing perverse energy from the
reaction, Dylan and the Hawks were playing as much for themselves
as for the audience, and they weren't going to coast. Dylan and the
Hawks knew the songs inside out but found gleeful surprises in them
again and again. The way Garth Hudson's organ answers each line of
lyrics in ``Ballad of a Thin Man,'' or Robertson's lazy, twangy
guitar lines cackle through ``Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,'' or the
band unanimously ratchets up the last verse of ``Baby, Let Me
Follow You Down,'' revel in how closely they were listening to each
other and how fast their reactions were.
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers were wrong about the music, as most of them would
probably admit now. Dylan's idea of American tradition was truer
than what the acoustic-guitar purists would have enforced. He
understood that blues, country and gospel always used the
instruments at hand, and that the songs that collectors came to
revere were written about their own time and place, connected to
the past but not pretending to live in it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet spare a kindly thought for those righteous folkies who were
so intent on punishing Dylan's heresy. Who now goes to a pop
concert expected to be challenged or upset by what they hear? Who
cares so much about artists that they would face Ticketmaster for
the chance to correct an idol's errant ways? Wrongheaded as they
were, the folkies were passionate about music and convinced that
they could make a difference. It's a good thing they couldn't, but
at least they weren't passive entertainment consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As the late 1960's careened into view, their clapping and
shouting added up to their own protest song.

LITTON, AMERICAN CLASSIC VOYAGES CRUISING FOR SHIP DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In a deal that could re-energize the moribund
commercial shipbuilding industry in the United States, a unit of
Litton Industries Inc. and American Classic Voyages are in
negotiations to construct the first U.S.-built cruise vessels since
the late 1950s, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Ingalls Shipbuilding Division in Pascagoula, Miss.,
which built the last two domestic cruise ships 40 years ago, and
American Classic have signed a letter of intent to develop a design
and construction contract for the cruise line's Project America
program. The cruise-ship operator is controlled by billionaire
investor Sam Zell.
</P>
<P>
   A formal contract for two ships and an option for a third, each
worth $400 million, could be signed in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Litton beat out two other companies, National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. in San Diego and Avondale Industries of New
Orleans, in a 10-month competition.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels will be the largest able to transit the Panama Canal
and will be designed to carry up to 2,000 passengers for the Hawaii
cruise market. Federal law requires the ships to be built in the
United States because they will be traveling between domestic
ports.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls is primarily known for building sophisticated warships
for the U.S. Navy, but the company doesn't think it will have any
trouble switching to a commercial application. Some of its vessels,
like multipurpose assault ships, have hotel space for 320 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a different customer, but it's not that far
outside our product line,'' said Ingalls spokesman James McIngvale.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls has been pursuing the cruise-ship market since 1995,
when the company initiated the Maritech project, which developed a
concept design and construction strategy for a 2,000-plus-passenger
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited to work with Ingalls Shipbuilding in a
partnership which will revitalize America's commercial shipbuilding
industry,'' said Philip Calian, American Classic's president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people taking cruises has grown an average of 7.6
percent per year since 1980, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were surprised by the announcement, since all of
the cruise-ship construction in recent years has occurred at
foreign ports, in part because those governments subsidize the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of cruise ships being built around the
world,'' said Paul Nesbit, an analyst at JSA Research Inc. in
Newport, R.I. ``They are much cheaper to build elsewhere.''

GUITAR CENTER STOCK GETS ROCKED BY RETAIL SECTOR'S SOUR NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Stock of music-instrument specialist Guitar
Center Inc. hit its lowest point in more than a year as part of
Wall Street's continued disenchantment with the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Agoura Hills-based retailer's shares lost 14
percent Tuesday, dropping $2.375 to $14.25. That represents a 56
percent decline since Guitar Center hit its all-time high of $32.75
on July 17 and its worst performance since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began hammering Guitar Center's shares after it
announced in late July that same-store sales in the third and
fourth quarters would not match the ``very strong'' growth of 15.7
percent posted in the first two quarters. Six analysts have issued
``buy'' ratings on the stock since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many other retail stocks, Guitar Center has come under
intense pressure since mid-July because of the perception that the
retail group is not the place to be,'' said analyst Alan Rifkin of
Piper Jaffray. Retail issues have been falling since the market
peaked July 17 on fears that the U.S. economy will follow Asia and
other emerging markets into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guitar Center is as strong as it's ever been,'' said Rifkin,
who has a ``strong buy'' rating on the stock with a 12-month target
price of $24. ``The weakness in the stock does not reflect any
change in fundamentals. They are gaining market share in an
industry that's growing four times faster than the gross domestic
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitar Center, which operates 44 stores, earned $4.9 million on
sales of $91.3 million in the second quarter. It became the first
music-instrument retailer to go public, with a $115 million
offering at $15 a share in March 1997.

NYU TAKES MAJOR STEP IN INTERNET EDUCATION MARKET 
</HEADLINE>

 By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to become a major player in the emerging
Internet education market, New York University, one of the nation's
largest educational institutions, plans to create a for-profit
subsidiary that will develop and sell specialized online courses to
other colleges, corporate training centers, as well as students who
simply prefer to attend class at home.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a direct response to what many educators see as the
biggest challenge to higher education: the rise of profit-making
companies like the University of Phoenix that threaten to siphon
off some of academia's most profitable courses _ continuing
education for adult learners _ and leave universities only in the
expensive business of undergraduate education.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these players are coming along, and we felt we needed
to get more assertive,'' said Gerald Heeger, Dean of NYU's School
of Continuing and Professional Studies, who will run the new
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   New York University already operates one of the largest
continuing education schools in the country. But unlike UCLA or
Penn State, which are developing a wide range of courses online,
NYU will start by offering a narrower range of courses that it
thinks will have broad demand _ including management, information
technology and computer languages, real estate and credit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line courses can be developed very cheaply, but what people
are discovering is that the success rates are not very high,''
Heeger said. ``The issue here is not to have thousands of courses,
but to have highly focused courses that meet large needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Universities have long reached beyond their own walls to offer
education to those off campus, through correspondence courses and
satellite campuses. But with the rise of the Internet, distance
education has suddenly become a new imperative, and universities
are scrambling to get a toehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a broad recognition that the Internet really does
change the ball game,'' said Frank Mayadas, a former IBM executive
now at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, who has given grants to NYU
and other universities to help them develop their Internet
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said that only a handful of colleges and universities _
including Penn State, the State University of New York, the
University of Illinois and the University of California at Berkeley
_ have entered the field in a sizable way. Most have fewer than
5,000 students on line.
</P>
<P>
   Like many universities, NYU has moved to put some of its courses
online, both for its 45,000 full-time students, and the 60,000
students who take its continuing education courses. And it will
continue to expand those offerings apart from the new venture.

HURDLES REMAIN ON DEAL TO AWARD AGENCY $18B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress inched closer Tuesday to an agreement to
replenish the strained reserves of the International Monetary Fund,
but significant hurdles remained.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants Congress to send nearly $18 billion to
the agency, which has committed $117 billion in loans to South
Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia amid the current economic crisis,
and is being asked to commit billions more to Brazil and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate generally supports Clinton's plan, but House
Republicans want to see major reforms at the IMF before committing
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, several GOP lawmakers said they believed a deal was at
hand. ``We're about 80 percent there,'' the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, Robert Livingston, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Fiddelke, spokeswoman to Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of
Nebraska, said, ``We're definitely getting close, but to my
knowledge there is not a deal yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, spokeswoman to one of the leading IMF critics in
Congress, House Republican leader Richard Armey, said new rhetoric
from Clinton in recent days had raised hopes of a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we heard from him from December until last week was,
`Give us the money with no strings attached.' Now, he's saying
there are certain things he expects from the IMF for it to work
better. There's definitely room for negotiations now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said Armey remained adamant that Congress not release
money to the IMF until reforms were in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough to have the White House say, `Give us the
check, and we'll see if we can make the case''' for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is a 182-nation body charged with making sure the
world's currency exchange system works smoothly. It sometimes makes
loans to nations to help ease short-term currency problems, and in
the current crisis it has made large emergency loans to several
nations, most of them in Asia, to help as their stock markets and
currencies have fallen in value.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has significant powers to order reforms at the
IMF because it contributes the most money and holds the largest
share of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $18 billion Clinton is requesting, House and Senate
leaders have agreed to set aside $3.5 billion for a new emergency
fund. House critics are balking at an additional $14.5 billion,
which represents the US share of an increase in contributions by
all members to shore up existing loan programs.
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to a senior Republican lawmaker said significant
roadblocks to a compromise remained.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Representative Jim Saxton, the New Jersey
Republican who leads the Joint Economic Committee, has proposed
legislation that would require the IMF to disclose more of its
practices and documents. Saxton wants minutes of IMF executive
board meetings to be made public, along with IMF staff analyses of
the effects its loan programs have on nations that borrow money. In
particular, IMF critics want to see a report that allegedly says
the IMF's own policies in Indonesia helped cause a bank run.
</P>
<P>
   But language that Senate Republicans proposed to their House
colleagues Tuesday would not require the IMF to disclose these
documents, the GOP aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Saxton's bill calls for the IMF to stop lending money
at subsidized rates. Some lawmakers believe that below-market loans
encourage investors and governments to take on undue risk in their
businss affairs in the belief that the IMF will provide a low-cost
bailout if their projects run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Republican language would not significantly
change IMF lending practices, the aide said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepares to vote Thursday on beginning
an impeachment inquiry, Democratic leaders labored on Tuesday to
keep as many beleaguered Democrats as possible from voting for the
Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and Judiciary Committee members met throughout the day
to weigh the Democratic alternative they plan to offer this week,
and to consider bringing it closer to the Republican version in
hopes of appealing to a large bloc of nervous and angry moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of a chaotic day, it appeared that they were
leaning against that approach and preferred staying with a proposal
Democrats offered on Monday in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever approach they choose, the White House was still bracing
for desertions by anywhere from two dozen to several dozen
Democrats. The greater the level of defection, the harder it will
be to scoff at the vote as a partisan vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, more concerned about their colleagues' electoral
success than their president, were seeking a way to enable the rank
and file to say they voted for a reasonable proposal for conducting
an inquiry into the president's behavior, but opposed a Republican
witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, adopted on Monday by the Judiciary
Committee along party lines, has no time limit on the inquiry and
does not limit its focus to the possible charges recommended by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, who dealt only
with President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his
efforts to conceal it. Committee Democrats sought to give the
inquiry a Thanksgiving deadline and bar the consideration of
additional issues.
</P>
<P>
   The possible revisions being floated early on Tuesday included
extending the Thanksgiving deadline until the end of December, and
specifically allowing for the consideration of any new information
from the Office of Independent Counsel, Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Democrats, the idea of softening the alternative could
sweeten the pot. ``I'm trying to avoid polarizing this thing as a
political decision,'' said Rep. David Minge of Minnesota. ``I'm
searching for ways to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others the decision to vote for the Republican proposal
is all but a foregone conclusion. ``I'm going to vote for an
inquiry in order to move the process forward,'' said Rep. Chris
John, D-La. ``My district has consistently wanted to move this
along, and this is a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr., D-S.C., who is in a tight race for
re-election, said he favored an inquiry, but only one with a
deadline and a limited scope. ``If the Democratic alternative
fails, I've got a tough choice,'' Spratt said. ``I haven't ruled
out the Republican motion.''
</P>
<P>
   All day, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and Democratic
whips tried to appeal to moderates by cautioning them that a vote
for the Republican proposal would doom the House to a long,
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry. But by evening, they seemed
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and lobbyist friends of his like Thomas
Downey placed a new round of phone calls to House Democrats,
including some committee chairmen, to lobby and to gauge the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said they could lose as many as 80
Democrats or as few as two dozen on the vote on the Republican
proposal. For their part, Republicans have said that as many as 100
Democrats could vote with them. But some on each side are playing
the expectations game, hoping to argue once the votes are cast that
they did better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote is coming awfully close to an election and a lot of
people are factoring that in,'' a White House official said.
``There will be a significant amount of people who will vote, not
based on how they feel, but on how they expect it to impact in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters for the White House and its allies,
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said on Tuesday that
Democrats would not be allowed to offer their proposal as a
clear-cut substitute to the open-ended Republican proposal.
Instead, Democrats will have to bring up their proposal under a
parliamentary maneuver in which debate is limited to one hour.
</P>
<P>
   And Armey again raised the possibility that the inquiry's scope,
under the direction of the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde
of Illinois, could broaden to include accusations and evidence from
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight,
whose chairman is Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., is expected to vote to
release its interim report on 1996 Democratic campaign finance
abuses. A Republican aide with the committee said that there were
no impeachable offenses in the findings, but that at least one
chapter of the report contained information ``salient'' to the
Judiciary Committee's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The information deals mostly with ``White House stonewalling and
the abuse of executive privilege,'' the aide said. An estimated 80
witnesses took the Fifth Amendment or fled the country in order not
to testify before the panel, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said on Tuesday: ``Let me remind you again, one of the
patterns that we see, that I certainly see is stonewall,
evasiveness, obstruction. So I mean these things will be pursued by
the committee.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democratic leaders listened as member after member
expressed a sense of nervousness about the November elections and
anger toward Clinton, Democratic officials said. But by the end of
the day, the leaders had not decided on a course of action to bring
members together, torn in part between angering their traditional
liberal base and upsetting moderates who face tough re-election
bids. They will caucus Wednesday morning to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals complained that the president was worrying too
much about himself and not enough about the elections. And a few
said they were tempted to vote against any resolution that opened
the door to an impeachment investigation. That includes a
Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting against Hyde is easy,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, who opposes any impeachment inquiry. ``The Democratic
alternative, that's the problem. There's no alternative for those
of us who say the evidence does not rise to the level of an
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New Democrats, who traditionally align themselves with
Clinton on policy matters, said they were not pleased about the
pressure they were getting from the White House. And moderates in
swing districts, who must answer to a large number of Republican
constituents, continued to express outrage about the president's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion for an inquiry is a very proper motion,'' said Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, stating his intention to vote for the
Republican resolution. ``I want the process to move as quickly and
expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic leaders stressed that ultimately members must
vote their conscience, Judiciary Committee members lobbied their
fence-sitting colleagues in the hopes of bringing them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an open-ended resolution, the only thing needed to keep
it going would be for someone to mail in new allegations,'' said
Rep. Robert Scott, a Virginia Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, several senior Democrats voiced skepticism that
Republicans would hold fair impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly convinced that House, as presently led, couldn't
conduct a fair trial on a parking ticket,'' said Rep. David Obey of
Wisconsin.

JONES DEAL MAY BE DOWN TO A FINAL HAGGLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Negotiations to settle the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton as described by both
sides this week are increasingly coming to resemble the haggling in
a new car showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones and the White House have powerful reasons to reach a
settlement, White House officials and friends of Ms. Jones have
said.
</P>
<P>
   But talks have stalled on how much money it will take to end the
lawsuit that led to Clinton's being put at risk of impeachment.
Friends of Ms. Jones have said she is inclined to reject the
president's last offer of $700,000, an increase over his previous
offer of $500,000. Ms. Jones has been asking for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers have not notified the White House of any decision,
and Ms. Jones and her husband are said to be mulling over whether
to stand firm on the $1 million demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' husband, Stephen, has resisted making any significant
concessions, friends of Ms. Jones said Tuesday. Hillary Rodham
Clinton had been the staunchest opponent of concessions, until a
change of heart last month opened the way to settlement talks,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are facing a deadline of sorts on Oct. 20, when they
are scheduled to argue an appeal of Ms. Jones' case before a
three-judge appeals panel in St. Paul, Minn. Ms. Jones' lawyers are
asking the appeals court to reinstate her lawsuit against Clinton.
A federal trial judge dismissed Ms. Jones' lawsuit in April, saying
that even if her accusations were true, they would not constitute a
case of sexual harassment or deprivation of constitutional rights
as she has asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jones' lawyers have filed a brief with the appeals court
arguing that the case should be reinstated because Clinton has
admitted a sexual liaison with a former White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky. During a deposition in the case last January, Clinton
testified under oath that he had not engaged in ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones brought her suit in 1994, saying that three years
earlier, when Clinton was governor of Arkansas and she was a state
clerical employee, he had her summoned to a hotel suite in Little
Rock and asked her to perform oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied her account.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House advisers have said that eliminating the Jones
lawsuit from the scene could make it easier to persuade Congress to
avoid impeaching the president. Ms. Jones, who would get some money
out of a settlement, runs the risk of walking away from four years
of litigation with nothing if the appeals court rules against her.
</P>
<P>
   As is common in such negotiations, each side has sent signals
that it is losing patience and preparing to walk away from the
bargaining table. But the few hundred thousand that separates the
two sides is probably a bridgeable gap.
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which previous negotiations foundered _ Ms. Jones'
insistence on an apology from Clinton _ is no longer on the table.
Ms. Jones' lawyers have said that the president's admission about
Ms. Lewinsky has made an apology unnecessary. Indeed, some public
opinion polls have shown that a majority of people now believe
much, if not all, of Ms. Jones' account.

CITING SECURITY, U.S. BRIEFLY SHUTS SAUDI EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having received information that the U.S. Embassy
in Saudi Arabia may be the target of a terrorist attack, the State
Department said Tuesday that the embassy and two other diplomatic
buildings will close Wednesday, so security can be tightened.
</P>
<P>
   The department said the embassy in Riyadh and the consulates
hundreds of miles away in Jiddah and Dhahran would be closed for
the day ``to review present security measures and to implement
physical security enhancements.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said Tuesday night that he could
provide no further information on the nature or seriousness of the
threats, when and how the information had been received or what the
``enhancements'' would be.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, the department noted that a number of
embassies and consulates had received threats since the Aug. 7
bombings of the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, that killed more than 250 people and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department official emphasized that only the
embassy in Riyadh was the target of the latest threat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats have been wary since the United States launched
missile attacks Aug. 20 against suspected terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and Sudan. Those camps are believed to be run by Osama
bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi exile whom the United States blames for
the bombings in August. U.S. officials have said they expect bin
Laden to try to retaliate for those strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Tuesday that Saudi authorities
``continue to provide full support to insure the security of the
embassy, as well as of the consulates general and United States
military elements'' in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But an Arab diplomat who insisted on anonymity, described
closings as ``a bit of an overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Embassy is very secure,'' the diplomat said,
describing the complex as naturally fortified by hills and further
protected by artificial obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995 seven people were killed in a bombing at a
U.S.-run military building in Riyadh. In June 1996, 19 U.S. airmen
were killed in the bombing of an apartment complex in Dhahran.

FEDERICO ZERI, ITALIAN ART HISTORIAN, 77 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Federico Zeri, an Italian art historian whose expertise
was sought by many American museums and private collectors, died
Oct. 5 of a heart attack in his villa outside Rome, the news agency
ANSA reported. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in medieval and Renaissance art, Zeri was among the
first Italian critics to put paintings in their social and
historical context. He was co-author of a catalog of the Italian
paintings collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
with Elizabeth Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Zeri, who appeared frequently on Italian television, often to
criticize the government for neglecting the country's artistic
heritage, was well known even to Italians who never frequent
museums. Though he had been a trustee of the J. Paul Getty Museum
in California and was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in
Paris, he was never given a major academic post in Italy. He is
survived by a sister, Nuncia Melgeri.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11)  
 (af)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Holly Hunter and Beth Henley had not been stuck in
an elevator together 16 years ago on their way to an audition for
Ms. Henley's play ``The Wake of Jamey Foster,'' the two would have
found each other eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter has appeared in six Henley plays and on Thursday she
will open in the seventh, ``Impossible Marriage,'' a production by
the Roundabout Theater Company at the Laura Pels Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met her under professional auspices and that is where I was
most comfortable with Beth for some time,'' said Ms. Hunter, over a
recent Manhattan dinner. ``However, we clicked in a monstrous
way.''
</P>
<P>
   With Southern roots, small physical frames and straight, cropped
hair in common, Ms. Hunter, 40, and Ms. Henley, 46, seem like two
of a kind. Ms. Henley, who was born and brought up in Mississippi,
helped advance Ms. Hunter's career as an actress; Ms. Hunter, who
comes from Georgia, helped solidify Ms. Henley's success as a
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Both appear to have struck a delicate balance between the public
selves they dutifully present and the private lives they fiercely
protect. And they clearly share a deep affection and respect for
each other.
</P>
<P>
   So when people suggest that Ms. Henley has somehow dropped off
the map in the 14 years since her last New York hit, ``The Miss
Firecracker Contest,'` Ms. Hunter gets defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always weird to me when people talk about a comeback,''
she said. ``When somebody's life is examined up close these days,
they're always going somewhere, when really they've never been
away. She's always been a playwright, making a living at it. Beth
writes every day, all year long, every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is largely because Ms. Henley has been absent
from the New York theater scene that the Roundabout decided to
commission her to write the play that became ``Impossible
Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention,'' said Todd Haimes, the company's artistic
director, ``was to commission plays by established playwrights, but
perhaps playwrights who were not being produced as often as we'd
like to see them produced. We came up with a list of playwrights
that interested us who hadn't been seen recently in New York and
Beth Henley happened to be at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley, who lives in Los Angeles with her 3-year-old son,
has, as Ms. Hunter says, been busy writing: her plays have included
two that were presented at the Manhattan Theater Club _ ``The Lucky
Spot'' in 1987 and ``Abundance'' in 1990, both of which received
mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley has also written screenplays, including ``Nobody's
Fool,'' which starred Rosanna Arquette and Eric Roberts, and two
adaptations of her own plays. One was for the film version of her
first stage hit, the 1981 Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Crimes of the
Heart'' (for which she was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987).
</P>
<P>
   The other for ``Miss Firecracker,'' a 1989 movie that starred
Ms. Hunter, as had the 1984 stage version. Both plays were also
done at the Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   During a sandwich break while rehearsing ``Impossible
Marriage,'' Ms. Henley said that she writes screenplays more out of
necessity than passion. ``If I could make the same money writing
plays as writing movie scripts, I don't think I would do it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she acknowledged, she could have lived
without writing ``Revelers,'' a 1994 play about an acting company
that gathers at a wake to spread the ashes of their teacher. But
ultimately, Ms. Henley said, every one of her projects has been
valuable. ``I've been exploring what concerns me and how it
concerns me,'' she said, ``and I would not trade writing those
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very blessed,'' she added, ``because `Crimes of the
Heart' was a hit and has allowed me to be a writer for this many
years. Of all the good things I've done well in my life, I think
life as a playwright is the one I'm most pleased with.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plays, particularly ``Crimes of the Heart'' and ``The Miss
Firecracker Contest,'' have won praise for their quirky Southern
sensibility, insights into women's relationships and Gothic humor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter said she is attracted to the physicality of Ms.
Henley's characters, their wildness, how their primitive instincts
collide with civilized society. ``She writes about parts of
ourselves that we may not even want to claim,'' the actress said.
</P>
<P>
   The current play, ``Impossible Marriage,'' takes place in
Savannah, Ga., on the eve of a wedding and reveals a tangle of
family secrets surrounding three Southern women _ two sisters and
their mother. In writing it, Ms. Henley said she was interested in
investigating many kinds of incompatibility: ``How do we marry our
dark and light sides? How do you marry lust with love? Being a
mother with being a woman?''

 NEW YORK: a woman?''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet in spite of the complexity that these questions suggest, the
author said she also wanted to write ``a happy play, an ebullient
play.'' That is what she said her mother wanted _ that and nice
costumes. She was also eager to enter the world of fantasy. ``I was
tired of naturalness _ tired of it for the stage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Ms. Hunter's role, that of Floral Whitman, the older,
very pregnant, emotionally volatile sister of the bride, Ms. Henley
said the play was difficult to cast. ``It has a tricky tone,'' she
said. ``It requires striking some sort of balance between deep,
deep tragedy and foolish whimsy and being able to go from one to
the other as kind of a hairpin turn.'' Directed by Stephen
Wadsworth, the cast includes Christopher McCann, Lois Smith, Jon
Tenney, Gretchen Cleevely, Daniel London and Alan Mandell.
</P>
<P>
   Did she write the part of Floral with Ms. Hunter in mind? ``I
always have Holly in mind,'' Ms. Henley said. ``As soon as I see
her do a reading, it becomes impossible to think of anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   While most actors might find it heady to have roles written for
them, Ms. Hunter, who won an Academy Award in 1993 for her
performance in the film ``The Piano,'' seems to take it in stride.
``It's irrelevant,'' she said. ``I don't see any of myself in the
characters. I see more of Beth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley made Ms. Hunter's Broadway debut possible in ``Crimes
of the Heart'' after it had opened at the Manhattan Theater Club.
Ms. Hunter, who replaced Mary Beth Hurt, said that her audition was
terrible but that Ms. Henley pulled for her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hideous, awful, vulgar, wrong for it, much too young for
it,'' Ms. Hunter said. ``She fought for me to get the role.'' (Ms.
Hunter left ``Crimes of the Heart'' to play the lead in ``The Wake
of Jamey Foster'' in 1982.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the actress said, she has found each one of her
roles in Ms. Henley's plays challenging. For example, she said, it
was ``agony'' performing in Ms. Henley's ``Control Freaks,'' a
black comedy about a murderous family that she helped produce at
the Met Theater in Los Angeles in 1993. `` `Control Freaks' was one
unrelenting rage,'' Ms. Hunter said. ``I hated for it to begin and
I couldn't wait for it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, she said, she is relishing the role of Floral in
``Impossible Marriage'': ``She is a radical, she is rebellious, a
truth-teller, really manipulative. She is courageous, a protector
and a fighter, an extremist. She has wickedness, she's a schemer,
she has plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Ms. Hunter added, ``she has magnificence.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Living Out Loud,'' her new film, a romantic comedy inspired
by two Chekhov stories that opens next month, the actress plays a
woman who sees life with new eyes after her husband leaves her and
she develops a friendship with her elevator operator, portrayed by
Danny DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to change how I approach acting as I get older,'' Ms.
Hunter said. ``I want there to be a reason I'm playing certain
characters at certain times. I think characters come to me when I'm
ready to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter said she does Ms. Henley's plays out of a similar
sense of necessity, not just out of loyalty. ``I do Beth's plays
because I know they will be an adventure,'' she said, elbows on the
table, chin on her hands. ``We hooked up in a way that I don't even
understand and she doesn't understand and I play homage to our
history and feel loyal to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do this for her and I've never stopped wanting to do
this with her,'' Ms. Hunter said. ``It's just a history in my life
and she's the only one I have it with.''

<HEADLINE>
N.J. COMPANY TO BUY HUNNEMAN REAL ESTATE CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ NRT Corp., a New Jersey-based real estate brokerage
giant already in possession of several national brand names, is
expected to finalize a deal Wednesday to buy Hunneman Real Estate
Corp. _ the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hunneman officials and NRT refused to divulge terms of the
sale, though they did say it is not expected to result in layoffs
among the 3,000 employees in any of Hunneman's 75 New England
offices. Hunneman will still use its own name both in its
residential and commercial business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a seamless transaction from the perspective of the
agents,'' Stuart W. Pratt, Chairman and CEO of Hunneman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the latest regional firm to be snapped up by a
national corporation in a consolidation frenzy that is gripping the
residential real estate industry from coast-to-coast. Fueling the
acquisition demand are well-funded buyers in search of new
companies and brokerage firms that have grown in value during a
healthy market.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the latest in a string of acquisitions by NRT, which
is expected to issue a public stock offering sometime early next
year. Since it was formed in 1997 as a joint venture between the
Cendant Corp. (HFS Inc.) and Apollo Management, NRT has acquired
more than 27 residential brokerage firms throughout the United
States in major metropolitan areas including New York, Atlanta, Los
Angeles, and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has an estimated worth of more than $63
billion, already owns several well-known real estate franchises,
including Coldwell Banker, Century 21, and ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the sale, which comes at a high point in the
residential real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of what's going on in the industry, it's probably the
only way to survive. What you either have to be is a real small
boutique with a specialty, or a big company with a reach around the
world,'' said analyst Ray Torto, managing director of Torto Wheaton
Research in Boston. ``You know what they say about people who stand
in the middle of the road: they get hit from traffic on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sales and leasing, the company also offers home
security, construction, and mortgage services. Its residential
division is affiliated with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the direction the industry has been going in for years,
it is just reaching a crescendo currently, which is something you
would anticipate during a very solid real estate market,'' said Jim
Dougherty, director of marketing for Carlson Real Estate/Better
Homes and Gardens, and president-elect of the Massachusetts
Association of Realtors. Earlier this year, Carlson aquired the
Springfield-based Landry, Lyons, &AMP; Whyte.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pratt said his company encountered other suitors _ among
them Prudential Real Estate Corp. and Insignia Financial Group _
but opted for NRT because the company permits a high degree of
local control. ``Our business is absolutely a local business and
the second you take away local autonomy, this whole thing doesn't
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morever, Pratt said linking with a larger, national company
should allow Hunneman to offer such things as more attractive
interest rates on its mortgage products. At the direction of NRT,
Hunneman is already making plans to itself gobble up a number of
smaller Massachusetts real estate firms, Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody touted the state's latest behemoth, however.

   ``I'm sure it's a windfall for the owners, but the only reason
that people sell is for the money, it's not for an advantage,''
Richard B. DeWolfe, president of DeWolfe New England, said upon
learning of the acquisition. ``I hope it will dramatically improve
our business, because we are locally owned and operated.''
</P>
<P>
   Added DeWolfe: ``It's not just about business, it's also about
the community. I'm one of those people who don't think New York and
New Jersey should own Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, DeWolfe said NRT officials last year said they were
interested in purchasing his company, but he turned the company
down because ``we are not interested in selling, we are interested
in building our business.''

2 BOOK GIANTS IN GLOBAL DEAL TO SELL TITLES VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Two giants in the book business struck a
$200 million deal Tuesday to become partners in a global network to
sell titles in all major languages online, posing a powerful threat
to the electronic commerce pioneer Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the largest bookstore chain in the United
States, and Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate,
announced the plans for a joint venture involving the American
chain's unprofitable electronic subsidiary, Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a shift in strategy for Bertelsmann, which
months ago announced its own ambitious plans to start a worldwide
electronic bookstore called Books Online that would take advantage
of its existing distribution network in Europe and its longstanding
experience with book clubs in many countries. As late as last week,
executives were planning to introduce some of the plans for the new
World Wide Web site at the 50th annual international book fair in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thomas Middelhoff, the chairman and chief
executive-elect of Bertelsmann, said the company had decided that
it could move more rapidly into the expanding market with its $200
million purchase of a 50 percent stake in Barnes &AMP; Noble's
electronic subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, both Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP;
Noble will each invest $100 million in the venture. The bookstore
chain's announced plans for an initial public offering in the
electronic venture will be temporarily delayed. Both companies,
however, said they expect a public offering sometime later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff said the negotiations ended Tuesday in New York,
following four months of on-again, off-again talks with Leonard
Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Riggio said that ``from our perspective, we kind of
look at this as a game breaker, in terms of our E-commerce
business.'' He added: ``Joining forces with Bertelsmann is one of
the most exciting things we have ever done. They have global reach,
expertise in direct marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that once the joint venture was fully established,
customers would be able to buy practically ``any book on the
planet,'' in a variety of languages.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann will still move forward with plans for its own
distinct electronic venture, Books Online, which it will start in
November in Britain, Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands,
Middelhoff said. The joint venture with Barnes &AMP; Noble is
Bertelsmann's latest move in the United States, where it became the
dominant publisher of popular trade books with its purchase of
Random House several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff insisted, however, that this new relationship with
Barnes &AMP; Noble would not affect the publishing side of the
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertelsmann will continue to adhere to our principle of
decentralized operations, which we have consistently followed
throughout our history,'' Middelhoff said in a news release.
``Neither our English-language book publishers nor our consumer
direct-marketing book clubs will be involved in the management of
operations of Barnesandnoble.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff added in an interview: ``As we have told everybody,
we have an arm's-length policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that both companies did not expect the venture would
require any U.S. government review for antitrust violations because
Amazon.com already had a dominant share of the market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An Amazon.com spokesman said the company's founder and chief
executive, Jeff Bezos, was unavailable to comment on the impact of
the new partnership. But it is clear that Amazon.com is already
making moves to expand into Bertelsmann's European turf.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Amazon.com purchased a British electronic
bookstore, Bookpages, and it is now poised to offer electronic
versions in Britain and Germany, with new distribution outlets in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Murdoch, the new managing director of Amazon.co.uk, was
asked Tuesday at a Frankfurt seminar whether the Seattle-based
company had plans to open electronic versions in other European
countries, but he declined to answer, saying that Amazon.com had
only made public its plans for Britain and Germany. &QL;

JEAN CROCKETT, 79, FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD PHILADELPHIA FED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ariz.)   (bl)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Andrus Crockett, the first chairwoman of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and first chairwoman of the finance
department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
died Oct. 3 at her home in Media, Pa. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   While at Wharton, Ms. Crockett conducted several analyses of the
stock market and investors. In 1970, for example, she and two
colleagues found that mutual funds did little to improve the
market's efficiency. On average, they found, mutual-fund investors
would have fared better had they simply bought an equal number of
shares of every common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1982, she served as a director of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and was appointed chairwoman of the
regional bank in 1982. In one of her first statements in that post,
she echoed a theme sounded by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, who argued that federal deficits had to be cut to make the
Fed's job less painful. ``Interest rates,'' Ms. Crockett said,
``would not have to be this high if fiscal policy were used in
addition to monetary policy to fight inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crockett was born April 20, 1919, in Tucson, Ariz. Before
joining the Wharton faculty in 1954, she was a mathematics
instructor at the University of Arizona, an assistant professor of
economics at the University of Illinois, a staff researcher for the
Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago and an economist
with the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   She was promoted to full professor at Wharton in 1966 and named
chairwoman of the finance department in 1977. In 1989, she received
the university's Distinguished Faculty Award for ``pioneering
all-University leadership and for dedication to furthering the
careers of junior colleagues and graduate students.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crockett is survived by her husband, Robert O. Crockett Jr.;
three children, Jennifer, Elizabeth and Robert, and three
grandchildren.

EXCERPTS FROM REMARKS AT GLOBAL LENDERS' TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from statements Tuesday by
President Clinton and the leaders of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, at the annual meeting of the two
organizations:
</P>
<P>
   By President Clinton
</P>
<P>
   A half century ago, a visionary generation of leaders gathered
at Bretton Woods to build a new economy to serve the citizens of
every nation. In one of his last messages to Congress, President
Franklin Roosevelt said that the creation of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I quote, ``spell the
difference between a world caught again in the maelstrom of panic
and economic warfare or a world in which nations strive for a
better life through mutual trust, cooperation and assistance.'' . .
.
</P>
<P>
   But now the health of Asia and indeed the world depends upon
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United States had to eliminate its deficits and high
interest rates, which were taking money away from the rest of the
world, over the last six years, now Japan must take strong steps to
restart its economic growth by addressing problems in the banking
system so that lending and investment can begin with renewed energy
and by stimulating, deregulating and opening its economy. For all
of us, there can be no substitute for action.
</P>
<P>
   By Michel Camdessus
</P>
<P>
   International Monetary Fund
</P>
<P>
   It would be perhaps too dramatic yet to talk of global
recession, but the evidence of the risks calls for immediate
action. Fortunately, in the industrial countries of North America
and Europe the fundamentals remain sound. For some time, inflation
has been subdued. Economic expansion continues in the United
States, while in the economies of the euro area the recovery has
continued to firm.
</P>
<P>
   But even North America and Europe are not immune, and effects of
the crisis are beginning to be felt. It was therefore most
appropriate that representatives of the industrial economies
recently recognized the shift in the balance of risks from
inflation to a slowdown in demand. ...
</P>
<P>
   If we expect any upturn next year, it will be because of the
impressive steps by many countries, some of which were already
implementing Fund-supported programs, to shield themselves against
contagion.
</P>
<P>
   An example at the onset of the crisis was the Philippines, which
was able to absorb the worst of te successive waves of contagion
by prolonging and rapidly strengthening an existing successful
Fund-supported program.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of Latin American countries, so admirably
illustrated by the remarks of President Menem, is also to be
lauded. By jointly strengthening their defenses they have invited
the markets to take greater account of the striking progress
accomplished over the past decade and in particular since the
Mexican crisis. They have created the conditions for the Fund to
negotiate promptly its financial support, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   By James Wolfensohn
</P>
<P>
   World Bank
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months ago there was optimism about Russia with its
strong reformist team.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a year of turmoil and travail.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia _ where estimates suggest that more than 20 million
people fell back into poverty last year, and where, at best, growth
is likely to be halting and hesitant for several years to come.
Russia, beset by economic and political crisis _ caught between two
worlds, two systems, comfortable with neither.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the world's second largest economy, so crucial to East
Asian recovery, with a Government committed to economic reform, and
yet still in recession, with a profound impact not just in Asia but
around the world. Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan. War
threatened in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Terrorist bombs in Kenya and
Tanzania. ...
</P>
<P>
   We must address the issues of long-term equitable growth on
which prosperity and human progress depend.
</P>
<P>
   We must focus on the institutional and structural changes needed
for recovery and sustainable development. We must focus on the
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   We must do all this. Because if we do not have the capacity to
deal with social emergencies, if we do not have longer-term plans
for solid institutions, if we do not have greater equity and social
justice, there will be no political stability and without political
stability no amount of money put together in financial packages
will give us financial stability.

FINDING `HAPPINESS`: A GOOD CAREER MOVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Margy Rochlin writes from Los Angeles about film and television.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The star of Todd Solondz's ``Happiness'' is
wide-eyed, soft-edged and good at rolling with the punches.
``That's when my Juilliard training comes in handy,'' said the star
in question, Jane Adams. One day she arrived on the ``Happiness''
set and was informed by Solondz that a scene scripted as a verbal
showdown between her character and her boyfriend's other girlfriend
now resembled something out of ``Caged Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd said, `OK, she's going to come in, spit on you, grab you
and then the two of you will fight on the floor.' And I said,
`O.K.!' Then I went back in the Rolodex of my mind to: `Down on the
Ground _ With or Without Kneepads' and started to figure how to do
it. It was kind of exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the open courtyard of a bookstore in West Los Angeles,
with her clear yogi's smile and halo of brown curls, Ms. Adams, 32,
seemed like the last person on earth to be spit on _ or have her
hair pulled or her face slapped, or be abused by a chain of
besiegers. In fact, when Ms. Adams floated into the room for their
first meeting, Solondz recalled, he thought, ``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   He knew he could use her unguarded quality as counterpoint to
the more emotionally twisted characters he created in this
much-talked-about follow-up to his feature debut, ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Comic and unsettling, ``Happiness'' (which opens on Friday)
takes three sisters (Ms. Adams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia
Stevenson) in suburban New Jersey and peels the lid off their
apparently ordinary lives to reveal a microcosm of modern-day
isolation. Lurking beneath the placid surface of their world are
child molesters, obscene phone callers, even a woman who murders
and dismembers her rapacious doorman.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Solondz knew that for his intricate black comedy
to work, he'd better have at least one character whom people
wouldn't mind hugging. With that in mind, he created Joy, the
painfully trusting baby of the family who, when she's not trying to
get her career and love life off the ground, is being used as a
doormat by her patronizing siblings.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Happiness'' the talk of the festival circuit this year
for its skewed view of the family, Variety noted that in a film
filled with impressive performances, Ms. Adams easily won the
sympathy vote by conveying ``a vulnerability and lack of
fulfillment in Joy that is both touching and pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the audience was going to connect with anyone in this
movie, it was going to be with Joy,'' said Solondz, although to
alleviate any extra pressure on his gentle axis, he kept that
information to himself. ``I certainly didn't say, `It's all up to
(italics)you,(end italics) Jane.' But even if I did, it wouldn't
have fazed her. I think she knew this was a role she was made
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of America, Solondz was unfamiliar with the unfazable
Ms. Adams, even though back in 1991 he might have read about what
happened during her first job on Broadway, in ``I Hate Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by Paul Rudnick, the play achieved instant infamy when
Ms. Adams's co-star Evan Handler fled the stage after being
vigorously swatted with a prop sword for no apparent reason by
another co-star, Nicol Williamson, the legendarily volatile actor.
Fortunately for Ms. Adams, Williamson displayed no such ire toward
his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the fog of Nicol's many demons, he still respected
Jane and knew that she wasn't a disposable ingenue,'' said Rudnick,
who has a blurb-worthy way of raving about Ms. Adams's performance
as a 29-year-old virgin in ``I Hate Hamlet,'' calling her ``an
ethereal earth-sprite who can do pratfalls'' and ``one of those
magnificent waifs who can make fragility seem magical and demented
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Hate Hamlet'' brought Ms. Adams nearly every theater award
except the Tony (she'd collect that trophy three years later after
appearing in a revival of ``An Inspector Calls''). Her strong stage
work also led to supporting roles in films like ``Kansas City,''
``I Love Trouble,'' and ``Father of the Bride II.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she wanted more. ``I needed some experience,'' Ms.
Adams said. ``I needed some money.'' So two years ago she made a
strictly goal-oriented move from New York to Los Angeles and landed
a berth as a sister _ just a trace edgier than Joy _ on the ABC
drama ``Relativity.'' A cult hit, the show tracked the evolution of
a love relationship between an exceptionally photogenic young
couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' she said, because although the show expired
after only two seasons, it lasted long enough to leave Ms. Adams
with extra cash in her bank account and a newfound ease in front of
the camera. She'd stopped feeling as if she were lying when she sat
down with a director and assured him, ``I can carry this film.''
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence was hard won. Growing up in Wheaton, Ill., the
eldest daughter of William Adams, an engineer, and Janice Adams, an
administrative assistant (Ms. Adams has a younger brother), she
made her stage debut as the wooden marionette in a seventh-grade
production of ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Ms. Adams briefly took
theater classes at Seattle's prestigious Cornish Institute, then
became an uninspired political science major at the University of
Washington. Unable to kick her drama habit entirely, however, she
began appearing in local theater again, and eventually found the
gumption to relocate to New York and give acting school another
shot by enrolling at the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Ms. Adams had a bachelor's degree in fine
arts, an unpaid student loan and untold memories of living in
roach-infested hotel rooms and fixing grilled hot dog dinners in an
electric wok on the floor. Around this time, she landed a small
role as Michael J. Fox's girlfriend in the final episode of
``Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, though, there were long, dry spells in which Ms.
Adams happily supported herself as a teacher at Tompkins Hall
Nursery School. Often, she'd dash straight from the playground to a
try-out, a habit that proved vexing to more than one Manhattan
casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd call my agent and ask, `Can she at least brush her
hair?' '' said Ms. Adams.
</P>
<P>
   During the making of ``Happiness,'' Solondz's most frequent
instruction to Ms. Adams was, ``Let's do it again, this time with
`more child,' '' trying to get her to convey how Joy has a blind
openness to everyone in her path, no matter whether they come
bearing kisses or stinging criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 18-hour days on the ``Happiness'' set in New Jersey,
when Ms. Adams would head home to New York feeling ``sleep-deprived
and hallucinating,'' by the next morning she was ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to be as naive as Joy, but it was wonderful to
be allowed to live in her skin,'' said Ms. Adams by telephone a few
weeks later, after having accompanied ``Happiness'' to film
festivals in Deauville, France, and Toronto. There, she said, she
encountered ``whole tablefuls of people debating, which I think is
a testament to Todd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They either didn't get it _ or they really loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her family, they have not yet seen ``Happiness,''
although her mother read the script before shooting began. ``She
told me that she liked it,'' said Ms. Adams. ``But she also said,
`Thank (italics)God,(end italics) you're not part of the pedophilia
storyline.' ''

 &HT;    5 keys to Braves success in NLCS
 &HT;    (EDS: Resending correct game information)
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. GET THE BIG CAT PURRING
</P>
<P>
   No one's transformed the Braves' lineup more than Andres
Galarraga. Batting cleanup, the Big Cat led the club in homers (44,
a franchise record for first basemen), RBIs (121) and slugging
percentage (.595). With 414 RBIs over the last three seasons, he's
the first NL player in 50 years with 400 or more RBIs in a
three-year span. But after hitting his 41st and 42nd homers Aug.
30, Galarraga had a quiet September. In 20 games, he hit .283
(19-for-67) with just two homers and nine RBIs.Galarraga needs to
rediscover his August stroke and reinvigorate the middle of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   2. NOW LEADING OFF SECOND, WALT WEISS
</P>
<P>
   Now that Atlanta's shortstop is once again healthy, wealthy and
Weiss, the Braves need Walt Weiss to be on base more, too. As adept
defensively as advertised, Weiss was, when healthy, a revelation as
a leadoff man. While Weiss hit .280 (22 points above his career
average of .258 entering 1998), his on-base percentage of .386
(157-of-407) was fourth-best among NL leadoff men. Atlanta was
68-28 (.708) when Weiss started, but he played only 96 games due to
a chronically strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   3. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: TONY GWYNN
</P>
<P>
   No one hits Braves pitching like Gwynn, the eight-time NL
batting champion who hit .321 this year his 16th straight .300
season. Against Atlanta's big three of John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and
Greg Maddux, Gwynn went 4-for-8 with two doubles, a homer (off
Glavine) and two RBIs this year. His career numbers against that
six-Cy Young threesome, however, are truly staggering: 91-for-226,
.402, four homers, 17 walks and but three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   4. BE SAFELY HOME BY 7
</P>
<P>
   In other words, score quickly, take an early lead and make sure
it's maintained by the seventh-inning stretch. If not, Atlanta's at
the mercy Trevor Hoffman. Hoffman was the premier closer in the big
leagues in '98, tying Randy Myers NL record of 53 saves. The Braves
were hitless in 10 at-bats this season (four K's) against Hoffman,
who earned saves in all three of his appearances against Atlanta
(three innings, three K's). He's historically tough on Galarraga
(2-for-10 lifetime, seven K's), Javy Lopez (1-for-7, three K's) and
Weiss (1-for-8, one walk).
</P>
<P>
   5. A SAN DIEGO BROWNOUT
</P>
<P>
   Although he won't start Game 1 and thus won't pitch three times
if the series goes the full seven games , Kevin Brown is a big
Braves hurdle to overcome.Brown beat Atlanta twice in last year's
NLCS while with Florida. Brown started just once this season
against Atlanta, a 2-0 shutout Aug. 20 in San Diego. He's
exceptionally tough against Braves batters, especially Galarraga
(2-for-11, five K's), Ryan Klesko (3-for-17) and Lopez (2-for-14,
one homer).

 Industry Hails AMD Profits As Good Sign   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a signal that the worst may be over for the semiconductor
industry, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a surprising
third-quarter profit yesterday and stronger-than-expected sales.
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMD's net profit of $1.01 million, or 1 cent a share, comes on
the heels of Monday's announcement by Motorola Inc., the world's
third-largest chipmaker, of a profitable third quarter and upbeat
projections for 1999 sales and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Chip industry analysts said the results showed the semiconductor
industry recovering from a painful, long-running slump but were
divided on whether it signaled an immediate upswing
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying for a while now that the light is at the
end of the tunnel for the semiconductor industry. The AMD results
as well as the Motorola results are evidence of that,'' said Mark
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are seeing a recovery in the marketplace coming
off a very difficult environment in the first half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc., said that,
although the worst may be over, the industry still may not start
recovering for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see more of an L-shaped correction,''
Kumar said. ``Things are going to drag along the bottom for quite
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD, the Sunnyvale chipmaker that had posted four consecutive
losing quarters, surprised Wall Street analysts by reporting it had
turned a profit for the third quarter that ended September 27.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected AMD to lose 11 cents per share, according
to First Call Corp., and even the more optimistic projections had
AMD losing 5 cents a share. AMD itself didn't expect to regain
profitability until the fourth quarter, especially after posting a
$64.5 million loss in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   AMD said sales of its K6-2 microprocessor, launched in May as
its latest competitor to Intel's Pentium II, led the boost in
third-quarter revenues to $685.9 million for the quarter, compared
to sales of $526.5 million in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of K6 increased by more than 1 million units to 3.8
million units, and sales increased 70 percent compared to the
second quarter, Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders also noted PC Data showed the K6 had captured 54
percent of the sub-$1,000 computer market.
</P>
<P>
   AMD announced that Sony Corp. plans to use the K6-2 chip in its
newest Vaio computers that will be launched in Japan later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a recent forecast by Dataquest of San Jose said the
worldwide semiconductor market will grow 11.8 percent in 1999
following a decline of 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone said a ``snap back'' in demand for computers will
boost the semiconductor industry, and AMD in particular.
</P>
<P>
   One risk in the fourth quarter is that chip-production cutbacks
earlier this year may mean there aren't enough PCs to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were too pessimistic in their forecasts for second-half
demand,'' Edelstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar was less enthusiastic about AMD's results, saying the
underlying economic problems that exacerbated the chip slump
remain. He maintained his neutral rating on AMD.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed?'' Kumar said. ``Japan is in the mother of
all recessions and it's going to be for years and years before they
show signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though AMD's K-6 chip has cut into Intel's market share,
it's at the lower-end, sub-$1,000 PC market level, which has lower
profit margins, Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain about whether AMD can deliver its planned K7
chip to compete in the more lucrative corporate PC market with
Intel, which has that area ``in its crosshairs,'' Kumar said.

 S.F. Money Manager Listed Erroneous Degrees on Resume   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Institutional money manager Frank Husic didn't get a doctorate in
economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Nor did he earn a
bachelor's degree in economics from Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble is, documents filed by his San Francisco firm, Husic
Capital Management, with the Securities and Exchange Commission
stated that he did. And that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Husic is, and has been for some time, a successful money
manager. The firm he founded has more than $3.6 billion under
management, meaning it handles big chunks of money for corporate
and government pension funds. In addition, it dabbles in mutual
funds. Until earlier this year, Husic Capital managed a portfolio
for Vanguard, the highly regarded mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   But now it remains to be seen how Husic's starched-collar
clients will react to the revelation that he may have fudged on his
academic credentials. After all, pension fund advisers aren't
exactly the boat shoe and khaki crowd that do handshake deals over
flapjacks at Buck's in Woodside. This is corporate America _ cubed
_ we're talking about here.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the world of institutional money management
plays by the rules because it is playing with other people's money:
most likely yours and mine. These people are a very conservative
lot, and the possibility that one of their kind padded the ol'
resume isn't likely to be shoved under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integrity is everything in this business,'' says B. Thomas
Willison, a longtime management and marketing consultant to money
managers who now lives near Lake Tahoe. And the falsification of
academic credentials ``would certainly call into question virtually
everything a firm has done.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancies in Husic's records were unveiled when his
company amended a filing to the federal government in August. Money
management firms are required to file forms with the SEC that
provide basic information about their operations and principals.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Husic Capital reported that Frank Husic had a
doctorate from Penn and an undergraduate degree from Carnegie
Mellon. Now, the company has revised its records with the SEC and
implies that the federal agency got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``After discovering some factual inaccuracies, Husic Capital
Management earlier this year corrected information pertaining to
Frank Husic's academic background,'' according to a statement
provided by the firm's publicist in Los Angeles. Husic would not
grant an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, according to the company's statement, Husic
holds an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Youngstown State
University, a master's degree in business from the University of
Pennsylvania and a master's degree in industrial administration
from Carnegie Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   And what else can Husic say? If his records were falsified, any
sign of culpability would open the money manager to greater
scrutiny by the feds and would inflict additional damage to his
credibility. Needless to say, knowingly reporting false information
to the SEC would violate its rules. For its part, the SEC isn't
saying much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as a policy matter, don't state whether we are
investigating people. So I can't comment,'' says Helane Morrison,
the SEC's head of enforcement in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could all be a big mistake. It's possible that the
bureaucrats in Washington might have screwed up. And one might be
inclined to give Husic the benefit of the doubt if there were only
a single discrepancy. Unfortunately for Husic, there were three: no
Ph.D. and the wrong undergraduate college and degree. (Forgive me
if I'm wrong, but even an inside-the-Beltway paper-pusher ought to
recognize the difference between Youngstown State and Carnegie
Mellon.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't expect any official repercussions from this
credential snafu. Sources close to the SEC say the agency isn't
likely to pursue a false-records case. The offense isn't egregious
enough. Which begs the question: What's the downside to fudging on
SEC documents?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long after President Clinton admitted that he lied to
the nation about having sex with Monica Lewinsky that the debate
was reshaped to examine the degree to which he lied.
</P>
<P>
   And in other cases, the debate centers on the degree to which a
fib becomes a major offense. But ethics professor Kirk Hanson at
the Stanford Graduate School of Business says fudging on academic
records doesn't have to become a federal case to warrant serious
concern. Sometimes it leads to a pattern of breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were an investor and senior management was suspected to
have falsified documents ... I would want to examine the (firm in
question) with a fine-toothed comb,'' Hanson says.

 New Buy By Lycos _ Wired Digital   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wired Digital, the last remnant of San Francisco digital media
empire Wired Ventures, was sold yesterday to Internet directory
firm Lycos for $83 million in stock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The acquisition is the latest in a buying binge by Lycos to
establish its online service as &UR;  &LR; a major portal _ an all-in-one Web
site that combines e-mail, chat rooms, search engines and other
features to hook users and generate advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cements our position as a leading media company,'' Lycos
chief executive Bob Davis said in an interview. ``People want
original, brand-name news content and personality on their sites,
not just wire stories. You need to give them reasons to log on and
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waltham, Mass., company plans to integrate all of Wired
Digital's operations into its service.
</P>
<P>
   Wired News, which posts breaking news and commentary on the
high-tech industry, will be the main source of news on Lycos.
HotWired, Wired's cultural lifestyle Web 'zine, will provide
features.
</P>
<P>
   The HotBot search engine, which reaches 4 million visitors a
month, will be combined with Lycos' popular search engine.
Webmonkey will continue as a resource for online developers, and
the satirical Suck.com magazine will be spotlighted as an
alternative Web community.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In all, Wired Digital attracts about 5 million users a month,
ranking it among the 25-most visited Internet sites, according to
Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta market researcher. (Lycos ranked
fourth in the August poll.)
</P>
<P>
   Lycos also expects to sweeten e-commerce deals with the likes of
CDnow and Barnes and Noble because Wired users tend to buy more
goods online than other Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' acquisition of Wired Digital is its splashiest pickup,
but hardly its only one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lycos has purchased companies to create personal Web
pages (WhoWhere for $133 million) and communities (Tripod, $58
million), provide free e-mail (MailCity, a product from WhoWhere)
and offer an online travel service (Guest-World, $4 million).
</P>
<P>
   The additions are expected to bolster its audience against
rivals Yahoo, Excite and Infoseek. Industry experts said Lycos
needed to dramatically expand its online offerings to compete
against such well-known brand names.
</P>
<P>
   But one Lycos competitor said the company's challenge goes far
beyond buying popular Web sites. ``It's not about traffic and page
views,'' the rival said. ``It's about building customer loyalty and
brand-name recognition.'' The move also increases Lycos' presence
in the Bay Area. With the addition of 150 Wired Digital workers in
San Francisco, Lycos will employ 250 people on the West Coast, 600
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inexpensive, smart acquisition _ considering the
amount of money that companies are throwing at Internet
properties,'' said analyst Andrea Williams of Volpe Brown Whelan in
San Francisco. ``Wired Digital differentiates Lycos from Yahoo and
Excite, and it is on the verge of profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital's sales are expected to nearly double _ to $24
million this year _ and it should be profitable by the end of 1998,
company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While the buyout signifies the emergence of Lycos as a major
portal player, it also marks the end of Wired Ventures, the
trail-blazing media company that started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founders Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe will have no role
at Lycos, and Wired Venture's board of directors will be dissolved
after the deal is completed later this year, a Wired spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to mount an initial public offering in 1996,
Rossetto stepped down as CEO in July 1997. In May, Wired Ventures
sold its flagship magazine for $75 million to Advance Publications
Inc., the New York owner of the New Yorker and Conde Nast, which
publishes Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair, among others.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wired Ventures executives said the sale of the
5-year-old monthly would enable it to pay off short-term debt and
plow more money into the online business.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the online division yesterday acknowledged it
had been exploring other options. Executives said they were in
discussions with Lycos and several unnamed companies for several
months about a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a number of strategic alternatives: Either we remain
independent, go public, merge or sell,'' said Beth Vanderslice,
president of Wired Digital. ``Lycos gave our product and people the
best opportunity to play on a larger scale. We took it.''

LESLEY, ART INSTITUTE OF BOSTON, TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lesley College and the Art Institute of Boston plan to
announce their merger Wednesday, an improbable alliance that
highlights how colleges are scrambling to be more attractive to
applicants in an increasingly competitive field.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing the art institute, the oldest art school in Boston,
will mean Cambridge-based Lesley can increase its lucrative adult
education programs, appealing to the fastest growing population in
higher education, and move closer to becoming a university. That
change alone can significantly boost prestige, and desirability,
for a school that now is known mostly for teacher programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of changing and being flexible with the
times,'' Lesley president Margaret McKenna said. ``Colleges need to
think of creative ways of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This doesn't mean Lesley wants to become Harvard, but within
the region of competition, it has to make itself as attractive as
it can be,'' said Clare Cotton, head of the Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts. ``All
colleges are looking for ways to broaden their appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   While enrollment at small schools with ``college'' in the name
has declined since the 1970s, enrollment at ones designated
``universities'' has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families believe that a university offers a wider spectrum of
courses and programs, and a wider variety of job options after
college,'' Cotton said. ``A lot of what families are looking for in
a school is a job after graduation. That's a major change over the
past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 89-year-old Lesley has already begun emphasizing its
self-designation as ``a modern university,'' although the official
change would require approval by state agencies and accreditors,
and the creation of additional PhD programs. Now, Lesley offers
just one, in education, but the merger opens the possibility of a
PhD program in fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   The art institute, with 500 undergraduate students, will stay in
its current building on the edge of Kenmore Square, and become the
fifth school within Lesley, adding to the Graduate Schools of
Education, Management, and Arts and Social Sciences, and the School
of Undergraduate Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The institute boasts enrollment at a 25-year high and solid
financial status. But the merger will allow it to expand programs,
and with that, attract more students. Undergraduates have asked the
school for years to begin programs in art therapy and arts
education, and Lesley offers both. The school, as part of Lesley,
will also begin masters programs in fine arts. And if students
decide to abandon art degrees, it will mean changing majors, not
reapplying to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the students, it's hard to think of any
negatives,'' said AIB president Stan Trecker. &UR;  &LR; ``They just have
more options rather than fewer. If there are logical reasons to do
it for the students, you can make the distance between the campuses
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger doesn't address several weaknesses at both schools.
Between them, they still have no athletic facilities or fields. The
Art Institute still needs dorms. Lesley, with 1,500 undergraduates
and 4,500 graduates, was ranked second in the North for highest
student debt load in this year's US News and World Report rankings,
which generally means the school is expensive and doesn't offer
sufficient financial aid. And its teacher-training program, which
turns out the most of any private institution in Massachusetts,
also had the second-highest rate of failures among private schools
with significant numbers of test-takers on the state teacher tests
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger does offer other benefits to Lesley, which in
recent years has also started a school in Israel and programs in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesley doesn't have a presence in Boston, and we have a very
strong presence in Boston,'' said Rosemarie Sansone, a board member
at the Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has been quietly in the works since January, and was
approved by the boards at both schools this month.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna acknowledged that the merger might seem unexpected,
given that the schools are relatively far apart in distance, and
don't completely meet one another's needs. Still, she said, they
shared a similar atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to almost everyone who has done a merger,'' she
said, ``and one of the most important things is your mission, your
values, and your culture. Both institutions, despite the disparate
sides, share a real attention to students.''

PATAKI DELIVERS A MILLION REBATE CHECKS, IN MID-CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEVITTOWN, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki is taking advantage of one
of the most powerful and time-honored perks of political incumbency
_ the ability to dole out the largesse of government. But instead
of the usual library grant here, road project there, the governor
is going tradition one better, with two programs that are sending
refund checks to more than 1 million New Yorkers in the middle of
his campaign for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The refunds are a result of Pataki's having found at least
partial solutions to two of the state's more intractable problems _
rising property taxes and Long Island's high utility rates _ and
many Democrats have been unwilling to carp about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor traveled to Long Island on Tuesday to pose for
pictures with residents who have benefited from the property
tax-reduction program for the elderly, and to hand Angelo Pioli, a
man in his 70s, the first of 1 million rebate checks for customers
of the now-defunct Long Island Lighting Co. Standing under the oak
tree in Pioli's front yard here, Pataki insisted that there was
nothing political about the blizzard of checks being delivered
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the soonest they could go out,'' he said. ``If we
could have done it sooner, we would have.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, New York City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, charged that the check-writing was nothing but politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really so transparent, it's sad,'' he said. ``He can't
possibly think the people are so easily fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the parade of Long Island elected officials who joined
the governor and praised him Tuesday were a number of Democrats who
were not inclined to take issue with the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there might be politics to it and he gets the political
benefit,'' said Bruce Nyman, the Democratic minority leader of the
Nassau County Legislature. ``That's fine with me. He's the one who
made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility rebate checks are a product of the $6 billion
takeover of LILCO in May by the Long Island Power Authority, a
state agency. By refinancing LILCO's debts at lower interest rates,
the authority has reduced electric rates an average of 20 percent,
saving customers about $490 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, every home and business in Nassau County
and the Rockaways is to get a check for $232, and those in Suffolk
County will get $101. Each of those one million checks will be
accompanied by a letter from the Long Island Power Authority
praising the governor.
</P>
<P>
   This comes on the heels of checks averaging about $750 going to
700,000 low- and moderate-income elderly residents across the state
over the last six weeks, under Pataki's effort to reduce the
property taxes charged by local school districts. Beginning next
year, every homeowner in the state is to be included in what the
governor has called the Star program, which he says will lower the
average property tax bill 27 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason for either program to send out checks.
Property tax and utility bills could simply have been reduced by
the appropriate amount. Done that way, voters might never have
noticed the benefit, or at least might not have been aware that it
was Pataki they had to thank.

KERRY PLANS TO TEST WATERS IN N.H. THIS MONTH  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry's trip to New Hampshire this month will be
an early step in exploring the possibility of a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Kerry said the junior senator, who has
considered traveling to New Hampshire several times in recent
months only to decide the timing wasn't right, has settled on an
Oct. 23 trip that will mix some meeting with activists, fund
raising for New Hampshire Democrats, and guest lecturing on issues
he hopes to make his own if he does run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Tuesday played down his planned journey north to the site
of the first presidential primary, saying the trip was mostly to
help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going up in response to a number of requests over a long
period of time,'' Kerry said. ``I am going to help raise money for
the Democratic Party in the state and to just get a feel for what
people are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry, who says he will decide whether to run for president
by the early next year, acknowledged he will probably be thinking,
and perhaps talking, presidential politics as part of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going up to listen and to have a dialogue,'' Kerry said.
``It is a way to combine getting a feel for what is on people's
minds and getting a sense of the lay of the land ... and also (part
of) a long-promised process as to how I will sort out whether or
not I might run.''
</P>
<P>
   The source close to Kerry was more succinct: ``This is certainly
his first foray into New Hampshire to test the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's camp, looking at the effect of the victories
then-Governor Michael Dukakis scored in the New Hampshire primary
in 1988 and former US Senator Paul Tsongas logged there in 1992,
believe a strong showing in the Granite State could rocket Kerry
into national prominence if he decides to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said Tuesday that with California having moved its
primary to March 7 _ the same day as the so-called Yankee primary
when most of New England votes _ candidates would have to be ready
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some very good political heads who are taking a look at
the whole process, what kind of funds are necessary,'' Kerry said.
``The nuts and bolts are being analzyed pretty carefully right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   An early California primary is generally expected to benefit
candidates who are well-known, like Vice President Al Gore, or
those who can pour substantial money into the state's media
markets. Because of his wife's wealth, Kerry would clearly fall
into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's tenative schedule calls for him to begin his day in
Portsmouth at a breakfast with Democratic Party activists. The
senator will then venture to Durham, where he will be a guest
lecturer to a combined University of New Hampshire political
science class. There, Kerry will discuss his ideas on education, an
issue he addressed in a June speech that was designed as an
intellectual framework for a possible presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry will then travel to Manchester for at least one event with
political activists and union officials. Kerry also plans
fund-raisers in Concord and Hanover.

 &HT;    Publishing company for sale after 122 years
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Amos Press Inc., a Sidney-based publishing
company that owns a chain of suburban Dayton newspapers plus coin
and stamp magazines, is up for sale after 122 years of family
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with 1997 revenues of $41 million, has hired
Jordan, Edmiston Group Inc., a New York investment banking firm
that specializes in newspaper properties, to find a buyer. Asking
price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The family plans to sell all of its publishing properties,
including the Sidney Daily News and other newspapers and hobby
magazines, but retain ownership of VisionMark, a Sidney-based
manufacturer of plaques and industrial name plates.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came less than a year after Amos acquired Tipp
City-based Bowling-Moorman Newspapers for an undisclosed price. At
the time, Bowling-Moorman published eight newspapers in communities
north of Dayton, while Amos published nine newspapers in Dayton's
south and east communities.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Francis, Amos board chairman, said in a letter to the
company's 375 employees, that the next generation of Amos family
heirs has pursued careers in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, 58, who married Margaret Amos, said about a dozen
family members own stock in the company. He and co-chairman John
Amos, 60, are ready to pass the torch, he said, but no one is there
to take it. The youngest of the heirs is 28.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth generation of Amos offspring has scattered around the
United States, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've held many family meetings, and they just aren't
interested in coming back to Sidney to be owner-managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amos family has been involved in running the company going
back to 1876, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, therefore, reached the end of the line of
owner-managers,'' Francis and Amos wrote to employees. ``Once that
was determined, the question became when to sell. The current
market for publishing companies appears to be favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said they expect it will take six months to eight months
to find a buyer and close the deal. They chose to inform employees
``up-front,'' he said, because the family has always tried to make
Amos Press and its subsidiaries a good place to work.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the family said it wants the company's growth to
continue. ``We have always believed that we must grow the business
or it shrinks. Amos Press has grown nicely over the years. We want
that growth to continue. To do that in the future will require
large resources to compete with large communication(s) companies.
Consolidation of the industry continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton of Morton Research of
Baltimore said a general rule of thumb is that smaller publishing
chains sell for 1 to 1 times annual revenues, which for Amos last
year was $41 million. Morton said prospective buyers would include
area publishers such as Thomson Newspapers, the Toronto-based chain
that owns more than 100 small dailies, including newspapers in
Miamisburg, Monroe and Lebanon.

 &HT;    'Headhunter' monicker still haunts Wright
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York media, always looking to toss a match
into a rubble pile, tried to turn Jaret Wright into a Broadway
stage show villain before the 22-year-old right-hander threw his
first pitch for the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night in Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during a workout, Wright felt as if he was sitting
under a 100-watt light bulb in the interrogation room of NYPD Blue
, as wave after wave of reporters asked him, ``Are you a
headhunter?''
</P>
<P>
   It goes back to March 2, an early-spring exhibition game between
the Yankees and Indians. New York's Hideki Irabu hit two Indians.
Wright then hit infielder Luis Sojo, breaking his wrist as he threw
his arm in front of his face to ward off an inside fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee starter David Wells squirted some kerosene on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation with Luis Sojo, that was a long time ago,''
Wells said. ``And sometimes you have to let bygones by bygones. But
if guys are a little more aggressive and you have to pitch inside,
I understand that. But you don't have to pitch up and in and head
hunt. That is one thing I don't believe in. I don't think it's
right because you can really hurt somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo believes he was wronged by Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way it happened . . . we hit two guys, then he hits me,''
Sojo said. ``It's one thing to push a guy off the plate, but he
threw at my head. You don't do that. We got family, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wright, ``I've been asked about whether I am hitting people
on purpose time and time again. I'm just out there trying to get
outs.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot was made of the fact that Wright hit Paul O'Neill in
June and that fact he has hit 11 batter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Uh . . . New York's David Cone has hit 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the Game 2 pitching matchup would feature
Cleveland's Dwight Gooden and that David Cone would pitch Game 1
instead of Game 2 tonight. And New Yorkers wanted to see former
Met/Yankee Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Both managers were ready with explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cleveland's Mike Hargrove about Charles Nagy starting
today's game, ``Nagy has been our best pitcher the second half of
the season and the last time he pitched very well against the
Yankees.'' In two starts against New York, Nagy was 1-0 with a 1.72
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy has not lost since Sept. 11, including a 4-1 over the
Yankees on Sept. 21. Gooden is scheduled for long relief over the
first three games, then might start Game 4 if he isn't used in the
first three games, or if Dave Burba doesn't start Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre purposely held Cone back a day so he
could pitch in the warm sunshine of the day instead of the chill of
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cone sometimes feels numbness in his finger-tips after
undergoing surgery to correct an aneurysm in his right arm two
years ago. Cone said he felt numbness when he pitched Opening Day
April 4, but he went on to pitch 207 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be as cold as Opening Day,'' Cone said. ``That day
there was a wind-chill factor of 30. It shouldn't be that low for
Game two. I should be OK. This is fine. It's in the mid-50s. I can
get warmed up. And I have more than 200 innings under my belt. On
Opening Day, I was just starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees and Indians play Game two, Yankees Director of
Scouting Gene Michael and six other scouts will be in Atlanta
tonight watching the Braves and Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Before they played Texas, the Yankees had a 200-page report in a
blue binder on the Rangers and before they played Cleveland they
had a 200-page report in a red binder on the Indians put together
by Michael and his staff after they tracked the Tribe for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland outfielder Brian Giles knows all about Shane Spencer,
the career minor-leaguer who suddenly is the toast of Times Square
after hitting 10 homers in 67 at-bats at the end of the regular
season for the Yankees _ including three grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Giles and Spencer grew up together in El Cajon, Calif., and
played Pop Warner League football together. They were 8 and played
for the Ravens. On the day they played Valencia Park, the best team
in the league, they won, 2-0, on a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane was the guy who made the tackle for the safety,'' Giles
said. Spencer also hit two home runs in the American League
Division Series sweep of Texas and Giles said, ``I'm just hoping
he'll still talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Bernie Williams, the American League's batting
champion (.339) is a free agent looking for a new contract. He and
the Yankees reportedly are only, uh, $2.5 million apart in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, though, isn't making a very good statement about his
usefulness in the postseason. He was 0 for 9 in three ALDS games
this year against Texas, he was 2 for 17 against Cleveland last
fall in the ALDS and he is 6 for his last 50 (.120) postseason
at-bats going into Game 1 of the ALCS Tuesday.

 &HT;    Cats! Fleas! Haven't we endured enough wildness?
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wild cats don't belong in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nothing wild belongs in Palm Beach. Ever since the
Pulitzer divorce trial, Palm Beachers have been deeply embarrassed
by feral behavior on the island.
</P>
<P>
   And now, we mainlanders have been treated to this shocking news:
</P>
<P>
   Fleas in the Flagler.
</P>
<P>
   How unthinkable! Yes, that stately museum, the epitome of Palm
Beach elegance and stodginess, has been troubled with fleas in its
carpets.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as unlikely as finding an Astroturf lawn on Mar-a-Lago,
a Wal-Mart on Worth Avenue or a mangy pit bulldog chained outside
the Estee Lauder estate.
</P>
<P>
   The flea problem at the Flagler is all because of wild cats.
They've formed increasingly large colonies on the island, in what
must undoubtedly be a mating scene that makes Clematis Street look
like a Southern Baptist wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's executive director, John Blades, has tried his best
to get rid of the cats, doing everything short of opening up a
Chinese restaurant in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Blades has hired a trapper to catch the cats and take them to
the pound. But his efforts have been thwarted by a local do-gooder,
a veritable cat crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bradley, a.k.a ``Cat Lady,'' has been going to the
pound, rounding up the captured cats and returning them to Palm
Beach, where she feeds them and hundreds of others on the island.
</P>
<P>
   It's her calling. Her passion.
</P>
<P>
   You usually see this kind of single-minded devotion in folks who
pray outside of abortion clinics or buy Leonardo DiCaprio
biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-cat.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't understand why cats who live in the wild need
somebody to put out store-bought cat food for them every day.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a form of welfare, enabling slothful cat behavior by
feeding them when they could be out there earning a cat living on
their own by hunting and eating a host of other pesky wild
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Lady claims she's doing a great service because she's paying
to have the cats spayed before releasing them back in Palm Beach.
But even so, the population of wild cats keeps increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The museum director is hoping he'll solve the problem by getting
another cat lover to take the cats off the island. But he tried
that already, and it didn't work. Cat Lady ended up dissuading the
alleged rescuer from relocating the Palm Beach cats.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the quickest solution to the Palm Beach cat problem
would be to stop trapping the cats and instead, set a trap for Cat
Lady.
</P>
<P>
   I've met Cat Lady, and I think she could stand another hobby,
something really time consuming like watching 'round-the-clock,
Clinton-in-crisis TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But I think Cat Lady should be left alone to be Cat Lady. Sure,
it's an odd calling. But certainly more understandable than say,
being Dolfan Denny.
</P>
<P>
   The cat problem can be solved another way. It rests in Palm
Beachers' quest for tax write-offs and influence.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study showed that Palm Beachers contribute more money
to federal-level political candidates than any other community in
Florida. During the 1995-96 election cycle, Palm Beachers gave more
than twice as much money as any other community in the state.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the deal: If Palm Beachers want to get rid of fleas in
the Flagler, they need to insist that all candidates who come to
town looking for cash end up leaving with at least one wild cat.
</P>
<P>
   Want the cash? Take the cat.
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get the tab, if you get the Tabby.
</P>
<P>
   The island's feral cat population will then be redistributed all
over the country, and Cat Lady would have to find another
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   How about Wood-borer Insect Lady?
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, nobody's stepped forward to champion the bugs
that are eating the pilings on the Royal Park Bridge.

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ While some Ohio State fans may yawn at the
thought of this Saturday's OSU-Illinois match up, Buckeyes' coach
John Cooper knows better.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the days not so long ago when the Fighting Illini
regularly whipped the Buckeyes. In fact, behind Michigan, Illinois
is the Big Ten team with the best record (6-4) against Cooper in
his 10 seasons at Ohio State. ``When I first came into this league,
I think other than Michigan, they probably had the best talent of
anybody we played,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several NFL players, including Arizona Cardinals linebacker
Simeon Rice, Oakland Raiders quarterback Jeff George and St. Louis
Rams linebacker Dana Howard starred on Illini teams that beat the
Cooper-coached Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   OSU lost to Illinois five straight years, from 1988 _ Cooper's
first at OSU _ to 1992. It wasn't until 1993 that the Buckeyes
finally won and began to turn the tide. Ohio State is 4-1 vs. the
Fighting Illini since '93.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just talent, though, that foiled the Buckeyes in a few
of those early losses. Sometimes it was a fluke play here, or a
fluke performance there, that hurt them. For example, in 1989
Illinois won, 34-14, even with backup freshman quarterback Jason
Verduzco playing in place of the injured George. In 1992, OSU
tailback Eddie George lost two fumbles near the Illinois goal line,
which led to an 18-16 UI victory.
</P>
<P>
   The past three years, of course, have been a different story.
The Buckeyes have won by a combined score of 130-9 in the teams'
games since 1995. And there's little reason to believe the scoring
gap won't widen this year.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 Buckeyes boast a stifling defense and an offense that
averages 479.5 yards per game, the best in the conference.
Illinois, on the other hand, has defeated just one Division I-A
opponent in its last 22 games (they defeated Northwestern last
weekend, 13-10) and starts freshmen at quarterback and at running
back on a youth-laden team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to build the confidence up and
nothing does that better than getting some wins,'' second-year
Illini coach Ron Turner said. ``But as young as we are, it takes
time to build that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said coaching instability _ the Illini have had three
coaches in the past seven years _ and a slip in recruiting are
probably two reasons the fortunes have fallen for Illinois. It had
recorded eight winning seasons between 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they haven't recruited as well as they used to,''
Cooper said. During their winning days, the Fighting Illini used to
get the best players out of St. Louis but that no longer is the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, when you're down, it's hard to get back
up,'' he said.

 &HT;    Longhorns finally feel good about run defense
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Week after week during football seasons past and
present, senior linebacker Dusty Renfro has done what might amount
to the bravest thing he's ever attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Not stand in against some of the top rushing offenses in the
nation. Show up at the Monday media conference and answer questions
about the play of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a long time I've been able to come
in here and say good things,'' Renfro said Monday as he attacked a
plate of barbecue and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro and his teammates held Darren Davis to only 53 yards, 97
below his average, and his Iowa State Cyclones to only 36 net yards
rushing _ reason enough for a big appetite and even bigger smile.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Renfro has been on teams that have won a combined 65
percent of their games, before this season he's also played on
three of the five worst rush defenses in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel good about winning, but as a unit, you don't want to
give up that many yards,'' Renfro said. ``That leaves a sour taste
in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has held down strong rushing attacks in consecutive weeks
against Rice and Iowa State, but the worst might be yet to come. In
the next five games the Horns face four teams that rank in the top
25 nationally in rushing, including three in the top 15 (Texas
Tech, fifth; Nebraska, sixth; and Oklahoma, 14th).
</P>
<P>
   This week the Horns will play an Oklahoma team that's still
trying to get comfortable with what was touted as a wishbone
triple-option offense, but in reality has relied more on lead and
dive option plays out of the power-I formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to run the option, but I don't know how much or
when,'' Texas Coach Mack Brown said. ``We're not sure who we'll see
the most. They've got a guy who'll run the option (Brandon Daniels)
and a guy who'll throw more (Patrick Fletcher).''
</P>
<P>
   Even though OU will be without the left side of its line _ guard
Adam Carpenter and tackle Scott Kempenich _ with injuries, the
Sooners still have junior halfback De'Mond Parker, and that's
enough to get the Horns' attention. Last season as a sophomore,
Parker ran for 291 yards and three touchdowns, including late
scoring runs of 48 and 66 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fast and slippery,'' Renfro said. ``He's an expert
at breaking tackles. We really have to latch on. We have to grab
cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can outrun our cutoff angles. So we'll run all-out to get
there, and if he sees that, he'll cut it back. ... He's probably
the best running back we'll play against.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Ricky (Williams),'' said strongside
linebacker Anthony Hicks. ``Both can run by you, both can run over
you. Of course, I think Ricky's better and practicing against him
is going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a cutback runner in Davis, defensive coordinator Carl
Reese stressed two things to his players: Swarm to Davis but don't
abandon your assignment if the play goes away from you _ more than
likely he'll come back your way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any great back can be reduced to a good back if you have
everyone around him,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will also be able to concentrate more on stopping the run
the rest of the season. None of its remaining opponents rank in the
top 50 in the NCAA in passing efficiency. Texas Tech is the best,
ranked 51st, followed by Oklahoma State (72), Nebraska (84), Baylor
(89), Texas A&AMP;M (97) and Oklahoma (104).
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Iowa State quarterback Todd Bandhauer's
437-yard, five-touchdown performance last week, OU's moribund
passing game will be a welcome change for the Horns. The Sooners
have completed only 39 percent of their passes but have a knack for
play-action success _ five of their 23 completions have been for
touchdowns and their average completion is for 20.3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rush defense is one of the areas in which the Horns needed
improvement heading into this season. Here's a quick look at the
other areas that needed work:
</P>
<P>
   _ Long drives. Of the 27 touchdowns allowed, 16 have come on
drives longer than 60 yards. Of the other 11, one was scored by
special teams, one on an interception return and seven others were
set up by turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the red zone. Opponents have scored on 19 of 22 trips
inside the Texas 20-yard line, and only one of those was a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turnovers forced. This is the one area in which the Horns are
vastly improved, with 13 this season _ one fewer than they forced
all of last year. What the Horns have to do better is turn them
into points _ they've scored only 35.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three and out. In the first three games the Horns held the
opponent without a first down in only eight of 39 possessions (21
percent). Over the last two they've improved it to 10 of 27 (37
percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Third-down conversions. That's dropped from 50 percent to 32
percent over the same period, but the Horns continue to be dogged
by poor efficiency on fourth down, where they've stopped the
opponent only once in 10 plays all season _ a late goal-line stand
against Kansas State.

 &HT;    LCRA water rights buy goes to state agency today
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin and other cities near the Colorado River
will not need to search for new sources of water until 2090 if
state regulators approve a $75 million purchase of water rights
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood Irrigation Co., which serves rice farmers near the
Gulf of Mexico, has agreed to sell its considerable water rights to
the Lower Colorado River Authorityfor the highest price in Texas
history.
</P>
<P>
   Before the LCRA can begin closing the deal, the sale needs
approval from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission _
and that could come at a commission meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do a jig in the street if we get this thing
wrapped up,'' said Mark Rose, general manager of the LCRA. ``If
it's approved, you can put a bow on it. I think we can have this
closed by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   How much water is at stake? Enough each year to cover one acre
to the depth of 25 miles. More importantly, it's enough water to
extend the LCRA's supply for cities and major industries to 2090 _
a crucial consideration in a fast-growing, drought-prone region.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to this point, however, has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Garwood and the LCRA had to overcome a half-century of
animosity over water charges that Garwood considered excessive and
over LCRA efforts to restrict the company's access to the river.
Then, the LCRA had to overcome protests from Austin, Lago Vista and
Lakeway. The cities objected to Garwood's decision to sell 20
percent of its water to Corpus Christi, which is well outside the
Colorado River basin.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood rights are considered one of the state's top water
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood's water rights are the oldest on the Colorado River,
dating to a November 1900 state permit. Under state law, Garwood's
rights must be satisfied first _ even if an extended drought limits
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, water rights can be bought and sold like any
private property. Whoever buys the Garwood rights would stand first
in line for Colorado River water.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the value of the water rights is that Garwood forms
the largest block of privately held water on the Colorado River _
168,000 acre-feet a year, or almost 55 billion gallons. An
acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover an acre to a depth
of one foot, or about 326,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood has asked the three members of the state's Natural
Resource Conservation Commission to approve the sale of water
rights for 133,000 acre-feet a year to the LCRA and 35,000
acre-feet to Corpus Christi. The commission's executive director,
Jeff Saitas, has recommended approval.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA would pay $75 million for its share. To repay the debt,
the agency anticipates raising water rates 20 percent, beginning in
two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA operates Lake Travis and the other Highland Lakes,
releasing enough water through dams to satisfy downstream needs.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, enough water flows down the Colorado River to easily
meet the demand. That would change, however, during an extended
drought. And that is when owning senior water rights would begin to
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood's 133,000 acre-feet would translate into slightly more
than 100,000 acre-feet of ``firm-yield'' water, or water that would
be available even during a repeat of the worst drought in Central
Texas history. That was during the early 1950s, when the level of
Lake Travis fell 67 feet below full. For comparison, during the
drought of 1996, Lake Travis dropped 29 feet below full.
</P>
<P>
   Even during a critical drought, Garwood would ensure enough
water to fill Town Lake 28 times and meet the household needs of
750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood rights are critical for the future of Austin as well
as southern Williamson County and northern Hays County, which will
increasingly rely on LCRA water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the LCRA has 53,000 acre-feet left to sell in the
Highland Lakes; the Garwood purchase would triple the agency's
firm-yield reserves. Austin has been seeking to buy an additional
50,000 acre-feet of firm-yield water from the LCRA, for a total of
300,000 acre-feet _ enough to last until 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great deal for the region,'' Austin City Manager
Jesus Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Austin was considering a formal protest to
the conservation commission. The city contended that selling water
to Corpus Christi would short-change Austin by 1,500 acre-feet
during a repeat of the 1950s drought.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA agreed to provide additional water if the sale to
Corpus Christi ever affects Austin's water supply, and Austin
dropped its protest _ ending the last serious threat to the Garwood
agreement. Lago Vista and Lakeway had already decided not to pursue
their protests, although they remain concerned about piping water
outside the Colorado River basin.

 &HT;    Forecast of chip sales lifts Motorola stock
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc.'s shares jumped $3.25 to $41.81
1/4 on Tuesday after executives said semiconductor sales would
rebound in 1999 and that the company would meet financial
expectations for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the company's restructuring _ including job cuts
_ was ahead of schedule. So far, the company says it has eliminated
7,800 of the 15,000 workers it plans to cut by the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, with about 10,000 employees in its Austin
semiconductor operations, is one of the area's major private sector
employers. The company is based in Schaumburg, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a morning conference call with analysts, Motorola executives
provided more details and the company's context for the
third-quarter financial results released Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   During the call, the company said it expects worldwide
semiconductor sales to grow 7 percent to 9 percent in 1999. In the
third quarter, Motorola's computer chip sales tumbled 14 percent to
$1.8 billion from $2.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company's sales and earnings have suffered, in
part, because of the worldwide weakness in semiconductor prices.
Computer chips account for about 25 percent of Motorola's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the semiconductor outlook was the key element
behind Tuesday's share price increase.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the call, Motorola officials said the company should
meet Wall Street expectations of a profit of 22 cents a share on
revenues of $7.9 billion for the current quarter. The company will,
however, take another charge against earnings as it continues
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Motorola had posted a $42 million loss on sales of
$7.2 million after taking a $117 million charge. Shares had sunk
Monday to a 52-week low of $38.56 1/4 in anticipation of the
earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   The company has blamed many of its revenue woes on pricing
pressures and sluggish sales in Asia. In implementing the
restructuring, the company saved $140 through cuts that included
layoffs and consolidation. The company said it wants to save at
least $750 million a year through its current reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   More reductions are in sight as workers have until Friday to
decide whether to accept a voluntary severance package from the
company. Job cuts are expected if not enough workers choose to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the company said 1,000 of its semiconductor workers
worldwide had accepted the terms of the severance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the third quarter, Motorola closed major sites in
California, North Carolina, Arizona and the Philippines.

 &HT;    Bush campaign launches broadside against Mauro
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush has spent most of the campaign
ignoring underdog opponent Garry Mauro, but Tuesday he dismissed
the Democratic challenger's platform as a budget-busting bucket of
promises waiting to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   The broadside against Mauro was launched for Bush by two top GOP
senators and a key Democratic House member. They said Mauro's
policies would cost the state $4 billion to $7.5 billion more than
the state will have to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which promises will Mauro break?'' asked Sen. David Sibley,
R-Waco, who is backing Bush. ``Inquiring minds want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro insisted his numbers balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do add up,'' he said. ``Their cooked numbers don't add
up. I think it is what you would expect from the three people that
issued them. They cooked the numbers to make their endorsed
candidate look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Any differences in the numbers, Mauro said, are due to varying
budget ``assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said its numbers were based on analysis by
``independent budget experts such as the Legislative Budget Board
and the comptroller's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said the Mauro plan, heavy on education, fails the simple
math test. Early projections show that state lawmakers next year
could have as much as $6.3 billion more to allocate when they write
the two-year budget.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has several big-ticket items in his platform, including:
</P>
<P>
   A $6,000 pay hike for all teachers. He says the price tag is
$3.9 billion. The Bush campaign said Legislative Budget Board
experts peg the cost at $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Hope Scholarship'' plan to pay college tuition for bright
kids. Mauro says the cost is $800 million. The Bush campaign says
the cost is $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 10,000 police officers. Mauro says that would cost
$500 million. The Bush campaign says the price tag is $731 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also is pushing two major tax changes. He wants to scrap
the sales tax on cars, vans and pickup trucks. Mauro wants to
offset part of that loss by doubling the state levy on some tobacco
and alcohol products.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't add up, Sibley said, even if lawmakers use money from
the tobacco lawsuit settlement to help pay for the Mauro plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turning point of the story of Cinderella comes when the
ugly stepsister tries to fit her very large foot into the glass
slipper,'' said Sibley. ``The political equivalent in Texas is
occurring now as Garry Mauro tries to fit $14 billion worth of
promises into $6.3 billion worth of shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant, and House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo, made the same point, if more clinically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that the publicly advocated spending proposals
of the various statewide candidates are within predicted available
revenues with the exception of the Mauro campaign proposals,''
Ratliff and Junell said in a joint statement requested by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawmakers have endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, Ratliff and Junell also rapped Mauro's plan to borrow $2
billion from the Permanent School Fund to pay for classroom
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be adamantly opposed to any invasion of this trust
fund,'' said Junell and Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Karen Hughes said Bush will be talking
about the Mauro plan in upcoming campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be pointing out that he has proposed a responsible
budget, that his proposals are within the means of the state and
that his opponent has proposed $14 billion worth of promises and
there is not $14 billion worth of money,'' said Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing Mauro running a distant second to Bush,
Hughes said the incumbent is taking the challenger seriously.
Campaign finance reports filed Monday showed that. Bush spent $10.8
million in the last three months, about three-quarters of it on TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who has had to scratch to raise money to keep his
campaign going, has not yet aired any ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's budget plan is highlighted by a $2 billion tax cut and
abolition of the sales tax on over-the-counter drugs, diapers and
some health-care products.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to send $1 billion in state money to school
districts to use as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said he is not ready to endorse Bush's property tax-cut
plan, but is convinced the governor's overall budget package
balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of a property tax reduction,'' said Sibley.
``What I'm saying is the amount is to be determined. And there are
other types of taxes we might want to reduce also.''

   WASHINGTON _ The administration on Tuesday intensified its
threat to use force against the Yugoslav military and the police,
as Washington continued diplomatic efforts to persuade President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end the crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move to maintain NATO unity behind military action,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote to the group's 15 other
members over the weekend to urge them to give NATO's commanders the
authority to use force against the Serbs in Yugoslavia. Some allies
resist that step; a vote on approving force, which was to take
place in Brussels on Wednesday, has been delayed to the end of the
week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans insist that NATO make another effort to persuade
Russia to accept the possibility of intervention in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia on Tuesday vowed to veto any attempt by the United
Nations Security Council to authorize the strikes, warning of
``serious international consequences'' if NATO used force without
such authority.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said NATO does not need explicit
authorization to use force. But some allies say the allies need an
explicit Security Council resolution. That leaves the United States
in a position of having to persuade the allies to go along even if
there is no supporting vote by the Security Council, or persuading
Russia not to veto such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the administration there is disagreement about how
best to pursue and enforce a resolution to the standoff with
Milosevic over the Serbian crackdown against the ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The rift emerged over the possible use of American ground forces
to follow up a diplomatic solution or military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen told the Senate Armed
Services Committee that he opposed placing American troops on the
ground in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, though he said
some sort of international force might be necessary to insure
stability. That puts him at odds with Albright and other members of
the administration, who have not ruled out the use of ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a ground component is required, it is my recommendation _
and I would almost say insistence _ that it be largely if not
wholly European in nature,'' Cohen said. Members of Congress worry
about another peacekeeping mission in the Balkans because American
troops now in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not seem to be near a
pullout yet.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks surprised officials within the administration
and NATO. Allied commanders have drafted a plan to send up to
26,000 troops to Kosovo to enforce a cease-fire and support relief
efforts for Albanians driven from their homes by Serbs. Serbia and
Montenegro are the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia, and Serbs
are by far the dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said no decision had been made on using
American ground forces should Milosevic halt the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The internal rift underscores the extent to which the
administration is still forging its policy toward Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to President Clinton said they still hoped to persuade
Milosevic to accept a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke,
met with Milosevic again on Tuesday in Belgrade, the capital. The
envoy pressed Milosevic and leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to
accept an interim agreement that would give Kosovo limited autonomy
but would delay a final decision on the province's status,
according to a draft of the agreement provided to The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether either side would accept the agreement,
which would provide Kosovo less autonomy than it had in 1989,
before the breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In an address on Tuesdayy to a meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, President Clinton called on Milosevic
to accept U.N. demands in a resolution passed by the Security
Council last month, including a withdrawal of Serbian police and
military units from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''

</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks appeared to be an attempt to reassure a wary
Congress that the United States is not about to embark on a
large-scale peacekeeping operation like the one in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was not partisan. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., told
Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, he
was not sure that the administration's threats of force would work
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grave concerns about our ability to manage that civil
war through military force, through military intervention,'' he
said. ``I think and fear that it might be actually
counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military commanders have completed plans for an expanding
series of missile and air strikes against targets in Kosovo and, if
needed, throughout Serbia. These would hit military and police
sites and equipment but would not seek to destroy civilian
structures like bridges or communication networks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said of Milosevic that the strikes would inflict ``enough
damage to reduce his capacity to wage war against the people he's
been killing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also drafted plans for military operations that would
stop short of actual attacks, including enforcement of a ``no
flight'' zone that would prevent the Yugoslav air force from
operating over Kosovo, a NATO official said on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon still has not disclosed the forces that the United
States is prepared to contribute to any strikes. Pentagon and NATO
officials said that if strikes are approved, the alliance can
strike within hours or days with what one senior official called
``a potent force'' of several hundred warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the allies, Albright said it was important for
NATO to take the next step and give its supreme commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, the authority to strike, a senior administration
official said. That would not mean strikes are necessarily
imminent, but it would increase pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest draft of the proposal that Holbrooke presented
to Milosevic and the Albanians, Kosovo would remain within Serbia
and have relative autonomy over internal affairs, but would be
subject to possibly debilitating vetoes by the minority Serbs in a
local parliament. Roughly 90 percent of the people of Kosovo are
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia would retain responsibility for customs, military
affairs, foreign affairs and monetary policy, while Kosovo will
govern itself domestically through legislative, executive and
judicial branches.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials said the proposal would delay a
decision on Kosovo's independence _ which the West opposes _ for
three years. But to win Milosevic's approval, allied officials
said, the draft language on sovereignty is weak.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, according to the draft, ``the two sides will
undertake a comprehensive assessment of the agreement, with the aim
of improving its implementation and considering proposals by either
side for additional steps, which will require mutual agreement for
adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``sovereignty'' is not even mentioned, and there is
thought to be little possibility that Belgrade would provide the
``mutual agreement'' required for that kind of ``additional step.''
</P>
<P>
   Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister of a group that calls itself
the Kosovo government in exile, said in an interview on Tuesday
that Washington must be careful ``not to press the victim instead
of the aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far less than the autonomy we enjoyed until 1989''
when Milosevic, then president of Serbia, changed Kosovo's status,
Bukoshi said.

 &HT;    Bengals' Mack closer to running back
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Being able to run fast is a valuable asset for a
kickoff return man, but it's just as important to know when to run
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you return kicks, you're just like a running back,'' said
Cincinnati's Tremain Mack. ``You wait for the blockers to do their
jobs, you read the holes and when the holes open, you take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack took off for a 97-yard TD in the Bengals' last game at
Baltimore and will be trying to add to his stats this Sunday when
the Bengals host Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who ranks fifth in the NFL with his 28.4-yard average,
said returning kicks doesn't involve much cerebral exercise. ``You
just catch the ball and run hard. If the hole opens up, you take
it. If it doesn't open up, you try to find another one. If that
doesn't work, you just try to get as many yards as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams captain Eric Bieniemy usually is Mack's lead
blocker. ``A good return is all about spacing and timing. The
return man has to be patient, he has to have a knack for knowing
when everything is set up and when to make his move. Tremain has
the knack.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, the Bengals' fourth-round pick in the 1997 draft, set a
school record for kickoff return yards in a season with 514 as a
redshirt junior at Miami (Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   Mack had only 13 tries in '97, but had 39.5 yards per return.
``We had a really good defense and I didn't get many chances,'' he
said. ``I didn't get my first return until the sixth game.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been on the return team the previous season, but did
nothing but block and grow increasingly more frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year, I kind of suggested at a meeting that if I
wasn't going to be the return guy, I didn't want to be on the
(return) team. The reason was that I was tired of blocking for guys
who weren't running as hard as I thought they should.''
</P>
<P>
   That memory has helped shape Mack's aggressive running style.
``I want the guys in front of me to know that I'm going to run hard
no matter how tired I am or what the circumstances are. That every
time I touch the ball, I think I'm going to score. When they know
that, they tend to block a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   No Bengal has ever led the NFL or the AFC in kickoff returns.
Willie Shelby holds the club record with a 25.4-yard average in
1976.

HURRICANE, ALOU ON MINDS OF DODGERS BRASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers president Bob Graziano and
general manager Kevin Malone were to fly to the Dominican Republic
this morning with hopes of bringing back a new manager _ Felipe
Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano and Malone are expected to spend five days in the
Dominican to speak with Alou, 63, manager of the Montreal Expos the
past seven seasons. Alou has one season remaining on his contract
for $600,000, and the Expos have offered a three-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic to move forward and I am hopeful that Felipe is
a good match for the job,'' said Malone, who was Alou's GM in
Montreal from 1994-95. ``I have spoken to him by phone and have a
very good feeling, but until I meet with him I won't know for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's wife Lucie is from Montreal and her family has told local
media outlets Alou will remain in Montreal. Despite his ties, Alou
has told members of the Expos organization the Dodgers job is too
good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano and Malone also will inspect the estimated $333,000
damage done to the club's baseball academy by Hurricane Georges.
None of the 60 players housed at the camp was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is located in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo,
which also is Alou's residence. The most serious damage to the
camp, which recently was featured in a profile of Latin American
baseball on the Fox Network, was to the roof of one of the
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano and Malone also might visit San Pedro de Macoris,
hometown of Dodgers players Raul Mondesi, Ramon Martinez and Adrian
Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, Malone plans to move Mondesi back to right field,
where he has won two Gold Gloves. Mondesi went to center field
after Gary Sheffield was acquired May 15 from Florida. But Mondesi
developed a sore lower back from the added running in center.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who played 72 games with the Dodgers last season, could
be the club's starting third baseman next season if the Dodgers are
able to move Bobby Bonilla's $11.8 million contract. That is
Malone's top priority when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hold an option on the contract for Martinez, who
will not pitch until June at the earliest after undergoing surgery
last June to repair his right rotator cuff. If the Dodgers exercise
the option, they would owe Martinez $5.6 million. They are expected
to offer the buyout of $500,000 and re-sign him at a lower figure.
It is a delicate matter, because Martinez is the leader among the
Dodgers Latin players and the club does not want to embarrass him
with too low an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we really will get into all that on this trip,''
Malone said. ``Our focus is on Felipe.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Dodgers on Tuesday claimed right-handed relief
pitcher Doug Bochtler off waivers from the Detroit Tigers. The team
designated catcher Henry Blanco for assignment to make room for the
28-year-old Bochtler, who led all Tigers relievers with a
career-high 67.1 innings pitched after compiling an 0-2 record and
a 6.15 ERA in 51 games in 1988. He also had 45 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bochtler has a career 9-16 record with six saves and a 4.45 ERA
with Detroit and San Diego in four major-league seasons.

 &HT;    Contract on line for Williams
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new deal from the Yankees for center fielder Bernie
Williams may depend on how he plays the rest of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Williams becomes a free agent after the season, and the Yankees
want him back. But right now owner George Steinbrenner and agent
Scott Boras are apart by about $3 million a season on a deal.
Williams wants $11 million a year, but Steinbrenner must find a way
to rationalize a contract that would pay him more than Sammy Sosa,
who hit 66 homers during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who won the American League batting title, hitting
.339, could get his deal with a strong finish this October. He did
not get off to a good start against Texas, going 0-for-11, and he
looked a little apprehensive going into Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the American League Championship Series. There is no time
for relaxing out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went on to add, ``I keep trying and there is a lot of
room for improvement now. It's not the first time I have been
0-for-a-series and it's not going to be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster change
</P>
<P>
   The Indians made a change on their roster, activating reliever
Chad Ogea, who replaced veteran Doug Jones. Ogea has been bothered
by injuries all season but last year won both of his starts in the
World Series against the Marlins. He will be used in long relief.
Jones has struggled all year and was beaten up in his one
divisional series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   Charisse Strawberry, the wife of hospitalized Yankees outfielder
Darryl Strawberry, threw out the first pitch Tuesday night. . . .
Said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman: ``I'm very happy for
(San Diego GM) Kevin Towers and the Padres and Jim Leyritz. I hate
to say it, but (Randy Johnson) is one of the few guys out there
that really can make you wet your pants. Right now, I'm glad that
he is not pitching against us. Obviously, it proves that one man
doesn't make the team.'' . . . Yankees manager Joe Torre's contract
extension, which is still not official, likely will bring him a
salary of $2 million in the 2000 and 2001 seasons. He is currently
making $1 million. . . . A group of five Yankees scouts has tracked
the Indians for the last 30 days and put together a huge binder of
information for Torre and his players. The information obviously
worked in the previous series against the Rangers, as scouts
noticed that Texas slugger Juan Gonzalez had walked just 46 times
during the regular season and swung at a lot of bad pitches. New
York pitchers then fed Gonzalez low off-speed pitches, and he had
just one hit in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's pitchers
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will start right-hander Charles Nagy, who was 15-10
during the regular season and was the winning pitcher in Game 3 of
the divisional series with the Red Sox, going eight innings and
allowing one run on four hits. During the regular season, Nagy was
1-0 against the Yankees with a 1.72 ERA in two starts. The Yankees
will go with right-hander David Cone, who pitched 5 2/3 shutouts
inning in Game 3 of the divisional series and was 20-7 in the
regular season, the second 20-win year of his career. He is 1-1
with a 4.05 ERA in two starts against the Indians this season.

FRENCH TESTS FIND TRACES OF NERVE GAS CHEMICALS ON IRAQI WARHEADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 15 grafs at end of story and for minor re-editing
throughout) (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE  
c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ French tests appear to have found traces of
chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, according
to several weapons experts who said this would confirm earlier
American test results.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats also charged that the French had delayed
releasing the final results because they did not want to undermine
Iraq's push at the United Nations this week to lift economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   French officials denied that they were deliberately withholding
test results, and a French diplomat said on Tuesday that the
results are expected to be ``completely consistent'' with the
earlier tests that found no traces of the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is mounting between the United Nations and Iraq, which
has refused to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and has sent
a high-level team to the United Nations to argue that Iraq has
released enough information about its weapons program to justify
lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which has denied putting VX on weapons, disputed earlier
American test results finding traces of VX on warheads and asked
for further tests, conducted in France and Switzerland over the
summer. Preliminary French and Swiss test results found no traces
of VX.
</P>
<P>
   But if final French tests do find VX components on the warheads,
Iraq's credibility and case for lifting sanctions would be further
weakened. France, which like Russia has considerable commercial
interests in Iraq, has argued that the United Nations should move
faster to ease sanctions imposed after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   To begin lifting sanctions, all Iraqi biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons, as well as certain missile systems, must be
destroyed, and inspectors must be confident Iraq could not rebuild
them.
</P>
<P>
   Several weapons experts said that during a technical meeting in
September of international weapons specialists, French technical
experts had said that four or five of the samples taken from
chemical warheads had VX components on them. But at higher-level
meetings later that month, these results were not discussed,
according to diplomats and weapons inspectors. According to several
diplomats, French Defense Ministry officials told European
officials that this was too sensitive a time to publicize results
that would be damaging to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, say that
there are no more prohibited weapons of any kind to be found and
that the Security Council has a ``legal and moral'' obligation to
lift sanctions. Inspectors reply that there are too many
outstanding questions, and missing documentation, on issues like VX
and a host of biological compounds to justify relaxing restrictions
on President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Aziz angrily lashed out at the United States and the
weapons inspection system, suggesting that he was meeting
resistance in both the secretary general's office and the Security
Council in his demands for a new look at sanctions in return for
Iraq permitting the resumption of on-site arms inspections, which
Baghdad ended on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-month report sent to the Security Council on Tuesday,
Richard Butler, the chief of the program to inspect Iraqi, said
that the Iraqis were close to meeting requirements in ballistic
missile and chemical weapons programs. But it noted that ``the
level of verification of precisely how much VX was produced by Iraq
is not satisfactory.'' The report also noted that Baghdad continues
to deny that it loaded warheads with VX, contrary to mounting
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also not submitted a second final report
on the warhead samples, according to officials of the United
Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq
and preventing it from rebuilding its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first American report, in June, that revealed the
presence of components found in decomposed VX in missile warheads
destroyed by Iraq and dug up in April by U.N. weapons inspectors.
That report led to Iraqi demands for laboratory studies outside the
United States. Tests in France and Switzerland followed in the
summer. The Swiss tests, all agree, appear to be negative, with no
traces of VX components found.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts and diplomats said on Tuesday that a technical
team assembled in New York two weeks ago by the Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, expected to be able to discuss final results from
Switzerland, the Untied States and France. The Americans and the
French did not have results ready.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding
information because its scientists did not find VX components on
its second batch of samples, so as not to cast doubt on its first
tests.
</P>
<P>
   France told the UNSCOM technical experts that it had four or
five more samples to test. On Tuesday, experts said that there is
strong evidence that those outstanding samples had revealed two
chemicals found in VX _ though not only in VX. But the Iraqis would
be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on
warheads that Iraq said contained other substances.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis used Sarin gas in the 1980s in attacks on Iran and on
their own Kurdish population. The French say that the results may
be known in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi warheads being studied were discovered at a
weapons-demolition site north of Baghdad. Commission officials
haggled with Iraqis for weeks before being allowed to take some
metal fragments from the shells out of the country in May for
testing in the United States.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-four fragments were brought to the U.S. from the
al-Hussein destruction site, a site where al-Hussein missiles were
destroyed in Iraq, and they were analyzed using two scientific
techniques,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, at a
briefing for journalists on Sept. 18. ``On about a quarter of those
44 fragments, the analysts found traces of decomposed VX.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were then tested or reviewed by a special UNSCOM
team,'' Bacon said. ``This is a team of 13 people from seven
different countries appointed by UNSCOM to review the findings of
the U.S. lab. That team included representatives from Switzerland,
from France, from Russia and from China. The 13 people on that team
unanimously concluded that the U.S. findings were valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Other warhead fragments from the same site were stored in Iraq
by the inspectors, but apparently in conditions that were less than
optimal to preserve them. There is also some question whether
Iraqis, who had access to the site, could have tampered with them.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, after experts at the American military laboratory
at Aberdeen, Md., found VX traces on the shells and the Iraqis
demanded another set of tests in Europe, the samples for the second
round were taken from the fragments stored in the Iraqi warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, metal chunks were not removed from Iraq this time.
Instead, 80 swabs were made on the surface of the metal and half
were sent to France and half to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were concerned at the time that there seem to
be no ``custodial command'' over the fragments left behind by
UNSCOM, and no knowledge of what the Iraqis might have done with
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many questions surrounded the second set of tests
even before reports began to emanate from Europe and from the Arab
press saying that the Swiss and French had found no VX.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said that whatever the results from
Europe, those findings did not contradict the American conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on that, the question became not whether Iraq had
attempted to weaponize VX but how many warheads it had weaponized
with VX,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with here is something like an
archeological site. It's a large area with thousands and thousands
of little fragments that have been collected and taken to a
warehouse. These are fragments of missiles that the Iraqis have
destroyed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's like if you were trying to analyze different types of
grass in a large field,'' Bacon said. ``You might find bluegrass in
one corner of the field and zoysia grass in another corner of the
field. Just because you find zoysia grass in the northwest corner
of the fields doesn't mean that Kentucky bluegrass or fescue wasn't
growing in the southeast corner. So that's where the situation
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva on Tuesday, a senior American arms control official
said that Iraq could reconstitute its chemical and biological
weapons programs in a short period of time, and he urged that spot
inspections be resumed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   John Holum, acting under secretary of state for arms control and
international security affairs, said that the Security Council
should not agree, as the Iraqis demand, to a timetable for lifting
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were designed to be lifted when Iraq satisfied the
international community,'' he said at a news conference.

YANKS' LOOK NEXT SEASON WILL DEPEND ON WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees could be compared to some of the greatest
teams in history if they win the World Series. But it is unlikely
the team that won 114 games in the regular season will remain
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, the team's star center fielder, will become a
free agent at season's end. Speculation is already rampant that
another team, such as the Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers or
Baltimore Orioles, will offer him well over $10 million a year, for
at least six years. The Yankees are paying him $8.25 million this
year and must decide if he is worth an eight-digit salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy we want to keep,'' said Yankees general manager
Brian Cashman before the Yankees faced the Cleveland Indians in
Game 1 of the American League Championship Series on Tuesday night
at Yankee Stadium. ``There's no question we'll be bidding for him.
We're going to go after him and make him an offer we feel
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Yankees re-sign Williams will have a major impact on
other decisions. If Williams leaves, the Yankees have to look for
another center fielder. If he stays and is paid an eight-figure
salary, the Yankees may have to cut corners elsewhere _ perhaps at
third base. Scott Brosius, who had a spectacular year offensively
and defensively and fit in very well with this team, can also
become a free agent after this season and would be likely to
command three- or four-year offers, perhaps in the range of $4
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an important cog for us this year, and our intention
is to pursue him,'' said Cashman, who broke off negotiations with
Brosius' agent late in the season. ``If we're unsuccessful in doing
that, we've got a guy behind him in the minors'' _ the young third
baseman Mike Lowell _ ``who we think is ready.'' Lowell would play
for the minimum wage next season.
</P>
<P>
   Is Brosius' fate tied to whether Williams re-signs? ``Everything
is tied together,'' Cashman said. ``The bottom line is, we have
only so much money we can play with.''
</P>
<P>
   If Williams does leave, the Yankees could bid on free agents
such as Steve Finley or Brian Jordan, or attempt to trade for a
player such as the Angels' Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other decisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ David Cone pitched more than 200 innings this season,
activating a clause in his contract that gives him the option of
accepting or rejecting a $5.5 million salary with the Yankees next
season. Coming off a 20-victory season, it would figure that Cone
would try to parlay his leverage into either a new multiyear
contract, or more money above and beyond the $5.5 million. Cone and
Cashman both say they will worry about this in the off season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Raines can become a free agent in the off season, and the
Yankees have liked his production and contribution. But Ricky Ledee
will be out of options next season and must remain on the Yankees'
roster, and the September emergence of Shane Spencer gives the
Yankees another outfield option. It would seem to be unlikely that
Raines will return.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees hold a $2.5 million option for the 1999 season on
Darryl Strawberry, the outfielder who hit 24 homers before
undergoing surgery for colon cancer. If Strawberry were a free
agent, his value would have plummeted. But the decision on whether
to keep Strawberry, it would seem, will be in the hands of George
Steinbrenner, who must decide how much he is worth to the team.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees hold a $3.4 million option for the 1999 season on
catcher Joe Girardi, but with Jorge Posada progressing into the
frontline catcher this year, the Yankees probably will not exercise
the option. But they may try to negotiate another contract with
Girardi, to keep him as a backup. Girardi said during the season
that he would like to see if he could catch full time elsewhere,
before adding that he would be very open to returning to the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, could demand a
trade after this season. But according to a member of the Yankees
organization, Knoblauch has agreed to a two-year contract extension
beyond his current deal that would pay him $9 million for the 2002
and 2003 seasons. Cashman would not comment on the possible
extension, saying, ``He's a guy we don't plan on having go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, 31, is earning about $250,000 in his first year as
general manager of the Yankees. When he took the job, he asked for
a one-year contract. ``I'll sit down at the end of the year and see
if he's interested in having me back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Might Cashman's fate depend on whether the Yankees defeat the
Indians in this series and go on to win the World Series? ``I have
no idea, to be honest with you,'' he said.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR WILLIAMS, IT COMES DOWN TO TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BBA-YANKS-INDIANS, BBA-VECSEY-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The superb swing that propelled Bernie Williams to an
American League batting title is still there, although it might be
a little tentative. The classy demeanor that has enabled Williams
to play for the attention-grabbing Yankees without distractions as
he approaches free agency is still there, although it might be
tested if his drought continues for the rest of October.
</P>
<P>
   For many Yankee fans, the lasting image of the 1997 division
series is not Paul O'Neill's scorched double off the right
center-field fence. It is of Jose Mesa's next pitch, the pitch
Williams flicked to left field for the final out of the game and
the season. There was scant time to revel in O'Neill's gutsy hit
and his tumbling slide because Williams did not deliver the tying
run against Cleveland and the stunned Yankees were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing, that last year Bernie was very disappointed
when he made the last out,'' said Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``Let's
admit it, the year before, everything Bernie made contact with was
a homer or a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre heard about Williams' funk, called him in Bayamon, Puerto
Rico, and spoke to him in the soothing, simplistic way that
explains why he is the perfect manager for this often perfect team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him he can't expect to get a hit every time up,''
said Torre. ``He had to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``Last year is last year. This is a new year.
There are two teams that are both different.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is impossible to ignore the obvious circumstances and
glaring statistics. Williams was 0 for 11 as the Yankees swept the
Rangers in the division series, even while receiving little
production from the top five hitters in their order.
</P>
<P>
   Has Williams let go of the 1997 postseason failure? A drought
that actually extends to the 1996 World Series? Since being named
the Most Valuable Player of the American League Championship Series
two years ago, when he steered the Yankees by the Orioles, Williams
has six hits in his last 52 at-bats in the postseason, with one
homer and five runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what players who want at least $11 million a year
are supposed to do, not when the national spotlight is so intense
and the stakes are so high. Williams, a switch-hitter, has
struggled to drill fastballs from the left side and is flaring or
popping up pitches that he used to hit forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was asked if there was anything he would do
differently in the opener of the ALCS Tuesday night, he had the
look of a sixth-grader who has just been told that his science
project was awful. He pondered the question for a few seconds and
then sounded like a player who is searching for something he cannot
find, something he found so simply a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know what to change,'' said Williams. ``I have the
same swing I've had all year. I know I've been through rough times
before and I've kept working hard. I know that eventually it's
going to turn around. It has in the past. It's the only thing I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Torre discussed how Williams has fizzled in the postseason
recently, he said that ``sometimes you overthink and overprepare''
and wondered if the 30-year-old was doing that. Torre hinted that
Williams might be thinking too much about the importance of the
postseason instead of treating the games like games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything other than being in a short series
and wanting to win,'' said Torre. ``It's not like during the season
when you have a couple of hitless games and you can come back
because you have 160 games left. It takes a lot to tell yourself
not to put too much emphasis on each at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees proudly and rightfully raved about a pitching staff
that limited Texas to one earned run in three games, but what about
the disappearance of the first five in the order? Chuck Knoblauch
was 1 for 11, Derek Jeter was 1 for 9, Paul O'Neill was 4 for 11,
Tino Martinez was 3 for 11 and Williams, of course, was 0 for 11.
O'Neill's homer drove in the only run from among this quintet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the next round you can expect our bats to wake
up,'' promised David Cone. ``I think you can expect Bernie and Paul
and Tino to really start swinging the bats.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yanks blazed to a league record of 114 victories,
Williams' status was hardly even an issue. That is amazing,
especially in New York. Williams and Scott Boras, his agent, told
the Yankees that they did not want to negotiate a long-term
contract once the season began so the two sides have not had formal
discussions since March.
</P>
<P>
   Williams does not want to think about it now, but there is a
possibility he could be playing his last days with the Yankees. It
is the organization the all-star center fielder has been with since
he was 17, another reason why Williams should want to make this
postseason gratifying, for himself and for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been pressing,'' said Williams, before
vanishing into the Yankee clubhouse Tuesday night. ``It's kind of
tough to answer that right now, but I don't think so.''
</P>

`MARKET DUDE': THE FACE ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being transmitted

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Market Dude, a New York Stock Exchange floor broker
whose real name is Allan Gershowitz, was on the phone and
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is either a hoax _ one of the boys set you up to call me
_ or it's real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was real. Did Market Dude _ so named by Fortune magazine this
month for the pictures of him that pop up in publications all over
the world after every market swing _ have time to answer a few
questions? Such as, who is he? Why him? Millions of people have
seen him with his hand clasped on his face in agony after some
market atrocity, but no one has ever interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, 15 minutes before Monday's closing bell,
Gershowitz (one is tempted to call him Mr. Dude) was showing his
inquisitor around his universe _ the more-or-less center of the
universe, the main trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange _
while trying to buy 100,000 shares of BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   This was further complicated by Gershowitz's fellow brokers, who
have not let up in their ribbing since Market Dude was born. One
even faked a call from the David Letterman show, requesting Market
Dude as a guest. Gershowitz believed him, hence his subsequent
suspicion toward press calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' said one broker, scurrying by. ``The Japanese
would like to know if you'd pose for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Market Dude,'' called another.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Al might be the Market Dude,'' said a third, James Mack,
pulling out a well-worn clipping of himself in a Japanese
newspaper, ``but I'm what's called the International Market Dude.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Gershowitz, 51, traces his fame to location, location, location.
His booth on the floor is right below the balcony where
photographers take pictures, most often when the market is
crashing. When Gershowitz looks at the electronic ticker tape above
his booth, he also looks straight into a phalanx of lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell with my face, most of the time, what's happening
to the market,'' he said, adding that ``if I bought something at 52
and it's trading at 51, I get a little upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershowitz is an independent floor broker _ one of roughly 500
on the exchange _ who takes orders to buy and sell stock for such
clients as money managers, institutions and banks. Although
computers now handle some 40 percent of the trading volume on the
exchange, primarily smaller orders, floor brokers handle
institutional clients and say they can get better prices because
they bargain directly on the floor with other human beings _ the
``specialists'' who buy and sell individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, just as the bell was sounding, Gershowitz's last trade
was for the purchase of BankAmerica shares from James Emrich, a
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 15 you can buy 50,000,'' Emrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy 50,000,'' Gershowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The price was 51 15/16, or 51 and 15 ``teenies'' in broker
lingo. Since the stock traded as high Monday as 54~, Gershowitz was
pleased. If he had bought the 50,000 shares at, say, 52, it would
have cost his client $2.6 million _ or $3,125 more. ``That teeny is
worth a lot of money done enough times,'' Gershowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bell, Gershowitz repaired to the exchange's Luncheon
Club, filled with mounted animal heads, to talk about how he got
into the business. Basically it all goes back to a 1966 subway
ride. Gershowitz was traveling downtown looking for a job after
graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, and
somebody on the train told him that Wall Street was the last stop
before Brooklyn. He got off, found a job as a clerk at what was
then Bache &AMP; Co., moved to another firm, then filled in for a
vacationing order clerk on the exchange floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I never left,'' he said. The reason is simple. ``I just
like the action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Gershowitz bought his own seat on the exchange for
$150,000 _ ``I borrowed from everybody I could'' _ and now has his
own firm, Allen E. Gershowitz Securities Corp. (Exchange seats sell
today for as much as $2 million.) His office is his booth on the
exchange floor. He makes his money in commissions on trades, and
won't say what that amounts to per year, but floor brokers can make
between $300,000 and $1 million annually. He will say his life has
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a good student,'' Gershowitz said. ``What I wanted to
do all the time was play basketball. And my father, who worked at
the post office, worked at night, because you made more money that
way. So maybe I didn't have the guidance I should have.''
Gershowitz paused. ``Down here, there are a lot of stories like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershowitz wears a gold Cartier watch and a big green ring on
his pinkie finger. ``Everybody thinks it's an emerald,'' he said.
``It's not. I wish it was.'' His face is tan these days _ he was
recently on a trip to Italy. He calls women ``sweetheart,'' lives
with his wife of 20 years in Woodbury on Long Island, and has no
children. He plays basketball, works out, and says he first started
noticing pictures of himself around 1996, when interest in stocks
picked up. In November 1997, Newsday ran photographs of him under
the headline ``The Face of the Market.'' Being Market Dude, he
said, hasn't caused him to mug for the cameras because he's too
busy.
</P>
<P>
   Has Hollywood called?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``But I'm waiting. I don't want a big part. I
want to be a character actor. A lot of people think I'm a character
down here.''

MICHIGAN POLLS HINT AT DEMOCRAT'S DEFEAT 
POLLS IN NEBRASKA GO AGAINST THE GRAIN  
 ARMEY'S UNCLE EXHORTS DEMOCRATS ON POLLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Few candidates have been more outrageously outspoken this year
than Geoffrey Fieger, who aspires to be Michigan's governor after
building a reputation as a lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the
advocate and practitioner of physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But while Fieger, a Democrat, has enjoyed much success in
keeping Kevorkian out of jail, he appears _ because of or despite
his noisy stumping _ to be making no progress in trying to keep
Gov. John Engler from winning a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger is losing ground and many political analysts and leading
Democrats have all but written him off and are focusing on whether
he will run so poorly that other Democrats on the ticket may
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls, one by The Detroit Free Press and the other by
The Detroit News, show Engler, a Republican, ahead by a margin of
better than 2 to 1. Perhaps worse for Fieger, the polls also show
that the governor's ``positives'' are steadily going up while
Fieger's are steadily going down, to the point that roughly three
of every five voters now view him ``unfavorably.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fieger, who has recently been the target of a major
Republican advertising campaign, proclaimed at a rally: ``We're
going to create a revolution. There's going to be a surge of people
voting Nov. 3 who aren't being counted by pollsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was getting enough help from Democrats, he
declared, ``There is no Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLLS IN NEBRASKA GO AGAINST THE GRAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey's hopes for running for president in 2000 got a
nice lift a few days ago when a poll in his home state, Nebraska,
found that three of five voters thought he should go for it. Often,
such polls find that voters want their elected officials to stay
put and govern rather than take up the chase after that most
elusive of political goals.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Virginians sent to Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
in 1992 when he began spending less and less time tending the home
fires and more and more time courting primary voters in the snowy
notches of New Hampshire. More recently, it was the message voters
sent California Gov. Pete Wilson in 1996 when he briefly made a run
for president. And it is the same message they are still sending
him, according to several 1998 polls, as he prepares to leave
office early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Nebraska poll, conducted for The Omaha
World-Herald, had added meaning for Kerrey, a Democrat, because
Nebraska happens to lie next to Iowa, home of the first
presidential caucuses. They tend to be labor-intensive affairs,
with organization and turnout crucial to success, and the new poll
indicates that Kerry, if he runs, will have little difficulty
finding scores of Nebraskans willing to cross over into Iowa to
help with the heavy political lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But will he run?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a poll that shows people approve of your
performance, and they want you to run for president, I listen to
it,'' Kerry told The World-Herald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARMEY'S UNCLE EXHORTS DEMOCRATS ON POLLS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the all-in-the-family brand of politics ...
</P>
<P>
   The other day Joe Armey, a retired broadcaster from Seattle,
sent a letter to the Democratic Party, with copies to local papers,
in which he warned that if the party did not get out the vote in
November, the Republicans would add to their majority in Congress
with the direst of results for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zealots and bigots of the right wing,'' Armey wrote,
``already hold all key offices of the Republican Party and have a
stranglehold on every branch of the federal government except the
presidency. Not voting and letting someone else make a choice for
you could prove disastrous for democracy as we know and love it. By
not voting we will allow the extremists of the far-right Christian
movement of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jesse Helms, Dick Armey
and Newt Gingrich to control the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey? As in Dick Armey, House majority leader from Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Correct.
</P>
<P>
   He's Joe Armey's nephew. Not only that, as Uncle Joe sees it,
Dick Armey is the political heretic in a family of hard-core
Franklin Delano Roosevelt-style Democrats, among them the
grain-farming Armeys of Cando, N.D., hometown of Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The farm-support programs Democrats pushed through Congress back
in the Roosevelt era kept Dick Armey and the rest of the North
Dakota Armeys from being economically blown away a generation back,
Joe Armey says. But today, he laments, Dick Armey is one of the
most vocal opponents of farm subsidies on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Uncle Joe has publicly taken on his
nephew. Over the years, he has periodically zinged him in letters
to editors and articles for Op-Ed pages. And a couple of years ago
he even wrote a book, ``Harvest of Contempt,'' in which he
lambasted the new Republican majority in Congress and contended
that his nephew never breathed a conservative breath until he moved
to Texas to teach economics, whereupon, Uncle Joe says, he became a
born-again Christian, a hard-right Republican and an ungrateful
opponent of farm aid.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey's response to all this, through an aide, was this:
``Everybody has a right to express their opinion.''

COMMENTARY: FANS CHEER FOR RECOVERY, A DAY AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You Gotta Believe'' is emblazoned next to a picture
of Darryl Strawberry on the front page of a tabloid that someone
has tossed onto a table in a conference room. Since the Yankee left
fielder successfully underwent surgery Saturday to remove a tumor
from his colon, that phrase has meaning beyond mere games for
several baseball fans sitting around the table.
</P>
<P>
   Like Strawberry, they are recovering drug addicts. Once princes
in their own chemical Camelots of hazy highs and brutal lows, they
now live at Samaritan Village's Van Wyck treatment center in
Jamaica, Queens. Inside a squat brick building alongside the
expressway, they have come to learn that sobriety doesn't guarantee
a life without problems. It does give them the tools to live life
on its own terms, even when the terms are grim.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the grace and humility with which Strawberry has
confronted his health problems has renewed their belief in the
strength of sobriety. In whispered conversations in their rooms or
while sharing at house meetings each morning, they get support from
a man who is very much present among them even as he rests in a
hospital miles away.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Ernest M. never met Darryl S., he can identify more
than he ever imagined. Two weeks ago, Ernest learned he was HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was why not get high,'' said Ernest, who,
like others at the center, spoke on the condition that his full
name not be used. ``That wouldn't have changed anything. I've been
here five months. I came to believe and realize it's all up to the
individual how you deal with something. Just because you're in
recovery doesn't mean everything is perfect. But you deal with
things as an adult. That's what Darryl's doing. He's not running
away. He's not stirring the pity pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief was the first reaction for many of the men and women
who see themselves as a family at the treatment center. Strawberry
is a survivor, and he has dominated their thoughts since they
learned about his tumor. Recovering addicts say you don't get this
far to be let down, but it was hard for them to uncover the meaning
behind Strawberry's latest trials as they gathered for their house
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just hear the sighs and oohs and ahhs from our
family when it was brought up,'' said Pete P. ``I've followed his
ups and downs through the years. Marital problems. Treatment. Being
traded to different teams. Falling down, then doing everything he
had to do to build his life back up. He had it all. Then boom. How
could this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Because it does. The question for many of them was how to handle
it. Strawberry has fame and wealth, which bring with them an
outpouring of public support as well as the ability to afford the
best medical care. But for recovering addicts of any social class,
all riches flow from sobriety. In various ways, that lesson is
hammered home in therapeutic communities where men like Ernest and
Pete learn to put some gratitude into their daily attitude.
</P>
<P>
   They value the fact that for a lot of them, the only thing they
have is the fact they are sober,'' said John Tavolacci, the
center's director. ``When something happens in their lives, when
they're really using what they've learned, why would they throw
away something they really value?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the little things Pete and his friends value is the chance
to watch the Yankees in their series against Cleveland. They're
psyched, but they wonder how Strawberry must feel being sidelined
while the Yanks are in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sitting out the most important games of the year,'' Pete
said. ``The feelings going through his mind must be something, on
top of his surgery. To go through so much. If he doesn't get high
through this time, he's not going to get high.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Ernest decided to face his own illness. He figures he
has a better chance of staying well as long as he takes his
medication and keeps on top of whatever else pops up in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be like Darryl, with the best doctors,'' he said.
``But I can stay sober. That, I know I can do. Like Darryl knows he
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest wants to really live before he dies. It means getting
past the stigma that some put on HIV. Or cancer. Or addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they say about an untreated addiction,'' Ernest
said. ``It leads to death, jail or institutions. So far, I've been
through two of those. I don't want to see the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. Not today. Not when you believe.

HOFFA SAYS HE WON'T DEBATE CANDIDATES IN TEAMSTERS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, widely considered the front-runner in the race
for the Teamsters presidency, does not intend to participate in the
Oct. 19 candidates' debate scheduled by the court-appointed officer
overseeing the election, the Hoffa campaign announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's campaign manager, Tom Pazzi, said in a statement that
the election officer ``is seeking to cooperate with corporate media
giants to catapult Hoffa's opponents into a name recognition and
stature which they, unlike Hoffa, haven't earned.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other candidates, Thomas Leedham, head of the Teamsters'
warehouse division, and John Metz, head of the public employees'
division, have told election monitor Michael Cherkasky that they
plan to participate in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff O'Mara, a spokesman for Cherkasky, said the debate, to be
held at American University in Washington, would proceed without
Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's refusal to debate represents a reversal from his
position in the 1996 race for the presidency of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, when he repeatedly demanded a debate and
often ridiculed the incumbent, Ron Carey, for refusing to face him.
</P>
<P>
   Carey narrowly defeated Hoffa, son of the famous Teamsters
leader Jimmy Hoffa, but Cherkasky's predecessor as election monitor
invalidated Carey's victory, finding that he had improperly
siphoned more than $700,000 in union money to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Leedham attacked his opponent's
refusal to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior is afraid to debate, and if he's afraid to take me on
in a debate, I wonder where he's going to find the guts to take on
the United Parcel Service or the freight companies,'' Leedham said.
``He's in a position where he's afraid to have to defend his shady
past and his past connections. He's afraid that the people will see
he has no record and very little knowledge about the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz did not reply to a message left on the answering machine at
his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa campaign officials said the current situation was
different from 1996. Hoffa's demand for a debate then, they said,
was warranted because Hoffa and Carey had nearly equal support and
name recognition.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: DAN REEVES RETURNS WITH RESURGENT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here he comes. Here comes Dan Reeves, the former New York Giants
head coach, back into Giants Stadium as the Atlanta Falcons head
coach. The guy one of his former Giants players (Mike Sherrard)
said ran a Big Ten offense. The guy one of his former Giants
quarterbacks (Dave Brown) said offered an offense that was too
cumbersome and too archaic to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who left the Giants after the 1996 season in a huff, who
asked the Giants to change their ways, to be more aggressive in
free agency and work more with him in building through the draft.
The man who during four years as coach wanted more of an imprint
but was rebuffed. The Giants brass said, we pick 'em, you coach
'em. Reeves said thanks, but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   So, he took his style, his philosophies and his convictions and
traveled to Atlanta, where he became general manager and head
coach. Where he could pick 'em and coach 'em. He took his Big Ten
offense where it would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   And, excuse the rub, but the Falcons arrive to face the Giants
on Sunday night having just hung 51 points on the Carolina Panthers
last Sunday; most of those points were scored by the Falcons
offense, and that is the most points scored by a team this season.
Meanwhile, the Giants offense is crumbling, having scored only 3
points last Sunday in their loss at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta owns a 3-1 record. The Giants are 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons offense ranks 16th in the 30-team National Football
League. The Giants rank 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rank No. 2 in third-down efficiency (46.6 percent).
The Giants rank 30th (20.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rank No. 2 in possession time (32 minutes 57
seconds). The Giants rank 25th (27:40).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Giants ought to embrace that Big Ten offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people said that about my offense, then I'm OK with it
because the Big Ten won the national championship last year and
that's not bad,'' Reeves said, scoffing, but obviously perturbed.
Who wouldn't be?
</P>
<P>
   Here is the coach who has won more games (151) than any other
current NFL coach. His team was 11-5 in 1993, his first Giants
season, and he was coach of the year, and everything seemed so
lovely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that first year, we didn't have to make a lot of personnel
decisions,'' Reeves said. ``It was a noncap year. The salary cap
came, and all of a sudden a bunch of players were being let go. I
understood some of the decisions being made involving money. But I
wanted some things to change and they were not going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have differences like that, it's never any one
person's fault. I take some blame. I could have always just gotten
by, but that is not a situation I ever want to be in. I do not
dwell on it. There were some good times there, too, and I remember
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves went home. To the Georgia, to Atlanta, 140 miles north of
his hometown, Americus.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, coming off a 3-13 season, were so taxed and tangled
that they opened the doors wide open for Reeves for the 1997 season
and said, please, fix this mess. Reeves rolled up his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   He instilled discipline. Worked toward unselfishness. Started
changing attitudes. Built a team on the running game and on
defense. And then reminded everyone in his camp that whatever it
takes to win is what will be employed, that the structure may
endure but it can be altered on a per-game, per-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons initially struggled. They were 1-7. But since then
they are 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Reeves in his first 20 games is even at 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Giants would be a start for Reeves getting over the
hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a long, long, long way from where we want to be,''
Reeves said. ``But the attitude is being developed where we now
expect to win instead of expecting to lose. That is a big change.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, quarterback Chris Chandler is 10-4 in games he has
finished; when healthy, he produces. Chandler has thrown a
touchdown pass in a club-record 16 consecutive games. Jamal
Anderson gives the Falcons' running game bite: in his last two
games, he rushed for 123 yards against San Francisco and for 117
against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Falcons feature linebacker Jessie Tuggle, tackle
Travis Hall and cornerback Ray Buchanan among their leaders. This
defense has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 12 consecutive games.
(Only Jacksonville has a longer streak, at 16.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the Falcons players stroll into Giants Stadium knowing
what this game means to Dan Reeves. Of course he wants to dust the
Giants. He wants to show them that they made a mistake by not
insuring that he remain. He wants to remind them that there are
reasons he has the most victories among current NFL coaches. He
wants to keep building in Atlanta and heap more misery on the now
struggling Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said: ``Anybody wants this in their situation. If you do
not succeed, it is nice to know that it is nobody's fault but your
own.''

NYC BRACES FOR SHIFT TO MANDATORY MANAGED CARE FOR MEDICAID
PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of policy debates, hand-wringing and
foiled attempts, the managed care revolution is finally coming to
the city's 1.2 million Medicaid recipients. And the details
indicate just how hard the transition will be.
</P>
<P>
   Information brochures featuring a woman with her child and dog
will be remade for Muslim residents of Brooklyn _ without the dog
and with more modest dress. Doctors fluent in Tagalog will have to
be found. People with no telephones will have to be tracked down
with a detective's diligence and be made to understand that,
perhaps for the first time in their lives, they need to choose a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every state in the union has required at least some of
its Medicaid recipients to enroll in managed care plans; in several
counties in upstate New York, mandatory managed care has already
begun. But New York City's plan _ whose first phase is expected to
be up and running by the end of the year, pending federal approval
_ is not just the nation's largest. It is also likely to be the
toughest to put into effect because of the city's vastly
multilingual population, the depth of its social problems and
relative inexperience with managed care among even its most
affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous _ 19 percent of New York City's
nonelderly population is on Medicaid. Both the city and the state,
which each pick up a quarter of the cost of Medicaid, have made
their move into managed care a crucial goal, asserting that it will
ease the historically huge fiscal burden while providing better
care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a public health perspective, we're very hopeful that
managed care will create an opportunity to provide more
preventative health to correct the fragmented fee-for-service
programs for the poor,'' said city Health Commissioner Neil Cohen.
``We think there are many gains.''
</P>
<P>
   But many health care policy experts, some government officials
and advocates for the poor seriously doubt New York's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are not there yet,'' said Susan Dooha, a policy
analyst at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the AIDS service
organization. ``The moving trucks are outside the house, and the
people are painting the walls, but I am not confident that the
medical home is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The components of the rollout range from the mundane to the
profound, and each has provoked concern. Most advocates for the
poor say, based on the experiences of the 365,000 residents who
have voluntarily enrolled in limited areas of the city, that there
has been far too little thought put into how beneficiaries, many of
them illiterate, non-English speaking, transient or without phones,
will be informed of this sea change.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, recent surveys have found that many doctors'
offices and health maintenance organizations, which have grown by
leaps and bounds in recent years, lack the proper technical systems
to monitor care.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an important economic concern: whether New York
state will be able to save money and still entice the commercial
HMOs, which have been dropping out of Medicaid across the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only five of the participating HMOs in the city's
mandatory program are commercial companies _ Oxford, HIP, Empire,
Wellcare and United Health Care. The rest are what are called
provider-sponsored health plans, run by the hospitals, clinics and
the like that have traditionally served the poor or HMOs that were
set up for low-income patients exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeing of commercial HMOs raises two larger problems: While
there appear to be enough doctors to handle the first stage of the
rollout, many people fear that further on there will be too few
primary care physicians and specialists to give high-quality care.
This is especially worrisome, they say, in poor neighborhoods,
which have traditionally been underserved by doctors and where
patients tend to be far sicker than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Further, if most of the Medicaid HMOs are run by the same
hospitals and clinics that have been serving Medicaid recipients
for years, will mandatory managed care be able to fulfill its
promise of better care, with a wider universe of choices, at lower
cost? Put another way, will the city essentially end up with
separate but unequal managed care systems, one for the poor and one
for the middle class?
</P>
<P>
   The most vexing problem is also the hardest to quantify. People
on Medicaid, who have long sought out health care only after they
get sick, at low-income clinics and hospital emergency rooms, will
now have to wrap their minds around a totally different system of
care. And dealing with a referral system that has often confused
and frustrated a relatively stable and well-educated middle class
will be at least as tough for those on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're ready,'' said Michael Sparer, an
assistant professor at the Columbia University School of Public
Health, who has done several studies of Medicaid managed care
around the country. What he found is that states that gave the
least thought to the enrollment process fared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   While no state is quite comparable to New York in size, they
have lessons to offer. Tennessee, for example, did not give proper
forethought to its enrollment process and was totally unprepared to
see enrollment grow from 35,000 people to 275,000 literally
overnight. Minnesota prohibits direct marketing by health care
plans but had an extensive outreach and education component to its
program, which helped beneficiaries understand what they were
getting into.
</P>
<P>
   California had a large immigrant population, like New York, and
failed to staff its program sufficiently in the beginning, which
caused problems. The state used enrollment by mail with limited
outreach and education, which resulted in confusion. The program
also suffered from a lack of commercial HMO participation.
</P>
<P>
   California is still ironing out its kinks but has one advantage
over New York: its long history with managed care.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and state officials acknowledge these concerns and
insist that they have learned from their botched attempt to move
Medicaid recipients voluntarily into managed care earlier in the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exercised a great deal of caution and diligence,''
said Robert Hinkley, a spokesman for the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the city will move slowly, starting with lower
Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, and will branch out
in stages around the five boroughs. Each phase will take 13 months,
with starting dates staggered at five-month intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Few people say that the old system _ traditional fee-for-service
medicine _ was ideal. Many doctors would not see Medicaid patients
because they found payments too low, and so most Medicaid patients
sought care in grim clinics or emergency rooms. Last year, New York
City spent $2.8 billion on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under managed care, Medicaid patients will go to the doctors in
their plan, rather than seeking out any doctor who accepts
Medicaid. Instead of being reimbursed per visit, providers will get
monthly rates, known as capitation, for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the cost savings to the state, managed care, in
theory, will benefit everyone. Emergency rooms would no longer be
overburdened with nonurgent visits. Patients with chronic
conditions like asthma would be seen regularly, cutting down on
their acute care and decreasing hospital stays. And Medicaid
patients would sit side by side with lawyers and professors,
getting care from the same providers serving large HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But can New York pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Finance Administration, the federal agency that
granted the state the right to switch to mandatory Medicaid managed
care, will ultimately have the final vote on the city's readiness,
when it studies and reports on it this month.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's approval of the move to mandatory
managed care did not come easily. Earlier in the decade, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani began to push for Medicaid recipients to move
voluntarily into managed care programs. The effort was quickly
stymied by fraudulent practices by managed care companies that
caused the city to nearly shut down its effort to market their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the environment for managed care has altered
greatly. At that time, managed care companies were fighting one
another for Medicaid business. But New York ended up being far less
generous than they had anticipated, and the potential for profit
was cut even more when the state introduced a competitive bidding
process that resulted in rate cuts of 10 to 30 percent, depending
on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of clamoring among HMO companies, there have since
been slight rate increases, but rates are still far below what most
plans are looking for. ``We strongly believe the success of any
Medicaid managed care program relies on a rate structure that
supports the services,'' said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the
HMO Trade Conference in Albany. Ms. Moran said capitation averaged
$102 a person, compared with the average of $142 a person in fees
for service, causing many health maintenance organizations upstate
to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a doctor already serving 1,200 patients, how many
more can you sign up?'' said Ms. Dooha of Gay Men's Health Crisis.
``Also, you're talking about a very sick population, so do we have
a sufficient distribution and array of specialists? And who will
suffer? Will people be getting a five-minute physical? Or will the
uninsured no longer get attention? What falls out is of concern to
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems now that for the earliest stages, the supply of primary
care doctors will not be a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that capacity is not as bad as we expected
going into it,'' said John Billings, director of the Health
Research Program at the Robert F. Wagner School for Public Service
at New York University, whose capacity study is considered the gold
standard in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But while the state defines sufficient capacity as one doctor to
1,500 patients, many advocates for the poor and health care experts
feel that is too low. Capacity is also defined by how available
doctors are, another problem cited by experts. There is also a fear
among most health care experts that once the plan starts moving
into areas like the South Bronx and remote parts of Queens, there
will be fewer doctors and clinics that serve Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 study of New York City's health care centers for the
poor, the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research organization,
found that only half of those surveyed had doctors available after
hours and on weekends. This is important because discouraging
Medicaid recipients from using emergency rooms for ordinary care is
one of the program's main goals.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, only about half regularly called patients who
missed appointments, or reminded them to show up. These numbers
improved only slightly in a follow-up study in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most daunting is the enrollment process itself.
Medicaid recipients will soon be sent packages informing them that
they need to pick a plan, and detailing how to apply for an
exemption. People with HIV and severe mental illness need not join
managed care programs if they do not wish to do so. Maximus Inc., a
broker hired by the state to take over the enrollment process, has
not yet made these packages public.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential problems are clear enough. Will recipients
open a package that comes in the mail, especially if they cannot
read it? What if they change apartments frequently, which is
common, and never get the package?
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include the fact that the original letters to
recipients do not clearly state who is exempt, and there is concern
about whether people will get sufficient guidance through the
enrollment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city and state have done no outreach,'' said Christine
Molnar, director of the Medicaid managed care education project for
the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group that
is working with beneficiaries in Brooklyn to help the enrollment
process. ``There is no basic education on managed care, how it
works, what is mandatory, what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common thing we hear is that someone goes to the
clinic and presents their card and learns they can't go,'' Ms.
Molnar said. ``We hear a lot of people who can't get a referral or
go to a specialist they traditionally went to and get stuck with a
bill or get rejected or get referred to someone out of network.''

MVP IS FOR PLAYER, NOT TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long and short of it:
</P>
<P>
   __ The scariest symptom of the national home runs delirium is
the baseball columnists' consensus that Sammy Sosa and not Mark
McGwire is the National League's Most Valuable Player. What's that,
the consolation prize?
</P>
<P>
   In baseball tradition, if the individual stats are close, the
MVP is the guy who helped his team to the playoffs, so Sosa of the
wild-card Cubs is getting the nod over McGwire of the third-place
Cardinals. But the stats AREN'T close.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the home runs. McGwire beat Sosa in slugging percentage
by 104 points; that's the difference between Ken Griffey Jr. and
Travis Fryman. McGwire beat Sosa in on-base percentage by 93
points; that's the difference between Bernie Williams and Craig
Grebeck.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's edges, slight ones, are in runs scored and batted in. If
he's the MVP because of that and because the Cubs made the
playoffs, he's being rewarded over McGwire for having better
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not that it matters to the owners, but it's better for NBA
fans if the ``Larry Bird exception'' is kept, allowing teams to
bend the salary cap in order to re-sign their own free agents. And
this time, somebody tell the Clippers about it.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the NBA's appeal is the fact its biggest stars have
tended to stay with one team. Keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   __ What's the bigger surprise, that Green Bay gave up 100-plus
yards to Minnesota receivers Randy Moss !ital!and!off! Cris Carter,
or that until Monday night the Vikings hadn't had a 100-yard
receiver this season?
</P>
<P>
   Moss looks like he should get 190 every game.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Broncos after five weeks last season: 5-0, league leaders
in points, outscoring opponents by 16.8 a game, on their way to the
Super Bowl. The Broncos after five weeks this season: 5-0, league
leaders in points, outscoring opponents by 17.8 a game, on their
way to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sat in one of the new Rose Bowl seats for the first time at a
Galaxy playoff game last week. Actually, ``wedged myself into'' was
more like it, and I'm an average-size person. Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   I know people who wouldn't go to the Rose Bowl because of the
discomfort, and this is no improvement.
</P>
<P>
   __ Felipe Alou and Walter Alston share a page in my copy of
``The Baseball Encyclopedia.'' Easy, then, to note that Alou will
be 64 next season, and that when Alston was 64, he was in his 23rd
and final year as Dodgers manager.
</P>
<P>
   __ One more Angels tank job like this and Terry Collins, a good
guy, will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't supposed to be here'' ought to be a way of saying
the pressure's off, not an exit line. After that first loss to
Texas in the pivotal series, the Angels players sounded beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Even the manager was saying the wrong things, talking about his
insomnia and how ``we'll be disappointed'' without adding ``if we
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   __ When Gene Mauch muses that his biggest disappointment was
failing to win a World Series for Gene Autry, that's saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the list of matters about which I'd rather not be given
the details, Mike Tyson's psychological records rate a close
second.
</P>
<P>
   __ Note to Cal State Northridge fans: When the PA announcer
says, ``That's another Matador ...,'' you're supposed to chime in,
``... First down!''
</P>
<P>
   __ When will baseball employ the broadcast technology that
causes hockey pucks to glow and yellow ``first down'' lines to
appear on football fields? How about a vertical line marking the
outer edge of the strike zone?
</P>
<P>
   It would hover one foot outside the plate.
</P>
<P>
   __ To everyone who thought the media were rude to mention the
steroids speculation, never borne out by urine tests, in coverage
of Florence Griffith Joyner's death: How would you know the charges
were never proven if the media hadn't TOLD you the charges were
never proven?
</P>
<P>
   __ Not that it matters to the Fox people who will choose the
Dodgers' future spring-training home, but I'll bet that if you
walked down the street wearing a Giants cap, you'd take more heat
in Vero Beach, Fla., than in any other city. Including Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Good move by the NHL, experimenting with two referees this
season. One to see Geoff Courtnall plowing into Jamie Storr, one to
see Sean O'Donnell beating up Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   With two refs in that playoff game against St. Louis, maybe the
Kings wouldn't have blown a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   __ The $5 million purchase of top 2-year-old Worldly Manner by
an anonymous buyer could be horse racing's best publicity hook in
years. Here's the plan: The owner wears a wrestling mask to his
races. The jockey wears a Riddler's costume. The horse's number is
always ``X.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that $5 million price too high or too low? Yes. We'll know
which after the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   __ Naturally, a group of Raiders fans thought the recent
memorial for Jim Murray, at which Al Davis spoke, was the
appropriate site for a banner-waving demonstration in favor of the
team's return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Given the overanalysis that TV sports fans are subjected to,
an exchange like this, overheard at the Murray memorial at Dodger
Stadium, comes as no surprise. A woman said: ``Vin Scully is soooo
eloquent!'' A man replied: ``Well, he's used to speaking here.''

EDITORIAL: BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has little time to
savor his apparent first-round re-election victory Sunday. He must
take rapid and unpopular steps to save the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians voted for Cardoso because they trusted his economic
management more than that of his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva. da Silva, who leads the Workers Party, campaigned for a more
closed economy. His prescriptions struck many Brazilians as
well-meaning but unrealistic. But Cardoso avoided a runoff by the
smallest of margins, and his allies failed to win in many important
states. The new Congress, which will take office in February, is
likely to be less cooperative than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has made great economic strides under policies initiated
by Cardoso, first as finance minister and then as president.
Inflation, a perennial problem, has fallen from 3,000 percent a
year to around zero. As the economy has grown, many Brazilians have
prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that success came from a policy of tying the Brazilian
currency, the real, to the dollar, and allowing it to fall about 7
percent a year. Unfortunately, it appears that the depreciation
rate was not enough to keep up with economic realities. Brazil has
been running a large trade deficit as well as a big budget deficit.
Now, with markets fearful, its debts have become crucial. More than
$300 million a day is draining out of the country despite interest
rates of 40 percent, which have stopped economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso and the Congress must take fiscal discipline seriously.
In May the Congress rejected his social security and civil service
reforms. Then he abandoned restraints during his election campaign,
and spending soared. Now Congress must simplify taxes and improve
income tax collection rates _ especially crucial because these
taxes will come from the better-off in a country with one of the
world's most unequal income distributions.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil must also control spending, especially on pensions for
the bloated public sector. Putting Brazil's finances in order will
be painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming
up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves. But
it must be contingent on Brazil's own reforms. It is unlikely,
however, that the international community can find enough money to
support the overvalued real forever. The real will probably
eventually have to be devalued, but it is understandable that
Brazilians, who remember hyperinflation, fear an immediate and
perhaps uncontrolled devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The perception now is that Latin America could go the way of
Asia if Brazil sinks, and such perceptions can create their own
problems. There are good reasons for the world to help Brazil, but
Brazil must also deal with its own problems.

D'AMATO BACKS AN ACID RAIN BILL, AND SCHUMER SEES OPPORTUNISM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to seize an issue from his Democratic
opponent's quiver, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato testified at a Senate
hearing Tuesday in support of legislation intended to reduce acid
rain, which he called ``airborne terrorism'' that is defoliating
New York's forests and destroying its lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Without the legislation he is sponsoring, ``we could never, ever
protect those lakes,'' D'Amato told the Senate clean air
subcommittee. ``If we were to shut down every motor vehicle in New
York, close all of our factories, we would still have the same
degradation of our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But two hours later, D'Amato's Democratic challenger, Rep.
Charles Schumer, held a news conference near the Capitol to accuse
D'Amato of trying to whitewash nearly 18 years of
anti-environmental votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a leopard is trying to change his spots,'' Schumer
said. ``Al D'Amato's environmental record is one of the worst in
the nation. New York's families can't trust Al D'Amato to protect
the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling events spotlighted the importance of the environment
to both men's political calculations in what is shaping up to be
perhaps the tightest Senate race in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, a Republican whose record is considered spotty by
many environmental groups, the issue provides a way of distancing
himself from conservative Republicans and softening his image among
moderate New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Schumer, who has received consistently high ratings from
environmental groups, the issue provides a way of showing a clear
difference between him and D'Amato, a three-term incumbent whom
Schumer has sought to portray as a right-wing extremist.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's bill would require industries to reduce the emission
of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which are typically released
by coal-burning plants in the Midwest and drift on the prevailing
winds to the Northeast, where they turn to acid rain and snow.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and some environmental groups scoffed at the timing of
the senator's testimony in support of the legislation, contending
that D'Amato's allies in the Senate Republican majority had
scheduled the hearing to provide D'Amato an election-season
platform. The Senate is scheduled to go into recess on Friday and
D'Amato's bill has no chance of passing before then, and thus no
chance to be approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's hearing is a total farce designed to give Al D'Amato a
little election-year cover,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmental advocates _ as well as aides to Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who endorsed Schumer last Saturday
_ came to D'Amato's defense Tuesday, saying that D'Amato has been
pushing his bill for more than a year and had nothing to do with
scheduling the hearing in the heat of the election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Moynihan, said that it was
Moynihan, co-sponsor of the bill, who requested the hearing last
month and that it was delayed until now to allow for the release of
a major acid rain study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened to see a partisan spin to it,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   Several environmental groups that support the bill also praised
D'Amato's work on the issue, saying that they wanted a hearing
before the recess to give them a jump on passing the legislation
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue whose time has come,'' said Timothy Burke,
executive director of the Adirondack Council. ``It's not about
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmental groups used Tuesday's events to attack
D'Amato. The Sierra Club, which has been running an independent
campaign against the senator this year, delivered black balloons
emblazoned ``D'Amato's hot air'' to D'Amato's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of election-year environmentalism,''
said Kathryn Hohmann, the club's director of environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters also issued score cards
showing that D'Amato's lifetime environmental voting record, as
judged by the group, was 32 out of 100, while Schumer's was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that D'Amato ranked consistently lower than
other Republicans from the Northeast, with his scores even hitting
zero twice, in 1994 and 1996. Schumer routinely scored higher than
Democrats from the region.

NO DINING CAR  
 A RETIREMENT (SORT OF) 
NO DIVA AIRS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY JAMES BARRON with ALEX KUCZYNSKI and G.S. BOURDAIN 
   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was enough to make the briefcase-and-tote-bag crowd stop and
stare. There in Grand Central Terminal was a line of people in
evening clothes lined up for dinner. There was John F. Kennedy Jr.
And U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. And actor Stanley Tucci (now
platinum blond). And an enterprising panhandler working the line
for change.
</P>
<P>
   The diners were celebrating the newly restored station and the
Municipal Art Society. They sat in the polished Vanderbilt Hall,
which has more echo capacity than a Titanic-size bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Brooke Astor _ who, one might note, is older than Grand
Central itself _ stepped up to the microphone, the dinnertime din
barely subsided.
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Florio and Steve Florio, the embattled brothers of
Conde Nast, smilingly delivered a speech about the society _ the
evening's sponsor _ the diners paused only a second before diving
back into their squash soup and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But when Caroline Kennedy went to the podium, the diners set
down their silverware and became quiet. She talked about her
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who crusaded to save Grand
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dinner ended and a dance floor opened. And the crowd
was joined by several drag queens _ one in a sequined thong and not
much else _ who had paid $150 ($200 at the door) to dance without
dining (or straining to hear the speeches).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A RETIREMENT, SORT OF &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An off-camera change: He was a deputy mayor under John Lindsay
in the 1960s and 1970s. Then he became a cable television
executive, eventually overseeing Time Warner's cable operations in
New York City. In 1992 he started New York 1 News, the all-news
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Time Warner announced that Richard R. Aurelio, 70, was
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the word retirement,'' he said. ``I'm not
retiring from life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had some projects in mind but would not elaborate,
saying only, ``I'm not going to certainly plant roses or go down to
Florida, you know.'' Steve Paulus was named general manager of New
York 1, where he has been a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO DIVA AIRS &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some people stay modest despite years in the spotlight. Soprano
Camilla Williams, who in 1946 became the first black singer to be
put under contract by the New York City Opera, did not play the
diva last week at a New York Philharmonic luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams, 72, came from her home in Indiana to celebrate
the release of a 12-compact-disk album of the complete symphonies
of Mahler broadcast by the orchestra between 1948 and 1982. She was
the soloist in Symphony No. 8 (1950), under Leopold Stokowski.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams _ who co-starred on the first complete recording
of Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess'' (1951) _ spoke with pride about
her career at City Opera and at Indiana University in Bloomington,
where she was the first black voice teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pity we're still small in number,'' she said. But she did
not dwell on herself, instead speaking proudly about one of her
Indiana students, Janet Williams _ no relation _ and her opera and
concert appearances throughout the country.

LOPEZ GAINS IN HIS BID FOR TITLE BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Main Events, the promoter for Jose Luis Lopez, has got an
injunction to keep the World Boxing Association from sanctioning
the bout between Andrei Pestriaev and Greg Page in Paris this
Saturday as a welterweight championship match.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge Amos Sanders ruled Tuesday that
the WBA must conduct a purse bid Oct. 14 for a bout between
Pestriaev, its No. 1 contender, against Lopez, the No. 2 contender.
Sanders' ruling forbids the WBA from sanctioning any title bout
between Pestriaev and a contender ranked lower than No. 2. Page is
the WBA's No. 3-ranked contender.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also threw a curve at Showtime, which will broadcast
the Pestriaev-Page bout. Jay Larkin, senior vice president of
sports and event programming, said the ruling didn't affect the
scheduled broadcast of the bout, the length of which has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   The WBA welterweight title has been in limbo since Ike Quartey
was stripped of the title in August for not fighting Pestriaev.
Quartey said he was sick and could not defend against Pestriaev in
a timely fashion. Quartey will fight Oscar De La Hoya for the World
Boxing Council welterweight title Nov. 21 in Las Vegas. Quartey is
still considered one of the world's best welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is also considered one of the toughest opponents in the
welterweight division. De La Hoya named Lopez as the welterweight
contender he would least like to face. Lopez knocked down Quartey
twice last year during a bout, which ended in a draw. Since signing
with Main Events three months ago, Lopez has been maneuvered into a
top-ranked position for another world title bout.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti Cancels Rematch
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti has pulled out of a rematch against Ivan Robinson
on the undercard of the Roy Jones-Otis Grant card Nov. 14. Gatti
lost a tough decision to Robinson on Aug. 22, and Pat Lynch,
Gatti's manager, said he did not believe that Gatti was ready to
fight again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a must-win fight for Arturo, because he has lost
two fights in a row,'' Lynch said. ``Physically and mentally he's
just not 100 percent right now. He wanted to fight Ivan in a
rematch right away, because he didn't think that he lost that last
fight. But it's just too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which will broadcast the Jones-Grant bout, has not decided
what it will do to fill the void on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Miscellany
</P>
<P>
   _ A light heavyweight bout between Frank Tate, the World Boxing
Organization champion, and David Telasco will headline the second
installment of ESPN2's revamped boxing show this Friday night from
the Capital Theater in Port Chester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   _ Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who took a big step up and defeated
Genaro Hernandez last Saturday night for the World Boxing Council
superfeatherweight championship, is close to signing a deal to
fight Angel Manfredy on Dec. 19. Manfredy, a tough body puncher who
took Gatti apart last year, will be a lot tougher for Mayweather to
subdue than Hernandez was.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Thomas, the lawyer for Evander Holyfield, said he would
like to get Henry Akinwande, the World Boxing Association No. 1
heavyweight title contender, to step aside from a mandatory bout so
that Holyfield can meet WBC champ Lennox Lewis in his next bout.
But Thomas isn't sure whether Holyfield's promoter, Don King, will
be able to make that happen. Lewis isn't holding his breath. Talks
are underway for Lewis to meet Lou Savarese on Dec. 12.

7 WOUNDED IN CITY HALL SHOOT-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add police attributions in first two grafs; changes

 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ A man armed with a pistol and years of anger
about his dismissal as a part-time city parks employee burst into a
meeting room at City Hall here Tuesday morning and opened fire,
wounding the mayor and two members of the City Council, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the man, a postal worker identified as Joseph Neale
Jr., 48, then barricaded himself in the room with Mayor Ron
Loveridge and several council members as police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as police began breaking open the locked door
with a crowbar and a sledgehammer, Neale opened fire through the
door, police said. Officers then stormed into the room, just off of
the council chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, three officers were wounded in the
hail of gunfire as the officials took cover. One officer, Sgt.
Wally Rice, a 20-year police department veteran, was hit in the
abdomen. Another officer was hit in the hand and a third was struck
by a round that slammed into the front of his bulletproof vest,
leaving him bruised but otherwise unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Chuck Beaty, 63, was shot in the face and
the shoulder; he was listed in critical but stable condition.
Loveridge was grazed by a bullet. Councilwoman Laura Pearson was
hospitalized with a hip wound; Councilwoman Terri Thompson was not
wounded but was treated for unspecified pain. None of the injuries
were considered life threatening, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neale was hit at least twice by police gunfire and fell to the
floor. He was taken to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Neale had been dismissed by the city in 1994 from his job at a
local community center, where he had established and coached a
chess team. Since then he has been fighting to get his position
back.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited team members from the struggling neighborhoods of
the city's East Side. He said he saw chess as a way to develop
young minds and keep youths off the streets and away from violence.
</P>
<P>
   Neale, who is black, sued the city in 1995 for wrongful
termination, citing age and race discrimination. The city denied
the charges and a judge dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   Neale also said that the city had tried to deprive him of his
right of free speech. That part of his case is scheduled to go to
trial on Oct. 19.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is unclear why Neale was fired, but during his several years
at the center, he was a prolific letter writer, asking local
merchants for donations to the chess team, The Press-Enterprise of
Riverside reported in an extra edition Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neale also sent copies of a 54-page letter he wrote to local,
state and federal officials, including President Clinton, bemoaning
what he said was the lack of educational and employment
opportunities for black and Hispanic teen-agers. In his suit, Neale
contended that he had been fired because of that letter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Neale had frequently been seen sitting quietly
in the back of the City Council chamber during council meetings,
The Press-Enterprise said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, several City Council members, the city manager and
the city attorney were in the room Tuesday morning, preparing for
the day's regularly scheduled council meeting, when Neale burst in
and began shooting, said police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surrealistic, something you would see in a movie,'' a
shaken Loveridge said shortly after being treated for the graze
wound to his shoulder. ``You realize you may not leave that room,
that may be your final testimonial, lying on the floor of that room
behind council chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the police not gone into the room when they did, ``there
very possibly would have been some deaths,'' said Police Lt. Pete
Esquivel. ``There was blood all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no metal detectors in the building. ``Prior to this,''
said Det. Steve Johnson, ``we never felt metal detectors were
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The month before Neale was fired from the youth center, he
received a letter from Loveridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am impressed with your personal effort to help the youth of
this community,'' the mayor wrote. ``You must have invested
hundreds of hours working with these young people and, it is
obvious you have reached many of them.''

A COMPLACENT ATTITUDE IS NOT IN BRAVES' PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The usual guideline for a team that has grown
accustomed to winning all the time is to act in tune with having
been there before. The usual danger for such a team is it becomes
blase about its achievements.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other team in the major leagues, the Atlanta
Braves have become accustomed to success. Game 1 of the National
League Championship Series at Turner Field Wednesday night will
mark the seventh consecutive time that Atlanta will be in
post-season play. This time, the Braves will be going up against a
team _ the San Diego Padres _ that hasn't been this far since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves don't appear to be taking the ho-hum approach.
</P>
<P>
   When they dispatched the Chicago Cubs in three straight games in
the first part of the playoffs last week, they celebrated with a
considerable amount of giddiness, even if the sweep was hardly a
surprise. Tuesday, some of the veteran Braves credited the impact
of new players like Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss for helping
make the team feel a little hungrier, a little more determined and
a little more appreciative of its good fortune as it attempts to
make it to the World Series, where the Braves were turned back by
the Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get a little spoiled sometimes,'' said Chipper Jones,
who has played in the NLCS every season since he became a regular
in in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, the slick-fielding first-baseman who has given the
Braves a right-handed force in the middle of the lineup this
season, has never been to a World Series. Weiss, a steady shortstop
and leadoff hitter who was selected to his first All-Star team this
season, has not been to the World Series since 1990, when he played
with Oakland. Neither is trying to play down his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough new guys over here that we were really excited
about winning a division and winning the division series,'' Weiss
said. ``And it was kind of contagious. From what I've heard, it
wasn't that big a deal in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The way many of the Braves sounded Tuesday, on the eve of their
four-of-seven-game series with the underdog Padres, a hungrier
attitude was just what they needed after being upset by the Florida
Marlins, 4 games to 2, in the NLCS a year ago. And that was
something Javy Lopez alluded to when he said that Weiss and
Galarraga have a different attitude than former Braves like Kenny
Lofton and Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different perspective anyway with the guys we've
added,'' said John Smoltz, who will start Game 1 for Atlanta
against the San Diego right-hander Andy Ashby. ``They're not taking
anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Atlanta, however, it is easy to see why people might
take a lot for granted. Since 1991, the Braves have 757
regular-season victories, 71 more than the Yankees and 116 more
than the nearest NL team, the Houston Astros. And so, when Jones
said, ``We,'' he was also speaking of the hometown fans, who have
witnessed the Braves win seven division titles in a row _ excluding
the 1994 strike-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said, ``Nothing short of winning the World Series will be
acceptable here,'' adding that it is a little unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, we've played five different teams in the NLCS,''
said the 31-year-old right-hander, who went 17-3 this year after
undergoing off-season elbow surgery. ``It's easy to say that we
only have won one World Championship. But credit needs to be
given.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who is 11-3 with a 2.29 career post-season ERA, was
speaking from the perspective of having pitched for a team that had
lost 106 games in 1988 and 97 games in both 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glavine and I have been humiliated and laughed at,'' Smoltz
said, referring to Tom Glavine, Atlanta's Game 2 starter, who was
also there in the dreary years. ``That's why this means so much to
us. When this run is over, they're going to appreciate it so much
more than they do now. It's going to be like, `Remember the 90's.
Man, that was great.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Braves sounded a little miffed when they were
subjected to ``Let's Go Cubs!'' chants in their own ball park
during the first round. They heard the same sort of chants for the
Yankees in the 1996 World Series. When asked Tuesday if he would
ever expect to hear ``Let's Go Braves!'' at Yankee Stadium, Jones
quickly answered no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not unless they're on a suicide mission,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a much different mission this week: to get back
to the World Series, to win another one, and to once and for all
quiet the critics, many of whom come from their own hometown. But
regardless of what happens with the Padres, Smoltz figures his team
deserves a little more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won our seventh division title this season,'' Smoltz said.
``I just can't see that ever being done again.''

 &HT;    Campaign '98 orbits into cyberspace
 &HT;    (EDS: With INTERNET-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories. Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the November elections near, candidates are
planting their virtual battle flags in record numbers across
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   While 1998 is the first election year in which the Internet is
widely regarded as a mass medium, it's still uncertain what impact
these powerful new digital tools will have on individual campaigns,
or more broadly, on the country's future political course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a test year for the Internet and politics and
we expect to learn a lot from this effort,'' Steve Case, chairman
and chief executive officer of America Online (AOL), said Tuesday
as he helped launch a major initiative to mesh the established
political world with the fluid World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by AOL, the new Web, White and Blue site
(http://www.webwhiteblue.org) offers one-stop political shopping to
some 45 major non-partisan political databases. The selected sites,
replete with their own clickable links, dispense voter information,
campaign schedules, issue papers and state-by-state political news.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation, a co-sponsor of
the cyberproject, said 450 commercial Internet sites had so far
agreed to carry a Web, White and Blue icon on their own home pages.
</P>
<P>
   As Case put it in a conference call with reporters: ``We're
giving people the tools and resources to do their own research _ to
learn about the candidates and issues and to connect with the
political process on their own terms and timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of candidates, key staff members and consultants in 270
current campaigns published last month in Campaigns &AMP; Elections
magazine last month found that nearly nine out of 10 respondents
saw the Internet as a vital medium that is changing, or soon will
change, political campaigns. Less than 12 percent voiced a
skeptical viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The new explosive political demographics of the Internet became
evident last month when, within 24 hours, about 20 million
Americans accessed the impeachment report on President Clinton that
was referred to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
NetRatings, a cyberspace traffic measuring firm, found that each
online visitor spent an average of 30 minutes reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as television has all but eliminated observational
reporting, the Internet threatens interpretive and beat
reporting,'' said Michael Cornfield, who teaches courses on
politics and the new media here at George Washington University's
Graduate School of Political Management.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield, who also co-publishes an online political review,
noted that the advent of such massive document dumps puts extensive
source material for the first time directly in the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, ``journalists are being forced to
accommodate to the Internet by devoting more of their efforts to
guiding their audiences into, and through, publicly relevant
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public becomes an intimate part of the story itself, and
the dynamic and the role of the media changes from being mere
'reporters of fact' to 'guides to context'.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The sheer growth of cyberspace is another factor impacting the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the Internet has grown extensive roots, a
recent Field Poll shows that 41 percent of likely voters now use
e-mail and that 67 percent use a computer regularly at home, work
or school. Such high numbers offer largely unplowed soil for
political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide telephone survey conducted last February found that
the proportion of people who used the Internet for political
activity had doubled since a similar survey conducted before the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth path has a ways to go. According to Bruce Bimber,
a political science professor at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, who conducted the February poll, only 17 percent of
respondents used the Internet to express political views, to learn
about political issues, to browse for political information or to
get in contact with elected officials or candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of activity encouraged by Project Vote Smart, a
nonpartisan nonprofit group founded 40 years ago by former senators
and presidential candidates Barry Goldwater of Arizona and George
McGovern of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're averaging more than a half million hits a day,'' said
Richard Kimball, the group's president. ``I fought against going on
the Internet three years ago,'' he added, ``but it's become huge
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No so huge, however, that the Internet stands a chance of
displacing television as the prime contact point for voters in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants note that, unlike television, the Internet
is still not universally available and that online information
reaches only self-selected interested voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, you decide you want to watch 'Seinfeld,' and you get
our ad,'' says Mark Mellman, a Washington political consultant
whose clients have included Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota and Barbara Boxer of California. ``But when you go to the
Web, you have to want to go to a political site.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL's Case remains undeterred from his middleman function
of creating another viable ``portal for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics Internet-style: interactive, contextual,
informative, and, above all, optimistic,'' he concluded in touting
the new Web White &AMP; Blue site. ``While we cannot predict how the
Internet will change politics, we can say with certainty that it
will.''

   ARIZONA: 2 Quarterbacks, 0 Losses
</P>
<P>
   Alternating quarterbacks can be a two-headed curse for many
teams, but the Wildcats are making it a blessing. Keith Smith and
Ortege Jenkins have led Arizona to a 5-0 record and No. 10 ranking
(No. 25 in The New York Times computer) heading into its Pac-10
confrontation at home against No. 3 UCLA (3-0, 1-0) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working out better than I thought,'' Smith said. ``We're
tight as friends, so it's not like I'm rooting against him. I'm
totally rooting for him. We're like one big quarterback instead of
two little ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Smith has the edge. He has completed 51 of 74
passes for 782 yards and 6 touchdowns. His efficiency rating is
179.04, which would make him second in the nation if he had one
more attempt. Jenkins is 33 of 61 for 481 yards and 3 touchdowns,
and has the greater flair for the spectacular. His flip over three
defenders into the end zone with 4 seconds left gave the Wildcats a
31-28 upset of Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could that not be the highlight of the year?'' an admiring
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   They are truly equals in the system. Jenkins played eight series
against Washington and Smith seven.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona even has a trick play in which they are both deployed on
offense, and it was used to great effect last week. Smith stationed
himself at tailback and Jenkins lined up at quarterback and went in
motion as a receiver would, leaving the spot behind the center
vacant. After the ball was snapped on the ground, Smith picked it
up and fired the ball to Jenkins near the sideline for a 22-yard
gain that kept an 80-yard touchdown drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   Both return next year, and Smith fully expects the platooning to
continue. ``We know that each other is not going to blow each other
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA: A Lesson From Baseball
</P>
<P>
   If Quincy Carter, the Bulldogs' quarterback, seems mature for a
freshman, credit the daily grind of baseball. Carter has played
outfield in the Chicago Cubs organization the last two years, and
said the games in which he struggled taught him resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to do your best every day,'' said the
20-year-old Carter, who has approached phenom status by guiding the
No. 7 Bulldogs (No. 9 Times computer) to a 4-0 record heading into
Saturday's Southeastern Conference showdown with No. 4 Tennessee
(4-0, No. 7 Times computer).
</P>
<P>
   Carter, from Southwest DeKalb High School, reneged on a letter
of intent to Georgia Tech when the Cubs drafted him in the second
round in June 1996. Missing football, he enrolled at Georgia last
spring and beat out three upperclassmen in August for the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not playing quarterback for nearly three years, he has
completed 66 of 93 passes for 957 yards and 6 touchdowns with 1
interception, giving him a better passing efficiency than
Kentucky's Heisman candidate, Tim Couch. Carter threw for 318 yards
and 2 touchdowns in last week's 28-27 upset of LSU. The 6-foot-2,
220-pound Carter is also the third leading rusher on the team with
111 yards and 2 touchdowns on 37 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who hit .248 in 27 games for Class A Rockford last
summer, said he will continue to play both sports. He already has
sought the advice of the current Cowboy and former baseball player
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me never just give up on one of them if you love them
both,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   SYRACUSE: Changing the Focus
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Pasqualoni is calling on his Orangemen (2-2, 1-0 Big
East) to shake off last week's 38-17 defeat to North Carolina State
in order to refocus on winning the conference championship. ``We
can't allow it to be that disappointing,'' Pasqualoni said. ``Hey,
we're all grown-ups here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, ranked 24th in both the coaches' and media poll
and unranked by The New York Times computer, entertain Cincinnati,
a nonconference foe, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   RUTGERS: A Successful Conversion
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of struggling in the standings is that
Rutgers can develop its freshman recruits. Tosh Riddick, of
Allentown, Pa., was converted from running back to receiver to
shore up Rutgers' injury-depleted pass-catching corps.
</P>
<P>
   In his first exposure Sept. 19, Riddick caught a 25-yard pass
against Syracuse. Last week against Miami, Riddick had a breakout
game, grabbing 3 passes for 102 yards, including a 58-yard
touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to develop him as a wide receiver,'' coach
Terry Shea said. ``He truly has that breakaway speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (2-3, 0-3 Big East) has an off week, then travels to
Pittsburgh on Oct. 17.

4 CHARGED WITH SELLING FAULTY UNIFORMS TO PENTAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn-based clothing company and four of its top
officials have been charged with defrauding the Pentagon of
millions of dollars by using defective cloth in coveralls and
combat uniforms, law enforcement officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said the company, Isratex Inc.,
rigged inspections to make Defense Department inspectors think they
were examining random samples of new clothing when they were
actually seeing the same small batch of properly made goods over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   Isratex had $30 million in contracts with the Defense Department
to manufacture clothing for the armed services. Prosecutors said
the rigged inspections took place at a subsidiary in Puerto Rico
that made uniforms and other military clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They said an inspector who wanted to examine a lot ready for
shipment would choose at random the numbers on the boxes that he
wished to see. ``He would then wait in a conference room and they
would bring him the boxes with those numbers,'' said Seth Marvin,
an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspectors were shown boxes that had quickly been
spray-painted with the requested numbers and that contained
garments that would pass the inspection, Marvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual production lots manufactured by Isratex of Puerto
Rico Inc.,'' as the subsidiary was known, ``consisted mainly of
items that were manufactured with defective cloth and with inferior
workmanship,'' said a statement from the office of Zachary Carter,
the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin declined to say how the fraud was discovered or how much
of the $30 million worth of clothing had actually been produced,
delivered and paid for. But he said Defense Department officials
had estimated that the agency had lost $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know whether Isratex, based at 59 Scholes St.
in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, was still in business,
noting that it had been involved in bankruptcy proceedings. There
is currently no telephone listing for the company in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The officials charged are Abe Brin, 50, of Brooklyn, the
company's president; his brother Yehudah Yoav Brin, 48, of
Jerusalem, the vice president and secretary; Zvi Rosenthal, 54, of
Tenafly, N.J., the production manager, and Timothy Lafferty, 43, of
Collegeville, Pa. Lafferty is president of another Isratex
subsidiary, Marywell Ltd., which obtained the cloth used by the
companies: cotton sateen for the coveralls and a mixture of cotton
and nylon for the combat uniform parts.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that the company used substandard cloth
in the form of ``seconds,'' a merchandising term for goods of
inferior quality, and took steps to disguise their use.
</P>
<P>
   All defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud the
Defense Department, a crime punishable by up to 5 years in prison,
and all but Lafferty were also charged with fraud counts punishable
by up to 10 years in prison. All but Yehudah Brin, who is being
sought, have been arrested and have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Brin's lawyer, Avi Moskowitz, was reported to be out of his
office Tuesday. Lawyers for the two other men who were arrested
declined to comment.

EDITORIAL: AFFORDABLE BASIC BANKING

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Making banking services available to citizens who need them has
long been a worthy goal, but it will become even more important in
January, when new rules require that most recipients of federal
benefits _ including Social Security _ have the money transferred
to them electronically. Paper checks will no longer be available.
</P>
<P>
   That is why one section of the House-passed Financial Services
bill was so welcome. It directed federal regulators to require
banks setting up financial services holding companies to offer
low-cost basic banking services _ a low-fee checking account with
limited withdrawals. Such accounts do not offer the flexibility of
more popular accounts, but they are vital for many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of such a provision in the Senate bill is a significant
problem. Before that bill is acted upon, the basic banking
provision should be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be good if the Senate would overturn a decision to
strip the Comptroller of the Currency of important regulatory
responsibilities that were left entirely with the Federal Reserve.
That far-reaching decision seems to have been made largely because
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is very popular. But banking
issues sometimes are very important for the economy, and the
people, through officials appointed by the president, should have a
say in them.
</P>
<P>
   The pending bill has many good parts. But if Congress passes the
version now pending in the Senate, it may be necessary for
President Clinton to veto it and ask the next Congress to do a
better job.

EDITORIAL: A CHALLENGE FOR CARL MCCALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   New York State's comptroller, Carl McCall, is not the only
Albany politician whose campaign treasury is bulging with donations
from companies and executives doing business with the state. McCall
has called for campaign finance reform in the past, and his current
fund-raising is within the law. Still, as described by Clifford J.
Levy in The Times, he has harvested a sizable amount of money from
lawyers, investment officials and others awarded contracts
involving the state's $100 billion pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, who steadfastly denies any quid pro quo, has
received more than $1.8 million in donations from these sources _
over 35 percent of his campaign donations to date. In some cases,
the contributions landed in McCall's campaign around the same time
the companies landed the contracts. Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co. of Los
Angeles, for example, received an investment of $85 million last
December from the pension fund three days after McCall's campaign
received $16,000 from seven executives of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, a Democrat whose huge war chest of $5.2 million
this year apparently helped ward off a strong challenge from the
Republicans, argues that he has not done anything illegal or even
wrong. Contributions do not buy state business, his communications
director, Steven Greenberg, asserts, adding that many more
businesses have contracts with the pension fund even though they
have not donated a penny to McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this style of fund-raising and the huge amounts of
pension money involved would make even the most trusting of
citizens uncomfortable. The pattern of the McCall campaign
donations provides another of the many reasons New Yorkers deserve
a better system for campaign fund-raising. While advocating tighter
campaign finance laws, McCall asserts that until such laws are
passed, he will not disarm unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is in a position to lead on this issue. He is facing
a weak opponent. He already has a multimillion-dollar campaign
treasury, and plenty of contributors who are not in the financial
field. For the rest of the campaign, McCall should forswear
questionable contributions. He should promise that if re-elected he
will devise a system for insulating himself from decisions that
present a conflict of interest, and then press the Legislature for
reforms that would bar future comptrollers from taking
contributions that look compromising. McCall has acknowledged that
he has an appearance problem. This is the way to correct it.

49ERS CO-OWNER ADMITS CONCEALING EXTORTION PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Clarifies in 3rd graf that Edwards has not been charged.) 
 (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ After striking a deal to provide evidence
against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, San Francisco 49ers
co-owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty Tuesday to concealing
an alleged extortion plot by Edwards that involved the licensing of
a riverboat casino.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the proceedings began in federal district court
here, the 71-year-old Edwards _ tanned, silver-haired, unwrinkled,
and accompanied by his striking 33-year-old wife, Candy _ strode
into the courtroom, glad-handed with spectators, and took a seat
three rows behind DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 45-minute hearing, a bent knuckle pressed
against his lips, Edwards, who has not been charged in the case,
announced to reporters in a descending elevator that his longtime
friend had become ``the Linda Tripp of Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   For emphasis, he later added that ``I hope the 49ers lose this
Sunday,'' when they play the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   And noting that DeBartolo is worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, he scoffed at the prosecution's contention that he had
victimized DeBartolo: ``If I had victimized him, I would have done
it for a lot more than $400,000.'' That is the amount that all
sides agree DeBartolo paid to Edwards, in new $100 bills, for his
services in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, the 51-year-old scion of one of the country's most
successful shopping mall developers, softly pleaded guilty to one
count of misprison of felony, meaning that he failed to report what
prosecutors characterized as ``extortion and fraudulent conduct''
by Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   As per the plea agreement, Judge John Parker sentenced DeBartolo
to two years probation and ordered him to pay a $250,000 fine,
forfeit the $400,000 he paid to Edwards and provide up to $350,000
in restitution that can be claimed by anyone injured by the crime.
</P>
<P>
   After sentencing, Parker advised DeBartolo that his lawyer,
Aubrey Harwell, had served him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This criminal justice system rewards the fellow who gets to
the courthouse quickest,'' the judge said. `` And Mr. Harwell has
secured you a prime seat on this train that seems to be leaving the
station. In fact, you may have a private car.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, FBI agent Jeffrey Santini testified that
evidence provided by witnesses and wiretaps showed that Edwards and
his son, Stephen, had repeatedly sought payments from DeBartolo in
late 1996 and early 1997. The money, he said, was to insure that
the state Gaming Board would award the license for its 15th and
final riverboat casino to a consortium that included DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Edwards left office in January 1996, prosecutors say he
still maintained influence with the six-member Gaming Board through
other elected and appointed officials. Santini said that Edwards
put DeBartolo ``in fear of economic loss relative to the awarding
of his joint venture's license if he did not pay Edwards
substantial sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   First Edwards demanded ``a $50,000 per month sham consulting
agreement payable to Stephen Edwards and a price per head of each
customer aboard the riverboat,'' Santini testified.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked for the $400,000 lump sum payment ``by stating, in
substance, that he must have payment of that amount by March 13 or
there could be problems with the licensing.'' Even after that
payment was made, Santini said, the Edwardses ``sent DeBartolo yet
another proposed retainer agreement for $10,000 per month.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1997, DeBartolo gave Edwards the $400,000 after a
lunch in California. The next day, the Gaming Board granted the
casino license to Hollywood Casino Corp., the Dallas company that
had enlisted DeBartolo as an investor. The board later withdrew the
license after learning of the federal investigation. In late April,
federal agents raided Edwards' house and office and seized the
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors called DeBartolo's plea ``a major
development'' in their efforts to convict the former four-term
governor, a flamboyant charmer who twice escaped federal
convictions on unrelated charges in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in their right mind would underestimate
the value and significance of DeBartolo's cooperation,'' said Eddie
Jordan, the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans and the lead prosecutor in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the plea also raises questions about whether DeBartolo will
ever regain control of his beloved 49ers, the professional football
club he managed until last December. At that time, he stepped down
as chairman after prosecutors notified him that he might be
indicted. The team has been run ever since by DeBartolo's younger
sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who is chairwoman and chief
executive officer of the Youngstown, Ohio, real estate firm started
by their father.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the National Football League frowns on the ownership of
teams by felons, DeBartolo said Tuesday that he would immediately
``start the process of getting my football team back.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement Tuesday that
DeBartolo's plea agreement was not made as part of any arrangement
with his office. ``Until our office is able to complete a thorough
review of today's agreement and related matters, I have directed
Mr. DeBartolo to continue his current inactive status with respect
to both the affairs of the 49ers and the NFL,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Several league officials and team owners said Tuesday that
Tagliabue would have broad discretion to fine DeBartolo and suspend
him from team activities before allowing him to apply for
reinstatement.

WOMAN WHO STALKED LETTERMAN IS A SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (mk-nk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman who was repeatedly jailed for stalking David Letterman
over the last decade committed suicide on Monday by kneeling in
front of a speeding train in western Colorado, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conductor saw her run out on the railroad tracks,'' said
Fred McKee, undersheriff of Delta County.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Margaret Mary Ray, 46, was sentenced to prison
several times for harassing Letterman by trespassing on his
property in New Canaan, Conn., breaking into his house, and trying
to reach him by telephone and in person.
</P>
<P>
   She was first arrested in 1988 while driving Letterman's Porsche
through the Lincoln Tunnel. When she could not pay the toll, she
identified herself as Letterman's wife and her son as David
Letterman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, she was repeatedly arrested for trespassing
and for harassing and stalking Letterman. He responded by calling
the local police and using the situation as fodder for jokes on his
late-night television show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, shortly before moving the show to CBS, he dedicated one
of his celebrated Top 10 lists to ``Things I Have to Do Before I
Leave NBC,'' and included ``Send change-of-address forms to that
woman who breaks into my house.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1992 interview with The Advocate of Stamford, Conn., he
had spoken seriously about the matter. ``The thing of it is, she's
insane,'' he said. ``And you don't want to do anything to make it
worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Letterman responded to the news of Ms. Ray's death
through a spokesman: ``This is a sad ending to a confused life.''
</P>
<P>
   Undersheriff McKee said that Ms. Ray had been living in
Crawford, Colo. She apparently did not leave a suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray spent about 10 months in jail for the trespassing
convictions, as well as 14 months in a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she began to harass Story Musgrave, an astronaut
who retired in 1996 at age 61, said a police officer in Osceola
County, Fla. Ms. Ray called Musgrave repeatedly, sent unwanted
packages to him and broke into his home, turning on all the water
faucets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him,''
she told a local newspaper, from jail. She was released last
August.

GOP SPLIT ON BUDGET STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 and JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Congress and the nation have been preoccupied
with impeachment, a battle has erupted on another front and could
have an equally dramatic impact on this November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the deadline for completing the federal budget, and
Republican congressional leaders are desperately trying to stave
off another government shutdown such as the ones three years ago
that resulted in a big public opinion backlash.
</P>
<P>
   They are jettisoning controversial provisions from
appropriations bills and promising to send President Clinton a
series of ``clean'' temporary spending measures if they can't
complete their work by Friday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   They are doing this despite protests from the conservatives in
their own party. The reason? They don't want to give Democrats the
opportunity to exploit a shutdown and divert the public's attention
from Clinton's travails.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives want Congress to make a stand for tax cuts and
spending caps. They are convinced that backing down will gain them
nothing because Clinton will shut down the government anyway and
distract voters from his possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the Senate's No. 2 Republican, said
Congress will pass a temporary spending measure every day if
necessary to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chances of us having a government shutdown are
zero,'' he said Tuesday, after the Senate GOP's weekly caucus. ``If
the Democrats choose to shut down the government, it will clearly
be the Democrats doing it. I hope they're smarter than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is scrambling to pass the nine remaining spending bills
before heading home to wage re-election campaigns. They must pass
some kind of spending measure by Friday, when a temporary extension
of funding authority expires, or the government will shut down as
it did for 27 non-consecutive days in 1995 and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said the GOP will drop its plan for $80 billion in tax
cuts because it doesn't have enough Senate votes. Also on the
chopping block are education vouchers for poor children in the
District of Columbia. Both measures are opposed by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   As the budget casualties pile up, conservatives are growing more
and more irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anyone in our leadership who wants to take the
president on on a government shutdown issue,'' said Rep. Matt
Salmon, R-Ariz. ``It's really sad, because no one is well served
that way. It's not about philosophical differences. It's a
political chess game.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he's sure that Clinton, even after he gets what he
wants out of the budget negotiations, will shut down the government
with his veto power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's going to shut it down anyway, we might as well
draw our philosophical line in the sand,'' he said. ``What I do
blame Republicans for is not being as philosophically committed as
they once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot lead out of cowardice. You cannot lead out of a
position of weakness,'' he said. ``They (GOP leaders) are backing
down because they fear they'll be blamed for a government shutdown,
and they fear the retribution at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he's
concerned that Clinton will veto even the most innocuous spending
measures in a scenario similar to the movie ``Wag the Dog''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned if they're thinking about a domestic ``Wag the
Dog'' to take advantage of some way to change the subject or
distract attention from the administration's problems by not coming
to an agreement on this (budget) bill,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote Thursday on whether to open an impeachment
inquiry into the president's conduct surrounding his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The House Judiciary
Committee voted Monday along party lines to recommend such an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Democrats have no
intention of shutting down the government for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning on any government shutdown. There's too
much at stake. . . . The only way it will happen is if the
Republicans insist on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle made it clear that many budget issues are still
outstanding and that the Senate may have to stay the weekend,
beyond Friday's end of federal funding, to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles is scheduled today to
meet with congressional leaders to try to smooth out remaining
budget wrinkles, including funding for the 2000 census that has
been held up over whether to use a controversial statistical
sampling method.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticks toward the November election, this budget
period becomes critical for both parties, said Democrat Gene Karp,
who served as a top aide to former Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next week to two weeks, you may see a big shift in how
the electorate feels. It could shift dramatically either way, de
pending on how these showdowns come out,'' said Karp, who recently
ended a four-year stint as a Department of Labor manager.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unresolved budget issues are whether the Republicans
would drop their push for a contentious series of environmental
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those include increasing timber production in Alaska's Tongass
National Forest and redistributing some Indian funds so that
wealthier tribes receive less money and poorer tribes get more. &QL;

INJURY SLOW TO SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty minutes after practice began Tuesday, Cal
State Northridge defensive end Patrick Cwik pulled himself out with
a sore neck.
</P>
<P>
   Cwik is fortunate he even made it to practice at all.
</P>
<P>
   A junior starter, Cwik said he was riding his bike from the main
campus to North Campus Stadium earlier in the day when he was hit
by a car. The incident took place in front of the Asian House on
Halsted Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew off the windshield and went flying,'' said Cwik,
sporting a cut beneath his nose. ``The lady was hysterical. She
never saw me coming. I got up, didn't break anything, so I told her
not to worry about it. I don't know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Cwik didn't tell the coaching staff about the accident until he
took himself out of practice. He spent the rest of the time with
ice on the back of his neck. Cwik said team trainers thought he may
have whiplash. Police were not called to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hey, I'm fine,''' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``He
doesn't even want to indicate that he can't play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Cwik said he will try to practice today and remains optimistic
he will be available for No.23 CSUN's showdown Saturday with No.18
Montana. However, if he can't play against the Grizzlies (3-2, 2-1
Big Sky), it will pose enormous problems for the Matadors'
defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Sean Beard (broken leg) and Marcus Nance (knee)
out, Ponciano said it's unlikely Mike Colunga (ankle) will play.
Also, Jacob Mageo (pinched nerve) didn't practice so Quinton Reed,
a 6-foot-2, 270-pound junior, was shifted from linebacker to nose
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more guys can we lose?'' Ponciano said.
``Fortunately, we have a lot of guys that can play multiple
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Reed) will be a great defensive lineman. You get a
guy in there that's fresh and can get off the ball quickly, that's
of the utmost importance.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nice shirt, coach: The first national ranking since CSUN
moved to Division I-AA left many of the Matadors in jovial moods
before practice, and Ponciano sensed it. So he went on the
offensive about getting everyone's attention back on Big Sky power
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   And he did so by donning a Montana Grizzlies T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on and got in a bad mood quickly,'' Ponciano said.
``The reality is we have Montana coming up, so we can't afford to
slip.''
</P>
<P>
   __ First downs: Center Beau Cherry, who injured his knee in the
season opener at Boise State, returned to practice Tuesday and will
back up Julio Alcala. Also, Mike Barnes (groin) practiced after
missing Saturday's game with Southern Utah.... Ponciano said
little-used defensive back Bryant Eubanks quit the team Tuesday for
lack of playing time.... Backup defensive back James Maldonado
(pinched nerve) and linebacker Carl Finely (shoulder) missed
practice.... Wide receiver Eric Carpenter (ankle) returned to
practice after missing two weeks but said he doesn't expect to play
against Montana.

M'S PLAN REVEALS ANOTHER SEASON GOING BACKWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To be a Mariner baseball executive these days is to be
able to identify a little with the disturbed sleep of Ebenezer
Scrooge.
</P>
<P>
   Every time they doze off in front of a TV screen featuring a
baseball playoff game, the nap is haunted by the Ghost of Dealings
Past.
</P>
<P>
   As you perhaps have read or counted, 25 former Mariners advanced
to the 1998 playoffs, which is, of course, 25 more than advanced
from the current Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest among the ghosts was Randy Johnson, who on
postseason eve was forecast to be the decisive acquisition that
would tilt the baseball championship to the Houston Astros. It was
not hard to imagine the Big Unit as the World Series' most valuable
player, giving him the privilege of shaking his chains and moaning
in Mariner dreams throughout the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But no.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of industrial-strength deja vu, Johnson pitched well
in Games 1 and 4 of the Division Series against the San Diego
Padres. And he and his team lost Games 1 and 4, just as the
Mariners did with him a year ago in the Division Series against the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? asks ``Saturday Night Live's'' Church Lady. Or is
it ... SATAN!
</P>
<P>
   Well, before we throw in a third paranormal analogy and get
completely derailed, neither ghosts nor devils have compromised
Johnson, who has now lost an astonishing five straight postseason
games to tie a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Johnson has no effective change-up or curve ball. So
when he's up against good hitters in the postseason, the law of
averages suggest that if a bat is kept whipping through the strike
zone at the right speed, in the span of 120 or so pitches, contact
can be made five or six times.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson's two speeds of fast and faster supply the power,
mere contact can produce home runs or big hits.
</P>
<P>
   And since Johnson is usually matched against the other team's
premier pitcher, that usually means a dead-even game decided on
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has pitched 521/3 career innings in the postseason,
giving up 18 earned runs (3.15 ERA) while walking 16 and striking
out 62. But he has a 2-5 record, and one of the wins was in relief
_ the nearly immortal fifth game of the 1995 Division Series
against New York.
</P>
<P>
   The foregoing is not to suggest that Johnson is a choking,
losing dog and the Mariners did well by unloading him this season.
No, no. Just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   However cursed his postseason fate, the Mariners still don't
have a pitcher that can put up Johnson's numbers. Nor do they plan
to acquire one, based on their stated intentions to hunt only for a
No. 3 guy behind Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   And if the playoffs thus far have offered anything, they have
provided the 10 essentials for postseason camping: pitching,
pitching, pitching, pitching, pitching, pitching, pitching,
pitching, pitching, pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers, perhaps the brawniest hitting club in
baseball, got one stinking run in the three-game sweep by the New
York Yankees. The Astros' ``Killer B's'' of Derek Bell, Craig
Biggio and Jeff Bagwell _ now the Killer Breeze _ are 8-for-78
combined in Houston's consecutive first-round exits in the last two
playoffs. Even the Yankee offense, which helped New York to one of
the great regular seasons in history, hit .210 against Ranger
pitching. The Cubbies, even with Sammy Sosa, were helpless against
the Atlanta Braves' mound staff.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted Mariner lineup in the 1997 Division Series against
Baltimore hit a collective .218. In the 1995 ALCS against
Cleveland, it hit .184.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone requiring ironic emphasis upon the obvious point
about pitching, the man who dispatched Johnson and the Astros from
the playoffs was none other than Sterling Hitchcock (Mariner
executives: resume nightmare).
</P>
<P>
   The lefty who washed out of Seattle after one season in 1996
because Mariner manager Lou Piniella thought he was a wuss (as he
believed about Andy Benes, Derek Lowe and others) crushed the
Astros with 11 strikeouts over six innings. Hitchcock recovered his
allegedly lost manhood as the No. 4 Padres starter with a 9-7
record and 3.93 ERA in 176 innings, including 158 strikeouts and 48
walks.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquired from the Yankees along with third baseman Russ
Davis in the infamous 1995 deal that sent to New York All-Star
first baseman Tino Martinez and relief pitcher Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   But after the '96 season in which Hitchcock faded at the end, he
was traded for pitcher Scott Sanders, who was subsequently dealt to
Detroit for two more pitchers, Omar Olivares and Felipe Lira.
</P>
<P>
   Lira was mostly a bust. Olivares was not re-signed and went to
Anaheim, where this year he picked up two wins over the Mariners
and finished 9-9 with a 4.03 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners seem to have had a whole bunch of No. 3 starters
the last few seasons. But they failed to develop or keep them,
instead putting the payroll emphasis upon the aspect of the game
that comes up second-best in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   What is left is a team built backwards, with little plausible
plan for going forward.
</P>
<P>
   At least the players will be making the playoffs, as long as no
one minds the different-colored shirts.

DOCTOR SAYS MEDICAL CARE FOR NYC PRISONERS HAS ERODED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The doctor responsible for monitoring the quality of
medical care in city jails said in an interview Tuesday that she
resigned recently because the medical care for prisoners has eroded
under a new managed care contract, and she accused city officials
of refusing to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Audrey Compton, who until Friday was the medical director of
the Health and Hospital Corp.'s Office of Correctional Health
Services, said she resigned from her post because she felt she
could no longer effectively perform her job.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Compton accused city officials of not doing enough to
monitor St. Barnabas Hospital's performance under its contract with
the city to provide health care at Rikers Island and in the
Manhattan Detention Complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left because I was frustrated with the lack of monitoring,''
Dr. Compton said. ``I personally didn't feel as though the contract
was being enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Manhattan district attorney and city's
Board of Correction have been investigating the care of inmates,
including the cases of four prisoners who died.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials last week acknowledged problems in
monitoring St. Barnabas' performance, they pledged to improve their
oversight of medical care in the jails.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday, Joseph Erazo, the executive director of the Office of
Correctional Health Services, said he and his senior staff would be
moving their offices to Rikers Island within the next few weeks to
keep better track of the quality of care in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked at the issues she was concerned with,'' Erazo
said. ``And I think we're moving to deal with a lot of the issues
that concern her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erazo suggested that Dr. Compton herself might be partly
responsible for the problems in the jails, given that under state
law she was legally responsible for insuring that inmates received
adequate medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility for quality of care is on the medical
director,'' Erazo said, referring to Dr. Compton. ``That's where
the buck stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Compton countered that her superiors, including Erazo,
failed to act on her recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel that I was empowered to do my job,'' she said.
``There should have been more of an on-site presence in all the
facilities. It never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Compton is the fifth senior official to have left the Office
of Correctional Health Services since St. Barnabas took over the
contract in January.
</P>
<P>
   Erazo, who took his position in June after the last executive
director resigned, said the departures were routine and not part of
a systemic problem.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the resignations reflect the difficulties
surrounding the Giuliani administration's implementation of the
contract, which they say provides an incentive for St. Barnabas to
increase its profits by withholding medical care from prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   As in many managed care contracts, St. Barnabas is given an
annual lump sum to provide care. Whatever funds the hospital does
not spend at the end of the year can be kept as its profit.
</P>
<P>
   Since St. Barnabas took over the contract in January, visits by
inmates to hospitals outside the jail _ one of the most expensive
forms of care _ have fallen 57 percent. Some city officials said
that St. Barnabas was on track to make a profit of 14 million to
$18 million.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Barnabas officials and Erazo said that the profit would
be far less than that. St. Barnabas officials have said that the
quality of care remained high and that they had added new types of
specialized care that reduced the need for hospital trips.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, city officials said Tuesday that the
district attorney's office had begun a preliminary investigation
into allegations that St. Barnabas used funds from the jail health
contract to pay the full salaries of St. Barnabas medical staff who
did not actually work on Rikers Island, or only worked there part
time.
</P>
<P>
   The new inquiry is part of a review by prosecutors of St.
Barnabas' handling of the contract that includes looking into
allegations that prisoners' medical charts have been tampered with
and medical supplies are in short supply in jail clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Geto, a spokesman for St. Barnabas, did not respond to a
call requesting comment Tuesday night.

 &HT;    All's Wells as Yankees win opener
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is there really any reason to go further? Why not
just call off the rest of the postseason, hand the Yankees the
trophy and start the vacation early.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 114 games in the regular season, the Yankees are
beginning to appear invulnerable, having ripped through their first
four playoff games after a 7-2 beating of the Indians Tuesday night
to open the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   This game, in front of 57,138 at Yankee Stadium, was over
shortly after Indians starter Jaret Wright took the mound. The
right-hander never made it out of the first inning. The Yankees
batted around, and when it was over they led by five runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have now scored 16 runs in the playoffs, allowing
just three in 36 innings, and it doesn't appear right now that the
Indians are going to put up much more of a fight than the Texas
Rangers did.
</P>
<P>
   What is becoming very apparent is the Yankees won 22 more games
than any other team in the American League for a reason. They are
simply very good, perhaps great, as they pursue their second world
title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Has any team run the table in the postseason, not lost a game,
since baseball went to divisional play in 1969? It has happened
just once, in 1976, when Cincinnati's Big Red Machine took three
straight from the Phillies and swept the Yankees in the World
Series. But the league championship had a best-of-5 format then,
and there was no division series round.
</P>
<P>
   This Yankee team has the ability to pull off such an October
sweep. Again Tuesday, they got super starting pitching from David
Wells, the portly left-hander who had a shutout until he gave up a
two-run homer to Manny Ramirez with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the New York offense has come to life. The first four
hitters in the order went a combined 4-for-42 against the Rangers
with Paul O'Neill getting four of those hits. But in the first
inning against Wright, they all opened with singles.
</P>
<P>
   So about the only suspense on this chilly night was whether the
wife of Darryl Strawberry would throw a strike when she delivered
the ceremonial first pitch. Strawberry, who underwent surgery to
remove a tumor from his colon, watched from a nearby hospital and
Charisse's throw bounced at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It was about the only thing that fell short for the Yankees.

   GAME 1: YANKEES 7, INDIANS 2
</P>
<P>
   _ TURNING POINT
</P>
<P>
   First inning. The Yankees opened with four straight hits off
Jaret Wright, scoring two runs. It was quite a contrast from the
previous series as the top of the lineup struggled in a three-game
sweep of the Rangers. The Yankees went on to score three more in
the inning, batting around as they sent 10 players to the plate.
The team batted around 36 times during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   _ GAME'S BEST
</P>
<P>
   Yankees left-hander David Wells threw 8 1/3 shutout innings and
has now allowed two runs _ both on Manny Ramirez's ninth-inning
homer Tuesday night _ in 16 1/3 postseason innings.
</P>
<P>
   _ PLAYING UP
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are now 4-0 in the postseason and have done little
wrong. But the Indians are not a club that typically opens a series
with a win. Of the last four postseason series wins, the Indians
have lost the first game, including last week's set to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   _ PLAYING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   A Yankee killer in the playoffs last year, Wright was horrible,
allowing five runs on five hits and not even getting out of the
first inning. His performance was the shortest outing for a
starting pitcher in an ALCS game since Kansas City's Dennis Leonard
failed to retire any of three batters when he faced the Yankees in
Game 5 in 1976. Wright has now allowed 11 runs in five innings in
two postseason starts. . . . Kenny Lofton certainly didn't help his
team, striking out on his first two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   _ WORST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   With Yankees at second and third in the first and two outs,
Wright had a chance to get out of the inning allowing just two
runs. But he let loose a wild pitch against Shane Spencer, bouncing
one past catcher Sandy Alomar, and a runner came home.
</P>
<P>
   _ AT THE PLATE
</P>
<P>
   Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter went 1-for-11 in the divisional
series but had hits on his first two at-bats Tuesday. . . . Yankees
catcher Jorge Posada hit the game's only home run, a solo shot in
the sixth. . . . Spencer, who homered in his first two postseason
games, didn't go deep on this night, going 0-for-x with a walk and
a run scored.
</P>
<P>
   _ ON THE MOUND
</P>
<P>
   Indians righthander Chad Ogea came on for Wright in the first
and tried to limit the damage, but gave up a run-scoring single to
Scott Brosius. ... The six singles the Yankees had in the first
inning were an ALCS record for any inning. ... Also, the five runs
scored in the first inning are the most to open an ALCS, surpassing
the old record of four. ... Jim Poole has nine lives, the Indians
reliever entering the game in the seventh. Poole was in the
playoffs last year with the Giants and he was the pitcher that gave
up the deciding home run to David Justice in Game 6 of the World
Series when the Braves and Indians met. They are now teammates.

   Justice, in left field for the Indians, saved a run in the
second with a sliding catch on a ball hit by Tino Martinez. ... In
the fourth, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter went to his right and
grabbed hard hit ball by Travis Fryman, throwing off his back foot
to get the out.

   The Indians reached second base just three times and didn't get
a runner to third. Their best chance to score off Wells came in the
seventh when they had runners at first and second and one out and
Wells fell behind 3-0 to Richie Sexson. But Wells came back and
struck out Sexson.
