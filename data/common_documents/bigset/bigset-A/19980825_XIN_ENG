<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has advised the general public to know and assert their
rights against corrupt government officials and encouraged them
to report cases of corruption to the inspectorate of government.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a speech read for him by the Minister of
the Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda at the opening of a three-day
regional ombudsman conference for west, south and eastern Africa
here Monday morning, Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>

countries can contribute to popular democracy if they execute
their work with impartiality, professionalism and courage.
</P>
<P>
The ombudsmen from more than 18 countries were urged to show a
common resolve to stamp out corruption, bad governance and lack
of accountability which led to siphoning out hard earned meager
resources by corrupt elements in the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the ombudsmen can play a vital role in
nurturing the young democracies in Africa to ensure justice is
guaranteed for all.
</P>

will compare notes on how to uproot corruption and dictatorship
from member countries.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Seek New Sanctions against Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The German government has decided
to seek new sanctions against Belgrade along with its European
Union partners in order to force an end to the conflict in
Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, a German government spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on the Kosovo situation on Monday, the German
cabinet expressed "extreme concern" over the escalation of
violence in Kosovo, and especially from the Yugoslav side, German
government spokesman Otto Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation worsened further, a military intervention
could become necessary," Hauser warned.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the German government had decided to seek
along with its EU partners a new package of sanctions against
Belgrade, which includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Freezing the bank accounts of all Yugoslav banks and
companies in which the Yugoslav state has a majority holding.
</P>
<P>
-- Introducing visa restrictions for Yugoslav businessmen and
travellers.
</P>
<P>
-- A ban on all Yugoslav airlines at airports in all EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening EU efforts to pass on information regarding
criminal actions in Kosovo to the International Court of Justice
for Yugoslavia in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
-- Monitoring Kosovo-Albanian associations in Germany to
prevent them from purchasing weapons with funds raised in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The world community must make it clear that they will not
tolerate the violence policy and will act with determination,"
said Hauser.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel would call for a special meeting of
EU foreign ministers to discuss the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Women Smokers More Likely to Suffer from Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Women smokers in the 35-64 age
group in many countries are more likely to suffer from heart
attacks, said the world Health Organization (WHO) in a press
release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Men are faring better while heart disease rates for women are
receding more slowly and the increasing numbers of daily smokers
in many countries do not augur well for the future, according to a
WHO study.
</P>
<P>
The WHO launched its MONICA Project in 1982 when investigators
from 38 centers in 21 countries started working together using
standardized methods to study trends in heart disease and
associated risk factors.
</P>
<P>
The finding is part of preliminary analysis of the final
10-year results of the largest collaborative study of heart
disease ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts revealed the results drawn from examining 150,000
heart attacks and 180,000 risk factor records at the European
Congress of Cardiology in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, the project generated an enormous amount of
high quality data which helps us to understand better the
relationship between trends in cardiovascular disease and major
risk factors," said Dr Ingrid Martin who is in charge of the
cardiovascular diseases program.
</P>
<P>
The WHO study has also found some good news: heart disease
rates are declining in general, with exceptions in some eastern
European countries and China.
</P>
<P>
At the present time, the study said, there is a much better
chance of surviving a heart attack than in the past, due to a
range of effective treatments.
</P>
<P>
The global death toll directly attributed to cardiovascular
disease is 15 million a year. Heart disease alone is responsible
for seven million deaths in the world each year.

The National Weather Service said Del Rio got a record 11.87 30
centimeters of rain on Sunday to accumulate a total of 37
centimeters in the month, surpassing the city's previous record
for the entire month of of 15.5 centimeters.

<HEADLINE> ILO, UNICEF Launch Program to Eliminate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
announced Monday the launching of a joint program entitled "Toward
the Elimination of Bonded Child Labor in Nepal."
</P>
<P>
The program will be implemented in nine of the 75 districts in
Nepal, where children are toiling as bonded labor in brick-kilns,
stonequarries, hotels, restaurants and carpet factories, the
Kathmandu office of ILO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Trade Unions in collaboration with the
Confederation of Italian Industry has raised over one million U.S.
dollars to support the efforts of ILO and UNICEF in eliminating
child labor in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, different components of the program will be
implemented by workers, employers and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) with the assistance of ILO and UNICEF, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the program aims to increase the capacity of
employers, workers and NGOs to prevent and combat child labor,
prevent bonded child labor, withdraw children from bonded labor
and provide them and their families with alternatives.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, ILO launched the international program on the
elimination of child labor to help the country build capacity to
address the problem of child labor, foster the development of an
effective partnership between government services, employers
organizations, trade unions, NGOs, universities and media, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that UNICEF's child protection program in Nepal will
concentrate for the coming four years on building societal concern
and responsibility for children especially in difficult
circumstances, and on measures at the family, community and other
levels to prevent child exploitation, abuse and neglect.

<P>
UNICEF
ill assist in providing educational opportunities for working
children and bonded child labor in Nepal, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, UNICEF will disseminate the findings of a national
situational analysis of child labor in Nepal and assist in the
formulation of policies and programs, it added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that child laborers in Nepal have doubled in
the past four years to one million.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have decided to eliminate
the evil of child labor from the region by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> 2 Foreign Journalists Detained in Congo Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign journalists detained
by border guards in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) last
week were released Monday, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Lara Santoro, an Italian working for the Christain Science
Monitor of the United States and New Zealander Hugh Nevill of
Agence France Presse (AFP), both based in Nairobi, Kenya were
released Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both Congolese and Zambian immigration officers at the
Kasumbalesa border post confirmed the freedom of the two
journalists in separate interviews with ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The immigration officers said that the Congolese border guards
did not find any credible offense to warrant continued
incarceration of the journalists.
</P>
<P>
After their release, Santoro and Nevill crossed the
Zambian-Congolese border into Zambia and joined their companion,
Odd Andersen, a Norwegian photo journalist also of AFP but based
in Johannesburg, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Andersen had remained behind on the Zambian side of the check
point when Santoro and Nevill sauntered to the Congolese side
where they were detained last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three intended to enter the troubled former Zaire to cover
the war situation in that country when some border guards pounced
on them.
</P>
<P>
Since conflicts broke out on August 2, Congolese officials are
said to be reluctant to allow foreign journalists to enter their
country on allegations of unfavorable coverage of the war
situation by foreign media.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Backs Egypt's Call for World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese opposition leader
expressed support Monday for the Egypt's call for an international
anti-terrorism conference to define principles and strategies in
regional and global terrorism fighting.
</P>
<P>
Sadeq Mahdi, head of the Sudanese opposition Ummah Party, made
the remarks here after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In its response to Thursday's U.S. missile attacks on what it
described as "terrorist-related" targets in Sudan and Afghanistan
following the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, Egypt on Friday renewed its call for an international
conference on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which did not openly condemned the U.S. attacks, said
Friday that terrorism should be dealt with within international
legitimacy and it does not approve any unilateral measure in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile flattened a pharmaceutical plant, which it
said was producing ingredients for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi along with other major Sudanese opposition leaders came
to Cairo early this month to attend a conference of the National
Democratic Alliance (NDA), the umbrella group of all Sudanese
opposition factions in the north and south.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has released a statement in Cairo, urging the
U.N. to send a fact-finding mission to determine whether the plant
was involved in terrorist activities as claimed by the U.S., or it
was a civil target as insisted by Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has disputes over border and other hanging issues
with Sudan, has changed its low-profile policy in Sudan's civil
war recently by hosting for the first time the NDA conference, for
fear that the escalating fighting in Sudan can lead to the
division of the country and affect the control of the Nile River,
the water source of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese People's Liberation Army has been fighting since
1983 for greater autonomy for the Christian and Animists in the
south from the Islamic north.
</P>
<P>
The war and the consequent famines have claimed over 1.5
million lives in the poor African country.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Strongly Condemns U.S. Bombing Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) condemned
Monday the U.S. missile attack against Sudan as an aggression
against an Arab country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution following an emergency meeting, the AL
Ministerial Council also pledged strong support for the Sudanese
government.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was held at the request of Sudan to seek
Arab support in its confrontation with the U.S., whose attack
flattened a pharmaceutical plant near Khartoum Thursday with the
claim that the factory produces ingredients for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials claimed the plant has link to Osama Bin Laden,
the Saudi billionaire it blames for the twin bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the council urged the U.S., as a permanent
Security Council member and a major superpower, to "show respect
for international legitimacy and refrain from such actions that
constitute an assault on sovereignty of a nation and instigate a
vicious cycle of violence and counter-violence to the detriment of
world peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The council also appealed to the international community to
stand firm against the use of force in solving problems between
countries.
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's air strike, Sudan has received strong backing
from some of Washington's staunch Middle East opponents, including
Iraq, Libya and Iran, which roundly condemned the U.S. military
raid. But some other Arab countries remained silent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Try Libyan Suspects in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Britain
and the Netherlands had agreed on a plan to set up a Scottish court
in the Hague to try two Libyan suspects charged for blowing a Pan
Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to go forward with a trial of the two
suspects before a Scottish court with Scottish judges applying
Scottish law" in the Netherlands, a third country, Albright told
reporters at a special briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We thank the Netherlands government for indicating its
willingness to host this proceeding," she added.
</P>
<P>
"After consultations with the Netherlands, we have concluded
that such a trial is indeed possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the step "is fully consistent with U.N.
Security Council resolution," calling it "a way to bring the
fugitives into court at long last."
</P>
<P>
The Pan Am bombing killed all 259 passengers and crew, and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. Among the dead were
189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
But Albright made no mention of the possibility of lifting the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position has been that the two Libyans should be
turned over to American or British authorities for trial, but
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has refused, saying the two men
would not receive a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government proposed in 1994 that the two men be
tried in a third country.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton confirmed in July that the United
States and Britain were considering the Libyan offer.
</P>
<P>
Now a compromise came after diplomatic maneuvering by the
Organization of African Unity, the Arab League and former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter. But Washington and London agreed on the
compromise only on the condition that the court be set up in a
third country with Scottish judges under the Scottish law.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook announced Monday that the British and U.S. governments had
agreed that the two Libyans accused of undertaking 1988 Lockerbie
bombing should be tried in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a statement issued here Monday afternoon that he
had spoken to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and asked Annan to
help in arranging the transfer of the two Libyans named Abdel
Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
</P>
<P>
Cook also made it clear: "As soon as they are handed over for
trial, we will support action in the (U.N.) Security Council to
suspend the international sanctions against Libya."
</P>
<P>
However, Cook noted that the trial, due to be held in The
Hague, would be "a Scottish court administering Scottish law under
Scottish procedures and Scottish rules of evidence."
</P>
<P>
This particular trial would be one without jury as it was not
practical to ask 15 ordinary citizens to spend many months in a
foreign country, cook added.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 people were killed when a Pan AM airliner exploded
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, and the
U.N. imposed international sanctions against Libya in 1992 after
the Libyan government refused to hand over the allled bombers.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Solution, Only Way Out for Congo Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy, Howard Wolpe, said here Monday that the U.S.
government has ruled out the possibility of resolving the crisis
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) militarily.
</P>
<P>
Wolpe said his government believes that political and
diplomatic solution is the only way out for the Congo crisis,
ruling out the possibility of resolving it in a military way.
</P>
<P>
"We desire to find a solution which will not make any country
in the region uneasy and in a way that it will help resolve the
internal issues in Democratic Congo, for instance, granting
citizenships to the (ethnic Tutsi) Banyamulunge and including all
political forces in the government," said the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
He added that the United States hopes such a solution will
delay or pre-empt a human catastrophe in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had talks with the
U.S. envoy, exchanging views on the developments in Congo crisis.
During the talks, Wolpe conveyed to President Dos Santos a letter
from U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed how to resolve the Congo crisis peacefully,
including the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country,"
the U.S. envoy noted.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press conference after the meeting, Wolpe
described his talks with the Angolan president as "positive and
constructive."

<HEADLINE> Nicosia Calls for National Unity to Solve Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides called for national unity in dealing with the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is unity among the political ranks to tackle
issues of national interests in the best possible manner,"
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides' appeal came amid calls by local politicians for
President Glafcos Clerides' resignation should the Russian
missiles the Cypriot government has contracted to buy can not be
deployed on the island as planned.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides is not abandoning his responsibilities,"
Kasoulides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the decision to deploy the missiles remains in
force unless there is sufficient progress toward a solution of the
Cyprus problem or moves leading to the demilitarization of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the north third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway state in
northern Cyprus in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia in January last year to buy
the surface-to-air S-300 missiles, which are expected to be
deployed on the island in November.
</P>
<P>
The deal has drawn strong protest from Turkey, which has
threatened to launch pre-emptive strikes if Cyprus insists on the
deployment of the missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks have been deadlocked since last
summer when Turkish Cypriots opted out of the negotiations to
protest against the European Union's decision to begin membership
talks with Cyprus, but not their close ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Athens talks between Clerides and Greek Premier
Costas Simitis Wednesday will deal with a possible postponement of
the missiles deployment, Kasoulides only said "we shall examine
defense and arms acquisition issues in general."

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges U.S. to Pressure Turkey Over Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday urged the U.S. to
pressure Turkey into withdrawing its American-made arms from
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his visiting Seychelles counterpart
Jeremy Bonnelame, Greek Foreig Minister Theodoros Pangalos said
that his country had presented specific proposals to Washington as
part of efforts for a Cyprus solution and once again called on
Washington to implement the concept of "U.S.legality" with regard
to Turkish arms in northern Cyprus which has been occupied by
Turkey since 1974.
</P>
<P>
He described it as "a matter of political will," saying that
the U.S. should persuade Ankara to withdraw its American-made arms
from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
As for the planned deployment of Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus, the minister stressed that
Turkey had become involved in the issue with threats and
irrational demands, but as far as Greece was concerned the issue
was never a substantial one in the overall Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The substance, he pointed out, was for intercommunnal talks in
Cyprus to restart so that the political problem could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Kosovo crisis, Pangalos said that he was
cautiously optimistic that the latest developments in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo could lead to a difusion of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Meets with Former Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin called on all members of the former government
to continue their duties till the formation of a new Cabinet, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with members of the former government here on Monday
afternoon, Chernomyrdin said that it is important for the people
working in the government to have a feeling of "state
responsibility," and this means to work instead of taking offense.
</P>
<P>
He told the former government members that he had met with his
predecessor Sergei Kiriyenko earlier on Monday and discussed with
him "all the issues concerning the activity of the government."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin confirmed that he asked the Duma deputies not to
discuss the stabilization program submitted by Sergei Kiriyenko's
government for the time being.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile stressed that he considered it important to
announce terms of restructuring government commitments on GKO
treasury bills at the shortest possible time as this action "is
badly needed and must not be delayed."
</P>
<P>
The priority of the tasks of the government at present, said
Chernomyrdin, is preservation of the banking system, on which in
many respects depends normal functioning of the state.
</P>
<P>
He noted that not all banks would possibly be able to sustain
the pressure of the present difficulties. "But we cannot allow to
lose the banking system as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was nominated by President Boris Yeltsin on Monday
as Prime Minister and is waiting for the Duma's confirmation to
the post.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin and his Cabinet were fired by Yeltsin five months
ago and received the appointment on conditions that he have full
personal control over the appointment of all government ministers.
</P>
<P>
He chaired the first government meeting held behind closed
doors on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Show Flexibility in Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
said on Monday that Israel is willing to show flexibility in the
talks with the Palestinians over the second redeployment of its
troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, David Bar-Illan, senior
adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stressed
that the ability of Israel to make concessions would "be found
out in the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that security is the main concern of
Israel, noting that a single digit withdrawal would endanger the
security interests of the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
He added that only after the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) fulfilled its commitments to fight terrorism, a progress
would be made in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office also confirmed on Monday that
Netanyahu is ready to consider a 13-percent further redeployment
but with certain conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been deadlocked since
March last year over Israeli's construction of Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem and the much-delayed second withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has formally accepted the U.S. peace proposal, which
calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank in the
next pullback. But Israel is demanding that it will retain full
security control over 3 of 13 percent area, which will be
designated a nature reserve.

BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The world largest PC computer
manufacturer Compaq said Monday that it has managed to increase
its market share in western Europe to 16.6 percent in the second
quarter of this year from 15 percent a year ago.

According to the U.S. company's European headquarters in

in 10 western European countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the company boosted its worldwide sales to 11.5
billion dollars in the first half of this year from 10.8 billion
dollars registered in the same period of last year, it still had
losses of 3.6 billion dollars which it attributed mainly to the
costs resulting from the takeover of Digital Equipment.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes U.S., U.K. Decision on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday said he welcomed a U.S.-UK decision to set up
a Scottish court in the Netherlands to try two Libyans accused of
blowing up a U.S. airline over Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was informed of the decision in Monday morning by
the U.S. and UK governments, said that he "is extremely pleased
with" the joint decision. Earlier Monday, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright announced the decision in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, in a press statement issued here via his
spokesman Fred Eckhard, also voiced his hope that "all sides
will cooperate in order to reach an early solution of this
long-standing issue."
</P>
<P>
The airline bombing, which took place over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed all 259 passengers and crew, and 11 people on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
Libya has long been locked in a dispute on where to try the two
Libyan suspects. The United States and Britain insisted on the use
of Scottish judges rather than an international panel. The
proposed court will be chaired by three Scottish high court judges
and the trial will proceed under normal Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain asked the U.N. chief to convey to
the Libyan Government a letter, which has elaborated the U.S. and
British proposal, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, currently on vocation in his home country Ghana, was
also asked "to provide to the Libyan Government any assistance it
might require with regard to the physical arrangements for the
transfer of the two accused directly to the Netherlands, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, the Secretary-General has been
following this issue very closely and has been in contact with
Governments of the United States, Britain and the Netherlands
and other interested parties, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Take Steps Facing Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir said here Monday that his government would take
necessary legal steps to counter potential U.S. strike on his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the Sudanese leader lashed out
at the United States for attacking a plant in north Khartoum that
produces human and veterinary medicines.
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. fighter planes attacked Al-Shifaa pharmaceutical
plant in the industrial zone in north Khartoum on Thursday night
and left it completely destroyed. The material losses amount to
100 million U.S. dollars apart from a number of casualties,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the plant is a terrorist-related factory
where chemical weapons were produced.
</P>
<P>
Western media circulated reports that the United States was
planning to launch another strike on an underground plant for
chemical weapons also in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
However, Al-Bashir did not go into details on what steps his
government would take.
</P>
<P>
He accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of trying to cover up
the alleged affairs with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has requested that the U.N. Security Council send a
fact-finding committee to investigate the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, the owner of the plant
and No.1 terrorist wanted by the U.S. for a series of terrorist
attacks, has no relation to the plant that the U.S. thought as a
terrorist base.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shifaa Company used to be owned by Ba-Aboud Co. for Trade
and Navigation which is registered with the Jeddah Chamber of
Commerce under relevant Saudi laws, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Bashir Hassan Bashir, a Sudanese national, used to own 60
percent of its shares till March, 1998. Then it moved to the hands
of the Sudanese businessman Salah Ahmed Idris, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996 in response
to a request from the United States. Laden left Sudan to
Afghanistan where he lives up till now.
</P>
<P>
The type of fighters that attacked the plant can not take off
from anywhere other than a neighboring country, he said, without
identifying the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa's denial of
rumors on the take-off of the U.S. fighters from Egyptian
territories, Bashir said "we hope that is true."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all the U.S. allegations and calculations were
untrue and baseless, citing the British and U.S. engineers who
took part in construction of the plant as saying that "the plant
is technically unable to produce chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
On the recent U.S.-Sudanese contacts, Al-Bashir said that the
U.S. welcomed the return to Washington of Sudanese Ambassador
Al-Fateh Bin-Orwa who was withdrawn following Thursday's attack.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the United States based its calculation
of the attacks on erroneous information from Sudanese opposition
elements who seek money by any means.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that if the plant were able to produce chemical
weapons, the strike on the plant would have caused a great
catastrophe. However, no one was affected by any gas although the
plant was at a residential zone, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He asked Clinton to apologize to the Sudanese people and
compensate the owners and workers of the plant.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls on Congo Rebels to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Defense Minister
Monday called on Congolese rebels to surrender as Zimbabwe has
positioned a strong force in defense of Congo capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over Zimbabwe state radio, Moven Mahachi said
Zimbabwean troops have stopped the Congolese rebels from marching
into Kinshasa and that around 600 Zimbabwean well-armed troops
have been deployed to curb their advance from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing left for them to do now is to surrender,"
Mahachi said, noting: "They did not want to engage us because
they knew that we are well trained. They did not want to
encounter a strong force."
</P>
<P>
Besides, news reaching here reported that Zimbabwe Monday
welcomed a regional call by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) for a cease-fire in Congo, but said it applies
only to the ethnic Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any efforts to get peace... but it is the rebels
who must stop fighting. We are there in the interests and defense
of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of
Congo," a top government official told reporters in Harare.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came just one day after a mini-summit of the
14-member SADC in Pretoria, South Africa called for a cease-fire
and a standstill of troops in Congo, where President Laurent
Kabila is facing a Tutsi-led rebellion from the west and east of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila did not attend the summit but sent two ministers.
Zimbabwe sent only a Pretoria-based diplomat and Angola boycotted
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Kabila blames Rwanda and Uganda for invading to back the
rebellion but the two deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
Congolese government and rebel sources said the Angolans had
taken the western garrison town of Kitona and had moved on to
take Banana and Boma on the road to Kinshasa.

OTTAWA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Monday that
Canada will support the constructive movement towards democracy in

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Lack of a well-developed
telecommunication infrastructure is affecting the efficiency of
all social and business interactions, thus hindering the
development of the country, a Ugandan minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, the minister of works, housing and
communications, said this here when opening the Second African
Regional Workshop on Communications, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Movements of people over large distances, usually at a high
cost of time and transport, result in low efficiency, Nasasira
asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government will try to ensure all social members
can have easy access to good telecommunications so as to
facilitate industrialization and economic progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the information age, development of telecommunications is
of paramount importance for most African countries, the Ugandan
minister said, adding that effective and continued development
can only be achieved with the concerted efforts of the private
sector, training institutions and professional associations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Oil Sanctions if Libya Withholds Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
press for international oil sanctions against Libya if it failed to
hand over two men charged for the bombing of a Pan Am flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, a senior U.S. official said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat came after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced earlier on Monday that Washington and Britain
agreed under the agreement of the Netherlands to set up a court
in the Hague with Scottish judges applying Scottish law for a
trial of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
If Libya turned down the offer by the United States and
Britain, "We think we are capable of building a much stronger
international consensus around further steps that must be
taken," said the senior official, asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a special briefing that the United States and
Britain "have decided to go forward with Scottish judges
applying Scottish law" in the Netherlands for the trial of the
two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
"America is determined to see that the perpetrators of
terrorism are brought to account," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Albright "made it very clear that
she is obviously extremely interested and supportive of moving
on, particularly in the direction of oil sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The United States has banned American imports of Libyan oil,
but has so far been unable to persuade other countries to follow
suit. The official said if Libya failed to come to terms with
the United States and Britain, he believed other countries would
now be more willing to join in the ranks with the United States
and Britain in imposing oil sanctions against Libya.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Hopes Pakistan to Help Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Monday expressed the hope that the Pakistani government
would use its influence to persuade the Afghan Taliban militia to
release the captured Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Pakistani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Sidique Khan Kanju, Khatami said there is no
doubt that the Iranian diplomats are in hands of the Taliban and
Iran will never remain indifferent toward the fate of the
Iranians, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"We decisively expect our friends in Pakistan to inform us of
the fate of the Iranian captives" and "to make the
Taliban ...immediately release them all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that the Taliban forces kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA reporter earlier this month when the
fundamentalist group seized the northern town of Mazari Sharif,
the main stronghold of the Iran-backed opposition. However,
Taliban denied the capture.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president expressed concern that outside hands are
at work to hindering improvement of situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint enemies of Iran and Pakistan have a role
in this crisis by perpetrating provocative acts. He expressed the
hope that the officials of the two countries would overcome the
crisis through wisdom and vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Khatami called on Pakistan, a strong supporter of the Taliban,
to launch satisfactory efforts in this respect and said "our
friendship is very fundamental and has not been gained at a low
price."
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the malignant factors" are working hard to
disrupt the friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said he believes that the Taliban's rule
over Afghanistan would be a shaky one and constantly prone to
attacks by other ethnic groups and would create problems for
Pakistan in the long run.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kanju handed over a message from Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Khatami and said the Pakistani
government and nation would spare no effort to alleviate the
anxiety in the region and help release the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani official arrived here Sunday night and held
talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi who expressed
dissatisfaction with Islamabad's performance over the issue of
captured Iranians. Kanju has left Tehran for home.

<HEADLINE> CIS Countries on Dismissal of Russian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed the government headed by Sergei Kiriyenko and named
former premier Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting Prime Minister last
Sunday, to which many member-states of the Commonwealth of
Independent States made responses.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze expressed hope that the Russian president's
decision would enhance stability in Russia. "For Georgia the most
important thing is that Russia preserve and strengthen its
stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik president's press secretary Zafar Saidov told Tass
that Yeltsin's decision is an "entirely internal affair of Russia,
it will in no way affect the traditionally friendly relations
between our countries."
</P>
<P>
The Kirgiz president's press secretary Kanybek Imanaliyev also
told a briefing on Monday that the Russian government's
resignation is Russia's internal affair, that everything that
happens in Russia is important for them.
</P>
<P>
In Minsk, Ivan Korotchenya, first deputy executive secretary of
the commonwealth, expressed confidence that "Viktor Chernomyrdin's
return to the Russian government will boost the structural reform
to the CIS."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that Chernomyrdin's reappointment would
help restore the weakened ties between the CIS and the Russia
government.
</P>
<P>
Moldavian President petru Luchinschi expressed hope that
"Chernomyrdin's experience and influence will overcome the severe
financial crisis that hit the Russian Federation this Summer."
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus' spokeswoman said the
replacement of the Russian government "will not impair the
developing good-neighborly relations" between the two countries,
that the new Russian government headed by experienced politician
Chernomyrdin will succeed in rescuing the country from the current
economic and financial difficulties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Effort on Cyprus to Continue: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Cyprus
Kenneth Brill, assured Cyprus Monday that Washington will continue
its efforts for a settlement to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, Brill
said "we will continue to work on all the issues that relate to
Cyprus and ways to make progress."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed a report that the U.S. efforts on Cyprus have
reached a dead end, noting "there are opportunities to find
constructive ways."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks have been stalled since last
summer when Turkish Cypriots walked out of the negotiations to
protest against a European Union (EU) decision to start accession
talks with Cyprus, but not their strong supporter Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said that he will not
return to the talks unless his self-styled regime is
internationally recognized and Cyprus withdraws its application
for an EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke and State
Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller have
failed to convince the two sides to go back to negotiating table
during their shuttle over the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Grain Output to Exceed 1.9M Tons: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Ministry of
Agriculture and Fishery has predicted that the grain output in
the country in 1998/99 will reach 1.936 million tons, a 15
percent increase against 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made at the three-day meeting of the third
Coordination Council of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery
which ended Saturday in suburban Maputo, the Noticias newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The council said the output of maize in 1998/99 will go up by
25 percent over the previous year's to 1.405 million tons while
that of rice will increase by 13 percent to 215,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The output growth of these two crops has been attributed to an
expansion of planting acreage by 468,000 hectares to 2.432
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
However, the output of sorghum and millet will decrease by 17
percent and four percent respectively, said the agriculture
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that the output of sorghum will drop
from 318,000 tons in 1997/98 to 265,000 tons due to the decreased
planting acreage and that the millet output will be only 51,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
For the harvest year 1998/99, the ministry also forecast that
the output of peanuts will go up by 62 percent, reaching 231,000
tons thanks to the increase of planting acreage.
</P>
<P>
Beans will witness an increase of 23 percent, topping 234,000
tons while the output of cassava will also go up by 23 percent,
harvesting 6.934 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the total planting acreage in the
country next year will be 4.833 million hectares, a one-third
rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican National Bureau of Agriculture has decided to
carry out a supplementary plan for maize and rice planting.
</P>
<P>
In line with the plan, some high quality seeds of maize and
rice will be chosen for use throughout the country according to
the conditions of soil, climate and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Remains Opposed to S-300 Missiles' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Cyprus David Madden Monday expressed the hope that the
Russian-made S-300 missile system ordered by the Cypriot
government will not be deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides, Madden said "we are hoping that conditions will be such
that the S-300 does not need to come to the island of Cyprus. That
is what we are working for."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the surface-to-air S-300
missiles from Russia in January 1997 in a bid to boost the
country's air defense as against a possible Turkish offensive. The
missiles are scheduled to be delivered and deployed in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal has sparked strong protests from Turkey, which has
vowed to block the delivery of the missiles and threatened to
launch preemptive strikes if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat said there are various ways of achieving
the cancellation of the deployment of the missiles, noting that
"the question of a moratorium is still very much on the agenda and
we will see what progress can be made on that."
</P>
<P>
"If progress can't be made on that, we will try to make
progress in other areas as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has put forward a proposal for a moratorium of
flights by Greek and Turkish military planes over Cyprus, but
Turkey has rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has said it will agree to the creation
of a no-fly zone over the island, provided there are sufficient
international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, claiming to
protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities, who unilaterally declared
in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Immediate Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Monday adopted a presidential statement, calling for "an
immediate ceasefire" in Kosovo, and urging all parties concerned
to strive for a political solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement also urged the authorities of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leader to
"enter immediately into a meaningful dialogue" to find a
negotiated political solution to the issue of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council said in the statement that it
welcomed the announcement of the formation of a negotiating team
to represent the interests of the Kosovo Albanian community,
saying that the establishment of such a panel should be conducive
to the early commencement of a substantial dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted the presidential
statement as efforts are being made to bring the two parties to a
negotiation table. On August 18, the talks did not kick off as
scheduled after the Kosovo Albanian team failed to turn up in the
venue.
</P>
<P>
The statement was adopted after the Security Council discussed
a report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the issue of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The report, the fourth one by the U.N. chief since the conflict
broke out in February, said that the situation in Kosovo was
worsened in July by the failure of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians to begin serious talks on the
future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost province, has
recently been intensified and resulted in an increase of refugees
and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
With the onset of the Balkan Winter, the situation of Kosovo
refugees "has the potential to become an even greater
humannitarian disaster," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians made up 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, which has an area of 10,000 square kilometers and a
population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, the conflict in Kosovo has caused
more than 500 deaths and created about 200,000 displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Cooking Gas Price Soars in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The price of cooking gas has more
than doubled in the last one month in Nigeria, just as acute
shortage of fuel and other petroleum products began to ease.
</P>
<P>
Investigations found that a 12.5-kilogram-cylinder of cooking
gas is now sold between 1,200 to 1,500 Naira (one U.S. Dollar
equals to about 85 Naira), compared with about 6,00 Naira a month
ago, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Retailers and energy industry analysts have attributed the
high price to poor supply from the refineries.
</P>
<P>
"It is not our fault, we don't readily get gas to buy and when
we get we pay highly, and have to make our own profit," Emeka
Agu, a retailer was quoted by the NAN as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a top African oil producer with a daily crude oil
output of about two million barrels, has been suffering from
persistent fuel shortage in the last few years, due to ailing
refineries.
</P>
<P>
The country's four refineries are either shut or not
functioning properly and consequently have not been producing
enough petroleum products, forcing the government to resort to
massive imports.
</P>
<P>
The latest fuel shortage which started several months ago is
only beginning to ease in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
A ray of hope is now in sight as it has been announced the
110,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Kaduna will resume normal
operation in early September after a major repair carried out by
the French oil firm Totol.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Discusses Iraqi Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Support for diplomatic
efforts to solve the U.N.-Iraq standoff on arms inspections is
still dominating the Security Council while the United States is
trying to exert more pressure on Iraq for it to comply with U.N.
resolutions, diplomatic sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the council's informal consultations after the briefing of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy to Iraq Prakash Shah,
many council members, such as China, France, Brazil and others,
expressed their view that Annan's initiatives are worth
considering or being put into action, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They stood behind Annan's ideas for a comprehensive review of
the Iraqi issue since sanctions were imposed on Iraq because of
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, by engaging Iraq more closely to
find ways of solving its differences with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang noted
that there can be no other solutions to the Iraqi issue except
through dialogue and negotiations. China has been backing Annan's
and others' diplomatic efforts in finding solutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain are mulling a draft
council resolution calling on Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, warning that if Iraq fails to call off the suspension
of cooperation, the Security Council would be urged to stop the
periodic review of sanctions on Iraq, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This may represent a step further toward prolonging the
eight-year sanctions, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions won't be lifted until the council is convinced
that Iraq has no longer long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM,
U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, requesting a
restructure of UNSCOM to reduce what it calls the American
influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq charges that the U.S. is using the arms inspection to
prolong sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
"Unless this restructuring takes place, Iraq finds it very
difficult, almost impossible, to keep any meaningful cooperation
with UNSCOM," said Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council sees the Iraqi suspension of cooperation
as totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Shah's latest meetings with Iraqi Deputy prime Minister Tariq
Aziz did not change Iraq's position.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after today's briefing: "Basically, they (the
Iraqis) felt that since I had come there only with a message (for
them) to comply (with U.N. resolutions) and that I had no
proposals to negotiate with them, they had no reason to change the
decision taken August 5th."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Islamic Activists Protest U.S. Attacks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of Israeli Islamic
activists demonstrated Monday in front of the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv to protest against the U.S. missile strikes against Sudan and
Afghanistan, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters shouted anti-U.S. slogans, criticizing the
U.S. administration for authorizing the cruise missile strikes at
the so-called terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. administration has no right to conduct missile
strikes against other countries because all these strikes are
aimed at killing the innocent people," the Radio quoted the
protesters as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said Monday's demonstration was of small scale because
the police only allowed 50 demonstrators to present at the
U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we just want to tell the United States that there will
be no way for it to carry out more missile strikes against the
innocent people," a protester was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel since Monday tightened security at Ben Gurion
International Airport and other strategic sites for fear of
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
This measure was taken after receiving warnings that certain
Islamic groups are planning to target U.S. and Israeli airports
and other strategic places, including bombing foreign airlines in
Israel, in retaliation against U.S. missile attacks on Sudan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the U.S. conducted cruise missiles strikes at
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan that the U.S. believed to have
been the terrorist basis involved in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa early this month.
</P>
<P>
Israel is one of the countries voiced strong support to the
U.S. air strikes. But most of the Arab and Islamic countries,
including Palestine, termed the air strikes as provocative action
against the Muslims.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's blue chips witnessed
their first rally in 10 days Monday amid thin trading as the
market awaited the terms of a conversion plan for the
ruble-denominated GKO Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
A change of government had little effect on the stock market
except that shares of Gazprom shot up 24.2 percent on news that
its former head, Viktor Chernomyrdin, had been reinstated as the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the RTS-Interfax Composite Index rose 6.3 percent at
23.11 on Friday's close. The narrower RTS1-Interfax Index, which
does not include Gazprom, inched up 4.73 percent at 85.63.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Securities Commission twice suspended trading on
the Moscow Stock Exchange as Gazprom prices soared.
</P>
<P>
However, the slim volume of trading, at a mere 760,000, was too
low to consolidate the price rises, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Trading System, volume as of 17:00
local time (13:00 GMT) stood at only 4.28 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prices ended the day up 3 percent from Friday's close for
Unified Energy Systems at 0.053/0.055 dollar on volume of 20.72

volume of 485,000 shares. Moscow power utility Mosenergo was up
1.5 percent at 0.029/0.025 dollar on volume of 12.6 million. Share
price for Russian long-distance carrier Rostelecom rose 12.5

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Condemns U.S. Attacks in Sudan, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei condemned on Monday the recent U.S. missile attacks
in Sudan and Afghanistan, terming the attacks as an explicit
example of state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iranian cabinet members on the occasion of the
Government Week, Khamenei said that what happened in Sudan and
Afghanistan last Thursday is unacceptable to the peoples of the
world.
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable that a government relying on its military
might attacks another country and kills the defenseless people,
the official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei termed the U.S. missile attacks as a criminal act,
saying that they are as much condemnable as the bombings of
U.S. embassies Tanzania and Kenya on August 7 in which at least
250 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday night on a factory
in Sudan and several bases of the Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden
in Afghanistan which were believed to have links with the August 7
terrorist bombings.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Stresses Need to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed
concern Monday over the recent terrorist events and stressed the
need to fight terrorism within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet, during a session chaired by First Deputy
Prime Minister Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, condemned all
forms of terrorism and emphasized that all international legal
measures should be taken to combat terrorism and confront those
who harbor terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted Information Minister Fuad Bin
Abdel-Salam Bin Mohammed Faresi as saying after the meeting that
"although the Kingdom condemns the recent bombings of American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, it still believes that the sole
way to combat terrorism should be by means of international action
within the framework of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Riyadh holds that such action within the framework of the
United Nations ensures eradication of terrorism, strengthens
security and stability of the communities and safeguards
sovereignty of states," said Faresi.
</P>
<P>
This came after the U.S. launched missile attacks last Thursday
on what it termed as "terrorist-related" targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were in retaliation for the twin bombings in the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam on August 7, in which
more than 260 people were killed, including 12 Americans, and more
than 5,000 others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bonnie Churning Toward U.S. East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- As Hurricane Bonnie was
churning up in the Atlantic with 185 kph winds, people in the East
Coast of the United States are busying on preparation for the
worst.
</P>
<P>
From Florida to North Carolina, local residents are stocking up
on emergency supplies while the governor of South Carolina, David
Beasley, called on 1,000 National Guard to get ready for Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center reported the 720-kilometer-wide
storm was 1,040 kilometers southeast of Savannah, Georgia, at 2
p.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane has been wobbling northwest. The center said a
hurricane watch may be issued for part of the southeastern U.S.
coast later Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear exactly where, when or even if Hurricane
Bonnie would strike the U.S. mainland. But the hurricane center
officials said it could be as far west as northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
Two weather computer models indicated the hurricane could move
slowly northwest toward Georgia or South Carolina, but another
predicted the hurricane would pass 160 kilometers off North
Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
However, hurricane-force winds extended 135 kilometers out from
Bonnie's center and tropical storm force winds could be felt 360
kilometers out.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic basin typically has nine tropical storms each
year, with six of them becoming hurricanes. In 1997, there were
seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense hurricane.

BRUSSELS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has decided to
host the trial of the two Libyans suspected of the Lockerbie
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch council of ministers made the decision on Monday to
cooperate with the United States and Britain to serve as the
third-country trial host, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a letter sent to the Dutch
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The trial will be held in a place to be decided later by a
Scottish court and in accordance with the Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the council of ministers was the first step
toward making it possible to have the trial held in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has to give its go-ahead
and Libya has to cooperate as well before the trial can really
take place in the country that is already the host of the
International Court of Justice, the International War Crimes
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and will soon host the
International Criminal Court.
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday condemned a blast in Zugdidi, western
Georgia, as an act perpetrated by the country's enemies.
</P>
<P>
A bomb with some five kilograms of explosives was detonated in
the building of the Zugdidi city administration earlier Sunday,
killing a woman and a two-year-old child and wounding 34 others,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the blast, "masterminded and executed by the
enemies of Georgia", could not alter "the Georgian people's
determination to build an independent and democratic state."
</P>
<P>
In a special statement distributed by his press service,
Shevardnadze said investigators would try to find out from which
side of the Inguri river the perpetrators had come.
</P>
<P>
The river divides the Zugdidi region and Georgia's breakaway
republic of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic's minister of state Vazha
Lordkipanidze, who arrived in Zugdidi Monday afternoon, said the
explosion was apparently aimed to destabilizing the situation in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Security Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze, Interior Minister Kakha
Targamdze and Health Minister Avtandil Dzhorbinadze were also
heading for Zugdidi to address the situation, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Work On Memory Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Neuroscientists at Harvard
and Stanford universities have identified for the first time
specific parts of the brain that play a key role in determining
what we remember and what we forget.
</P>
<P>
The scientists reported their findings in the August 21 Science
that they asked volunteers to view words or photographs and
watched what was happening in their brains. When certain parts
of their brains -- the prefrontal lobes and the parahippocampal
cortex -- were most active, the subjects were much more likely
to remember what they had seen or read.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile scientists at University of California in Irvine
have found a clue to why memory can fail during stressful moments.
</P>
<P>
24 hours after training laboratory rats to find a platform in
a tank of water, the scientists stressed the rodents by applying
small jolts to their feet. When the rats where placed in the
tank again 30 minutes later, they swam around randomly and could
not retrieve the memory of where the platform was located.
</P>
<P>
They found in rats levels of the hormone corticosterone peak
about 30 minutes after a stressful incident. The rats were able
to find the platform if two minutes or four hours had passed
after the stress-inducing shock. Rats injected with the hormone
also forgot how to find the target. However rats that were
stressed but given a drug to block corticosterone did fine.
</P>
<P>
Now the U.S. scientists are conducting similar experiments in
humans, who release a similar hormone--cortisol during stress.

<HEADLINE> Panel of Judges Rules Census Bureau can't Use Sampling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- In a victory for
congressional Republicans, a federal court panel Monday ruled that
the government cannot use statistical sampling to help count
Americans in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
The nation's founding fathers really meant it when they said
America must have "actual enumeration" of its populace, and a
modern statistical tool called "sampling" is not an acceptable
substitute, the three judges said in a unanimous ruling.
</P>
<P>
The 71-page opinion puts a stop to Census sampling, which is
favored by the Clinton administration, and means the delicate
issue of how Americans are counted will likely head to the Supreme
Court this fall.
</P>
<P>
"The use of statistical sampling to determine the population
for purposes of apportioning representatives in Congress among the
states violates the Census Act," the judges ruled.
</P>
<P>
The count, conducted every 10 years, is the basis for drawing
the boundary lines for congressional districts and other elected
offices and in determining how 180 billion dollars in federal
money is distributed.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration and congressional Democrats defended
the Census Bureau plan to use statistical sampling to reduce the
undercount of hard-to-reach minorities and the poor, often in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who control Congress, said in their suit that the
plan was flawed and violated the Constitution's requirement for an
"actual enumeration." They also argued that Democrats would use
sampling for political gain.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and lawyers for the House argued in June
before a special panel of Appeals Court Judge Douglas Ginsburg and
District Court Judges Royce Lamberth and Ricardo Urbina -- two
Reagan appointees and one Clinton appointee.
</P>
<P>
The unusual combination of appellate and district judges was
created to put the lawsuit by one branch of government against
another on the fast track to the Supreme Court by removing the
intermediate step of review by a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
At the Justice Department, spokeswoman Chris Watney said
lawyers have 10 days to decide whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., argued during debate in
Congress earlier this month that Americans should not have to
"rely on politicians controlling pollsters to invent virtual
people to get a grossly inaccurate count on behalf of some
political party."

WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people were
killed in South Texas and Mexico in flood that was caused by the
remnants of Tropical Storm Charley that also washed away blocks of
homes in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Also as many as 30 other people were reported missing Monday in
Del Rio, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Entire neighborhoods of the Texas border town of 34,000 were
submerged after a 24-hour heavy rain, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Governor George W. Bush ordered 150 National Guardsmen, 25
trucks and nine Blackhawk helicopters to join the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Two deaths were reported in flooding in Del Rio Monday and at
least four people, including two children, were killed Sunday when
a pickup truck was swept into a creek in Real County about 160
kilometers northwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
A 65-year-old man died Sunday of a heart attack while being
evacuated because of rising water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine people were reported dead in neighboring Ciudad
Acuna, Mexico, after they were washed away while trying to cross a
normally dry gully holding a rope.
</P>
<P>
In Del Rio, law enforcement agencies closed nearly every
highway leading into the town about 230 kilometers west of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods around the flooded creeks were submerged, and two
or three blocks of homes were washed away along with several
mobile homes. Hundreds of people were evacuated to shelters.

MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said Monday that President Boris Yeltsin will step down
within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He told the local Ekho Moskvy radio Monday evening that Yeltsin
would have to resign "on health grounds", the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
His prediction came one day after Yeltsin sacked the government
of Sergei Kiriyenko and reinstated former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin as interim premier.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin formally nominated Chernomyrdin as prime minister
Monday morning and urged the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, to expeditely approve the nomination.
</P>
<P>
However, Zyuganov said his Communist faction would not vote for
Chernomyrdin's approval if it was not sure that the new government
would be subordinate to parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Zyuganov and leaders of two other opposition
factions called for subordinating the executive branch to the
country's Federal Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, they said the new system should provide
"guarantees against the presidential structures meddling in the
work of the government".

<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Angola Monday confirmed it has
sent troops to Democratic Congo to assist President Laurent
Kabila in fighting off attacks by ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge
soldiers who rebelled on August 2, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan government announces that it is backing a
decision taken by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to provide military support to the government of Laurent
Kabila," the state radio broadcast in a news bulletin in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
It said Angola "is participating in this effort so that we can
find a political solution which will put an end to the Congolese
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Luanda has reportedly sent 1,000-strong troops with tanks,
armored vehicles and fighter jets to Congo to join the battle in
defending the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Angola's Cabinda enclave Monday reported heavy
troops movements across the border into Congo and the return of
wounded men.
</P>
<P>
Congolese government and Rebels sources said the Angolans had
taken the western garrison town of Kitona and had moved on to
take Banana and Boma on the road to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Angola has come out officially to
confirm its military involvement in the Congolese conflict after
Zimbabwe whose officials admitted earlier that around 600
Zimbabwean soldiers are now in Kinshasa to help Kabila combat the
Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
During Kabila's armed struggle against late dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko, the Angolan government had sent an army of some 5,000
men to help him. Angola and Congo (K) had signed an agreement on
security and defense.
</P>
<P>
Angola and Congo share over 1.000 kilometers of border. Mobutu
offered Angola's rebel movement UNITA help and allowed it to set
up military bases on its land.

CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday urged Islamic states to counter the acts of terrorism and
extremism which are under the guise of Islam.

"There is a yawning gap between Islam as a religion of

Quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Mubarak also
criticized "some Western forces" for launching "smear campaigns"

<HEADLINE> IBM Develops New Encryption System to Protect Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Mathematicians at IBM Zurich
Research Laboratory and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) announced Monday that they have co-developed a new
public-key cryptosystem that provides the first practical and
mathematically proven way to secure information from even the most
aggressive Internet hacking attempts.
</P>
<P>
The new Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem, which is being revealed on
the same day at the Crypto'98 conference at the University of
California-Santa Barbara, effectively closes the backdoor on
so-called "active" attacks.
</P>
<P>
All current commercially available cryptosystems are
potentially vulnerable to active attacks, which are considered to
be the most dangerous hacking attempts any cryptosystem might
face, IBM said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we nip this type of powerful attack in the
bud," said Victor Shoup of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory, who
invented the new cryptosystem with Ronald Cramer for the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology (ETH).
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this year, an active attack decoded information
secured by the most widely used encryption system for Web
browsers. Our system will prevent this from happening," he said.
</P>
<P>
IBM plans to incorporate the new system into a future version
of its Vault Registry software, the IBM SecureWay public-key
infrastructure product that allows e-commerce transactions to
travel across organizational boundaries in a private, secure
manner.
</P>
<P>
"Active" attacks bypass the difficulty of solving the
underlying mathematical problem by sending a series of cleverly
constructed messages to a publicly accessible server.
</P>
<P>
By analyzing the server's pattern of responses to the bogus
text, an attacker can decode encrypted messages passing through
that network. The Cramer-Shoup method thwarts these attacks by
delivering the first non-malleable cryptosystem efficient enough
for commercial use.

ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Alpine skiing veteran
Alberto Tomba will announce whether he would retire from the
sport in a press conference next month, the ANSA news agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tomba, who won the 50th World Cup race of his career in last
season's final slalom at Crans Montana, is going to be training
for two weeks on the high altitude snows of the Chilean Andes,
Tomba's personal trainer Flavio Roda said.
</P>
<P>
A decision on what to tell the press conference should emerge
from how the training session goes.
</P>
<P>
Roda said Tomba was still maintaining top form, having
work-outs in the gym and open air.
</P>
<P>
"Physically, he's in great shape; he's lean and fit," said
Roda.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tomba got back from Helsinki where he joined Ruud
Gullitt, Marco van Basten and other top sports stars in a charity
golf tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin has set as top priority for the Russian
government the removal of the negative influence of the world
financial crisis on the economy of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the newspaper, Komsomolskaya
Pravda, on Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said the government would take
measures to prevent the world financial crisis from affecting the
country's economy and people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating his plans, Chernomyrdin emphasized two priorities,
the protection of social interests and the payment of wages and
pensions. Another was the drawing up of a state industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, monetary measures could not overcome Russia's
hardship.
</P>
<P>
Appraising the work of the previous cabinet, the acting prime
minister said he very much appreciated its measures to obtain
income tax by different approaches.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the future line-up of his
government, Chernomyrdin said: "The Kiriyenko government included
fine professionals, some of whom worked with me. Those who want to
work, and, the main thing, can work, will stay on."
</P>
<P>
He said he was ready to hold consultations with "anyone who had
any sound ideas".
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed as the acting prime minister of
Russia by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who sacked the entire
cabinet led by Sergei Kiriyenko on Sunday.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan welcomed Tuesday the
U.S. willingness to talk to Taliban on issues related to
terrorism, saying "it is important to engage the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive development," Pakistan's special envoy on
Afghanistan and acting Foreign Office spokesman Iftikhar Murshida
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to engage the Taliban and not isolate them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the U.S. embassy earlier quoted State
Department sources as saying that Washington is interested in
talking to the Taliban about exiled Saudi Ossama bin Laden and
"other international terrorist threats."
</P>
<P>
Islamabad had expressed its "indignation" at the U.S. attack
last Thursday on alleged terrorist bases in eastern Afghanistan,
close to the Pakistani border, stressing that a peaceful course
should be followed to tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also made a move to the U.N. Security Council in
protest against the landing of a U.S. cruise missile in a remote
part of Balochistan and the violation of its air space. The
missile remained unexploded.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors implanted an
artificial lens onto the left eye of a Tibetan farmer at Lhasa's
People's Hospital this afternoon and the patient is expected to
recover his eyesight gradually, according to the doctor who did
the operation.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very happy when I think that I will be able to see
things tomorrow," the Tibetan patient, whose name is Aqiong, said.
</P>
<P>
Aqiong, who lives on the outskirts of Lhasa, the capital of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, was the first person to benefit from a
sight recovery program sponsored by the China Disabled Persons'
Federation and Lion's Club International.
</P>
<P>
The program, "China Sight First Operation", is the largest
program of its kind in China and some 1,000 Tibetan cataract
sufferers are expected to benefit from the operations they will
receive free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is reported to have the largest number of cataract
sufferers in the world because of the intensity of its sunlight at
that altitude.
</P>
<P>
The doctors will also go to 3 other Tibetan towns, according to
Wang Chengquan, vice president of the federation and head of the
medical team.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 residents and
visitors were ordered to evacuate North Carolina's low-lying Outer
Banks Tuesday as Hurricane Bonnie churned towards the East Coast
of the United States, the Associated Press reported Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service forecast that Bonnie's center will
be near the Outer Banks by Wednesday afternoon. By mid-morning
Tuesday, the storm's eye was centered about 720 kilometers south
of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Even when the storm was still hundreds of kilometers away,
three meter waves were already reported on the North Carolina
beach. Surf hit the New Jersey shore in breakers one to two meters
high.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane warnings were posted from the south edge of the
coastal areas in South Carolina to the North Carolina-Virginia
state line, telling local residents that dangerous winds and heavy
rain could hit the area within 24 hours. Hurricane watches
extended south to Savannah, Georgia, and north to Cape Henlopen,
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
Before the hurricane warnings were posted for North Carolina,
South Carolina Governor David Beasley had already told 1,000 of
his state's National Guardsmen to get ready. Officials estimated
there were 125,000 tourists in the state's beach towns.
</P>
<P>
People along the East Coast were buying emergency
supplies. Plywood, batteries and gas cans were hot items at Bame
Ace Hardware in Carolina Beach, North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urges India to Stop Deporting "Indian Citizens" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh on Tuesday formally
requested India to stop pushing Bengali-speaking "Indian citizens"
into Bangladesh in the interest of the two countries, the official
new agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted "a competent source" of the Foreign
Ministry as saying that India made a series of attempts in the
last eight days to push what India called "illegal Bangladeshi
nationals" into the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government of India has been requested to take necessary
action to stop such attempts of pushing Indian citizens into
Bangladeshi territory in the mutual interest of both the
governments," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Deb Mukharji was
summoned to the Foreign Ministry Tuesday afternoon and conveyed of
the message.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman, while delivering the
message to Mukharji, said the Bangladeshi government feels that
the attempts to push "Indian citizens" into Bangladesh are "likely
to affect the excellent relations so happily existing between the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said India's Border Security Forces (BSF) began to push
"Indian citizens" into Bangladeshi territory at least through four
points since early last week.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Ministry has got information that a group
of 60-70 people had been kept at a temporary camp near the border.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad, when contacted by the news
agency, reiterated Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's assertion that
"no Bangladeshi nationals are staying illegally in India."
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue the present excellent relations with
India," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded in resolving many outstanding issues with
India in the spirit of cooperation and understanding," he said,
adding that the two sides should avoid issues that might create
misunderstanding.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaria spread in 14 central and
central highland provinces of Vietnam in the first seven months
this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of malaria patients and deaths increased by 5.71
percent and 14.9 percent respectively in these provinces.
</P>
<P>
Seven of 14 provinces in the region saw rapid increases in the
number of malaria patients, and 54 deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
32 villages in seven communes of Tra My district of Quang Nam
province had outbreaks of malaria, with 15,000 people infected.
</P>
<P>
The worsening epidemic is attributed to neglect of prevention
measures against the deadly disease. Unseasonably warm weather,
which caused the rapid development of mosquito sectors, low
standards of living, limited awareness of malaria and a weak
health care network were other factors to blame.
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, local health care networks would be
strengthened, disease prevention facilities better supplied and
awareness on malaria prevention raised, reports said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Become Main Supplier for Boeing Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company has some 8,500
aircraft flying all over the world, but few people know that about
3,000 of those aircraft have parts that were built in China.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Chinese manufacturers have produced thousands
of parts for Boeing aircraft, and assembled 35 McDonnell Douglas
MD-80s, according to Raymond Bracy, president of Boeing China.
</P>
<P>
Bracy told a seminar on the Boeing 717, the company's newest
family member, in Xiamen in Fujian Province that this shows that
China is not only Boeing's largest market outside the United
States, but also its main supplier.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is the world's largest manufacturer of passenger
planes. In 1997, it produced 374 aircraft. Its annual sales
amounts to 27 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, China has bought about 300 Boeing aircraft,
accounting for 72 percent of the country's plane imports. In 1985,
China began to assemble MD-80s and to manufacture major parts. In
1992, China signed an agreement with McDonnell Douglas, which
merged with Boeing last year, to assemble 20 MD-90s in the cities
of Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenyang and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The first Chinese-assembled MD-90 is scheduled to be put into
use by November this year, according to Mr. Bracy.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Contain Floodwaters Continues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The 7th flood crest of the
Yangtze River is moving towards Yichang in central China's Hubei
Province, while the 3rd flood crest of the Songhua River in
northeast China reached the city of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang
Province today.
</P>
<P>
A State Flood Control Headquarters official says that they can
not give up in the fight against the floods, with water levels
still very high and a new flood crest on the Yangtze, and the
danger of embankments that have been water-logged for nearly two
months.
</P>
<P>
The flood season will end in October if weather conditions are
normal, the official told a press conference of the State
Council's Information Office today, and that the Yangtze will
remain high for about 20 days and the Nen and Songhua rivers will
take two weeks to recede -- if there are no torrential rains on
the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, the water level at Jiamusi was up more than 30
centimeters. It is now 80.27 meters, 1.27 meters above the danger
level. At Yichang it is 53.28 m., at Shashi, 44.32 m., and at
Jianli 37.6 m. at 10 a.m. today. These were up 0.79 m., 0.44 m.,
and 0.07 m. from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The 7th flood crest of the Yangtze formed at 4 p.m. Sunday in
Chongqing, where the water level at the Cuntan measuring point was
183.21 meters and the flow rate 58,000 cubic meters per
second. This was 1.1 meters higher and 3,100 cubic meters more
than the previous flood crest.
</P>
<P>
The new peak could cause more difficulties downstream, but
water levels on the middle and lower reaches are not very likely
to break records.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not An Advocate for Iraq: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Although Moscow supports an
early lifting of the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
Russian Ambassador to Kuwait Vladimir Shishov has said "Russia is
not an advocate for Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Arabic daily Al-Qabas
published here Tuesday, Shishov said Moscow and Washington share
views with regard to Iraq, adding a united stance is always
interpreted into the voting process in the U.N. Security Council
at the end of every discussion over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said Moscow is also committed to all
U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia denounced Iraq's invasion and took part in all
activities exerted to remove the traits of the aggression, and
action is still going on to push Iraq to carry out all Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Asked how to prevent Iraq from threatening its neighboring
countries when the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad are lifted,
the Russian ambassador said a follow-up regime would be
established, adding that lifting the embargo "does not mean the
United Nations would leave Iraq do whatever easily, as some
believes."
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly supports an early lifting of the sanctions
which were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Russia has
suffered a loss of at least 10 billion U.S. dollars due to the
block of trade and economic activities with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shishov said Russia is committed to Kuwait's security,
stability and territorial safety. "This is Russia's stance in
principle that was reflected in the signing of a defense
agreement" in November 1993 with a term of 10 years, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Shishov also underlined the "extremely
special" relations, historic ties and cooperation between Russia
and Kuwait.

<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African foreign and
defense ministers as well as envoys sent by Gabonese and
Congolese (B) presidents arrived here Tuesday to coordinate their
stands with the Angolan government on the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister
Joe Modise arrived here Tuesday morning. They are followed by
Jean Ping, the Gabonese Minister of Planning, Environment and
Tourism, Congolese Foreign Minister Adolf Adada and Defense
Minister Pierre Oba, who are envoys of their respective
presidents, the Angolan Foreign Ministry revealed..
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here believed that ministers are here to
coordinate their positions on the DRC crisis in view of the
current differences among the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries in terms of military interference and
political and diplomatic resolution.
</P>
<P>
A SADC mini-summit was held over the weekend in Pretoria, the
economic capital of South Africa in the absence of presidents of
Angola, Zimbabwe and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called and presided by South African President
Nelson Mandela concluded with a joint communique, calling on a
ceasefire between the warring sides in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government issued a declaration Monday night to
support military assistance to the Laurent Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
Angola firmly supports the repulse of rebels by the Kabila
government and has reportedly sent a 1,000-strong army with tanks
and fighter planes to the DRC. Last Friday, the army helped
Kabila snatch back Kitona, a strategic air force base in
southwest of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a special envoy to Angola
last Saturday and made it clear that only through political and
diplomatic means could the crisis in the DRC be settled. He also
asked all foreign countries to move out of the vast central
African country.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Slumps 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble's exchange rate
dropped an alarming 10 percent Tuesday on the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX), to 7.86 rubles against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
This was the steepest drop since October 11, 1994, the
so-called Black Tuesday, when the dollar moved up 27.43 percent,
from 3,081 old rubles to 3,926 old rubles.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ruble has shed 24 percent since last Monday, when
the former government and central bank raised the ceiling of the
ruble's exchange corridor from 6.3 to 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise in the dollar prompted the MICEX to suspend
trading twice.
</P>
<P>
Traders believe that the central bank on Tuesday launched a
serious intervention at the end of the trading session on the
MICEX, and plugged almost all unsatisfied demand for dollars, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a source with the central bank that the great
demand for the dollar had been fueled by Russian banks eager to
change their rubles into dollars.
</P>
<P>
The source expressed concern that the banks were using central
bank loans, intended for them to maintain current solvency, to
purchase foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"We can't help being worried by the fact that banks are
spurring the market virtually at the expense of Central Bank
resources, instead of channeling the finances they receive to the
fulfillment of their obligations to clients," he said.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Iraq hardened their positions over
Baghdad's decision to end cooperation with weapons inspections.
Washington and Britain are pushing to end the periodic sanctions
reviews that could keep Iraq under an embargo indefinitely, and
Baghdad insists on a friendlier system, while refusing to
cooperate with international organizations.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who dismissed the Cabinet
on Sunday, named Victor S. Chernomyrdin as his choice for prime
minister. In an effort to build support for Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin
said he was giving a greater voice to the Communist-led forces in
Parliament that have sought to frustrate economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. federal court on Monday handed the Clinton
administration a serious setback in its plans to use a
controversial statistical method to conduct the 2000 census,
declaring that the administration's proposal to estimate a portion
of the nation's population rather than try to reach every
household is illegal and cannot be used.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Britain announced a novel proposal
Monday to convene a Scottish court in the Netherlands in an effort
to bring to trial two Libyan intelligence agents accused of the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The intelligence officials in the United States said they
recently acquired a soil sample containing a chemical precursor of
VX nerve gas, and said the substance isn't used, or produced as a
byproduct, in any commercial process. They added they have
evidence plant officials had links to a top Iraqi chemical-arms

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Hold Presidential Election on February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will hold its
presidential election on February 27, 1999 to usher in an elected
civilian government, the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in capital Abuja, INEC chairman
Ephraim Akpata said elections to the National assembly would take
place on February 20.
</P>
<P>
Elections of state governors and legislators will be held on
January 9, Akpata said, quoted by the official News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The INEC also released the guidelines for the registration of
political parties, which require all political associations to
first contest the local government council elections scheduled
for December 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Only those that score 10 percent of votes cast in at lease 24
of the country's 36 states will be registered as political
parties, the INEC said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new transition to civil rule program
announced by the Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, the military will withdraw to barracks on May 29, 1999,
when the newly-elected civilian president assumes office.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who came to power on June 9 following the sudden
death of late military leader General Sani Abacha, announced his
own transition program in a national broadcasting on July 20.
</P>
<P>
He scrapped all the political parties as well as the electoral
commission of the Abacha time on the ground that the transition
program has lost its credibility and acceptability due to massive
rigging.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's new policy, including dialog with the opposition
and the release of political detainees has won him the trust of
many people both at home and abroad, particularly in the West,
which have had a strained relations with the Abacha government.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Nigeria's powerful rival on the continent which
has been critical of the Abacha military government, is currently
hosting a three-day official visit by Abubakar, the first
Nigerian leader ever to do so.
</P>
<P>
Scores of new political associations have emerged in Nigeria
in the last one month. In a recent meeting of the INEC, the
associations have refused registration by the government as it
was done in the Abacha time.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been under
military rule for most of its time since its independence in
1960.
</P>
<P>
All the military rulers had announced their transition to
civil rule programs, but only General Olusegun Obasanjo actually
handed over to a civilian government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's latest transition experience started in 1985, after
General Ibrahim Babangida took over power in a coup.
</P>
<P>
His transition ended in a national disaster when he annulled
the June 1993 presidential election, in which Moshood Abiola, a
businessman from the south, was believed to have won.
</P>
<P>
When General Abacha took the power in 1993 from the interim
government led by Earnest Shonekan, he kept to tradition by
announcing his own transition program, which was expected to
usher in an elected civilian government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
But as God would have it, he died a sudden death of heart
attack in June, after he was chosen the sole presidential
candidate by all the five political parties registered by him.

up their alert on potential terrorist actions against United
States and other foreign missions here, after the bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania early this month.
</P>
<P>
The National Police Administration (NPA) Tuesday said it held
an emergency meeting with the U.S. embassy here to map out
anti-terror steps immediately after the terrorist attacks on the
two East African countries.
</P>
<P>
Police had strengthened the guards on foreign missions here,
including the U.S. Embassy, consul and information service, said
the police administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration had also ordered its stations to strengthen
their patrolling of foreign business firms in their areas of
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, two bombs blew up at the two U.S. embassies,
killing more than 250 people, including 12 U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Retaliating 13 days after the bombings, U.S. forces launched
cruise missile strikes against alleged terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton vowed to lead an all-out
fight against terrorism, even as threats of retaliation were made
for U.S. missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific States Agree on Whale Sanctuary Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute Japanese-inspired
bid to scuttle support for a whale sanctuary in the South Pacific
was Tuesday rejected by Australia, New Zealand and 14 South
Pacific island nations.
</P>
<P>
As a joint Australia-New Zealand initiative, the sanctuary was
backed at the two-day annual summit meeting of the South Pacific
Forum, which concluded Tuesday in the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM), despite a proposal by Palau which would have
allowed Japan to veto the plan, the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The forum groups Australia, New Zealand and 14 South Pacific
island states, including Cook Islands, FSM, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru,
Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Marshall Islands, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers from Australia, New Zealand, PNG, Solomon
Islands and Samoa were absent from the meeting because of domestic
politics or illness.
</P>
<P>
Palau's move shocked the forum delegates who had expected no
opposition to a ban on commercial whaling in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Palau has no history of commercial whaling, and many blamed its
surprise intervention on its close ties with Japan, the biggest
aid donor to the island nation, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Palau wanted the forum's support for the sanctuary to be
subject to a veto by outside nations including Japan, who are
dialogue partners with the forum.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the few countries still practicing whaling and
if accepted, such a move would have meant an automatic veto of the
forum's backing for a whale sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said it
was totally unacceptable for the forum members to be handing
control of their affairs to outside countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique released Tuesday by the forum urged developed
nations to stick to their targets for reducing greenhouse gases as
global warming poses threat to many island nations.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Acquisition of Rolls Royce by Volkswagen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, gave its approval on Tuesday
for the acquisition of Rolls Royce/Bentley and Cosworth by
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will not raise any competition concerns because
of the limited market shares of Rolls Royce/Bentley and Cosworth,
said commission spokeswoman, Martine Reicherts.
</P>
<P>
The overlap of Volkswagen and Cosworth's car engine
manufacturing activities will not create any impediment to
competition in the market for car engines either, commission
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed that Volkswagen will manufacture and
distribute luxury cars under the Bentley name immediately, and
will continue to do so after January 1, 2003, and that BMW has
granted Volkswagen a license to use the name for a limited period
until December 31, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Corruption Cases Through July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-corruption drive
this year has resulted in 67,842 cases of corruption and
dereliction of duty from January to July, according to Han Zhubin,
the procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Procurators have investigated 24,131 cases and opened legal
proceedings in 11,852, Han told a conference of provincial
prosecutors here today.
</P>
<P>
There were 7,743 cases each involving more than 50,000 yuan
(6,000 U.S. dollars) or more, and 618 that were major cases of
dereliction of duty, and 1,126 officials at or above the
county-head level involved.
</P>
<P>
Han said that the anti-corruption fight will continue in
accordance with President Jiang Zemin's directives, and prosecutor
offices have been told to be more diligent in dealing with
smuggling cases because of China's fight against these crimes.
</P>
<P>
Some government employees are involved in smuggling, he said,
or in letting smugglers go free or even sheltering them, and this
is a crime of dereliction of duty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that prosecutors need to focus on corruption among
government employees and important officials in the following ways:
</P>
<P>
-- government officials and judicial officers seeking personal
gain by ignoring the law;
</P>
<P>
-- employees of finance, taxation and foreign currency
management offices breaking rules and causing losses to the state;
</P>
<P>
-- officials abusing their power to steal state property; and
</P>
<P>
-- misappropriation, diversion, or theft of disaster relief
funds and materials or dereliction of duty in the fight against
flooding.

<HEADLINE> 530 More Ethiopians Return From Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Ethiopian
government spokesman announced Tuesday that 530 more Ethiopians
had returned from Eritrea in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the office said 400 Ethiopians
arrived in Ethiopia Monday while 130 arrived Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"According to the 130 who came Sunday, thousands of Ethiopians
have been desperate to leave for some time," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The 130, like many Ethiopians in Eritrea, were being
prevented from working, had been thrown out of their homes and
were consequently suffering from hunger and from the extreme heat
and cold during the days and nights," the statement noted, adding
that "in many cases Ethiopians, especially those in Assab
(bordering the two countries) are suffering from starvation."
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean government is preventing Ethiopians from leaving
by deliberately being obstructive," the statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
In desperation, 1,000 Ethiopians went to demonstrate their
plight and seek help from several international bodies including
embassies, telling them "they wanted to go home and they were not
being allowed to do so."
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement issued here Sunday, the office of the
Ethiopian government spokesperson urgently appealed to the
international community to put pressure on Asmara to allow
Ethiopians come home.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of them are desperate to leave but Eritrean
immigration authorities are refusing to give the International
Red Cross a list of those who want to leave," said the statement,
adding "2,100 have registered to leave but only a handful has
been allowed to do so. A further 2,000 were prevented even from
registering."
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 Ethiopians have returned home since the outbreak of
border conflict between the two countries in May this year.

GENEVA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Europe's biggest bank, UBS,

"By the year 2002 it expects a net profit after tax of 10
billion to 11 billion francs, a return on equity of 20 percent and

BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese guerrilla was killed in
south Lebanon on Tuesday by the Israeli air raids, the National

</P>
<P>
Hossam al Amin, an officer of the Shiite Muslim Amal movement

At the same time, five Lebanese civilians, including a boy,

<HEADLINE> Delegates Exchange Views on Rehabilitation for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 11th
Rehabilitation International Asia and the Pacific Regional
Conference exchanged views and experience on further improving
the rehabilitation work for the people with disabilities here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the third day meeting since the conference cum
Campaign'98 for the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons
1993-2002 was opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Now there are about 300 million people with disabilities in
this region. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) will focus its contribution on the training of
people with disabilities in social mobilization of eliminating
barriers to disabled persons' participation in society.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, Yasuhiro Oyama, president of the
Japan Association of Employers of the Severely Disabled, put
forward a suggestion to make good use of the workplace of private
companies for vocational training in order to achieve better
results in the system of vocational rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
This will "make it possible for persons with severe
disabilities to live and work in their community, as aimed at by
the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arturo A. Borjal, a representative from the Philippines, urged
the media of the country to conduct a strong lobby for causes
affecting persons with disabilities after briefing the
participants on its specific laws and provisions in general laws
directly or indirectly focused on the welfare of persons with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo Dahong, a representative from China, told the meeting
about the measures that the country has taken in carrying out the
projects of disability prevention.
</P>
<P>
Major tasks of the projects include the reduction of the
incidence of hereditary disabilities and congenital defects,
control of infectious diseases, severe malnutrition and cerebral
vascular diseases, reduction of incidence of drug-induced deafness
and incidence of iodine deficiency and endemic fluorosis and
prevention of disabling injuries caused by traffic and worksite
accidents, Zhuo said.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimation in 1996, the number of people with
disabilities in the Chinese mainland was 60 million.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo said that in the next decade, at least 30 million people
can be saved from disability through preventive action.
</P>
<P>
Leonie Exel, executive officer of the National Employment and
Psychological Services Center of Australia, gave an overview of
the Australian disability employment sector; its political
influences, structure, funding sources, lobbying mechanisms,
target clients and challenges.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reform its
insurance business by ending the People's Insurance Company of
China's monopoly of more than 40 years, according to Outlook
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The PICC (group), which was established three years ago, will
be disbanded and its three subsidiaries in life insurance, property
insurance and reinsurance are expected to be independent, and
China will establish a state insurance regulatory commission.
</P>
<P>
China will also develop a policy-oriented agriculture insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
Premiums in China amount to 108.7 billion yuan and have a
year-on-year increase of 40 percent, much higher than the growth
of the GNP. According to the World Bank, the figure is expected to
reach 240 billion yuan by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
China agrees with the World Bank that commercial insurance can
be an important part of a social security system and will make
individual security a common thing.
</P>
<P>
With the grain distribution reforms and the increase in
farmers' incomes, Chinese farmers have come to accept insurance
and life insurance companies are expected to pay more attention on
the rural market, where 80 percent of China's people live.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate May Not Approve VFA This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has not
included the approval of the proposed Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA) with the United States in its 1998 legislative agenda,
Senate majority leader Franklin Drilon said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the urgency attached to the agreement by
both the Philipppine and the U.S. governments, the VFA does not
figure in the Senate legislative program for this year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, Drilon said, has committed itself to passing four
of 79 priority measures submitted by the Presidential Palace
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The four bills are the 1999 budget proposal, amendments to the
General Banking Act, amendments to the Retail Trade Law and an act
empowering local governments in the administration and operation
of the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said the Senate sees no connection between the VFA and
the Philippine economy and dismissed speculations that delayed
approval of the agreement will have adverse economic and security
effects on the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that the VFA has to be similarly ratified by the U.S.
Congress for it to be constitutionally valid and binding.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Senate President Marcelo Fernan also said that
the four priority measures are considered "very urgent" and the
VFA, by implication, does not figure in such urgency.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine and the U.S. governments are urging the
Philippine senate to ratify the VFA as soon as possible to pave
the way for joint military exercises between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 236 energy-related
projects will get funding from the European Commission, commission
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission fund, amounting to 110.5 million ECU (121.55
million U.S. dollars), will finance 116 energy technology
demonstration projects and 120 associated measures.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, is supporting these projects with an aim of developing new
technologies and applications in the rational use of energy,
renewable energy sources and fossil fuels, so as to meet the
challenges originated from the constant growth in global energy
demand.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, who is responsible
for energy policy, said: "In view of the 21st century, we need to
define an integrated approach to technological development,
covering the research, development, promotion and wider market
deployment of new energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
"This approach needs to be one which works hand-in-hand with
various market factors in industry, finance and the public sector,
and which responds to the real needs of the consumer."
</P>
<P>
Under the JOULE-THERMIE program that provides support for
research and development of non-nuclear energy technologies, the
commission is supporting two types of energy projects --
demonstration projects and associated measures.
</P>
<P>
The associated measures are aimed at the promotion of new
energy technologies, overcoming barriers and obstacles to market
penetration and the dissemination of information on the benefits
of new energies.

<HEADLINE> 10 Percent Tree Species on edge of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Three international organizations
warned on Tuesday that 10 percent of the world's known tree
species are facing extinction.
</P>
<P>
The World Conservation Monitoring Center (WCMC), the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
said more than 8,750 of the 80,000 to 100,000 tree species known
were found to be threatened with extinction
</P>
<P>
The three organizations are launching the World List of
Threatened Trees, a report compiled by the WCMC, for a United
Nations Intergovernmental Forum on Forests.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which aims to tackle the crisis facing the world's
forests, began on August 24 in Geneva and will last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The threats to tree species include overuse of timber as fuel
and as a construction material, the uncontrolled expansion of
human settlements and agriculture, widespread forest fires,
invasive alien species and unsustainable forest management, said a
report of the forum.
</P>
<P>
Trees, as an intrinsic part of the world's ecosystem, provide
such valuable services to mankind as climate control, water
catchment, medicine, food and timber.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Earth's animal species depends upon the
survivability of trees. Tropical forests are home to about 90
percent of the world's terrestrial species.
</P>
<P>
The World List of Threatened Trees advocates urgent actions by
the international community in sustainable forest management,
restoration of forest habitats and control of alien invasive
species.It also calls for such supplementary measures as the
establishment of botanic gardens, arboreta and seed banks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hit by Heavy Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
knocked to a new 12-year low when the currency was hit by heavy
selling at European markets Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar had been holding up around the 58-U.S.-cent
foothold for most of Tuesday before trading in London got
underway.
</P>
<P>
The wave of selling there took the Australian dollar to its
lowest level since July 1986 at 57.63 U.S. cents, surpassing
Monday's fall to 57.79 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was trading at 57.68 U.S. cents, from
58.01 U.S. cents, and edging closer to its post-float low of 57.10
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The late fall follows a stressful local trading session with
offshore investment banks keeping up the pressure up on the unit,
preventing it from breaking away from its 58.00-U.S.-cent
foothold.
</P>
<P>
The crises in Asia and Russia have resulted in a bearish
outlook for the local currency and market participants responded
by continuing the selling.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that whenever the local currency looked to rise
above the 58.00-U.S.-cent mark, U.S. investment banks were on hand
to sell off large orders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a superannuation briefing in Sydney Tuesday, former
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Bernie Fraser shied away
from commenting on the falling Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the RBA should intervene to support the
Australian dollar, Faser replied that what was evident at present
was that the current volatility should be looked at on a longer
term, not short term view.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed trading here at 83.71 yen, from
83.42 yen and 1.0426 German marks from 1.0449 marks.

<P>
The class was held in the Tianjin Heping Hospital of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, where hundreds of thousand of

According to experts from the World Health Organization (WHO),
men's reproductive disease, after cancer and heart disease, may
become a major problem threatening human health in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the quality of male sperm is
decreasing, with sperm density reduced from 113 million per
liter in 1940 to 66 million per liter in 1990, while the average
amount of sperm discharged each time dropped from 3.4 ml to 2.75
ml.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Fifth Letter of Intent to IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved the latest quarterly economic review, better known as the
fifth letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
which forecasts that the economy will contract 7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The letter predicted that Thailand's economic downturn will
stabilize by year-end, with slight growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"A supportive regional environment will be important to this
respect," a press release regarding the letter issued by the
Finance Ministry Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The review will be sent to the IMF board for final approval
early next month before Thailand withdraws an additional 494
million U.S. dollars from the IMF's 17.2-billion-dollar rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
Under the fifth letter of intent, the 1999 fiscal budget, which
begins October, will have a deficit target of 3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), the same as the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
This will include a central budget of 1 percent of GDP, with
the remainder from state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit target excludes the 1.5 percent of GDP
budgeted for financial restructuring costs, including domestic
bond issues and other costs from the reform package announced on
August 14.
</P>
<P>
On monetary policy, the release said money market interest
rates have already declined substantially from 20 percent earlier
this year to a 10-12 percent range. The government expects that
banks' lending rates should fall further and liquidity conditions
improve.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves are expected to remain within the
26-28 billion dollar range by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the deeper recession, the government expects
inflation to decline to 9.2 percent and the external current
account surplus be higher to 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Thai government and IMF officials have agreed to revise
policies on financial and corporate debt restructuring, social
security and market opening.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Tuesday that the
economic downturn is worse than it was expected three months ago,
which is mainly due to the unfavorable external environment.
</P>
<P>
Domestic purchasing power and investments in Thailand also
recorded significant falls, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Youths Hold Peace Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,750 Israeli and
Arab teenagers on Tuesday gathered at the Israeli-Jordanian border
to mark the fifth anniversary of the historical Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said some 1,500 teenagers came from the youth wing
of Israeli United Kibbutz Movement (UKM), which organized the
event.
</P>
<P>
And the other 250 youngsters came from Jordan, Gaza Strip and
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the UKM said that the rally was to mark
the mutual recognition agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization signed in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
It said the aim of the gathering was to express support to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been deadlocked for 17
months.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's peace rally was held in the Naharayim boder area
despite Israel Education Ministry's order forbidding the
participation of school pupils for reasons of security.
</P>
<P>
In March last year, seven Israeli schoolgirls were killed
by a Jordanian soldier during a school outing in the area.
</P>
<P>
Yoel Marshak, head of UKM's youth and settlement section, said
that there would be proper security arrangements provided by
Israeli and Jordanian border troops.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that " peace is our best security belt and it is
also our future, and it is the desire of our youth."

<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented shake-up of
China's procutorial offices, 756 prosecutors were disciplined in

</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Procurator-General of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate Han Zhubin at a national meeting
of provincial procurators here today.
</P>
<P>
During the process, 1,255 cases that had been mis-handled were
re-examined by prosecutors. An "educational rectification
movement" was begun during the central government's new term in
March in response to criticism by members of the top legislature,
the National People's Congress (NPC).

NPC members were invited to explain their dissatisfaction with
prosecutors and comment on their work and notoriously illegal
practices were halted to keep practices in accordance with the
law.

being involved in illegal activities in their official duties and
legal proceedings were opened against 73 of them.
</P>

<P>
Prosecutor's offices were also examined for prolonged detention
of suspects, 675 people were released in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The illegal practices are still hard to deal with, but they
relate to whether the confidence of the public can be won, Han
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Government Earns More From Gas Flaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government made
about 58.64 billion Naira (about 689.9 million U.S. Dollars) in
the first quarter of this year from gas flaring penalty.
</P>
<P>
A major national newspaper This Day Tuesday quoted figures
from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the recently scrapped
Ministry of Petroleum Resources as saying that the figure is 270
percent up from that of the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The drastic rise is attributed to the increase of the penalty
from 50 Kobo (0.006 Dollars) to 10 Naira (0.12 Dollars) per 1,000
standard cubic feet of gas flared, starting from the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the top African oil producer, is rich in natural gas
resources estimated between 110 and 350 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that Nigeria's oil fields are currently
producing 2.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, but 75
percent of them are flared into the air, incurring a loss of
several millions of Dollars.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the utilization of the resources, the Nigerian
government raised the penalty for each 1,000 cubic feet flared
from two Kobo in the 1970s to 50 Kobo in 1996, further to 10
Naira in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government also provides various incentives for investment
into gas utilization.

</P>
<P>

<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Olympic swimming
champion Susan O'Neill has criticized national coach Don Talbot
for alleged rudeness and insensitivity to his swimmers' feelings.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who won the women's 200 meters butterfly in the A
tlanta Olympic Games in 1996, was quoted in Australian sport's
magazine Inside Sport.
</P>
<P>
"Just once I wish he'd just say 'great swim' and forget what
you didn't do," O'Neill was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"When I won my Olympic gold it was my seventh event. It was
also the only time that week he didn't tell me after a race that
I could have done better. He should know that I don't find any of
that stuff motivating," she said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill also said after her failure to win a 200-meter
butterfly event in Europe Talbot also blasted her.
</P>
<P>
"He yelled at Scott about me -- on and on and on about how
every race I've had in the last four years has been too easy, and
now that's caught up with me, and I won't win again unless I
improve things he pointed out," she said.
</P>
<P>
The timing of these comments certainly would not help the
Australian swimming as the national team arrived in Perth on
Tuesday for a training camp for the Commenwealth Games.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis to Hit Turkish-Russian Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to the official
assessment, economic experts were quoted Tuesday as saying that
the Russian financial turmoil will have considerably adverse
impact on the thriving Turkish-Russian trade.
</P>
<P>
As result of the shrinking domestic consumer demand in Russia
due to the crisis, Turkey's export losses are expected to reach
700 million U.S. dollars by the end of this year, the Daily News
newspaper quoted these experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The experts also pointed out that Turkey' overseas borrowings
would increase due to the decline of the Turkish-Russian bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the annual trading volume
between Turkey and Russia now stands at 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish business circles and financial markets were rattled by
Russia's announcement on August 17 that it would sharply devalue
its currency ruble, halt payment on government treasury bonds
and impose a 90-day moratorium on payment of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish State Minister for economic affairs Gunes
Taner last week brushed aside the worry about the negative impact
of the Russia crisis on the Turkish-Russian booming trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would take necessary measures to
restrict the limit the possible damage caused by the Russian
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Terrorism on the Internet was
increasing at an alarming rate and threatening businesses and
governments around the world, an Australian computer expert warned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Organizations should review their security to protect
themselves against cyber-terrorist attacks, Deakin University
computing expert Matthew Warren said in an interview in Melbourne
with the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
He said many organizations were at present so preoccupied with
the millennium bug that they had become lax on computer security.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist groups have difficulty in relaying their political
messages to the general public without being censored and they can
now use the Internet for this purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some groups were even using the Internet for
fund-raising purposes, adding it was now possible to make a direct
donation to a certain group by using your credit card.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist groups could also use other methods such as E-mail
bombs where thousands of E-mails are sent to a particular computer
system until that system crashed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most companies were preoccupied with the millennium bug and
viruses and were too relaxed in their attitude toward computer
security, leaving themselves open to Internet terrorism, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Willing to Pay High Rates on Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday his government is willing to pay
high interest rates on foreign loans in efforts to revive the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
"We guarantee that we will repay our loans and even pre-pay
them," the Malaysian leader said at a meet-the-people gathering
in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his government would not force foreigners to
lend money to the country if they were not confident.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would toil on its own to set the economy on the
recovery path, Mahathir said, adding "our country is our
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said some foreigners still felt that the economic
turmoil in Malaysia was because of the government's inefficiencies
like what had happened in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said the real culprits were the speculators who depressed
currencies and share prices.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has lost some 600
billion ringgit (about 142.517 billion U.S. dollars) in market
value to only 300 billion ringgit (about 71.258 billion U.S.

He said Malaysia could still manage the economy and if it had
not managed the economy well, the country would have sought IMF
(International Monetary Fund) aid a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are still free. This shows that the government knows how to
manage the country," he said, adding that Malaysians must believe
in the capability of the government in managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that sooner or later, Malaysia would see the end of the
economic turbulence and the country has to sacrifice a little but
this is not as much as the sacrifices made by the people in
countries which had sought IMF aid.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami called Tuesday for dialog to safeguard peace and stability
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Dialog is the "most rational way" to remove tension and crisis
and forge peace and stability, Khatami told visiting Armenian
Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he insisted the dialog be based on principles of
mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president rejected the presence of outside forces
in Central Asia and the Caucasus, saying that Israel's influence
in the region has sparked Iran's concern.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a leading rival of Israel, will never tolerate influence
and domination of the Jewish state in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between Iran and Armenia, Khatami
said that friendly bilateral relations are needed in promoting
development and progress.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's readiness to boost the ties and conduct
cooperation on the bilateral and regional levels.

Oskanyan, who arrived here Monday for a two-day visit,

<HEADLINE> Angola Supports SADC Move on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government has announced
to join the Southern African Development Community (SADC) efforts
in supporting the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
This is a political solution to the crisis now facing the
central African country, according to a brief statement by the
Angolan government issued Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Angola supports the move proposed by SADC security and defense
organ led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, which asked SADC
members to offer military assistance to Kabila's government to
repel armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The move is in line with the effort for peace and stability in
the DRC, said the statement which did not mention whether Angola
has sent army to the DRC to help Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamulungue soldiers in the DRC started rebellion on
August 2 against Kabila. And the fighting has since spread to
the east and southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kabila government has accused Rwanda and Uganda of backing
the rebels which was denied by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign media reports said earlier that Angola has
sent a 1,000-strong army with tanks and fighter planes to the DRC
which helped the Kabila army snatch back the Kitona air force
base 20 kms away from the mouth of the Congo river last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> hke082554 -Malaysian Opposition Leader Jailed After Losing Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
Democratic Action Party (DAP) Deputy Secretary-General Lim Guan
Eng was sent to prison Tuesday after his appeal against his
18-month jail sentence on charges of publishing false news and
sedition was dismissed by the Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court Tuesday upheld the 18-month jail sentence
passed by the Court of Appeal on Lim Guan Eng who is also a member
of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the decision, Chief Justice Mohammed Eusoff
Chin said, "We find that the Court of Appeal had considered
thoroughly the principles of sentencing, and had given the reasons
for interfering with the sentence passed by the trial judge. We
find no good reason why we should interfere with the Court of
Appeal's decision that the appellant should stand convicted of the
two charges."
</P>
<P>
Eusoff said the Federal Court had given "anxious consideration"
to the submission of Lim's counsel, Karpal Singh, that an
imprisonment sentence of not less than one year would disqualify
Lim from being an MP.
</P>
<P>
He said an MP should always act in a responsible manner and, in
particular, should not break the law because he was likely to face
charges in court and leave his constituency without a
representative in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"When such a situation happens, the people should not put the
blame on the police, the attorney-general or the court because the
blame lies entirely on the Member of Parliament who breaks the
law," Eusoff said.
</P>
<P>
Eusoff also said that a written judgment would be given in due
course.
</P>
<P>
Lim Guan Eng, 38, looked calm when the verdict was announced
and hugged his family members after the court adjourned. Present
were his father, Lim Kit Siang, who is the opposition leader in
Parliament and DAP Secretary-General, his mother and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Lim was fined 15,000 ringgit (about 3,562 U.S. dollars) by the
Malacca High Court on April 28 last year for maliciously printing
false news and uttering seditious words under the Printing Presses
and Publications Act 1984 and the Sedition Act 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal dismissed Lim's appeal on April 1 this year
and upheld an 18-month jail sentence on each offense with the
sentences to run concurrently.

<HEADLINE> More Relief Supplies Ensure Flood Victims' Daily Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Ministry of Civil Affairs said today that the flood situation
still remains China's major concern, and more donations and relief
materials continue to be sent to flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Fan Baojun, vice-minister of Civil Affairs, said at a news
conference held by the Information Office of the State Council
this afternoon that the central government has repeatedly asked
local officials to take greater care of homeless people, as top
leaders themselves went to the flooded areas to direct flood
control.
</P>
<P>
So far, the central government has allocated 3.029 billion yuan
(366 million U.S. dollars) and distributed huge amounts of relief
materials, Fan said, and more than 100 work teams have also been
sent to flood-ravaged regions.
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangxi Province has been one of the hardest-hit
regions, and the provincial government has provided more than 100
million yuan in disaster relief funds and distributed 100,000 tons of
grain, 1.87 million items of clothing, quilts and blankets,
100,000 tons of fuel and 21,000 tons of fiber and nylon cloth.
</P>
<P>
To prevent epidemic outbreaks, central China's Hubei Province
has sent nearly 1,245 medical teams with 5,783 people to provide
check-ups and distribute medicine valued at 3.48 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China has also suffered the worst flooding since the
founding of new China in 1949. Heilongjiang Province has used 100
million yuan in flood control and disaster relief funds, and Jilin
Province has distributed 8,500 tons of instant food, 258,000
quilts and clothing items, and 2,700 cases of medicine.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces have helped more than one million flood
victims resettle in safe places, said Fan, adding that heavy
flooding has drawn great concern both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has received 1.746 billion yuan in donations
including relief materials, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs has
allocated 824 million yuan to flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Civil Affairs had issued three
emergency circulars urging that donations be handled openly,
fairly, and in an orderly fashion to ensure that money and goods
get to the the people they are intended for.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Expand Settlements in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- During a condolence call to
the family of a slain settler in Hebron, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to build more housing for the
settlers in this flashpoint West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
Due to security reasons, Netanyahu's visit to the family of
late Rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan was previously unannounced.
</P>
<P>
Ra'anan was stabbed to death by a Palestinian perpetrator at
his home in the Tel Rumeida neighborhood Thursday night, prompting
setter leaders' call on the government to expand the existing
settlements in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"The new housing construction plan will be finalized soon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He told the family members of Ra'anan that he had nothing to
say about the peace process, but would insist that the Palestinian
side take measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Before Netanyahu, Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai had already visited the divided city,
where 450 Jewish settlers living among 12,000 Palestinians, to
express condolences to Ra'anan's family.
</P>
<P>
During their visits, Mordechai was blamed by Jewish settlers
for not providing proper security to the settlers, and Weizman
accused of being a "spy" of Israel's enemies.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit to Hebron showed that he is doing everything
he could to appease the right-wing Jewish settlers, who helped
sweep him to power in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Seven Jewish families are living in caravans at Tel Rumeida,
which is surrounded by Palestinian residents. Israeli security
forces have found it difficult to protect the safety of these
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the only West Bank city where there remains a Jewish
presence. Under the January 1997 agreement, Israel hand over 80
percent of the city to the Palestinian control but has been
retaining control over the rest of the city, where 450 Jewish
settlers are living in isolated neighborhoods.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim holy shrine Aqsa
Mosque in East Jerusalem was closed to visitors Tuesday morning
because of a protest against the arrest of two Palestinian youths.
</P>
<P>
The two youths were arrested by Israeli police Tuesday morning
near the entrance to the Mosque, the third holiest Muslim shrine
in the world.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given by the Israeli police for the arrests.
</P>
<P>
After the news of the arrests spread, a large number of
Palestinian protesters gathered inside the Mosque to demonstrate
against the Israeli moves, forcing the officials of the Mosque to
close the Mosque to visitors.
</P>
<P>
Aqsa Mosque is jointly managed by Jordanian and Palestinian
religious personnel and tens of thousands of visitors visit it
everyday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast War, and Israel has since claimed its sovereign
control on the whole city.
</P>
<P>
Talks are going on between Aqsa Mosque officials and Israeli
Jerusalem police, but no agreement has been reported so far on
when the shrine would be reopened.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Peace Could Only Be Achieved Through Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A durable peace in Afghanistan
"can only be achieved through an indigenous Afghan peace process
leading to the establishment of a multi-ethnic government."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made Tuesday by Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz in his first foreign policy statement presented at the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Pakistan's policy on Afghanistan is impelled by its
vital interest in the restoration of a durable peace in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after assuming his premiership in February last
year, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took new initiatives for the
promotion of peace in Afghanistan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sharif reached out to the Afghan leaders on both sides of the
political divide as a consequence of which, leaders of the Taliban
militia and the opposition Northern Alliance visited Islamabad,
said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these efforts culminated in the meeting of a
Steering Committee early May to work out the modalities for an
Ulema (religious scholar) Commission to seek a solution to the
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
"This was a significant breakthrough which unfortunately was
derailed because of the intransigence of one of the component
parties of the Northern Alliance," the Foreign Minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan is also making efforts internationally to
promote a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict which led to
the formation of the "Six plus Two" group comprising the six
countries with common borders with Afghanistan plus the U.S. and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The group has been meeting regularly under U.N. auspices in New
York, Aziz said, adding Pakistan has also fully supported the U.N.
and the OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference) in their efforts
to promote peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the dissension and discord within the Northern Alliance
not only derailed the peace process but weakened them to the
extent that some of their commanders defected from the Northern
Alliance and invited the Taliban to take over the territory.
</P>
<P>
The event of the past few weeks in Afghanistan show that the
Taliban have met with only minor resistance and most of the places
fell to them with little or no fighting, Aziz said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Loses $1M for Smuggled Sugar: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has lost nearly one
million U.S. Dollars in revenue in five months due to the
smuggled sugar, according to an official with the Mozambican
National Association of Sugar.
</P>
<P>
Arnaldo Ribeiro, director of the association, Monday told the
third Coordination Council of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fishery in Maputo that "from last November when additional
tariffs were imposed upon the imported sugar to the end of April
this year, Mozambique has lost nearly one million U.S. Dollars
due to sugar smuggling and overpriced invoices."
</P>
<P>
In five and a half months, more than 20,000 tons of sugar were
smuggled into Mozambique, Ribeiro said, adding that all of the
legitimate importers escaped additional tariffs through
overpricing in the invoices.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the illegal activities have forced the
sugar producers in Xinavane and Mafambisse to reduce the prices
of their products.
</P>
<P>
If the situation is sustained, Ribeiro noted that it will
endanger the investment of 220 million U.S. Dollars under way or
in pipeline and some 25,000 jobs, let alone the achievement of
the goals in the growth of sugar industry, the development of
rural areas and the increase of export.
</P>
<P>
The industry leader disclosed that in May this year his
association sent some administrators to the customs to help
monitor all legal importation of sugar, greatly pre-empting the
forgeries in the receipts.
</P>
<P>
However, Ribeiro also voiced his concern because the customs
in Mozambique cannot monitor and curb sugar smuggling because no
governmental measures were taken in the respect.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb sugar import, crack down on smuggling and
encourage domestic producers to resume and develop sugar
production, the Mozambican government imposed additional tariffs
upon imported sugar at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Approximately, 120,000 tons of sugar are consumed in
Mozambique per annum, the Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that sugar output in the southern African
country will reach 32,000 tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Pak Continues to Accord Importance to Ties with Iran: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first policy statement since assuming his portfolio
early August, Aziz said Pakistan's relationship is based on common
historical, religious and cultural links.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Iran also have mutually beneficial cooperation in
trade, commercial and cultural fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan also appreciates Iran's position on the Kashmir
issue, and its offer of mediation which we have accepted but India
has rejected," the Foreign Minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's relations with Iran are marked by frequent
contacts at the leadership level. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
already visited Iran twice during his current term of office, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"It remains our constant endeavor to preserve the special
nature of the abiding and time-tested Pakistan-Iran ties and to
particularly guard against any negative fall-out on it of the
Afghan situation," the Foreign Minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the Pak-U.S. relations, Aziz said that the Pakistani
government is working with the U.S. for upholding human rights,
promoting privatization and a liberal market economy, and fighting
against drug trafficking and global terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"A common objective that Pakistan continues to share with the
U.S. is maintaining peace and stability in the region," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is currently engaged in a bilateral dialogue
with the U.S. on security and non-proliferation issues in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has made it clear that on these critical issues
Pakistan's position would be dictated by its supreme national
interests and that under no circumstances would it be coerced into
compromising its position," Aziz stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan hopes that "the U.S. administration will
show an understanding of its eminently reasonable stance and play
a positive role in easing tension in South Asia."

<HEADLINE> Asian Elephant Home In Southwestern China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pu Yunchang, 50, who used to be
a crack elephant hunter of the ethnic Jino people, is now head of
a model village for elephant protection in southwestern Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Pu's Baihua Village is situated at the fringe of a nature
reserve with 99,000-hectare of tropical forest in the
Xishuangbanna Prefecture of ethnic Dai group, home to endangered
animals including Asian elephants.
</P>
<P>
Pu said, "The forests are the last habitat of the wild
elephants, so our folks should become their good neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Pu and his villagers used to lived by hunting in the primitive
forests. But when the nature reserve was established, they moved
their village out of the reserve and handed their hunting rifles
over to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that with efforts from the villagers and local
governments, the number of wild elephants in Xishuangbanna has
increased to some 250 from 197 just 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Baihua Village and the adjacent areas are the haunt of about 50
wild elephants. During the harvest season, herds of elephants will
come by on the sly to eat the maize, soybeans and other grain
crops.
</P>
<P>
Some bold elephants even ramble into the village. Last fall, an
elephant slipped into the village at midnight, used its trunk to
steal the maize hanging under the eaves, and swaggered away until
it was finally stopped by the villagers.

<P>
Wild elephants often come to drink in the river in front of the
village, fearless of the villagers who wash their clothes nearby.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a wounded elephant was found in the
river. Villagers looked after it and reported the matter to the
local government immediately. The elephant was saved under the
care of the villagers and medical staff.
</P>
<P>
The frequent elephant visits have added spice to village life,
but at the same time it can also be a big headache for the local
farmers during harvest season. Satistics show that elephants eat
more than 30,000 kg of grain from Baihua Village
annually. Although the government offered some compensations to
the farmers, Pu Yunchang, head of the village, said that it was
only an amount worth one-third of the losses.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zhuang, commissioner of the Xishuangbanna Prefecture, said
that the local government will increase the compensation this
year. He added that there are plans to move the villages back from
the fringe of the nature reserve backwards so that villagers and
elephants can co-exist in harmony.

<HEADLINE> Official: No Major Epidemic Diseases in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Health Ministry
official said today at a news conference that there is no
prevalence of major epidemic diseases in China's seven
flood-stricken provinces and one autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health, said at a news conference
held by the Information Office of the State Council this afternoon
that the incidence of infectious diseases in the flooded areas has
maintained the same level as last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 22,728 medical teams and approximately
125,600 health workers have been sent to the flood-stricken areas
to offer their services in preventing and control epidemics.
Cooperating with the grass-roots health organizations, the medical
teams have provided timely treatment for people have been injured
or have fallen ill while fighting the floods.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of diseases spread by water or food poisoning
have been curbed in those areas, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent epidemic diseases, leading disaster relief and
disease prevention groups have been founded as part of the flood
control headquarters at various levels.
</P>
<P>
As millions of people have been surrounded by the floods or
become homeless, he noted, many of them are living in crowded
makeshift tents. The hot and humid weather in the south and
polluted drinking water have presented major problems for health
workers.
</P>
<P>
Colds, intestinal diseases and dermatitis have become common in
the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister went on to say that central China's Hubei
Province has adopted effective measures to prevent snail fever
among the one million local residents and armymen.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has urged local governments at various
levels and health departments to enhance disease prevention and
epidemic monitoring in the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji presided over a State Council meeting to
deploy the disease and epidemic-prevention units.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei and Hunan, east China's Jiangxi, Anhui
and Jiangsu provinces, and northeast China's Heilongjiang and
Jilin provinces, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
have been suffering from serious flooding since late June.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Plan for Post-Flood Epidemic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has announced an overall
plan to prevent and control major epidemic diseases in the flood
stricken areas. The plan will be implemented as soon as the floods
recede.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health, said today at a news
conference held by the Information Office of the State Council
that sanitation workers will launch a large-scale "carpet"
cleaning and disinfection campaign in those areas where the floods
have receded and the flood victims formerly lived.
</P>
<P>
He said the resettlement areas, garbage disposal areas, and
other places which could most easily trigger an outbreak of
epidemic diseases will also be the focus of repetitive cleanings.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that additional medical teams will be
sent in when the floods recede, and their duties will be disease
prevention and environmental cleansing aimed to eliminate
conditions which could lead to the spreading of epidemic and
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised that health workers will also help flood victims
to choose their drinking-water sources and monitor its quality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, health departments at various levels are also urged
to monitor the incidence of diseases and curb the spreading of
epidemics as soon as one case is reported.
</P>
<P>
The focus of disease prevention will be on villages, towns,
neighborhoods and households to ensure that each individual takes
preventative measures.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said he believes that so long as the leaders
and people in the flooded areas insist on this disease-prevention
campaign, China will see no outbreaks of major epidemic diseases
after the current flooding subsides.

is expected to use Tuesday's visit to Northern Ireland to announce
the emergency recall of parliament to push through anti-terrorist
legislation, The Daily Telegraph said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that during his visit, Blair would outline tough
new security measures in hopes to bring the Omagh bombers to
justice.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed 28 people and injured 220 nine days ago, the
deadliest atrocity in 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland
between the rival Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
But parliament speaker Betty Boothroyd has the final say on
whether to reconvene the session. If she approves, the likely
dates for the recall will be on next Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It would be only the fourteenth time since World War II that
members of parliament have been brought back for an emergency
session.
</P>
<P>
One of the main planks of the new security package is a
proposal that terrorists could be convicted of membership of a
banned organization on the sworn testimony of a senior police
officer.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has announced a series of
draconian anti-terrorist measures to crack down on terrorist acts
in the wake of the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
Blair is also expected to meet Ahern on Wednesday for talks
over joint actions against terrorism and over the historic
Northern Ireland peace accord signed last April.

</P>
<P>
Aziz, who assumed his office early this month, said that "we

Viewed in the light of dramatic global changes, the continuity

<HEADLINE> China to Use Grain Reserves to Control Prices if Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will use grain reserves to
keep down grain prices in flooded areas when necessary, Zhao
Qizheng, director of the Information Office of the State Council,
said here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"China has huge reserves of grain, which will not cause price
hikes," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 flooding, the United States, based on satellite
surveys, predicted that China's grain production would go down. As
a matter of fact, this didn't happen, because satellites couldn't
figure out the depths of floodwaters and the extent of flood
damage, nor the accurate grain output reduction.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Flooding of the Yangtze River
since early this summer had caused more than 38.4 billion yuan
(4.6 billion US dollars) in direct economic losses to central
China's Hubei Province by 20th of this month, an official source
said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The flooding, the worst since 1954, has affected 4.47 million
residents, damaged 2.54 million ha of cropland, and forced 9,769
enterprises to suspend or reduce production, Yang Yongliang, deputy
Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party
of China, said at a news briefing. Hubei has a population of 58.72
million.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River is more than 6,300 km long, the longest in
China. Its section that runs through Hubei is about 1,061-km
long.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and several
other senior officials got, at different times, to the flooded
areas to direct the anti-flood effort.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 2.3 million people, including some 82,900
troops of the People's Liberation Army and the armed police, are
countering floods along the embankments of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that the government at various
levels had, by August 20, issued 280 million yuan (33.7 million US
dollars) in relief funds and 47.3 million kg of relief grain to
flood victims in Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The flood-victims have been appropriately settled and their
basic living is effectively guaranteed, Yang said, adding that no
major epidemic diseases have been reported in the flooding areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yang told reporters, "the social order in the flooded
areas in stable and the people are calm,"
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the flood-control task remains gravely
arduous as the seventh flood crest of the Yangtze River, the most
ferocious this year, is expected to enter Hubei Province today.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Welcomes Chernomyrdin's Reinstatement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey welcomes the
reappointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as Russia's Prime Minister,
saying it would have positive impact on the Turkish-Russian ties,
the English-language newspaper Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of Turkish Foreign Ministry were quoted by the
paper as saying that the reinstatement of Chernomyrdin, a veteran
politician and ex-premier, was a positive development from
Turkey's point of view.
</P>
<P>
"For five years Chernomyrdin has been familiar with the
Turkish-Russian relations. He knows all the dimensions and
profound potentialities of the relations between the two
countries," said one official.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the paper, Turkish Ambassador in
Moscow Nabi Sensoy said that Chernomyrdin's return to the Russian
government was good news for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin became the prime minister in December 1992 and
was replaced by the 35-year-old Sergei Kiriyenko only five months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Kireyenko's ouster came one week after the Russian government
and the central bank raised the ceiling of the ruble's exchange
corridor from 6.3 to 9.5 rubles to the U.S. dollar, which
amounted to a devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry sources believed that the current
financial crisis in Russia, which is a major trade partner of
Turkey, would not have direct negative impact on the bilateral
political relations and the recently accelerated economic
cooperation.

Water levels on sections of the Yangtze River between
Shashi-Luoshan and Wuxue-Jiujiang, at Dongting and Poyang lakes,

<HEADLINE> Boeing Hopes to Introduce New Aircraft to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing company hopes that
China will accept its newly developed Boeing-717-200 passenger
aircraft, said Raymond Bracy, president of Boeing China Inc. here
today.
</P>
<P>
He told the "Boeing-717 China Conference" which opened here
today that this new model, which has been undergoing test flights,
will officially be put into operation in June, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Bracy, the Boeing company plans to sell China over
1,900 civil aircrafts worth over 120 billion U.S. dollars in the
next 20 years, making it the second largest Boeing market after
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Company representatives told Chinese aviation officials
attending the conference that the Boeing-717-200 is a 100-seater
equipped with the most advanced avionics technology and an engine
made by BMW/Rolls Royce. It features low noise and low
fuel-consumption.
</P>
<P>
The branch-line aircraft was previously the MD-95 model which
changed to its present name after the merger of the Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas companies.
</P>
<P>
A United State airline which has ordered 50 Boeing-717-200s is
expected to become the first to have the model.
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, Boeing has sold China about 300 Boeing aircraft of
seven series worth a total of 15 billion U.S. dollars. Over the
past three years, one in every ten Boeing planes has become part
of a Chinese airline.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, China will need 2,000 new passenger
planes over the next twenty years with an annual growth rate of
9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's conference, sponsored by Boeing China Inc., focuses on
the development, function, and after-sale service of the new
model.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Should Demonstrate Sincerity With Action (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities should
demonstrate their sincerity for "seeking reunification of China"
with actual deeds, according to an official from the State
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking in today's exclusive interview with the
Xinhua News Agency, pointed out the Taiwan authorities continue to
lack sincerity in their pursuit of peaceful reunification. He
noted that recent speeches have vacillated between "the
reunification of China" and "an insistence on splittist
activities."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have advocated expanded cross-Straits
economic and cultural exchanges which would undoubtedly have a
positive effect, but have nonetheless used recent meetings as
forums to claim status as "an independent state" and attempt to
"explore expanded international living space" in an effort to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities recently demanded that some western nations,
especially the United States, increase arms sales to Taiwan in
order to ensure "the governments of Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland remain separate," and firmly rejected the "concept
of 'one country, two systems'" which has been successfully
implemented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The developing international situation and improving
cross-Straits relations have resulted in an increasing number of
Taiwan compatriots expressing their eagerness for a more friendly
and stable environment and hope for political negotiations between
the two sides at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland has attempted to satisfy the common desire
of Taiwan compatriots by proposing initial discussions to outline
procedural arrangements for political negotiations, and subsequent
economic and practical negotiations between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Should Demonstrate Sincerity With Action (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent reiteration Taiwan authorities made to "sign a
cross-Straits peace agreement through negotiations and end the
state of hostility" resulted from mounting internal and external
pressure and was ostensibly the premise for "negotiations."
</P>
<P>
However, the actual goal of the premise -- to "separate the
government of China on the existing basis" -- centers on defying
the "one China" principle and continuing to delay negotiations for
"ending cross-Straits hostilities."
</P>
<P>
The official said Taiwan authorities should exhibit their
sincerity by abandoning the "two Chinas" stand and removing
barriers hindering discussions concerning procedural arrangements
for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said ARATS is seeking a common understanding based on
strengthening contacts with SEF, and is perfectly willing to
engage in political dialog with the latter so long as related
contacts will benefit the peaceful reunification of China and the
development of cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office
recently reiterated they welcome SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his
delegation to visit the mainland in either mid-September or
mid-October. With the exception of those who stubbornly insist on
the "independence of Taiwan," the mainland side will be delighted
to exchange views with Taiwan residents from various parties and
all walks of life concerning cross-Straits relations and China's
peaceful reunification, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS official concluded the interview by noting that
Chinese people on both sides of the straits should join hands and
make new contributions to the cross-Straits relations and the
reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Asks Dismissed Cabinet Members to Work Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree on Tuesday, asking members of the dismissed
cabinet to continue their work until a new Russian government is
formed.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that under the decree deputy
prime ministers and federal ministers will continue performing
their duties until a new cabinet is formed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed ex-prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his
entire cabinet and named Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting prime
minister last Sunday, which brought a governmental crisis to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko had already turned down an offer by Yeltsin to be
the first deputy prime minister in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made it clear on Monday that he won't form a new
Cabinet until the State Duma approves his nomination as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma declared that it will confirm the nomination of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister in 10 days instead of the seven
days stipulated by legislation.

<HEADLINE> NZ Growth Strongly Linked With Asia: NZ Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith said here Tuesday evening that
New Zealand should not "turn its back on Asia" because of its
current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand's growth and development will always be strongly
linked with Asia," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he was addressing the annual general
meeting of the Wellington Branch of New Zealand Institute of
International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"No one in the New Zealand Government has ever underestimated
the seriousness of the turmoil in Asia. Asian economies account
for half our top 20 export destinations," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the effect of the Asian economic crisis so far
has been significant on New Zealand's key sectors, such as
forestry export.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, none of this is to suggest that New Zealand
"should turn its back on Asia" because of its current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said, "there continue to be good opportunities in services
such as tourism and education."
</P>
<P>
"Longer-term, Asian markets will continue to be our natural
trade, tourism and investment partners into the future.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they don't offer the levels of economic growth seen in
the past, they will offer strong, more sustainable rates of growth
in the future," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand minister noted that nothing is more certain
than that Asia will recover. "The only question is how long it
will take."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Plays Major Role in Combating Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- While combating the raging flood
waters of the Yangtze River, the People's Liberation Army and the
armed police force have so far dispatched some 175,000 soldiers to
participate in resue operations.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest military deployment in the Yangtze River
Basin since 1949, and the soldiers are playing a decisive role in
protecting people's lives and state and individual property, said
Ma Shukuan, a major-general of the PLA General Political
Department, at a news conference held by the Information Office of
the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, another 95,000 soldiers have been sent to
fight the flooding along the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The army has dispatched motor vehicles, ships, planes and
helicopters along with the soldiers who have saved and removed to
safe places 11.54 million people trapped by the floodwaters, and
reinforced dikes with a combined length of more than 5,900
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
These soldiers have also plugged breaches and eliminated
trouble spots at 5,690 places and helped transport goods totaling
78.37 million tons, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
The infinite loyalty to the country and the people, as well as
high sense of responsibility displayed by both men and officers of
the PLA have been highly praised by the Party and government
leaders and have won the admirations of the general public who
have provided easy accesses and material support to the army's
operations, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Lower Tax Boosts Lake Victoria's Cargo Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Cargo transportation business
has picked up at Lake Vicoria's Kisumu Port in western Kenya in
the last week thanks to a 21 percent reduction of tariffs on
transit cargo taking effect on August 1.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that a number of traders, who had shunned the
port due to what they termed as exorbitant charges, now resume
cargo business between Kisumu and Mwanza, Tanzania, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cargo business between Kisumu and the Tanzanian ports of
Mwanza and Bukoba have not picked up since the Tanzanian giant
steamer, the motor vessel Bukoba, sank with more than 700 people
and about 100 tons of cargo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Besides the alleged high tariffs, cargo business across the
lake had also been seriously hampered by the hyacinth weed, which
blocked the Kisumu pier, immobilizing smaller boats and forcing
larger ones to spend long hours and more fuel to dock.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the hyacinth invasion, many traders opted to
transport goods from Kisumu's container depot and from the Kisumu
port to Mwanza by road.
</P>
<P>
Now with the weed cleared by strong winds and tariffs reduced,
the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), which manages the port, is
expecting a business boom.
</P>
<P>
With the revised charges, it will now cost 66,000 Shillings
(1,100 U.S. Dollars) to transport a container one way from Kisumu
to Mwanza, down from 84,000 Shillings (1,400 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new tariffs will especially benefit the importers of
cotton from Tanzania and coffee from Uganda, who use the Kisumu
port, said officials at the Kisumu port.
</P>
<P>
The KRC is also expected to take more measures to improve its
lake service and security of lake traveling.

<P>
Changjiang, one most severely affected counties, reported 115
dry reservoirs and ponds are dry and disrupted water flow in 12
rivers and streams.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Xiamen in east
China's Fujian province will become one of the four permanent
production bases of the Dell Computer Corp. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
John J. Legere, president of Dell Computer Asia-Pacific, said
his company has drafted a long-term strategic plan for the
construction and development of this new production base.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's fastest growing computer market. It is
estimated that by the year 2002, China's PC market will be four
times what it is today, with some 10.6 million units on the market
by then, which will make it the largest market in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Dell Computer Corp., the world's leading direct marketer of
computer systems, began direct sales recently in China. Direct
computer sales is a two-tiered business operation based on a
direct relationship between the manufacturer and the customer,
without intermediaries such as distributors and retailers.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Dell Computer Corp.'s direct
sales will have nine locations in such major Chinese cities as
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Customers can place order through telephone or on internet, and
receive Dell's "built-to-order" service which is uniform around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Dell Computer Corp. has founded a China customers center in
Xiamen, which combines production, marketing and customer hotline
service.
</P>
<P>
Dell Xiamen Company, with a registered investment of 15 million
U.S. dollars, now mass-produces desktops, laptops and servers,
targeted at the Chinese market, in its Xiamen production centers.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of Gonorrhoea
cases is increasing sharply in Wellington, capital of New Zealand,
according to a Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Tuesday quoted Hilary Andrews, clinical director
of Wellington Sexual Health Service, as saying that 21 cases had
been diagnosed in the past six weeks, compared with 22 in the area
for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease and is caught by
having sex without a condom with an infected person. The
incubation is from one to 10 days, so infection can spread
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The symptom for men is a discharge from the penis while
urinating, but women usually have no symptoms and are diagnosed
only when their partner tests positive.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Opposition Vows to Continue Election Vigils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's opposition parties
Tuesday vowed to maintain a 24-hour vigil in front of the National
Assembly which began from Monday until their complaints about
election irregularities are resolved and Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen steps down.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in protest is led by former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, head of the Sam Rainsy Party, and leaders of the Funcinpec
and some other small parties.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who returned from
Bangkok Monday, joined Sam Rainsy Tuesday and made an anti-Hun Sen
speech to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
About ten thousand opposition supporters are expected to take
part in Tuesday's vigil and protest.
</P>
<P>
In a Funcinpec-Sam Rainsy Party joint statement on Sunday, the
opposition threatened more mass demonstrations if their complaints
about election irregularities are not addressed by August 29, when
the official results of country's July 26 election are due to be
released.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that so far at least two violent attacks have
taken place by opposition supporters on bystanders perceived to be
Vietnamese during the march.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the escalating violence and prolonged uncertainty
after the election would affect the establishment of a new
government and risk scaring away foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Early results showed that Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party
won the election, although it may not have enough parliamentary
seats to rule alone.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties, who accused Hun Sen of stuffing the
ballot box, refused to accept the preliminary official results or
the coalition offer proposed by Hun Sen.

<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua)-- Travelers to Lhasa, capital of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, no longer need burden themselves with
bringing along articles for daily use, as they now can get almost
anything they need in the bustling markets in Lhasa on the "roof
of the world".
</P>
<P>
Shops and restaurants run by businessmen from Sichuan, Qinghai,
Shaanxi, Zhejiang and other provinces can be found everywhere on
the streets on the plateau city.
</P>
<P>
In the department store, sweaters made in Shanghai, cosmetics
from Guangdong, Japan-made electrical appliances, French perfumes,
and small articles from India and Nepal are readily available.
</P>
<P>
The night bazaar on the plateau, with a widen assortment
of goods, is even more charming.
</P>
<P>
A man from Henan sells about 10 kilograms of roasted sweet
potatos every night. He said that the sweet potatos are very cheap
in his hometown, and sell very well here.
</P>
<P>
A young man named Liu from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
Province, runs a handicraft shop. His goods including photo frames
and music boxes from Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wenzhou all enjoy
popularity on the market.
</P>
<P>
Early in the 1980s, Lhasa had no marketplace except on Bargor
Street. Visitors to Tibet always complained that there was little
available to buy.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from other provinces began to set up stalls in
Lhasa in 1985, but the market didn't take off until 1992 when a
set of policies were carried out to encourage businessmen to
invest in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Regional Department for Industry and Commerce,
thousands of enterprises from about 20 provinces and regions of
China are now doing business in Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Clamp Down on Pirate Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government and state TV
stations are to launch a crackdown on pirate satellite TV stations
in the coming weeks, Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to take action since the situation has become
intolerable and spread so quickly in a very harmful and chaotic
way," Naoum Farah, a lawyer hired by TV stations to sue the
illegal satellite operators, said.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
Abdel Monem Youssef has also said that a crackdown on pirate TV
stations is on the way, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Written protests have been filed with the Ministry of Post
and Telecommunications by satellite channels, complaining of piracy
and abuse of intellectual property rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are about 600 to 700 pirate satellite TV stations, some of
whom even broadcast pornographic movies and advertisements to
their subscribers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Farah estimated that over 1 million viewers in 200,000 homes
are subscribing to these illegal satellite TV stations, paying a
subscription fee of 6.6 to 10 U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
He said the lawsuits would be filed only against the "big and
known operators" across the country.
</P>
<P>
"We can not file against all the 600 or 700 illegal operators,
so we will target the big fish and the small ones will get the
message and stop their activities," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said this morning that Chinese people are waging a united battle
against a serious flood rarely seen in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
"The battle against flooding shows the cohesiveness of the
Chinese nation and the close friendship between the People's
Liberation Army and common citizens," said Jiang during a meeting
with a delegation from the board of directors of the U.S.-based
Associated Press (AP).
</P>
<P>
He said, "I also would like to take this opportunity to express
our thanks to the governments of various countries and their
people for their concern for and support to China which is
combating the floods."
</P>
<P>
AP Chairman Donald Newhouse and President and CEO
Louis Boccardi voiced the delegation's deep concern for the
suffering of Chinese citizens during this year's floods.
</P>
<P>
Jiang responded to questions concerning the future of
Sino-U.S. relations, the Taiwan issue and the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Sino-U.S. relations and noted the highly
successful reciprocal visits by the presidents of the two nations
promoted bilateral relations to a new stage, and have opened even
greater prospects for exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The summits, according to Jiang, not only helped deepen
understanding and strengthen friendship between peoples in the two
nations, but also resulted in major progress in building a
constructive and strategic Sino-U.S. partnership geared to the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We are approaching the turn of the century and healthy and
stable Sino-U.S. relations reflect the common aspirations of
peoples in both countries," said Jiang. "Close relations will also
promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world at large, and will comply with the trends and
requirements of the times."
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his belief that the two sides can remove all
obstacles and bring healthy and stable Sino-U.S. relations into
the next century so long as they proceed from the fundamental
interests of the people of China and the United States and of the
world at large, consider and handle the two countries' relations
from a strategic and long-term perspective, strictly abide by the
principles set in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, properly
deal with the differences between the two sides and, in
particular, properly handle the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the AP, which has exchanged news with the Xinhua
News Agency since the early 1970's, as one of the world's most
influential news agencies.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the two agencies will continue to strengthen
cooperation and communications in journalism and various other
fields," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived in Beijing on Sunday at the
invitation of the Xinhua News Agency, will also visit Xi'an,
Shanghai, Guilin and Hong Kong.

in the third century BC. They mixed with Han and other
nationalities and settled in present-day Xinjiang in the middle of
the ninth century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reporting System Helps Stamp Out Corruption in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Procuratorial organs in the
Chinese capital of Beijing have handled 49,714 cases of official
corruption since a reporting system was introduced in 1988.
</P>
<P>
By using a hotline, correspondence and interviews, the public
has provided tips in over 60 percent of the cases involving graft,
dereliction of duty and the violation of people's rights which
have been accepted and handled by procuratorial organs during the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 52 million yuan (about 6.3 million U.S.
dollars) have been retrieved for the state as a result of these
cases.
</P>
<P>
The People's Procuratorate in Beijing's Western District
opened the first hotline for reporting economic crimes on January
1, 1988, and the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate set up a
corruption-reporting center in August of the same year, with
branch offices around the city.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, 210 senior officials above the bureau chief level
have been reported as being corrupt, among which 195 cases
involved at least one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Recently exposed cases include one involving an official with
the People's Construction Bank who, when he worked as a top
officer in one of the bank's Beijing branch offices, accepted
bribes and embezzled funds totaling more than one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zhengguo, head of the Installation Management Department
of Air China, was recently found guilty of dereliction of duty by
the reporting system, which led to losses of over 8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The presence and force of the reporting system have caused 523
law-breakers to turn themselves in to authorities during the last
ten years, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Rejects Resignation of Envoy on Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has rejected the resignation of Iran's special envoy on
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi, local daily Tehran Times
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi submitted his resignation last week after his
efforts failed to find out the whereabouts of 11 Iranian diplomats
allegedly kidnapped by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Iran has alleged that the Taliban forces kidnapped these
Iranian diplomats and a reporter of the official news agency IRNA
in Mazari Sharif of northern Afghanistan on August 8 when the
militia took control of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban rejected Iran's claim, saying that the
Iranian consulate in the city was evacuated when their forces
reached there and they have no information about the whereabouts
of these Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry has been widely accused of failing to
acquire advance information about the fall of Mazari Sharif, the
main stronghold of the Tehran-backed opposition Northern Alliance
led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who is still recognized by
the international community as the legal ruler of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, President Khatami summoned Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi and his deputies to discuss the situation in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi criticized Boroujerdi for his inefficient role on the
Afghan affairs, but Boroujerdi contended that he was not provided
necessary facilities for performing his duties properly.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi, former deputy foreign minister for Asia-pacific
affairs, was named as Iran's special envoy on Afghan affairs
after President Khatami took office in August last year.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Retire Power Station Loan on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts said today
that the China is fully capable of retiring World Bank loans for
the nation's largest hydropower station constructed this century
on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for China to pay 1.75 billion US dollars in
principal and interest on the loans by the year 2015. The loans
are being used to construct the Ertan Hydropower Station which
entered partial operations two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng, general manager of the Ertan Hydropower
Development Co. Ltd., said the Ministry of Finance has guaranteed
the loan repayment.
</P>
<P>
The stations, located on the Yalong River, a tributary of the
Yangtze River, in Panzhihua, Sichuan Province, will have six
generators with a combined generating capacity of 3.3 million
kilowatts/hour.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which will be constructed at a cost of 28.55 billion
yuan (3.44 billion US dollars), will mainly supply power to
Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality prior to entering
full-scale operations.
</P>
<P>
"World Bank inspections carried out in recent years have
granted Class-A ratings to all the Ertan projects involving
related loans," said Liu Junfeng
</P>
<P>
The general manager attributed the success of the project to
the introduction of international financing and bidding, and the
extensive use of advanced technology and management methods.
</P>
<P>
However, unnamed sources indicated that bank officials
conducted a recent inspection and expressed some concern
concerning the future marketing of power.
</P>
<P>
Wang Keming, deputy chief engineer in charge of the loan
project, expressed certainty the plant will have adequate users
and that rates will easily ensure that both principal and interest
will be paid on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the annual per capita power consumption
in Sichuan stands at a mere 600 kWh, or less than 10 percent of
that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He projected that the demand for power will grow substantially
with the closure of a large number of thermal power stations built
in the 1950s, and the progress being made in restructuring
state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Living Buddha Completes Basic Buddhism Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- While most 14-year-old boys would
quite likely consider reciting sutras several hours a day as
somewhat boring, O'kying Chilai, the 17th Garmaba Living Buddha in
the Tibet Autonomous Region, regards the activity as a sacred part
of his life.
</P>
<P>
The young Living Buddha, a member of Kagyudpa School from the
White Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, followed in his predecessors
footsteps and recently completed basic studies of Buddhism in the
Curbo Monastery.
</P>
<P>
The Living Buddha has memorized more than 4,000 sutras and
reached a fourth grade level in mandarin.
</P>
<P>
Senior lamas and laymen language instructors have expressed
great admiration for intelligence and diligence.
</P>
<P>
The lama in charge of the young man's daily life points out
that he arises promptly at 05:00 every morning and immediately
prays and chants scriptures for an hour. He spends most the day
studying sutras, and presides over meetings with followers for an
hour each.
</P>
<P>
He occasionally reads famous literary classics, with King
Gessar, a Tibetan epic containing 10 million characters, purported
to be his favorite.
</P>
<P>
The Living Buddha joins more than 370 lamas living in the
monastery to celebrate a major holiday which falls on June 4th
according to the Tibetan lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
The activities performances of Tibetan folk art and videotapes
of adapted Chinese classics such as "A Pilgrimage to the West" and
"Outlaws of the Marsh".
</P>
<P>
The Kagyudpa School introduced the reincarnation system for
living Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
Lamas from the Curbo Monastery, located 70 kilometers from
Lhasa in southwestern Tibet, followed instructions in the will
left by the 16th Garmaba Living Buddha and conducted a search for
the reincarnated soul boy.
</P>
<P>
The search led them to eight-year-old O'kying Chilai who lived
on a ranch in eastern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The young boy became the first reincarnated Living Buddha the
central government approved following the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Chickens Control Grasslands Locust Infestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 chickens and tens of
thousands of starlings have proved to be the most effective means
for controlling locust infesting 174,500 hectares of grasslands in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Previous attempts to use manpower and aircraft to curb the
locust infestation failed.
</P>
<P>
The chickens undergo a special 60-day training program shortly
after birth and numerous nests were placed in the area earlier
this year to attract starling, a small migratory bird measuring 20
cm in length.
</P>
<P>
Starlings spend the summer in northern China and migrate to the
south in winter.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Youth Daily quoted an official with the Xinjiang
Pest Control Headquarters as saying that locusts have infested
approximately a fourth of Xinjiang's grassland areas since the
beginning of summer, He cited this year's infestation as the worst
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have infested housing complexes, shops and office
buildings in urban areas surrounding Urumqi, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture allocated 3.5 million yuan (422,000
US dollars) to establish a regional locust control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the fact that most of the locusts jump rather than
fly has lessened the severity of this summer's infestation.
</P>
<P>
The birds have helped to basically control the infestation
this summer and locust monitoring stations have been set up at the
autonomous regional, prefectural and county levels.

<P>
TAIYUAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A great number of Stone Age
sites have been found in areas in north China's Shanxi Province
that will be submerged after completion of a reservoir on the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists are rescuing the relics in the sites
and moving them to safer places before the inundation.
</P>
<P>
The sites include a pottery kiln from some 4,700 years ago and
the remains of some 300 neolithic dwellings, stoves, and rubbish pits.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the pottery kiln is one of the
best preserved of its kind, with details that will help recover
the pottery-making procedure used at that remote time.
</P>
<P>
National and local archaeologists have been researching and
excavating the sites since the beginning of this decade when the
country decided to build the Xiaoliangdi Reservoir.

TAIYUAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly six million yuan has been
invested to conserve four huge oxen dating back to the middle Tang
Dynasty (618-907) in Yongji City in north China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-year-old oxen, discovered at Pujindu Harbor, were

mountain, in August 1989. The iron objects weigh 146 tons, about
one fourth of the total iron output of the Kaiyuan Period
(713-741).

<P>
SOFIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's Trade and Tourism
Minister Valentin Vassilev said that the country is trying
to find ways to solve trade and tourism problems with Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after meeting with the directors of the
tourist resorts on the northern Black Sea city of Varna, he
attached particular importance to relations between Russia and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"We must be ready to talk with any government. Governments go,
and Bulgaria and Russia stay," he referred to Bulgarian President
Petar Stoyanov's visit to Moscow later this month.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov had said his trip to Moscow would facilitate the
growth of Bulgarian-Russian ties and the move toward a more
transparent and pragmatic relationship.
</P>
<P>
Russian tour managers and journalists will be invited to
Bulgaria in late September. The idea has been suggested because of
the 10 to 30 percent fall in the number of Russian holiday makers
in Bulgaria this season.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Bulgaria enjoyed close relations in politics,
economy and trade in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
But sofia has distanced itself from Moscow in recent years as
Russia was unhappy with Bulgaria's bid for membership of the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
recently spent about 2 million U.S. dollars in providing food to
displaced families in the country's war-torn north.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission General of Essential Services
Department, the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu,
Mannar and Vavuniya in Northern province have 58,000, 8,900,
13,000, 16,000 and 5,500 displaced families respectively at
present, department sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sources said the department maintains 342
welfare centers in 15 districts in the country and the 38,800
families in these centers are also given free meals.
</P>
<P>
Rations are graded according to the size of each family and a
family gets a maximum of 1,260 rupees (some 20 U.S. dollars) worth
of goods per month which include sugar, dhal, wheat, flour and
milk powder.
</P>
<P>
Around 8,000 fishermen who have lost their income due to
restricted fishing because of tight security in the northwestern
coastal area are also issued rations, the sources added.

<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamil, the major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the government
for a separate state in the north and east of the country since
1983. 55,000 people have been reportedly killed in the war which

NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- India's tea major Tata Tea
company is expected to acquire 21 more tea gardens in Sri Lanka in
a bid to globalize its tea production and marketing base, Tata Tea
sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The company has already acquired 23 gardens in Sri Lanka and
tea production from these gardens amounts to about 6 million
kilograms. With the proposed acquisition, the number of gardens to
be run by Tata Tea in Sri Lanka would come to 44 and the company's
Sri Lankan ventures would ensure an additional supply of about 12
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of the current fiscal year, Tata
Tea's exports to Russia was up by 11 million kilograms. India was
in a much more advantageous position vis-a-vis its competitors of
Sri Lanka and Kenya because of a rupee-ruble agreement, Tata Tea
Managing Director S. M. Kidwai said.
</P>
<P>
Once things stabilize, the Russian buyers would tilt toward
India to cash on the rupee-ruble opportunity as Russian buyers
would have to pay hard currency if they import from other
countries, he said.

Los Angeles, August 24 (Xinhua) -- California Governor Pete
Wilson Monday signed a state bill that bans any new taxes on
Internet activities for the next three years, calling on
U.S. Congress and the President to enact a federal version.
</P>
<P>
The new state bill, The California Internet Tax Freedom Act,
imposes a moratorium on taxes for any internet activity, including
online purchases and server accounts. Under the act, Internet
companies that are based in California but do manufacturing in
other states or ship their products to other states will be exempt
from California sales tax.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe that the new measure is intended to
help companies dependent on the Internet create new products,

<P>
Representatives of high-tech industries welcomed the new law.
</P>
<P>
"For California's economy and its citizens, growth in electronic
commerce means new jobs," the American Electronics Association said in

encourage the growth of electronic commerce and enhance the
opportunities available for Californians to find work in cyberspace
or related service industries."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Pose Threat to Local Ones: Thai Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-run banks will be
biggest competitors for local banks in the future, Chartsiri
Sophonpanich, president of Bangkok Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Tuesday quoted the Bangkok Bank president as
saying Thailand's banks are poised to split into three groups
after the recent comprehensive financial reform package.
</P>
<P>
The first group would comprise Thai banks which have raised
capital and would remain under local control.
</P>
<P>
This group includes Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank, Bank of
Ayudhya, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Military Bank, all of which
are similar in terms of operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The second group would be state-run institutions such as Krung
Thai Bank, Radanasin Bank and Krungthai Thanakit, which would gain
strengths and experience some weaknesses through ties to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Local banks owned by foreign financial institutions will form
the third group, which will pose the largest competitive threat in
the future, Chartsiri said.
</P>
<P>
This group, including Bank of Asia under ABN-Amro and Thai Danu
Bank controlled by the Development Bank of Singapore, would
benefit from information technology and management systems
transferred from their foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, plans to
improve efficiency and productivity to meet the challenges ahead,
Chartsiri said.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank may lose its top position in the country's banking
sector after the Krung Thai Bank absorbs assets and good debts of
Bangkok Bank of Commerce and First Bangkok City Bank under the
reform package.
</P>
<P>
However, Chartsiri said the bank has never been concerned about
asset size. Instead quality is of primary concern, he added.

<HEADLINE> RBI Likely to Announce New Policy Favorable of IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) is expected to announce a new policy soon in favor of the
country's information technology (IT) and software development, a
government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new policy exclusively deals with working capital for
information technology and the software development and service
sector to be provided by scheduled commercial banks. As part of
the proposed policy, the banks would be advised to advance up to
25 percent of the project-wise export or domestic contract value
for a term of 18 months and also treat IT software and services as
a priority sector for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled commercial banks lending to infotech software and
services exporters would be made eligible for RBI refinancing with
considerably low interest rates. They would also be allowed to
invest in dedicated capital funds meant for the infotech industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the broad guidelines of the proposed national informatics
policy being formulated by a task force appointed within the Prime
Minister's Office, 1 to 3 percent of every government ministry's
outlay should be earmarked for expenditure on information
technology and every department in the central government and
state governments would have to adopt and implement a five-year IT
action plan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed policy, the basic eligibility and
upper limit for the funding by scheduled commercial banks would be
based on the annual turnover level and export performance of the
applicant companies, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Sell Foreign Property for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is going to put on sale
stately homes and mansions once used as ambassadorial residences
and commercialize some embassy premises in prime locations
overseas in an effort to improve the government's shaking fiscal
position.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the sale and commercial use of former and
existing embassy premises will go to the state coffers to make up
for expected huge shortfalls in tax collection amid the economic
downturn, the newspaper The Nation reported Tuesday, quoting
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak Chutikul.
</P>
<P>
Among prime properties to be sold are the Thai ambassador's
former residence outside London worth between 300 million and 400
million baht (7.5 million to 10 million U.S. dollars) and a former
ambassadorial home adjacent to the Vienna Woods in Vienna
estimated at 200 million to 300 million baht (5 million to 7.5
million dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said embassies will be asked to make calculations
on whether it would be more cost-efficient to consider a long-term
lease for embassies or offices instead of buying new properties or
maintaining existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already recalled 30 percent of its overseas
workforce at embassies throughout the world. At present, there are
about 1,600 officials at the Thai Foreign Ministry. Of these only
about 400 Thai diplomats and auxiliary staff are stationed abroad.

<HEADLINE> Heroine of Disney's New Cartoon Found a Native of Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 25 (Xinhua) -- After years of study, Chinese
researchers have determined that the hometown of Hua Mulan, the heroine
of Walt Disney's newest cartoon film "Mulan," is in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that the heroine, whose real surname was Wei,
was born about 1,300 years ago in today's Yucheng County in Henan.
</P>
<P>
A tomb and a hall can still be seen there memorializing the
brave woman, who served in the army in place of her old and sickly
father. Her identity was kept secret until the war ended.
</P>
<P>
Many poets and writers through the ages have praised Mulan in
their works. In the memorial hall there are two stone tablets
telling of Mulan's life and exploits.
</P>
<P>
To memorize the ancient heroine, local people named a new
railway station, 2.5 k.m. from the memorial hall, as Mulan Station
in 1996. And several tourist companies in Henan are now busy
preparing tour grograms leading up to Mulan's hometown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses India, Pakistan to Join Arms Control Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States tried to
press India and Pakistan into joining the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty during a meeting on Monday in Washington between
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Indian envoy
Jaswant Singh, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott will also travel to London on Tuesday to meet Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the talks with both countries is to explore how
the U.S. and the international community can work with India and
Pakistan to bring them back into the international
nonproliferation consensus, reduce tensions and address their
security concerns," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth round of talks the U.S. has held with India
and Pakistan aimed at easing tensions in South Asia since they
conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The State Department disclosed no details about the talks, but
India still appeared to resist signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We will not come under any pressure and sign a treaty that is
against the interests of our country," Kushabhau Thakre, president
of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said on Sunday that it would seek to include its
dispute with India over the Jammu and Kashmir region in its talks
with Talbott.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that this (nuclear) issue cannot be discussed
in isolation. We have to consider peace and security within the
region and within that the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir," a
foreign ministry official said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Millionaire Yang Professes Investment Enthusiasm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Pan Qing
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- "I'll always be an enthusiastic
investor," said Yang Huading, or the legendary Shanghai
Millionaire Yang who has been largely ignored by his friends.
</P>
<P>
The former warehouse gatekeeper quit his government job some 10
years ago and joined the first wave of Chinese investors to enter
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Yang increased his limited capital by trading government bonds
which China introduced in the early 1980s. Investors at the time
faced difficulty in cashing bonds since only a few outlets in
Shanghai, Yang's home, handled related transactions.
</P>
<P>
Yang and his colleagues paid uniformed investors low prices for
their bonds and in turn sold same to government outlets at a
profit. "I once paid 70 yuan bonds valued at 100 yuan," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange opened in December 1990 and Yang
became one of the pioneers trading on the nation's first
bourse. Yang earned his nickname by consistently completing deals
worth around one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The former leader of local stock investors faded from the
limelight as wealthy investors flocked to stocks.
</P>
<P>
Yang currently lives in self-imposed seclusion in a common
apartment. "I haven't been downtown in 10 years and I don't
participate in recreational activities," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
His main activity centers on presenting a weekly lecture to
investors in Nanjing, capital of neighboring Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang works at home and completes transactions via his computer
or telephone everyday between 09:00 and 15:00. The virtual hermit
closely monitors radio and television reports, and reads at least
five newspapers daily. All of his activities center on finances
and investment.
</P>
<P>
His three-line business card reads: Millionaire Wang; common
stock investor in Shanghai; professor at the Shenyang Financial
Institute.
</P>
<P>
"A short 10 years ago, most Chinese were indulged in debates
as to whether stock markets belong to socialism or capitalism. I
opted to take a change and became directly involved in stocks,"
said Yang.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to role I've played in the development of China's
stock market, I quite frankly was 'the first man who dared eat the
crab'," says Yang. The once brilliant young investor appeared much
more mature during a television appearance some two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Many people view Millionaire Yang as simply one of the
country's 34 million stock investors. China is now home to a
number of millionaires and, in fact, a growing number of
billionaires.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  Myanmar Searches for Missing Airliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities are
launching a search operation for a missing airliner of the
state-run Myanmar Airways which was lost on Monday over Tachilek,
eastern Shan state bordering Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar, the Fokker XY-AEN with more than 20 local Myanmar
passengers on board was on a domestic flight (UB-635) from Yangon
to Tachilek Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
When reaching Tachilek airspace 3,000 meters above the airport,
the aircraft reported to the airport traffic control tower that it
could not land due to bad weather condition as it was raining in
the area and turned back to a nearby airport, the Heho.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, contact was lost with the aircraft, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Search operation is under way with the help of other aircraft
and helicopters, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Airways is operating its internal flight services
with a fleet of seven Fokker-27 and three Fokker-28 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on January 27 this year, a Myanmar Airways' passenger
plane Fokker-27 with 41 passengers and four crew members aboard
crashed at Thandwe, Southwestern Rakhine state of the country,
killing 14 persons including two French and an Italian and
injuring 20 others.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Slovak Economy Grows Fast, Problems Loom Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With fast growth and low
inflation in recent years, the Slovak economy has become one of
the best in Central and Eastern Europe, but problems are waiting
in the wings.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak economy suffered a serious setback in 1993 when the
country gained independence, with a 3.7 percent decline in the
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
However, the Slovak government took great pains in promoting
market economy, adjusting economic policies, tightening control
over its macro-economy, reshaping industrial structure, slashing
public expenditures, encouraging export and attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts paid off. The Slovak economy started to
recover in 1994. Besides a growth rate of 4.9 percent in 1994,
Slovakia achieved an annual growth of 6.8, 6.9 and 6 percent from
1995 to 1997. The growth for 1998 is estimated at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its industrial production, which has been on the rise over the
recent years, increased by 4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade, which stood at 21.3 billion U.S. dollars last
year, shot up by 76 percent as compared with that of 1993.
</P>
<P>
With the economy on the mend, Slovakia's inflation rate dropped
by a large margin, from 23.2 percent in 1993 to 6 percent in
1997. Inflation is expected to remain at 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil and the Russian financial crisis,
that have sent shockwaves to many countries, have hardly affected
Slovakia. The stock and currency markets stay stable in the
country. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the koruna
has been kept within the range of 1:32 and 1:35 in recent years.
</P>
<P>
And no depreciation is expected of the Slovak currency this
year.
</P>
<P>
But problems loom large.
</P>
<P>
First, budget deficits are expected to rise by 50 percent from
37 billion koruna (more than 1 billion dollars) in 1997 to 51.3
billion koruna (about 1.5 billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the weak financial system that cannot support a
normal operation of a market economy, Prague has to borrow
money. Its foreign debts have piled up to reach 11.2 billion
dollars, or more than 50 percent of its GDP, far above the warning
level of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Second, unemployment is worsening and posing as a growing
obstacle to the economic development. By the end of July, the
jobless population was registered at 389,000, which means an
unemployment rate of 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The problem is even worse in the eastern part of the country
with the unemployment rate getting as high as 30 percent in some
counties.
</P>
<P>
As the economic restructuring deepens, more people would be
laid off, becoming one of the social and economic worries of the
Slovak government.
</P>
<P>
Third, rising trade deficits is another major problem for the
country. Trade deficits soared to 70 billion koruna (about 2
billion dollars) in 1997, 12 times that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, trade deficits already amounted
to 38.4 billion koruna (about 1.1 billion dollars), which accounts
for 11 percent of the GDP, one percentage point above the warning
level.

<HEADLINE> Majority Favor Censure or Reprimand for Clinton: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Although most Americans
oppose impeaching President Bill Clinton for any inappropriate
actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair, many people say Congress
should censure or officially reprimand him, several recent polls
suggest.
</P>
<P>
An ABC News poll released on Monday shows that 55 percent of
those surveyed thought Clinton should be censured or reprimanded,
while 40 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said 41 percent favored a
congressional resolution disapproving of the president's behavior,
while 24 percent favored impeachment and 32 percent favored taking
no formal action.
</P>
<P>
In a Newsweek poll taken Thursday and Friday, people were
divided about whether Congress should censure or reprimand the
president, with 45 percent supporting such a step.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's job approval rating remained above 60 percent in all
three polls.
</P>
<P>
The public has two different views of the president, as
reflected in the polls, supporting his job performance but not
finding him trustworthy about personal matters.
</P>
<P>
While two-thirds in the ABC poll said Clinton was not
trustworthy personally, the same number said they trust him to
handle the nation's business. And 65 percent said a president who
does not provide good moral leadership can still be a good
president.
</P>
<P>
The Gallup poll suggested that two-thirds approved of Clinton's
dealings with Congress and on foreign affairs, while four out of
five liked his handling of the economy. Only 50 percent had
confidence in his dealing with issues concerning families.

<HEADLINE> Albania Pushs Former Senior Officials to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Six senior officials of the
former Democratic Party government were sent to court Monday,
accused of "crimes against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested late Saturday were Safet Zhulali, former
minister of defense, and Halit Shamata, former minister of the
interior.
</P>
<P>
The court hearing is closed to the public and reporters.
</P>
<P>
The six men "took action, or no action, in league with others,
who were doing great damage to the nation of Albania, bringing
inestimable economic loss and causing the disappearance, death or
injury to thousands of people," according to a communique issued
by the Albania Military Attorney's Office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They were also charged with "issuing or implementing orders to
use military mass-destruction chemical weapons on civilians in
February, 1997, issuing or implementing orders violating major
constitutional terms and resolutions of the People's Assembly to
take military actions with armed force on civilians, and issuing
orders to equip some people with arms on the basis of political
attitude to fight against their own compatriots."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party criticized the event as political action
attacking the opposition party, but the Socialist Party of
Albania, the biggest power in the coalition government, stated it
had not taken part in the action, which was completely an act of
state.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party fell out of power in July, 1997, and the
Socialist Party won to lead a five-party coalition government.

Major-General Kyaw Than called for identifying and taking
advantage of trade opportunities, formulating and pursuing
development strategies within the framework of the trading system
and defending the acquired trade rights.

export market development as the Asian economic boom in the past
couple of decades based substantially on the inflow of foreign
direct investment into the region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar are trainees from Myanmar's nine
ministries, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and private
firms.
</P>
<P>
The second seminar on export market development, sponsored by

</P>
<P>
The country mostly traded with Asian countries which accounted
for about 80 percent of its total export value and about 86
percent of its total import value of the year.

ROME, August 24 (xinhua) -- Employment remained steady in large
Italian industries in May this year, but a drop of 2.3 percent was
reported for the preceding 12 months, the National Statistics
Institute (ISTAT) said in a press release on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, the number of jobs

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Accelerate Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt has stressed the need to accelerate the privatization
of heavy industries including small mills and factories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here Monday of the Myanmar Privatization
Commission (MPC), Khin Nyunt, First Secretary of the State Peace
and Development Council, called for giving opportunities to
government employees in the to-be-privatized mills and factories
to have shares in them, the official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the MPC, noted that by
providing national entrepreneurs with greater opportunities,
productivity of the state would be enhanced and imports reduced in
the long run. He added that benefits like expansion of business
and creation of jobs would be brought about.
</P>
<P>
He said national progress would be gained only after achieving
success in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The MPC, formed in January 1995, has announced the first-phase
plan of privatization of 51 state-owned economic enterprises
including processing and manufacturing factories, cinemas and
livestock breeding farms.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process has been under way in various forms
including auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or
establishing joint ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs
or operating either under buy-back or counter-trade system.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, about 140 state-run
cinemas, some 42 factories and two livestock breeding farms in the
country had been designated to be sold through competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills have been
reportedly privatized.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's gross domestic
product in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in March, grew by
4.6 percent over the previous year, in which the private sector
contributed 75.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pillar Industries Boost Shanghai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Six pillar industries accounted
for more than half of Shanghai's industrial sales during the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The automobile manufacturing, electronic information, power
station equipment, petroleum and fine chemicals, iron and steel,
and household appliance sector recorded total sales of 118.5
billion yuan for the January-June period, with the figure rising
by 8.7 percent on the same 1997 period and accounting for 52
percent of the local industrial total.
</P>
<P>
The pillar sectors contributed 56 percent of pretax profits, or
12 billion yuan during the period.
</P>
<P>
The output value generated by the six sectors has jumped by 15
percent annually thanks to the introduction of local preferential
policies, heavy investment and the extensive use of technology.
</P>
<P>
The local industrial output value grew from 107.3 billion yuan
in 1987 to 560.6 billion yuan in 1997, with the significant growth
attributed to a shift in focus from textiles and light industrial
sectors to the six pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Local industries grew by 15 percent annually between
1992-1996, up substantially from five percent growth in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has paid greater attention to the development of the
multimedia technology, bio-pharmaceuticals, new materials,
microelectronic, machinery, shipbuilding and marine engineering
industries, and is attempting to build same into local pillar
sectors for the next century.

COLOMBO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Bank of Ceylon manager and
his wife, also an employee of the same bank, have been arrested by
police for a 300 million rupee (4.55 million U.S. dollars) fraud,
the official newspaper Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>

life owning several vehicles including a Mercedes Benz and a
Pajero and several houses and holiday homes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The suspect who worked in the clearing section of the bank, had
found a loophole whereby he could siphon out bank funds without
being discovered. He did so for 10 years out of the 20 years he
served in the state-owned Bank of Ceylon.
</P>
<P>
He had not touched the money of depositors but embezzled the
bank's own funds, police sources were quoted as saying.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli officials stood side-by-side at ceremonies in
the Norwegian capital of Oslo on Monday to mark the fifth
anniversary of the first peace accord between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies, aiming to push forward the stalled Middle East
peace process, were hosted by Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek and attended by Arafat, former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimone Peres, parliamentary leader of Israel's ruling Likud
coalition Meir Sheetrit, and U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with Peres and Sheetrit on Monday afternoon,
after which they appeared at a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a new stand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the Israeli withdrawal from West Bank, Arafat called
it "a beginning" but "not a breakthrough" in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed optimism for the survival of the Oslo Peace
Accord, noting that it was in line with the Israeli interests for
the Palestine state to exist and develop as a "partner" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accord, reached on August 20, 1993, after long-time
secret negotiations between Israel and the PLO in the Norwegian
capital, has played a positive role in promoting the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, the process has been bogged down since Netanyahu's
government went into power in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration of the peace accord in Oslo is seen as an
opportunity for unofficial contacts between the PLO and Israel to
rekindle the Oslo spirit.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Marble, Granite Firms Hit Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Almost 20 of Thailand's 106
marble and granite factories have closed because of the economic
slowdown, according to the Thai Marble and Granite Association.
</P>
<P>
More companies will close or cut production if no solutions are
found soon, Pichit Sawangvibulpong, secretary-general of the
association, was quoted Tuesday by the newspaper Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During the time of economic boom, the industry's output was 8
million cubic meters a year, but plunging demand has reduced the
total to about 2 million cubic meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The credit squeeze that began in mid-1997 has affected many
producers, making it difficult to run or expand their businesses
while many customers have refused to pay their bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, production costs have climbed, especially for
imported equipment such as saws and cutters.
</P>
<P>
Some producers have been looking to overseas markets to offset
low domestic demand, Pichit said.
</P>
<P>
The association will hold a seminar on September 9 in Bangkok
to discuss ways for marble and granite producers to ride out the
economic crisis, Pichit said.

KIEV, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine President Leonid Danilovich
Kuchma Monday called on Russia's State Duma to support the
reappointment of Victor Chernomyrdin as the federal prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's remark was made to the Ukrainian Interfax Agency. He
added that what has happened in Russia affirms the importance of a
"powerful and stable government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an anonymous senior official in the Ukrainian
President's Office stated that he hoped "Chernomyrdin's rich
economic and political experience will help find the way out of
the economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine pays close attention to Russia's economic situation
because the financial crisis occurring in that country could also
have negative effects upon it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, sacked five months
ago, was back in power Monday following a surprise announcement by
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is facing one of the worst economic crises to
confront Russia since the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin urged the parliament to support his decision to dismiss
the cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named Chernomyrdin as interim
prime minister on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Technicians to Train At German Volkswagen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one scientific research
workers from Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd. will fly
to Germany late this month to receive a three-year training on car
design and development at the Volkswagen parent company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese technicians will be engaged
in the design and development of new car models abroad, which is
an unusual step on the part of Volkswagen as the Germany comapny
used to keep the process a secret.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jirong, manager of Personnel Training Department at
Shanghai Volkswagen said that he believes Volkswagen's opening up
of this sector to Chinese technicians fully demonstrates the
sincerity of the company's cooperation with China and its
determination to pursue long-term expansion in the country.
</P>
<P>
Founded 13 years ago, Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Company
Ltd. is widely considered the starting point of China's modern
car-manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
With a designed annual production capacity of 300,000 units,
the Sino-German joint venture has so far produced one million
Santana cars, about 50 percent of China's car market
share.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture chalked up 26.3 billion yuan in car sales in
1997 and placed high among the 500 major overseas-financed
enterprises in China for six years in a row. It is also the most
profitable of all the Volkswagen global joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Peter Loew, deputy general manager of Shanghai Volkswagen, said
German Volkswagen Group has been implementing a global strategy
for car designing, purchasing of spare parts, production and
marketing, and that it values cooperation with China and is
willing to help Shanghai Volkswagen attain the level of scientific
research and development of the parent company by training senior
technical workers to become part of Volkswagen's round-the-clock
car development and designing link.
</P>
<P>
According to agreement, German Volkswagen will train 42 senior
technicians for its Shanghai Volkswagen. The second group of the
trainees will leave for Germany soon.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with personnel training, Shanghai Volkswagen has
accelerated expansion of a technical center, and is building a car
testing ground at a cost of 1.6 billion yuan. The car testing
ground will become China's first modern car testing
facility.

<HEADLINE> Embryo's Defenses May Prevent Miscarriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the
University of Georgia have found the secrets why pregnant women's
immune systems don't attack developing babies in their wombs as
they are foreign entities.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have long wondered why pregnant women's immune
systems don't attack fetal in their wombs as they would other
foreign entities like viruses, bacteria or a parasite.
</P>
<P>
A new research, reported by Monday's Washington Post, suggests
that the developing embryo actively defends itself from attack by
sending out a signal that shuts down the mother's natural defenses.
</P>
<P>
The researchers headed by David H. Munn of the University
treated pregnant mice to prevent fetal production of an enzyme
that destroys a substance that triggers key immune system cells
called T cells. Mice carrying genetically foreign embryos had
miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
The researchers say their findings potentially could lead to
new ways to prevent miscarriages in people.

COLOMBO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's top sprinter

<HEADLINE> House May Demand More than Lewinsky Evidence For Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives, has suggested that it may not be "a
smart idea" to rush into an impeachment inquiry against President
Bill Clinton, according to the Washington Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some democrats voiced agreement on this point. "Newt and I are
on the same page here," said Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, a senior democrat on the House Judiciary Committee
that will review the report that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
is expected to submit.
</P>
<P>
"It shows the republicans understand that while they have a
right wing that wants the president impeached, the country as a
whole doesn't," The Associated Press quoted Frank as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Monday in The Washington Post,
Gingrich said of the possibility of hearings: "I'm not at all sure
that you can get to that this year, and I'm not at all sure that
it's a smart idea to try to get to that this year."
</P>
<P>
At an appearance in Idaho Falls, Idaho, Gingrich refused to
answer reporters' questions on the matter. His office later
issued a statement saying Congress will investigate any evidence
of Clinton misconduct "in a very serious manner."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Congress could move forward only on
Lewinsky, unless he (Starr) has a clear case, and an overpowering
case," Gingrich told the newspaper in an interview in California.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich seemed to soften even more later Monday in a statement
issued by a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The speaker, while withholding any conclusions on the specific
allegations against the president, made the obvious statement of
fact that a pattern of criminal behavior is worse than a single
incident," said the spokesman, Andrew Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
"Any evidence of presidential illegalities however, whether one
incident or many, would clearly have to be investigated and
addressed by Congress in a very serious manner."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers and aides close to Gingrich and the committee agreed
that the election-year calendar -- with lawmakers anxious to
adjourn and go home to campaign -- would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
With only a month left in the congressional session, senior
members of the committee would have little time to review Starr's
expected report, which is likely to be massive, and to decide
whether to ask the full House for hearings. Actual hearings would
be expected to be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
Starr's four-year investigation also has included the Clintons'
Whitewater land deals and FBI files of former government officials
collected by the White House.
</P>
<P>
Several Republican lawmakers said that evidence of any instance
in which the president obstructed justice, lied or asked someone
else to lie under oath -- as has been alleged in the Lewinsky
matter -- would be enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Italy Anti-doping Head Hopes to Ban Creatine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugo Longo, who heads an Italian
Olympic Committee inqury into doping, called here on Monday that
the rampantly used substance creatine should be banned.
</P>
<P>
Creatine is a naturally-occurring aminoacid, taken onboard
when eating steak or drinking milk. It improves muscles by
speeding the conversion of stored energy to burned energy in
physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, Longo has adopted the line taken by many experts who
claim that creatine, when taken in very large doses, can actually
increase an athlete's muscle mass, and therefore his performance.
</P>
<P>
Longo said: "We cannot take decisions, we can only provide
indications -- and those we will give are that the use of this
substance needs clearing up."
</P>
<P>
If creatine can improve a player's performance it needs to be
banned or at least limited in terms of the amount being
administered."
</P>
<P>
The inquiry has attracted world-wide attention following a
warning by AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman that footballers were
taking dangerous substances, and that the Serie A were facing a
danger similar to the Tour de France.

<HEADLINE> Modahl Gives BAF Ultimatum for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Diane Modahl has given a
seven-day ultimatum to the bankrupt British Athletic Federation
(BAF) for a satisfactory compensation figure or they may face a
further legal action.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Monday, Modahl is suing BAF,
placed in administration last October with debts of around two
million pounds (about 3.2 million U.S. dollars), after
successfully fighting a four-year ban for failing a drugs test
and being sent home from the 1994 Commonwealth Games.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old, who had to sell her Sale home to fund the
long-running legal battle, is suing for 800,000, although her
lawyers have been negotiating with the Federation's
administrators to reach a financial settlement.
</P>
<P>
The administrators cannot pay other creditors until a
settlement with Modahl, who competed in the 800m for Britain at
last week's European Championships in Budapest, is reached.
</P>
<P>
Diane Modahl cleared her name after being banned for four
years. "I have now instructed my lawyers that, in the absence of
some sensible proposals from BAF, the case has to continue and a
trial date has to be fixed at the first possible opportunity,"
said Modahl.
</P>
<P>
"The administrators have a clear choice. Either they persuade
the other creditors to fund the legal costs of fighting the case
to trial or they continue discussions with us with a view to
resolving all outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot be expected to keep my claim on hold and so, as
from September 1, my lawyers will be taking the necessary steps
to advance the proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Modahl, currently training in Switzerland for next month's
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, added: "The sensible outcome
would be for the administration to be completed and for all the
creditors to receive a distribution.
</P>
<P>
"I share the frustration and anger of the other creditors
about the delay, but they have an opportunity at a meeting of
their committee tomorrow to make some important decisions, " she
said.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Warns on Bergkamp Burn-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- English Premier league club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger fears his star striker Dennis
Bergkamp is suffering from World Cup fatigue.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Dennis Bergkamp is not at his best at the moment, he
knows that.
</P>
<P>
"But it is mainly physically because he only started training
on August 1 and had a small setback injury wise against
Manchester United in the Charity Shield.
</P>
<P>
"And he has played just two games now, one on last Monday
against Forest and one at Anfield. He's not as sharp as he used
to be, but that is a question of time.
</P>
<P>
"For us it is important to get our players slowly back to full
fitness without us dropping too many points."
</P>
<P>
Wenger also worried that later in the season the stamina of
Bergkamp and fellow Dutch international, Marc Overmars, may be
affected after two seasons of near-continuous football.
</P>
<P>
But the Highbury chief feels that French midfield stars,
Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, have the ability to stay fit
despite their part in the host nation's World Cup success.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It's not quite the same for the other World Cup
players because up-front you need to be really sharp to make a
difference but in midfield they have the stamina, Petit and
Vieira work really hard,and they look OK.
</P>
<P>
"We might have a different problem with Bergkamp and Overmars
later on in the season because they need more stamina and
physical power by then. So they could have a problem around
October and November with overall fitness.
</P>
<P>
"But for Dennis it's a question of sharpness and overall
fitness, two different problems really, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Hingis Named Top Seed at U.S. Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- World number ones Pete
Sampras of the United States and Martina Hingis of Switzerland
were named the top seeds for next week's U.S. Open, the USTA
announced today in New York.
</P>
<P>
With the lone exception of five-time U.S. Open champion Steffi
Graf of Germany, the USTA seeded players directly according to
the latest ATP and WTA Tour rankings. Currently ranked 38th, Graf
received the eighth seed due to a recommendation from WTA Tour
players. She missed last year's U.S. Open after having
season-ending knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, a four-time champion, regained the world No. 1
ranking from Chile's Marcelo Rios for the second time this year
in the latest ATP rankings. But he has not displayed the form
that has seen him finish as the top-ranked player for five
straight years.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Sampras captured his only Grand Slam title of
the year at Wimbledon and has won just three events this year
after going unbeaten in eight finals in 1997. He lost to Petr
Korda of the Czech Republic in the fourth round at last year's
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
He was the top seed in 1994, 1996 and 1997 and has won the
annual Grand Slam finale in 1990, 1993, 1995 and 1996. He is tied
with Bjorn Borg of Sweden with 11 Grand Slam titles, one behind
all-time leader Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hingis beat Venus Williams in an all-teenage
final,the youngest women's Grand Slam championship in the Open
history, Hingis became the second-youngest Open women's champion.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open champion, Hingis has won just four events
this year and none since May. In 1997, the Swiss sensation
claimed 12 titles and suffered five losses all year. This season,
she already has lost nine matches.
</P>
<P>
Rios, who won just one match in two brief reigns as the No. 1
players, is the second seed, followed by defending champion
Patrick Rafter of Australia, Australian Open champion Kord and
Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands.

8.6 points and 6.4 assists per game, was named New comer of the
Year.

with a 22.7-point average and fourth in the league in assists and
3-point goals.

balloting by media. Second behind her was Jennifer Gillom of
Phoenix, who received eight first-place votes and 303 total

The Comets won the inaugural WNBA title last season and went
into Monday's first round playoff game with a 1-0 lead against
the Charlotte Sting in their best-of-3 series.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Work on Security Council Reform to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The current session of
the U.N. General Assembly (GA) ended its consideration of the
Security Council reform without sound results, but the work on the
matter will continue in the next session, it was announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
While some progress has been made and new ideas have emerged,
the working group on the question of equitable representation on
and increase in the membership of the Security Council has not
been able to submit substantive recommendations to the GA, said GA
president Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Monday following the adoption of the report
by the group which decided that its deliberations should continue
and that it should submit another report to the GA by the end of
the 53rd GA session in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said stumbling blocks to the group's work include:
opposition to creating new permanent seats, disagreement over the
size of an enlarged council, different approaches to the issue of
rotational arrangements for new permanent seats, and differences
on the veto right for current and prospective permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Security Council consists of 15 members, five
permanent ones, that is, China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the
U.S., and 10 non-permanent ones to be elected by the GA for a term
of two years.
</P>
<P>
The working group has met a record number of times, with 56
meetings during the current GA session, said its report.
</P>
<P>
In the current session, it dealt with decision-making in the
Security Council, including the veto, expansion of the council,
including the total size of the enlarged council, increase of
permanent membership and non-permanent membership, periodic review
of the enlarged council and majority required for taking decisions
on council reform.
</P>
<P>
The failure to yield practical results could stem from the
outside world perceiving that the reform exercise merely reflects
conflicting interests between different groups in pursuit of their
own goals, said Udovenko.
</P>
<P>
However, the reform exercise has not been initiated to satisfy
such interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
In deliberating on reforming the council, there should only be
one predominating interest -- to enhance the relevance of the U.N.
to the requirements of a changing world and to ensure that it
could more effectively and efficiently meet the challenges of the
new century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After five years of discussions, if there is still need for
anything to be explored, it is states' ability to see beyond
national interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
The working group was set up on December 3, 1993 according to
GA resolution 48/26.

<HEADLINE> The EU on Top of Romania's Trade Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union continued
to rank first among Romania's trade partners, with 59 percent of
Romania's total foreign trade in the first five months of the
year, showed the latest official statistical data.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of foreign trade of Romania amounted to 7.88
billion U.S. dollars, up 3.8 percent compared with the same period
in the previous year. Export volume reached 3.37 billion U.S.
dollars, while import volume was of 4.51 billion U.S. dollars.
Thus, the commercial balance over the mentioned period indicated a
deficit of 1.14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries were on the top of Romania's trade partners,
with 63.2 percent of Romania's total export trade and 56.0 percent
of its imports. Exports to the EU amounted to 2.13 billion U.S.
dollars, 11 percent up compared with the same period a year
earlier. Nearly half of Romania's total export trade was destined
to four EU countries, namely Italy, Germany, France and the United
Kingdom. Romania's imports from the EU amounted to 2.53
billion U.S. dollars, 19.9 percent up as against the period a
year ago. The first country in this field is Germany, with 766.2
million U.S. dollars in exports to Romania, followed by Italy,
764.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statistical data also showed that Romania had a negative
balance in trade with almost all its business partners, except a
few EU countries such as Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal, as
well as certain countries of the Central and Eastern Europe,
namely Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and the Republic of Moldova.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Serious Talks Crucial to Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Monday adopted a presidential statement, calling
for "an immediate cease-fire" in Kosovo and an early commencement
of substantial talks between conflict parties in the southernmost
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The statement mirrored the grave concerns of the 15-member
Security Council over the recent fighting in Kosovo, which has had
a devastating impact on the civilian population and resulted in a
swollen army of refugees and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Monday's presidential statement coincided with the approaching
of the Balkan winter, which observers here feared could turn a
humanitarian disaster in the making into a full-scale catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The same anxiety was echoed by Sadako Ogata, head of the U.N.
refugee agency, who has dispatched Soren Jessen-Petersen, the
United Nations assistant high commissioner for refugees, to Kosovo
for a first-hand picture of what life the refugees and displaced
were leading.
</P>
<P>
Since the conflict escalated in rebel-held areas in late June,
civilians have emptied large sections of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up a majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies have been unable to keep up with the
flow of civilians fleeing the fighting, and relief workers found
it hard to reach those currently living in forests and mountains.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people have been killed and some 200,000 people,
about 10 percent of Kosovo's population, displaced since the
security force of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia fought
against separatist rebels of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army about six moths ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Council affirms the right of all refugees and displaced
persons to return to their homes," the presidential statement
said.
</P>
<P>
But to ensure such right requires substantial talks between the
conflict parties. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his
latest report that failure to enter into meaningful negotiations
has worsened the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have set up a negotiating team to represent
their interests, but they failed to turn up in proposed talks on
August 18, thus making it hard for the international community to
see the scheduled beginning of the long-awaited talks.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that "the Kosovo issue can have no
military solution." Over the past months, the reality in Kosovo
has shown that pushing the peace process forward is no easy work
at all.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say it remains essential that the authorities of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians accept
their responsibility for ending the bloodshed in Kosovo, for
allowing the people of Kosovo to resume their normal lives and for
moving the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is highly hoped that all relevant parties can
take into account the state interests and the worsening physical
conditions of refugees and displaced people, and begin to sit at
the negotiating table at an early date for a peaceful settlement,
including the safe and permanent return of all internally
displaced persons and refugees to their homes.

<HEADLINE> 16 Sentenced to Death in S. Leone Coup Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen civilians, including five
journalists, were sentenced to death in Sierra Leone Monday on
charges of treason for their role in a May 1997 coup in the West
African State, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Among those condemned is Allieu Kamara, spokesman of the
military junta led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who seized power
in the coup from elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced to death are Christian Kargbo, the junta's
central bank governor and Hilton Fyle, a former presenter with
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)'s Africa Service and
owner of an FM radio station in Freetown, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent journalist among the 16 is Felix George,
former director-general of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Monday's delivery of sentence is the first since trial started
about four months ago.
</P>
<P>
The conviction was announced by Justice Edmond Cowan in a
courtroom in central Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Two other persons were discharged and acquitted by the court.
</P>
<P>
The 16 people were tried on various charges of collaborating
with the military junta, which was driven out of Freetown in
February by the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, altogether 60 civilians and 38 junta
soldiers were put on trial after President Kabbah resumed office
last March from exile in Guinea.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Positive Development on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said here on Monday that China welcomed positive development in
the Lockerbie issue, and hoped all parties concerned to cooperate
for an early solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters here that "We positively evaluate
the flexible attitude by all parties concerned ."
</P>
<P>
"It is said that all parties concerned will have cooperation and
consultations for an early agreement on the solution of the
Lockerbie issue and bring the troublemakers to justice at an early
date," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came shortly after the United States and Britain
announced an agreement to allow the two Libyan suspects to be
tried by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved by practice that only consultation and
cooperation can lead to the fundamental solution to the
(Lockerbie) problem," said the Chinese envoy.
