    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Jarome Iginla scored twice as the Calgary Flames
stopped a 10-game winless streak with a 4-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iginla scored his goals in the second period to stake the Flames to a 4-0

<P>
	   Marc Savard and Jeff Shantz had the other goals for Calgary. Valeri Bure
added three assists.

losses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> King Holds Edge at Hawaiian Ladies  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPOLEI, Hawaii (AP) -- Betsy King is ready to christen the third phase of
her career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hoping it's a rebirth again," King said Friday after shooting a
5-under-par 67 to get to 10-under 134 after two rounds of the Hawaiian Ladies
Open.
</P>
<P>
	   King was tied with Sally Dee, the day's final golfer who also shot her
second 67 on the Kapolei Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always say I had two careers out here. I didn't win for the first seven
years. ... Then, all of a sudden, I had a good run for 10 years," said King,
who's had only one victory since making the Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made me appreciate what an achievement it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Dee, still seeking her first victory, had a chance for the lead on No. 18,
but missed a 6-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It lipped out," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dee had four birdies against a bogey on the front nine, and added three
birdies on the back. Her birdie at No. 17 overcame a bogey at 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Dee relishes the chance of going against King in the final round.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not putting any undue pressure on myself. I'm excited more than I am
nervous," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Having never been in position to win entering the final round, Dee doesn't
know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like vuja de -- never been here before," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   First round co-leader Sophie Gustafson followed her 65 on Thursday with a 70
on Friday to stand at 9-under 135, one stroke behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Gustafson overcame bogeys at Nos. 7, 13 and 16 with five birdies, including
a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 5 and a birdie on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the Kapolei course was "quite open, so if you miss and land in the
rough, that's not a problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Marisa Baena and Leta Lindley were two shots back, followed by Sherri
Steinhauer, Suzanne Strudwick and Kris Tschetter at 137.
</P>
<P>
	   King, seeking her 32nd career LPGA title, made seven birdies and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
	   She saved par on her final hole by two-putting from 60 feet after hitting
into the right rough on No. 9, and finds herself in what used to be a familiar
place: Leading a tournament entering the final round.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't been there in a while," she said. "The more you're there, the
easier it is. I hope to be there a lot. That's what I've been working so hard
for."
</P>
<P>
	   Baena shot a 66 Friday, the day's best round, to move into contention.
</P>
<P>
	   Coincidentally, Baena earned her exempt status for the Tour in last year's
Betsy King Classic, and only then after King decided to play the final round of
the tournament despite bad weather. That allowed Baena to move up in the
standings and make enough to qualify for an exemption.
</P>
<P>
	   First round co-leader Joanne Morley shot 1-over 73 Friday to fall to 138,
while defending champ Alison Nicholas was at 141 after shooting 72.
</P>
<P>
	   Sue Ginter won $10,000 when she made a hole-in-one on No. 16, using a 6-iron
from 154 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The cut was at 143, with 73 golfers moving into the final round.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 93, Wizards 85  </HEADLINE>
    By LANDON HALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis scored 17 points and Damon Stoudamire
had 15 as the Portland Trail Blazers again played poorly but still won their
13th straight home game by defeating the Washington Wizards 93-85 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers, who have won 13 of their last 14, stayed a half-game ahead of
the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA's best record at 41-11. But for the fourth
straight game, they needed a late surge to beat one of the league's worst teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland, which struggled past the Los Angeles Clippers just before the
All-Star break and looked awful in beating Golden State twice earlier this week,
shot just 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Strickland had 18 points and Juwan Howard 15 points for the Wizards, who
lost their sixth game in a row and 14th straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington dropped to 1-7 under new coach Darrell Walker and 3-11 since
Michael Jordan took over as president of basketball operations last month. The
Wizards have won just 13 percent of their games with Walker as coach, compared
with 32 percent with Gar Heard, whom Jordan fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Three straight jumpers by Ike Austin, Chris Whitney and Tracy Murray put
Washington ahead 72-70 with just under nine minutes left. Detlef Schrempf tied
it with a 19-foot jumper to start a 15-4 run.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoudamire and the Wizards' Mitch Richmond dove for a loose ball, and it
bounced to Rasheed Wallace for an easy slam that made it 83-76 with 3:10 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace and Brian Grant each had 11 rebounds for the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers completely dominated Washington inside but missed too many easy
shots to count. Their 37 percent shooting matched Tuesday night's mark at Golden
State, which broke a streak of 29 straight games shooting better than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards, 0-3 on a West Coast trip that ends Sunday at Golden State,
trailed by nine early but ended the first quarter on a 9-2 run to tie it 24-24.
</P>
<P>
	   The team then missed 10 of its 11 shots to start the second period, and
Portland took a 10-point lead and led 47-40 at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards trailed by nine before going on an 8-0 run late in the third. A
turnaround 3-pointer by Murray to beat the shot clock cut the lead to 59-58, and
an 18-foot jumper by Howard gave Washington its first lead, 64-63 with 47.8
seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabonis, who scored nine points in the first quarter but just one in the
second and third because of foul trouble, started getting the ball again in the
fourth. He scored seven in the period, including two layups to start the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   His next basket, a hook with 2:34 to go, put the game out of reach at 85-76.
He fouled out with 1:40 left.

Storm Disrupts Midwest and East

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A powerful winter storm spread snow and sleet across the
Midwest and Northeast Friday, frustrating thousands of travelers with flight
delays and cancellations. A boat capsized during a rescue effort along a swollen

a bomb attack in 1991 that left a Spanish businessman seriously wounded, and
with the kidnapping of another person in the same year. Lorente was the first
suspected member of the Basque separatist group ETA to be officially extradited

defection and then caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact

the child after already experiencing the trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and

<HEADLINE> Student Gives Ex-Teacher a Porsche  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Accounting teacher Larry Lease was only kidding when
he told his students that when they get rich, they could show their appreciation
by buying him a new Porsche.
</P>
<P>
	   Lease thought one of his former Shasta College students was just continuing
the joke when he e-mailed him last May asking him what color he wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   But when Robert Sullivan came to visit Lease this week, he arrived with a
burgundy Porsche convertible, valued at $50,000 and registered in Lease's name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had faith in me,'' said Sullivan, 36, who now lives in Kentucky. ``He
always was there to support me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan, who kept in touch with Lease after taking his class, didn't have a
steady path to success. He was unemployed, sleeping in his car for part of 1989.
But by 1992, he was working for a firm that became Commerce One in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The company later went public, and Sullivan became a multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Sullivan called Lease to say he was coming to town and
invited him to lunch. He showed up at Shasta College with the new car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just too nice,'' Lease said. ``My body just aches from laughing and
smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Ore. Church in Zoning Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Officials in Jacksonville say Presbyterians in the
old gold-mining town can build a new church, they just can't use it for weddings
or funerals.
</P>
<P>
	   The City Council in the southwestern Oregon city says this is a zoning
matter, not a spiritual one.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastor Larry Jung disagrees. He says the says the city government is
interfering in religion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weddings and funerals are central to what we do,'' Jung said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jung's congregation has been meeting in a building that seats 125.
Membership has swelled, however, and there are plans to build a 400-seat
sanctuary and an education building on a 10-acre site.
</P>
<P>
	   The City Council granted a permit for the new church on the conditions there
be no alcohol, no funerals and no weddings.
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions were imposed to keep increased traffic in the neighborhood at
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
	   Jung, who is considering taking his case to the state's Land Use Board of
Appeals, said Oregon is ``one of the most un-churched states in the country.
We're definitely not in the Bible Belt.''
</P>
<P>
	   This is the second time this month that an Oregon church has clashed with
city officials.
</P>
<P>
	   A Portland United Methodist Church was told by a city official to limit the
number of people that can gather for worship services. The officer meant to
alleviate neighborhood complaints that people leaving a meals program sometimes
created a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Portland city attorney's office last week recommended dropping the
attendance limits while keeping restrictions on other church activities, such as
a daycare and the meals program. Religious leaders have filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   John Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville,
Va.-based advocacy group, said churches should be treated differently that other
land-use applicants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you are dealing with a church's religious mission, the government
doesn't want to mess with that,'' he said. ``They should be hands-off.''

<HEADLINE> Execs Quit Aurora Foods Amid Probe  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An investigation into accounting practices at Aurora
Foods Inc., the company that owns such brands as Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima,
has prompted the resignations of the firm's chairman and three other top
executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James B. Ardrey,
executive vice president Ray Chung and chief financial officer M. Laurie
Cummings all stepped down Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson and Ardrey also resigned from the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora's board said it has formed a committee with its auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate Aurora's accounting practices. It said it
expects the results to affect 1999 earnings and perhaps its 2000 projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting practices under investigation relate to trade promotion
expenses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora spokesman Tom Franco refused to elaborate on the statement.
PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty apparent that there's a difference opinion between the auditors
and management" over how to handle promotion expenses on the balance sheet, said
David Goldman, a Bank of America analyst who follows the company. "There's no
hard-and-fast rule, and the auditors are demanding a conservative approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Aurora's products include Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, Log Cabin syrup,
Chef's Choice frozen meals, Lender's bagels, Celeste frozen pizza and Van de
Kamp's frozen seafood.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, the San Francisco-based company has grown by
acquiring well-known brands and revitalizing them.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank Employee Face More Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to file additional charges against a former
Bank of New York employee accused of perjury in the $7 billion Russian money
laundering scam.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Buehler did not describe the new indictment against Svetlana
Kudryavtsev but referred to ``recent developments in this case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler, said he believed Buehler was
referring to Wednesday's guilty pleas from Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice
president in the Eastern European Division, and her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair admitted aiding Russian bankers in a $7 billion money laundering
scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   In her plea, Edwards said Kudryavtsev was paid $500 a month starting in 1996
so she could monitor accounts used for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev, an associate in the bank's Eastern European division, was
questioned by the FBI in August. Kudryavtsev pleaded innocent Thursday to
perjury charges stemming from that interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Adler said that during an ``unscheduled and difficult interview with
non-Russian-speaking agents, she made inaccurate statements.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the relatively small payments allegedly made to Kudryavtsev by
the couple reflect what little she would have known about the billion-dollar
scheme.

<HEADLINE> Texas Woman Faces Execution  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GATESVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman scheduled to die next week is
pleading with Gov. George W. Bush to grant further review of her claim that she
killed her husband in self defense after years of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm asking you to let me live,'' Betty Lou Beets said Friday, her voice
cracking in a plea broadcast on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' She is scheduled
to die by injection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm asking for mercy. And I'm asking for that compassion and I'm praying
you will allow it for me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beets would be only the second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War
and the fourth nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to
resume in 1976. There are nine women on death row in Texas and 50 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents have said cases like Beets' are a test of Bush's
``compassionate conservatism.'' The issue also has received renewed attention
since Gov. George Ryan of Illinois -- a Bush supporter -- suspended all
executions this month after the release of 13 inmates from that state's death
row over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was convicted of murder for the 1983 shooting death of Jimmy Don
Beets, a Dallas fire captain and her fifth husband, at the couple's trailer home
near Gun Barrel City. She was charged with, but never tried, in the 1981
shooting death of her fourth husband, Doyle Barker. She also was convicted of
shooting and wounding husband No. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip, authorities found Beets' body in a shallow grave under a
wishing-well flower garden outside her trailer. She had reported him missing two
years earlier, saying he never returned from a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
	   A short time after finding Beets' body, searchers found Barker's remains
under a shed. He had been missing for four years; Beets had said he left one day
and never came back.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawyers are asking the parole board to consider what they say is a
decades-long history of abuse by her husbands and recommend her sentence be
commuted to life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I certainly believe if Governor Bush means what he says when he
establishes the kinds of cases he would consider granting clemency in, we fall
within the category of those cases in which clemency is justified,'' said Beets'
attorney John Blume.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, campaigning in South Carolina for the Republican presidential
nomination, said he will make no decision in the case until he receives a
recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. He cannot grant
clemency unless the board recommends it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing I consider is whether or not a jury has heard all the facts and
whether or not the person is guilty of the crime committed and whether or not
the person has had full access to the courts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 119 inmates have been executed in Texas since Bush took office in
1995. He has spared only one prisoner, citing flimsy evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Beets killed her fifth husband to collect an $86,000
life insurance policy and a $760 monthly pension.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little focus at her trial on abuse and Blume said her original
attorney didn't investigate her background. An expert who examined Beets 10
years ago at the request of new attorneys found she had suffered domestic
violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have carried a heavy burden for battered women and children and domestic
violence,'' Beets told The Dallas Morning News. ``I'm going to be the one to put
a face on that, as a real human person.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Train Spotting Becomes Rage  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- As commuters hurried across the train platform, Richard Trott
leaned casually against a railing and poured himself another cup of coffee. At
his feet lay an open notebook, already covered in neat red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   Trains came and went, but the retired factory manager barely budged, except
to crane his neck for a better view of the identification tags prominently
displayed on the passing locomotives.
</P>
<P>
	   Scooping up his notebook, he scribbled down the numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   This is train spotting. And that's about as exciting as it gets.
</P>
<P>
	   Travel down most rail lines in Britain and you'll see train spotters such as
Trott, who decades ago began his quest to see every locomotive operating in
Britain and record its number.
</P>
<P>
	   Trainspotters huddle on bridges and stand at the end of platforms,
``collecting'' engines like birdwatchers check off species they've seen. The
ultimate goal is to collect all the numbers of the engines in operation, but
there is joy, too, in simply spying a rare one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe it seems a little bit on the outside of what is normal,'' concedes
Trott. ``But there are plenty of people passionate about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   And plenty of people who bash the hobby. The word ``train spotter'' has
become synonymous with the image of bespectacled loner in a greasy jacket. The
hit British movie ``Trainspotting'' took its name from the stereotype of people
with nothing better to do.
</P>
<P>
	   The spotters' image is not helped by cases such as that of a train
aficionado accused of stealing a credit card and spending $12,000 traveling
nearly 10,000 miles over the Great Western Railway network -- just so he could
be closer to his favorite engine, No. 43127.
</P>
<P>
	   Still the hobby is expanding. Increasingly, spotters are decked out with
laptop computers, video cameras and mobile phones, the better to chronicle the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   And it's not confined to just trains -- bus spotters and plane spotters also
abound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Train spotting has not been turned into a big commercial enterprise,''
says Colin Divall, a professor at the University of York's Institute of Railway
Studies. ``If you want to, you can still do it pretty cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's especially true since no one in Britain is ever very far away from a
rail track, which makes the hobby uniquely accessible.
</P>
<P>
	   Train companies have warmed to these enthusiasts. Last year, a trade
association of rail companies called the Railway Forum launched a campaign to
encourage spotters to help report crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one is looking for rail enthusiasts to turn into vigilantes, but given
their experience of railways, and the increasingly sophisticated equipment they
carry, they are in an ideal position to help the rail authorities and the
police,'' association spokesman Daniel Hodge says.
</P>
<P>
	   Amateur interest in railways can be traced back to the 19th century, when
Britain started to regulate train fares. With no control over prices, train
companies started giving their locomotives distinctive looks to distinguish
themselves and attract customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The populace took interested. The middle class, which had the money and the
time to devote to the new hobby, would wait on platforms, cameras at the ready
to photograph trains.
</P>
<P>
	   Credit for hooking Britons on spotting belongs to train lover Ian Allan,
according to practitioners of the pastime. After World War II, Allan published
cheap lists of locomotive numbers -- an instant hit with children, who started
ticking off the classes of engines they spied.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1940s, there were some 20,000 steam locomotives to ``collect.'' But
after the nationalization of the railways in the 1960s and modernizing in later
years, the variety that used to exist largely disappeared, Divall says.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, fewer than 2,000 locomotives are running on British tracks and probably
just a dozen different kinds, compared to hundreds in the 1950s and 1960s, he
says.
</P>
<P>
	   That may have dented enthusiasm for the hobby, but there is some hope of a
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Conservative government's decision to privatize the railways
means companies once again are competing. Already, enthusiasts say the train
companies are adopting more ornate styles to instantly set them apart.
</P>
<P>
	   For train spotter Trott, that's important. But the 60-something widower says
the hobby also has other advantages -- it lures him out of his house and gives
him the chance to get some fresh air, visit new stations and mingle with fellow
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a great affection for it,'' he says. ``It doesn't suit everyone --
but it does me.''

<HEADLINE> Doc Testifies in LA Shootout Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A gunman who bled to death after the notorious 1997
North Hollywood bank robbery shootout could have survived if he had received
immediate medical attention, a doctor testified in a lawsuit that claims police
let the man die.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Marshal Morgan, medical director of the emergency center at the
University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center, told a federal court jury
Friday that he based his opinion on the gunman's autopsy reports faxed to him by
a newspaper reporter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Medical care was not available to him and he in fact died,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan was called as a witness in a lawsuit filed against the city and
individual officers on behalf of the children of bank robber Emil Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked to define prompt, Morgan said that city paramedics normally respond
within seven minutes and Matasareanu could have been at a hospital in 10 to 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor testified, however, that he has no expertise in police crime
scene procedures, had no opinion on whether officers' actions were correct, and
that a delay in treatment does not necessarily translate to a breach of medical
standards of care.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal jury began hearing arguments in the case Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, revisits one of the city's
most violent crimes, a Feb. 28, 1997, North Hollywood bank robbery that turned
into a 44-minute shootout in which both robbers died, 11 officers were wounded
and a half-dozen civilians were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Matasareanu, 30, and Larry Eugene Phillips Jr., 26, wore full body armor and
fired more than 1,200 rounds from automatic weapons in a shootout with officers
who were mostly armed with handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips died when he shot himself at the same time a police bullet struck
his head. Matasareanu was finally brought down in a close-quarters firefight
with officers in the middle of a street.

<HEADLINE> Vote Count Begins in Iran Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Officials started counting millions of ballots after
Iranians voted for a new Parliament, expected to come under the control of
reformists who want to loosen 21 years of strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling stations were crowded throughout the day during Friday's elections
for the 290-member Parliament, or Majlis, but no official turnout figure was
released. Many people were still waiting in line to vote when the 12-hour
polling ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists, who have predicted a comfortable majority for themselves, have
said a high voter turnout would benefit them in wresting the legislature from
the conservatives. About 38.7 million of Iran's 62 million people were eligible
to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformists campaigned on a platform to strengthen the hand of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is leading a program for increased individual and
political freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposing him are conservative clergymen, who want to maintain the strict
laws imposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which brought clerical rule to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's brother, Mohammadreza Khatami, the head of Iran's largest
reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, said he expected
reformists to gain 60 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Interior Ministry employees spent Friday night in polling
stations counting the ballots by hand. They will work in 8-hour shifts around
the clock until the counting is complete. The first results are expected either
late today or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Khatami, after casting his ballot, said: ``I hope today's election
will be one of the most glorious, historical moments of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami came to power in an unexpected landslide victory in May 1997, a
reflection of Iranians' frustrations with the intrusive Islamic laws that limit
everything from how they dress to what music they listen to or what they watch
on television.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners have also tried to muzzle the press and have jailed
reformist dissidents. The outgoing Parliament, in which the conservatives had a
slight majority, impeached one of Khatami's main allies, the popular former
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri. It also tried to impeach Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the reformists are optimistic about taking control of the Parliament,
they may not be able to make all the changes they have promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guardian Council, a 12-man body made up of clerics and lawyers, reviews
all bills passed by Parliament. And Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who has mostly sided with the hard-liners, has the final word. He also
heads the armed forces, the judiciary, and the state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Election results are not expected for at least a week from the capital
Tehran, which has a 7 million electorate and fielded 838 candidates for 30
seats.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of Iran's 62 million people are under the age of 25, and they
are the loudest voices for change.
</P>
<P>
	   To most of them, born after the Islamic Revolution, its ideals are no longer
relevant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Revolution? I don't remember it, but I can see the consequences of it,''
said Naveed Saodati, a 23-year-old computer engineering student.
</P>
<P>
	   Many young people are even questioning why Iran cannot have normal relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the two nations were severed after radical students took
over the U.S. Embassy during the Islamic Revolution and held 52 Americans
hostage for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some liberals have suggested a national referendum to decide whether to
establish ties with the United States.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Koreas To Reduce Tensions  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For years, the Clinton administration has tried without
success to encourage North Korea to take steps to reduce tensions with its
southern neighbor, and former Rep. Stephen Solarz thinks he knows why.
</P>
<P>
	   Solarz, one of the few Americans to have met with the late North Korean
leader Kim Il-sung, said Friday the North's leaders believe their survival
depends on their ability to maintain a totalitarian regime.
</P>
<P>
	   And if they agree to confidence-building measures with the South to lessen
tensions, he said ``it would diminish the capacity of the North to contend they
are living under a state of siege.'' He added that the communist North is
determined not to undertake reforms, lest it wind up as the Soviet Union did
almost a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Solarz, who specialized in East Asian affairs during his tenure as a
Democratic congressman from New York, took part in a forum on North Korea at the
U.S. Institute of Peace.
</P>
<P>
	   The forum took place against a background of yet another turning point in
U.S. efforts to wean North Korea off a militaristic path in exchange for the
economic benefits that a more normal relationship with the United States would
bring.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea has agreed to send in March the most senior representative to
Washington since the end of the Korean War nearly 47 yeas ago. Preliminary
arrangements will be discussed at a U.S.-North Korean meeting later this month
in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Cronin of the peace institute raised the possibility of a historic
bargain between the two countries at the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   He said North Korea might agree to solidify a 1999 moratorium on testing
long-range nuclear missiles if the United States removes it from its list of
countries that sponsor international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   That step could lead a series of economic benefits to which North Korea is
now denied. Cronin noted that North Korea has not been implicated in an act of
international terrorism since 1987. State Department officials have said North
Korea is being advised of the steps it must take to qualify for being purged
from the list, which now numbers seven countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Snyder, author of a new book on North Korea's negotiating strategy,
told the gathering there is one indispensable ingredient for success in dealing
with North Korea: ``patience, patience, patience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Solarz, in trying to describe North Korea, recalled the phrase once used by
Winston Churchill in his description of Stalinist Russia: ``A riddle inside a
mystery wrapped in an enigma.'' North Korea, he added, ``makes the People's
Republic of China look like a libertarian society.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believes the North agreed in talks with the United States in 1994
to freeze a nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon only because it knew that much
of the rest of world did not know for certain whether it had secretly produced
nuclear weapons from plutonium that has never been accounted for. That ambiguity
serves as a deterrent against outside attack, Solarz said.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that efforts by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to reach
out to the North have produced scant results, but he said he supports the policy
so long as it doesn't provide significant military advantage to the North.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's not much to be lost, and a lot to be gained,'' Solarz said.

<HEADLINE> Dead Cop's Kids May Get College Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kathy Strehl has juggled part-time college classes with
raising three boys since her husband, a St. Louis police detective, was killed
on the job in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   While various government programs help pay for health insurance and other
family expenses, money is tight as Strehl pays tuition toward a communications
degree. She wants her sons -- ages 7, 9 and 15 -- to go to college as well, but
doesn't know how she'll pay for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Strehls are among 4,100 families nationwide not covered by laws
providing federal funds to pay college tuitions for spouses and children of
officers killed in the line of duty. A bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee last week would change that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our
communities deserve our unwavering support, as do their families,'' said Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   Strehl's husband, Stephen, was detached to the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration when he died in a helicopter accident. Strehl quit her job as an
insurance claims adjuster to stay home full time and raise the boys, but knew
she eventually would need to continue her education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always wanted to go to college. There's no way I (could get) to the
management level without it,'' Strehl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, only children and spouses of federal law enforcement
officers killed after 1992 and state and local officers killed after 1997 get
federal help with tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashcroft's bill would move back the date to 1978 for both groups. The
benefit would be up to $485 per month for full-time students for as many as 45
months at any private or public college. Children up to age 27 and spouses of
any age would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, backed by associations of federal law enforcement officers and
border patrol associations, would cost an estimated $124 million over its
lifetime, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   About half the states provide help with tuition for officers' survivors, but
benefits vary widely, according to Suzie Sawyer, executive director of Concerns
of Police Survivors, a national group based in Camdenton, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   In Missouri, where Strehl still lives, benefits for spouses are limited to
12 credit hours at an instate public institution.

<HEADLINE> Annan Doubtful on Sahara Referendum  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations has all but abandoned 9-year-old
plans to hold an independence referendum in Western Sahara because of disputes
over who can vote and concerns that the results might never be implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   In a remarkably blunt report Friday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the
``fundamental differences'' between Morocco and rebels over a voter registration
list had again destroyed the timetable for the referendum and made it impossible
to set a new date.
</P>
<P>
	   Disagreement over such a core issue ``could eventually prevent the holding
of the referendum as provided by the plan,'' Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   War broke out in the Western Sahara in 1976 after Spain abandoned the
Atlantic coast territory and Morocco annexed it and moved in settlers. The
fighting, which pitted 15,000 ragtag guerrilla fighters from the rebel Polisario
Front against Morocco's U.S.-equipped army, ended with a 1991 U.N.-negotiated
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations then launched a plan to hold a referendum to decide
whether residents of the mineral-rich north African territory would become
independent or part of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has been working since 1991 to identify voters because of
disagreements over who is eligible to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Polisario rebels wanted the list to be limited to the 74,000 people
counted in a 1974 Spanish census of the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Morocco, fearing a Polisario victory, sought to register thousands of
additional voters, including people who fled the territory to Morocco and came
from regions that are now part of southern Morocco.
</P>
<P>
	   After years of delay, the U.N.-monitored process of identifying voters was
due to be completed this month. A deadline of July 31 has been set for holding a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   But more than 79,000 appeals were submitted against a first provisional
voter list, and a second provisional voters list is expected to add another
60,000 appeals when it is finalized next week, Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the two sides have failed to agree on other key issues, such as
security arrangements for refugees who would return to the territory to cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with such obstacles, Annan said the Security Council should
review the entire Western Sahara situation because of doubts about whether the
referendum could be carried out now.
</P>
<P>
	   And Annan cautioned that even if a referendum were held, there would be no
way to ensure the results would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is worth noting that no enforcement mechanism is envisioned by the
settlement plan, nor is one likely to be proposed, calling for the use of
military means to effect enforcement,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan said he would ask his envoy, former U.S. Secretary of States James
Baker III, to meet with the two sides to try to salvage a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials said Baker had no specific proposals to offer and would
consult with both sides to try to devise an alternative both could live with.
</P>
<P>
	   One idea would be granting Western Sahara some degree of autonomy from
Morocco, but it wasn't clear that Polisario would accept anything short of an
independence referendum.

<HEADLINE> Photographer's Work To Be Displayed  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People in the 1800s might have lacked today's television,
but they could see a moving view of San Francisco and the Bay Area without
leaving the parlor, thanks to the work of a pioneer landscape photographer.
</P>
<P>
	   An exhibit at the National Gallery of Art covers the work of photographer
Carleton Watkins. His images, seen in a special viewing cabinet, could create an
effect similar to a scene being panned by a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, ``Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception,'' opens Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins' big images of Western scenery impressed Col. John C. Fremont, the
first presidential nominee of the Republican Party in 1856. His wife, Jessie,
sent the photos to her father, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The photos were popular and strengthened a movement that led President
Lincoln -- the second Republican nominee -- to sign a law protecting Yosemite
from commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins' stereoscope cards could be inserted into a kind of photo Rolodex
and then placed in a cabinet of dark, polished wood about two feet high. Gazing
through a pair of lenses built into the cabinet and turning a knob on the side,
a person could see a moving view of the city and the Bay Area -- almost as if
they were being panned by a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Despite the level of technology today, we could not improve on what
Watkins produced,'' said Earl A. Powell III, director of the gallery. ``We
couldn't even make what Watkins produced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins' heavy, specially built camera had two lenses placed an inch or so
apart. They gave him two slightly different images on the same plate.
</P>
<P>
	   The viewer, looking through similar lenses built into the cabinet, gets a
three-dimensional image. Turning the knob brings successive views before the
lenses of the cabinet, giving the effect of motion.
</P>
<P>
	   The gallery has four antique viewers on exhibit, as well as large prints of
Watkins' exceptionally precise photos of the western United States nearly 150
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The cabinets, available as early as the 1850s, were an ornament and
conversation piece in affluent Victorian living rooms. At one time families had
18 different models to choose from. They cost as much as $23, according to Sarah
Greenough, the gallery's curator of photos. That would have been equivalent to
several hundred of today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Hand-held viewers were much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The antique cabinets in the exhibit are shown behind glass, so the knobs
can't be turned and only one image can be seen at a time. Visitors can also get
some of the 3-D images on six interactive computer terminals installed at the
end of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins used an awkward but effective process. In remote scenic places he
covered glass plates that weighed as much as four pounds with wet, gummy
collodion, exposed them in a camera three feet long, carried them back to a
portable dark room and developed them -- all within half or three quarters of an
hour. He had to be quick to act before the collodion dried out and ruined the
shot. But the process produced extremely precise images.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins also did prints as big as 18 by 22 inches, which he sold in
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   His photos sold well, but he was a poor businessman and lost much of his
work in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. He died a decade later in
the Napa State Asylum for the Insane and was buried in an unmarked grave on the
grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Carleton Watkins - The Art of Perception'' will be at the National Gallery
of Art through May 27. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Zero Tolerance Disparity Noted  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A hearing on racial disparities in school discipline
found enough evidence of possible discrimination to persuade a government panel
to look further. The Clinton administration contended the evidence failed to
prove actions against black pupils resulted from racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Education Department figures show that for the 1997 school year, black
children made up 17 percent of U.S. students but 32 percent of those suspended.
Hispanics comprised 14 percent of students and 13.5 percent of those suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Whites accounted for 63 percent of students and 51 percent of those
suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A numerical disparity does not by itself prove discrimination,'' Norma
Cantu, assistant secretary of education for civil rights, told a hearing of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel's chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, who convened Friday's hearing on
whether blacks and the disabled are discriminated against, differed in her
reading of the day's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg,'' Berry said. ``All of
the commissioners support safe schools. No one wants to see guns in school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But there is clearly evidence that, by and large, black students are
expelled for things like talking back to a teacher or talking in a loud voice --
nothing associated with violence -- when other children are not.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioners heard testimony from more than a dozen government
officials, educators and civil rights advocates on the growing use in schools of
policies designed to allow zero tolerance of indiscipline among students. Berry
said the commission will decide at its March meeting whether to hold more formal
hearings or ask advisory panels in each state to take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same way mandatory minimum sentences and three-strike sentencing laws
have been used widely as no-nonsense ways to battle crime, zero tolerance
policies in schools have grown since the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act passed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cantu said wide racial disparities exist in the numbers of children
disciplined under zero tolerance but insisted that does not necessarily mean
racism is at work in the programs, as critics like Jesse Jackson contend.
</P>
<P>
	   Disproportionately high suspension rate for black students predates the new
policies and goes back as far as the middle 1970s, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Jackson brought the issue to national attention by defending six
black teenagers expelled for up to two years as the result of a
bleacher-clearing fight at a football game in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the policy ``an ugly, expensive, uneducational failure,'' the
biggest civil rights issue facing the country.
</P>
<P>
	   After Jackson's intervention, Decatur's school board cut the expulsions to a
year and let the six students attend alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Early evidence suggests zero tolerance discipline might help reduce the
number of guns students carry to school.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1996-97 school year, 5,724 students were expelled for bringing
firearms to school. That number fell 31 percent to 3,930 the next year, said
William Modzeleski, director of the Education Department's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools Program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We realize that denying students educational services is not in the best
interest of students or the community,'' Modzeleski said. ``However, we
understand and support the need to maintain order, discipline and safety in the
classroom.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Settles Discrimination Charges  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is paying $3.8 million in one of the
largest settlements with the Labor Department involving discrimination in hiring
women or minorities at seven of the company's plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford has agreed to compensate women and minority applicants for lost wages
for entry-level assembly positions at company plants in Louisville, Ky.; Wayne
and Sterling Heights, Mich.; Sandusky, Ohio; Kansas City and St. Louis, Mo.; and
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also will hire 100 women and minorities from previous applicants for
assembly jobs at the plants, according to the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the fifth-largest settlement by a company with the Labor Department's
Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which oversees federal contractors for
compliance with the government's affirmative action and nondiscrimination
requirements, officials said Friday. The department can cancel federal contracts
with companies that do not comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor officials said the agreement also ensured that Ford would hire more
women and minorities at all its facilities because Ford agreed to employ them in
proportion to the percentage that apply.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is significant that the company -- on a corporate-wide basis -- will
change its hiring analysis which will open a pipeline of opportunity to women
and minorities who have too long been excluded from good paying jobs on the Ford
assembly line," said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford did not admit to any discrimination in the settlement. The company said
it wanted to avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to reestablish a good working relationship with the agency," said
Ford spokeswoman Della DiPietro. "We fully share the same goals regarding
diversity in the workforce. Prolonged litigation is not in the best interest of
our employees or our shareholders or our consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the money -- $2 million -- is going to qualified female applicants
who were not hired at the Kentucky Truck Plant in 1993, shortly after the
facility underwent a major expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   At the plant, federal officials identified 318 qualified female applicants
who were not hired. Women composed 38 percent of qualified applicants, but only
about 25 percent of those hired for the assembly jobs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiPietro said a majority of those 318 female applicants subsequently were
hired at the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The other Ford plants are: Michigan Truck Plant; Sterling Axle; Sandusky;
Kansas City Assembly; St. Louis Assembly; and Norfolk Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The consent decree goes into effect today, closing a total of 10
discrimination cases involving Ford that federal officials started at various
plants and facilities from 1989 to 1998. There was no formal finding of
discrimination at the other three facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest Labor Department settlement involving allegations of
discrimination by a federal contractor was $14 million paid by Harris Bank of
Chicago in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Levels in Danube Said Down  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia has lifted a ban on drinking water from
two major rivers and a U.N. team is measuring mostly safe levels of contaminants
on the Danube -- two signs that the pollution left from a major cyanide spill
may be easing.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia's agriculture ministry on Friday said it would allow water to be
drawn from the Danube and Tisza rivers for drinking and other uses, saying toxic
substances in both had been diluted to safe levels.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 30, a containment dam broke at a gold mine in Romania, sending an
estimated 100 tons of cyanide and toxic heavy metals used in the mining
operation pouring into streams. The poison passed through Hungary and Yugoslavia
via the Szamos and Tisza rivers before returning to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have called the accident Europe's worst river disaster in
a decade, and the European Union has called for an international commission to
help with cleanup. The United Nations also plans to send a team of experts to
assess the damage to the Tisza and Danube rivers in Romania, Hungary and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement carried by the Fonet news agency, the Serb agriculture
ministry said that only traces of cyanide were found in water samples taken
Thursday. U.N. environmentalists said that of 18 samples taken from the Danube
where it forms the border between Serbia and Romania, only one registered
slightly above the allowable limit for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned about the cyanide levels which are certainly still some
risk for the aquatic life,'' said the head of the U.N. team, Pekka Haavisto.
</P>
<P>
	   Another member of the team, Peter Literathy, said analysis of other possible
poisons released with the cyanide, notably heavy metals, would be available
later.
</P>
<P>
	   The extent of improvement in water quality remained unclear, however, with
the U.N. analysis appearing to differ from findings by Romanian experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests taken Friday morning at a dam near the city of Drobeta Turnu-Severin,
170 miles west of Bucharest, showed cyanide levels three times above the
acceptable EU standard and 14 times the Romanian norms, said Gheorghe
Constantin, of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanian environmentalists also found high concentrations of copper, chrome,
zinc and iron in the Danube farther upriver Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Geneva-based World Health Organization expressed concern about the
presence of toxic metals in the water, which experts fear could pose an
additional health threat. The WHO called for a review of environment and health
regulatory standards related to precious metal mining in Europe.

<HEADLINE> INS Won't Change Elian's Custodian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Immigration officials say moving Elian Gonzalez to a new
temporary custodian in Miami, as his father in Cuba wants, would be too
disruptive to the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, they said they were continuing to press in federal court
for Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service outlined its stance in a letter
Friday to Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency declared that ``transferring Elian temporarily to a new and
unfamiliar environment would not be advisable for the child after already
experiencing the trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and losing his mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida last Thanksgiving,
Elian has been temporarily placed in the custody of a great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, whose family is waging a legal battle to keep the boy in this country
permanently. His mother and 10 others died in a boat wreck while fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father had requested that Attorney General Janet Reno shift the
boy's temporary custody to another of his great-uncles in Miami, Manolo
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The father had complained that Lazaro Gonzalez and his family had given the
news media too much access to Elian, had arranged psychiatric treatment for the
boy by doctors who had not been approved by his father and had allowed relatives
with criminal records to be around the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   An INS statement said the agency shares the father's concerns about the
boy's well-being ``and therefore will request information from Lazaro Gonzalez
concerning the credentials of any psychiatrist or psychologist who has seen
Elian, as well as any treatment that may have been prescribed for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also promised to obtain details of Elian's schooling in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami-based nongovernmental organization visited Lazaro Gonzalez's home to
verify that it was an adequate setting for Elian, the INS said. It also said it
was aware that Lazaro had past convictions for driving under the influence of
alcohol, but its current information does not suggest his home is inadequate for
Elian's temporary care.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Reno rejected a request to meet with Elian during a visit Friday
to Miami, her hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez's family had asked Reno to meet with them and Elian in hopes
she would sympathize with their fight to keep the child in the United States.
She spoke at an awards ceremony for an organization that provides legal
assistance to neglected children.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno would prefer to meet Lazaro's family in Washington next week so that
INS Commissioner Doris Meissner also could also attend, Associate Deputy
Attorney General James Castello said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Castello wrote, however, that Reno believes it is ``unnecessary'' for Elian
to attend, explaining that the adult relatives could convey any new information
they want her to hear.

<HEADLINE> P.G. Wodehouse Books Fetch $110,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A rare library of first-edition books by the late writer P.G.
Wodehouse sold for the equivalent of $110,000 at auction Friday, exceeding the
predicted total of $66,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans purchased four of the top 10 items in the sale, which included 67
lots, the auction house Christie's said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those sold to the unidentified U.S. buyers was ``Not George
Washington,'' a novel Wodehouse co-wrote in 1907. The novel sold for $4,550. A
pair of books -- ``Leave it to Psmith'' and ``Enter Psmith'' -- were sold for
the same amount to another U.S. collector.
</P>
<P>
	   Wodehouse's first adult novel, ``Love Among the Chickens,'' published in
1906, was sold for the equivalent of $5,000 -- the highest price paid for any
item in the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his most well-known creations were the butler character Jeeves and his
master, Wooster. The collection was amassed over 25 years by private a
collector, said Nicholas Worskett, head of books at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
	   The collection included a 1930 edition of ``Right Ho, Jeeves,'' and a 1934
copy of ``Very Good, Jeeves,'' which was auctioned for $2,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Wodehouse was born in Britain, but set up home in United States after World
War II and became an American citizen in 1955. He died in 1975.

Accused Basque Man Extradited to Spain

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A Basque man was extradited from Mexico to Spain on
Friday to face accusations of attempted murder and membership in a violent

suspected member of the Basque separatist group ETA to be officially extradited
from Mexico to Spain.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Nears Deal on Congo Force  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Security Council members neared agreement on
sending military observers to Congo but were still negotiating an arms embargo
on rebel groups and measures to protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-sponsored resolution calls for observers to monitor a cease-fire
signed last summer among the warring parties in the central Africa conflict. It
would also lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N.
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Council members heard a briefing Friday from Assistant Secretary-General
Hedi Annabi on the difficulty of deploying the 500 observers and 5,137 logistics
and security personnel called for in the resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   The cease-fire in Congo was signed by three rebel groups who launched an
insurrection in August 1998 to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila, and
Rwanda and Uganda who back them. Kabila and his backers -- Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola -- also signed, but both sides have been accused of repeated violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts from the 15 countries on the council have been meeting all week to
try to reach agreement on a final draft. Council president Arnoldo Listre of
Argentina said the council will meet again Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A vote is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's U.N. Ambassador Robert Fowler said the remaining differences were
important, but solvable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see any showstoppers here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution calls for an arms embargo on groups that refused to sign the
cease-fire agreement, including former Rwandan Hutu army and Interahamwe
militiamen who helped carry out Rwanda's 1994 genocide -- as well as rebel
groups from Angola and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's U.N. Ambassador Martin Andjaba said the position of the 11-nation
Southern African Development Community is that any embargo ``should cover all
rebel groups'' that are in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of this sensitivity I think there is a consensus emerging that for
now we should drop the embargo issue and attend to it later -- that that would
solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another area of dispute concerns the extent to which the U.N. troops could
protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution's original text allowed for U.N. troops to use force to
protect civilians ``under imminent threat of physical violence in the immediate
vicinity of deployment sites.'' The draft circulated Friday has a broader
possible alternative, backed by Canada, that would allow for force to be used
regardless of where the threat occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada wants to avoid the situation that arose in Haiti after the return of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1994, when troops watched civilians being
killed because they had no mandate to protect them, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we Canadians are saying is that we can never have that situation.
Anywhere where there are U.N. forces capable of intervening to protect
civilians, then they must do so,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ad Shows Gore As Abortion Defender  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of Al Gore's latest television commercial:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Committed.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Century Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: In states with March 7 primaries; campaign would not say which.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Narrator:) He's taken on the worst polluters in America and become
a leading voice for clean air, clean water and the environment. Al Gore. He's
taken on the HMOs and big drug companies -- fighting for a patients' bill of
rights. He's the only candidate committed to protecting Medicare and preserving
Medicaid. He's stood up to the extreme right wing -- defending a woman's right
to choose. Endorsed by NARAL, America's leading pro-choice group. The experience
to do the job. Al Gore. Fighting for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Gore, in casual clothing, talking to a crowd. Dark smoke
billowing out of smokestacks during talk of polluters, then green leaves, a
beautiful lake and a sunset during talk of clear air and water. Medical offices,
Gore walking a corridor with doctors. Gore hugging an older person. Women
talking with each other and then the NARAL logo during abortion section. Ends
with Gore and his wife, Tipper, shaking hands along a rope line.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: This is a slight revision to an ad from just two days ago, adding
the section on abortion a day after Bill Bradley released an abortion ad.
Bradley has been hammering Gore for his early, mixed record on abortion rights,
including opposition to Medicaid funding, and Bradley began airing an ad Friday
saying that he is the only candidate who has been ``pro-choice for everyone all
the time.'' This is Gore's response, as he works to maintain his edge nationally
and among women.
</P>
<P>
	   ACCURACY: The ad never mentions Gore's early record on abortion, but it
doesn't distort it either. Gore has been solidly pro-choice for years and he was
endorsed by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
Throughout his career, Gore has focused on the environment, and the Clinton-Gore
administration has fought hard for a patients' bill of rights. Gore says he's
the only candidate who is committed to preserving Medicaid -- a reference to
Bradley's plan to eliminate the program. But the ad never mentions that Bradley
would move poor people into the federal insurance program for government workers
and give many more people access to insurance.

<HEADLINE> Gore Finesses Way Around Picket  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rather than cross a picket line, Vice President Al Gore
used a telephone line to placate two key Democratic constituencies inside and
outside a hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Striking workers picketed in steady sleet outside the Grand Hyatt Hotel on
Friday as predominantly black delegates to the National Summit on Africa waited
for Gore indoors. He found a way to try to make both groups happy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hello? Can you hear me?'' Gore's voice called into the cavernous ballroom
over clanking silverware and china as 1,400 summit delegates dug into their
lunch of salmon and avocado salad. Huge television screens at the front of the
room stayed focused on an empty podium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hotel workers' union Local 25 is picketing, and in solidarity with
these workers, I will not cross that picket line,'' the vice president said,
drawing some applause. ``At the same time, I did not want to miss the chance to
share some words with you about the importance of our protecting the world
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore followed President Clinton, who spoke to the group a day earlier at a
convention center with no picket line. Both talked about helping Africa's
developing nations by forgiving some of their debt, enacting favorable trade
policies and improving public health by fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the vice president Monday is a debate over race relations with
rival Bill Bradley at the Apollo Theater in New York's Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit organizers did not gave a pulpit to Bradley, a campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said the former New Jersey senator offered to
appear before the summit via satellite, but organizers told him they preferred a
personal appearance. Walter C. Carrington, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria,
addressed the gathering on behalf of Bradley who, Ludecke said, ``cares deeply
about the connection between the United States and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Summit spokesman Sunni Khalid said Gore spoke as part of the event's focus
on the administration, following the president and various White House
officials. Unlike Bradley, Gore had not been invited to a separate candidates'
forum, which was canceled when only Bradley and Republican contender George Bush
signaled interest and then declined to appear personally, Khalid said.
</P>
<P>
	   In another bid for minority votes Friday, Gore released an ad in which he
speaks Spanish and pledges to improve schools, Medicare and the fight against
crime.
</P>
<P>
	   A second ad released Friday revises one from just two days earlier to add
abortion rights to a list of issues he has fought for. The retooling came a day
after Bradley began airing an ad hitting Gore for his early anti-abortion votes
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates regularly address groups by telephone or satellite when their
schedules don't permit them to be there personally. But Gore's way of
participating in the African summit drew a mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members, picketing on the sidewalk, appreciated Gore's gesture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't count'' as crossing the picket line, said Nancy Wallace, a
member of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union. ``We're
thrilled,'' said Ron Richardson, general vice president of the union.
</P>
<P>
	   But some summit delegates were miffed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm offended,'' said Christian Ibenacho, of Ontario, Calif., who
nonetheless said he would vote for Gore. ``We're also his constituency. He
should have come.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a politician,'' said James Alexander, a delegate from Rhode Island
who is undecided on a candidate. ``They have to be sensitive, but they have
their agendas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, campaigning Friday at a school in Harlem, invoked a bit of his past
by talking about dreaming big. He recalled his efforts, while a New York Knick,
to mentor Harlem youngsters during basketball's off-season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm coming here today as someone who has been in this kind of setting a
lot of times,'' Bradley told 25 students, most 13 or 14 years old, who are part
of a business and computer technology ``mini-school'' within Adam Clayton Powell
Jr. Middle School Academy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look in your eyes and I see incredible excitement. I want to make sure
those eyes will have the chance to fulfill the potential that each of you
possesses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his education plan would double federal aid for urban schools
to $88 billion a year, with the condition that schools accepting the money
ensure that all their teachers are fully qualified.

<HEADLINE> Absentee Ballots Pour Into S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- An outpouring of absentee ballots set the stage for
what could be a record turnout at today's Republican presidential primary in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona is looking for a heavy turnout of crossover
voters to defeat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, favorite of the GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the heaviest absentee balloting was in upstate South Carolina, a
traditionally Republican area where Bush would be expected to be strong.
Counties that tend to vote Democratic -- important for McCain who seeks backing
from independents and crossover Democrats -- also saw heavier-than-normal early
voting.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican officials predicted voter turnout would be well over
300,000, compared with more than 276,000 four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns reached out to core voters, including taped phone messages
from leading state Republicans to possible Bush voters, and a mass-mailing of
postcards, including about 65,000 to veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered showers and temperatures in the 60s and 70s were in the forecast.

<HEADLINE> Vote Count Begins in Iran Elections  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   Reformists Favored in Iranian Vote
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Officials started counting millions of ballots after
Iranians voted for a new Parliament, expected to come under the control of
reformists who want to loosen 21 years of strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling stations were crowded throughout the day during Friday's elections
for the 290-member Parliament, or Majlis, but no official turnout figure was
released. Many people were still waiting in line to vote when the 12-hour
polling ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists, who have predicted a comfortable majority for themselves, have
said a high voter turnout would benefit them in wresting the legislature from
the conservatives. About 38.7 million of Iran's 62 million people were eligible
to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformists campaigned on a platform to strengthen the hand of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is leading a program for increased individual and
political freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposing him are conservative clergymen, who want to maintain the strict
laws imposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which brought clerical rule to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's brother, Mohammadreza Khatami, the head of Iran's largest
reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, said he expected
reformists to gain 60 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Interior Ministry employees spent Friday night in polling
stations counting the ballots by hand. They will work in 8-hour shifts around
the clock until the counting is complete. The first results are expected either
late today or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Khatami, after casting his ballot, said: ``I hope today's election
will be one of the most glorious, historical moments of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami came to power in an unexpected landslide victory in May 1997, a
reflection of Iranians' frustrations with the intrusive Islamic laws that limit
everything from how they dress to what music they listen to or what they watch
on television.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners have also tried to muzzle the press and have jailed
reformist dissidents. The outgoing Parliament, in which the conservatives had a
slight majority, impeached one of Khatami's main allies, the popular former
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri. It also tried to impeach Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the reformists are optimistic about taking control of the Parliament,
they may not be able to make all the changes they have promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guardian Council, a 12-man body made up of clerics and lawyers, reviews
all bills passed by Parliament. And Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who has mostly sided with the hard-liners, has the final word. He also
heads the armed forces, the judiciary, and the state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Election results are not expected for at least a week from the capital
Tehran, which has a 7 million electorate and fielded 838 candidates for 30
seats.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of Iran's 62 million people are under the age of 25, and they
are the loudest voices for change.
</P>
<P>
	   To most of them, born after the Islamic Revolution, its ideals are no longer
relevant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Revolution? I don't remember it, but I can see the consequences of it,''
said Naveed Saodati, a 23-year-old computer engineering student.
</P>
<P>
	   Many young people are even questioning why Iran cannot have normal relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the two nations were severed after radical students took
over the U.S. Embassy during the Islamic Revolution and held 52 Americans
hostage for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some liberals have suggested a national referendum to decide whether to
establish ties with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought in LA Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors filed notice Friday that they will seek the
death penalty against a white supremacist charged with firing on a Jewish
community center and then killing a postman.
</P>
<P>
	   With Attorney General Janet Reno's permission, U.S. Attorney Alejandro
Mayorkas filed the notice under seal.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense could argue that diminished mental capacity makes Buford O.
Furrow ineligible for execution. Maria Stratton, head of the public defender's
Los Angeles office, told the Los Angeles Times on Friday that Furrow's defense
team had not yet decided whether to pursue such a defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Trial is set for Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Furrow was indicted on hate crimes in the wounding of three boys, a teen-age
girl and a receptionist at the North Valley Jewish Community Center and the
killing of Filipino-American letter carrier Joseph Ileto several miles away on
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   When Furrow was arraigned Monday, innocent pleas were entered by the judge.
Prosecutors then said a decision about the death penalty would be left to Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's her decision alone,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gennaco.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Public Defender Sean Kennedy, one of Furrow's lawyers, didn't
immediately return telephone messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge Richard Paez earlier refused a request from
Furrow's lawyers seeking access to internal documents the government used to
decide the death penalty issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those documents were reports on Furrow's alleged history of mental
illness. The defense is expected to include a claim that Furrow, of Olympia,
Wash., has a long history of mental illness and was not in his right mind at the
time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadline for filing motions challenging death penalty statutes is April
24.

<HEADLINE> McCain Declares Victory in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Invigorated by his cross-party campaign appeal,
John McCain declared ``we've already won'' the South Carolina battle for the
Republican presidential nomination. Rival George W. Bush was brimming with
confidence that a Southern victory would get his campaign back on track.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates have made it clear they'll march on regardless of the
results of today's primary, but the outcome was being closely watched because of
the impact it could have on elections coming soon in such key states as Michigan
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls were all over the map, but a couple of late surveys suggested Bush had
developed an edge. Neither candidate would concede an inch and both stumped to
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he's sensing intensity from backers that means the turnout would
be large, to his benefit. ``We're going to have a huge turnout,'' the Arizona
senator said. ``We're going to win because everybody is going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush countered that with the heft of a far superior organization, a lot more
money, the backing of virtually all of the GOP establishment and a sharp assault
that sent the polls into disarray.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to win here,'' the Texas governor declared. ``You mark my
words.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign opened with Bush the presumptive favorite, but McCain began
charging after a landslide win two weeks ago in New Hampshire sent his poll
standings soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush then unleashed a sharp assault, bashing McCain in a barrage of
television ads and hundreds of thousands of direct mail pieces. After initially
firing back, McCain pulled his attack commercials and ended the South Carolina
campaign running only positive spots.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative commentator Alan Keyes, the third GOP contender, was only a
blip in the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrapped up his campaign with a series of high-energy rallies, and
said the enthusiasm he's seeing will send voter turnout to record levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout held the key because of sharply differing strategies the two
candidates adopted. Polls showed Bush leading among Republicans, while McCain
appeals to independents and some Democrats. The primary was open to voters
regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics argued that Republicans shouldn't allow Democrats to help settle a
family fight, but McCain said he was following in the footsteps of Republican
icon Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you only get the votes of your party, you are resigning yourself to
permanent minority status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was some evidence McCain was getting aid from Democrats like state
Sen. Phil Leventis, who taped messages delivered to thousands of Democratic
homes arguing ``this is your one chance to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was more at stake than South Carolina's 37 delegates, with the real
prize being campaign momentum. Some nervous Bush backers worried that another
loss on top of New Hampshire could spell serious trouble for the
once-presumptive favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush offered only scorn as he confidently predicted victory, and he said he
was learning ``who my friends are.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there are some people getting weak-kneed, we need to know who they are
in the heat of battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain claimed a moral victory in advance, arguing his reformer's message
has been grabbed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already won,'' he said. ``We've changed the parameters of the
debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls and turnout in question, the outcome was ripe for surprise. There
were some signs that McCain's prediction of a big turnout could be on the mark
as absentee ballots were cast in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   While McCain said he sensed enthusiasm, the key to his race was turning out
voters who don't traditionally vote in Republican primaries, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the limited resources we had, we did the best we could,'' said
McCain. ``We were outspent enormously, so he had a much bigger megaphone, but we
did the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns had voter-turnout efforts in place, although Bush's was
bigger, and the phones line were burning looking for potential voters. There was
little standing in way of voters turning out as forecasters called for a balmy
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasts called for a high in the 60s inland, with temperatures nearing 75
along the coast. Light rains were seen ending early.
</P>
<P>
	   Wrapping up their South Carolina race, both rivals were looking ahead to
Michigan on Tuesday. It will be a two-day blitz leading up to that fight, with
momentum and attention coming from South Carolina likely to be decisive.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Examines Control Mechanisms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspect control mechanisms removed from several airliners
during urgent inspections ordered after the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261
are being examined by federal safety experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Government materials specialists are looking at wear on the assemblies,
which control the movement of the horizontal stabilizer on the aircraft's tail.
That wing-like device helps level the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington laboratories of the National Transportation Safety Board have
received five jackscrews taken from planes and expects to receive from the FAA
the rest of the 18 removed so far.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of the Alaska Airlines MD-83 reported problems with the stabilizer
and were trying to correct them when the plane crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed into the sea off the coast of California. As of Friday,
the Ventura County Medical Examiner's office reported that remains of 49 victims
had been identified, the safety board said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspection of more than 1,100
MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, all of which use similar control
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the NTSB said its specialists also are examining grease
samples from the removed jackscrews. Some of the lubricants reportedly had grit
or metal shavings in them.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew from the crashed plane had a stripped nut, the board said, and
the screw itself carried metal shards of the same material as the nut. Turning
of the screw within that nut is what moves the stabilizer up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   There also were impact marks on the nut, and the board is trying to
determine if the impact marks and stripping of the nut occurred before the plane
crashed or afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Laboratory work on these parts is expected to take several weeks, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew from the crashed plane was made in the United States, the
board noted, and was supplied to the plane manufacturer in 1990. It said
investigators are studying maintenance records for the part.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has completed mapping the wreckage and will begin salvage
operations next week using remotely controlled vehicles, according to the board.
Recovered wreckage will be taken to a hangar at the Port Hueneme, Calif., naval
base for examination.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: I'm True Environmentalist  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Casting himself as the true environmentalist in the
Democratic race for the White House, Bill Bradley said the Clinton-Gore
administration has not followed through on pledges to protect rivers, oceans and
clean air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To me, protecting the environment is who I am as a person. It's part of my
core,'' Bradley told a friendly crowd of 300 at a town hall meeting here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley aides flatly denied a story in today's editions of The Washington
Post saying the former New Jersey senator is likely to abandon his campaign if
he does not achieve significant victories March 7, when 16 states hold primaries
or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We expect to do well on March 7th,'' spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Vice President Al Gore are appealing to environmentalists
in their campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore supports spending $2 billion over 10 years to set aside more parkland,
paying for it with new mining royalties from federal lands, and defends a
Clinton administration order limiting logging in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley, arriving in Seattle in a green sweater, told the town hall
meeting Friday that the Clinton-Gore administration has spent too little money
from offshore oil drilling royalties on protecting public lands and has done
little to rally the public behind the ``Kyoto Protocol'' climate change
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he fought as a senator for the Superfund law to clean up
contaminated land and wrote the law allocating more California water to
environmental uses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley noted that he voted with the League of Conservation Voters 84
percent of the time during 18 years in the Senate, compared with 64 percent for
Gore during 14 years in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is the most unreported fact in this campaign, but that's the
record,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that, as president, he would enforce a moratorium on offshore oil
drilling, use money from existing offshore oil production to fully fund the Land
and Water Conservation Fund, and create a $250 million coastal and ocean
protection fund to help restore marine and coastal habitats.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said the next president should insist that sport utility vehicles be
required to meet more stringent fuel efficiency guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has also pledged to halt oil drilling off the coast of California and
Florida. But Bradley questioned why Gore couldn't dissuade Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt from extending some three-dozen offshore leases to petroleum
companies last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, talking to reporters in Minneapolis on a refueling stop on his way
to Seattle, Bradley said reform-minded voters choosing between him and
Republican John McCain need not look far for distinctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's against abortion rights, I'm for abortion rights. He's against gun
control, I'm for gun control,'' Bradley said. ``He doesn't have thoughts about
how to resolve the 44 million people without health insurance in America. I've
put out a very specific program to do that. ... He has an environmental record
that's not good. I have an excellent environmental record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly every place Bradley goes, campaigning at full throttle in advance of
the March 7 primaries, he encounters questions about McCain's surprisingly
strong challenge to Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley logged long days of campaigning throughout the Northeast late
this week, the attention remained on today's Bush-McCain showdown primary in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said there's time to regain the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most campaigns are fought in the last two to three weeks,'' he said, ``and
this will be no different.''

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Getting Help  </HEADLINE>
   By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hispanic immigrants hold many of the lowest-paying and most
backbreaking jobs in America. They sweat in chicken processing plants, on
construction sites and for landscaping firms.
</P>
<P>
	   On top of that, some employers cheat them out of their already meager wages
by taking advantage of deportation fears, their inability to speak English and
their ignorance of labor laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Some employers refuse to pay workers if they find out they are in the
country illegally, even threatening to call immigration officials on the
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   But federal law says even illegal immigrants deserve to be paid fairly. And
now AFL-CIO leaders are showing their support -- calling for repeal of a 1986
law they say makes it hard to unionize or improve conditions for undocumented
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   New policy stances adopted this week by the labor federation's governing
committee also commit unions to press for amnesty for the estimated five to six
million workers and their families who are here illegally or have only temporary
legal status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once you hire somebody, that person has the same rights as any worker,''
said Victor Narro, director of the worker's rights project at the Coalition for
Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheating illegal workers has long been a problem in California and Texas,
Narro said. But as the wave of Hispanic immigration rolls into Middle America
and the South, the problem of exploited workers follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilar Verdes, an editor for the Atlanta weekly newspaper Mundo Hispanico,
said Latin American immigrants are treated ``like slaves.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have no rights,'' Verde said. ``Everybody takes advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, eight men from Oaxaca, a state in southern Mexico, came to the
United States illegally and found work with a tree pruning company near Atlanta.
When the company learned they were illegal, it fired them and refused to pay
back wages.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mexican woman named Graciela was hired at an Atlanta grocery store using a
fake Social Security number. In the two weeks it took to verify her
identification, she earned $300, but the store refused to pay once it learned
she was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of losing their money, Graciela and Oaxaca men got help from a
Georgia lawyer who runs a unique and growing practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Adams started specializing in labor cases for Hispanic clients
about two years ago, recruiting clients with the help of Greg Richardson, a
union organizer who speaks Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Together they tapped a growing pool of clients. Since 1990, Georgia's
Hispanic population has at least doubled, hitting 207,000 in 1997, according to
the Census Bureau. Some researchers say the number closer to 750,000, including
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past six months, Adams' firm has filed suit on behalf of more than
230 plaintiffs in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia alone.
Nearly all their clients are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cases involving Graciela and the men from Oaxaca, both companies
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our clients are the least able to afford to lose a week's pay,''
Richardson said. ``To be cheated out of that money, for them, is a
world-rocker.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it's sometimes hard to persuade illegal workers to sue because many
fear they will be found and deported.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Fair Labor Standards Act says all workers, regardless of immigration
status, must be paid minimum wage and fair overtime if they work at a company
that engages in interstate commerce or earns more than $500,000 in gross
revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Labor Department is responsible for enforcing wage and overtime
laws, but labor lawyers say the agency has too great a workload and is not
aggressive enough in pursuing back wages and penalties. George Holt, the Labor
Department's district director in Georgia, said his office makes about 15,000
``compliance actions'' a year in Georgia and tries to complete all
investigations within three months.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most common ways of breaking the labor law is to put regular
employees ``on salary'' so the company doesn't have to pay overtime. Most of the
time that's illegal unless the employee is a manager or an executive.
</P>
<P>
	   Other companies try to skirt the law by treating employees as independent
contractors to avoid paying overtime, Social Security taxes and workers'
compensation, Adams said. It also is ``extremely common'' to see companies
disappear without paying workers their final check, particularly in the
construction business, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Minneapolis, nine Holiday Inn Express housekeepers helped unionize their
fellow workers but soon afterward were fired and reported them to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the nine workers won a $72,000 settlement from the hotel in the
first case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission intervened on
behalf of illegal immigrants. However, they will almost certainly be deported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a good example of the vulnerability of undocumented workers,'' said
Benjamin Casper, a lawyer with the Centro Legal, a nonprofit law office in St.
Paul, Minn. ``It's attractive to employers to have a work force that won't stand
up for itself and organize.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Traps Suspected Cuban Spy  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Suspicious that a U.S. immigration official was passing on
classified information about defectors to the Cuban government, FBI
investigators set a trap.
</P>
<P>
	   It worked.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said that 12 minutes after they fed Mariano Faget phony
information about a pending defection by a Cuban official, they caught him
passing it on to a contact with ties to the Communist island's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Faget, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, has been charged with violating the federal
Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI says Faget, 54, may have been passing on classified information
about Cuban defectors for some time.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, Faget was ordered held until a bail hearing
Thursday. Defense attorney Joel Kaplan declined comment, as did Faget's
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fy-EHT') faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the agency that
represents Cuba in Washington and had regular contact with the man he called
last week in the sting -- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Faget had been under investigation for a year. They
declined to say how long they believe he had been passing on classified
information.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said it was uncertain what effect Faget's alleged espionage had --
whether any Cubans were prevented from defecting, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   As a supervisory district adjudication officer for the INS, Faget had
``secret'' security clearance and oversaw decisions that affected the residency
status of immigrants, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and his father came to the United States and claimed political asylum
in 1960, the year after Cuban President Fidel Castro came to power. Faget became
a U.S. citizen in 1963 and began working for the immigration agency as a clerk
in 1966, said INS district director Bob Wallis.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials said the trap was sprung on Faget at a meeting with INS and
FBI officials Feb 11.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget was shown pictures of a Cuban intelligence
official he knew and was told that the man wanted to defect. He also was told
that the information was secret and very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Faget returned to his office and used his personal
cellular phone to call the New York businessman, telling him ``that `a person we
both know' was `one of the ones working with the Americans,''' U.S. Attorney
Thomas Scott said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget then mentioned the officer by name and later called to further discuss
the case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Court papers say Faget and the New York businessman are officers of
America-Cuba, a Miami-based company whose stated purpose is to engage in future
business transactions with the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the investigation confirmed for The Associated Press that
Pedro Font -- America-Cuba's president -- is the businessman referred to in the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   A number listed for Font in Greenwich, Conn., was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget's arrest comes amid strained relations with Cuba stemming from the
custody of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. The child's Miami relatives have fought to
keep him in the United States since a failed November immigration attempt ended
in the drowning deaths of his mother and 10 others.

<HEADLINE> Soldier's Hearing in Kosovo Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A soldier recalled how he and his comrades
followed a trail of blood through the snow to the body of an ethnic Albanian
girl, allegedly slain by a fellow U.S. serviceman in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony came at an opening preliminary hearing on Friday for Staff
Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, who is accused of assaulting and killing the 11-year-old
girl last month. Ronghi was serving as a peacekeeper in the NATO-led force in
the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing -- similar to a grand jury -- was to determine if there is
enough evidence to court-martial Ronghi on charges of murder and indecent acts
with a child. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi's defense counsel disputed that his acts were premeditated, and is
seeking a lesser charge that would carry a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment. Ronghi has not yet entered a plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the nature of the case, reporters were required to withhold
witnesses' names to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   One visibly shaken soldier told the court how, on the night of Jan. 13, he
and several comrades drove to a wooded hillside. They followed a faint trail of
blood to where a tin can appeared to have been tossed in the snow. A few feet
away, they noticed something else.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, my God, don't let that be a sock, please don't let that be a sock,''
one of the soldiers said, according to the testimony. They removed some snow and
found the dead girl curled into the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
	   Some details of how the soldiers came to suspect Ronghi were unclear in
Friday's testimony. But an investigating officer testified that Ronghi told a
witness who was in his vehicle that day to keep quiet about anything he had
seen.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi allegedly said it is ``easy to get away with something like this in a
Third World country,'' and he knew that because he had ``done it before in the
desert.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officer said a superior told him that, when confronted, Ronghi initially
denied knowing anything about the body. Then he said he found it in an apartment
building and got scared so he buried it, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi, 35, is a weapons squad leader assigned to the 504th Parachute
Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, N.C. The Niles, Ohio, native previously
fought in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi is being held in detention at the U.S. Army's Mannheim confinement
facility in Germany. He was brought to Kosovo for the hearing, which could last
up to a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army said Ronghi has made a statement on the case, but it has not yet
been released. Last month, Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military's unofficial
newspaper, reported he admitted to the killing. There has been no official
confirmation of that report.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi appeared calm as he listened to the testimony Friday. He did not
speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courtroom, the girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, said the family was
satisfied with the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a military court, and I believe nothing will be hidden here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, an investigating officer will study the testimony and
refer the case to higher officers, who will decide whether to convene a
court-martial.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Found in Indonesia Province  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- Twelve bodies, most believed to be victims of a
mass killing, have been discovered in the strife-torn Indonesian province of
Aceh, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Sayed Husaini, a spokesman of the local police said eleven of the
bodies, some handcuffed, were found Thursday in a 1,000-foot ravine in Lingge
Isaq district in central Aceh regency.
</P>
<P>
	   Husaini said it appeared they had been killed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were thrown into the ravine after being shot dead,'' he told
reporters Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in North Aceh on Friday found the body of a fellow villager in a
pit near the region's main town of Lhokseumawe, said Lt. Col. Syafei Aksal,
North Aceh police chief.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Husaini and Aksal believed that the victims were killed by members of
the Free Aceh Movement, a separatist group that is fighting for an independence
state in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings brought this year's death toll in Aceh to at least 191,
including 15 soldiers and 13 policemen.
</P>
<P>
	   Aceh, an oil-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra island, is one of
several Indonesian regions where separatists are fighting for independence.

<HEADLINE> US Air: Boeing Withheld Test Info  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. is denying allegations by US Airways that it
withheld flight test data that could have prevented a plane crash near
Pittsburgh in 1994 that killed all 132 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing said the information was made available to the Federal Aviation
Administration when the airplane was being certified in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have always been upfront and honest with the FAA," said Mike Denton,
former chief engineer for the Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
	   In court documents unsealed this week in Chicago, US Airways said the test
data involved the Boeing 737's flying characteristics at a certain speed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled last year that a rudder
reversal probably caused the 737 to crash into a gully near Aliquippa, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the crash, airlines have instructed their pilots to fly the 737 faster
when first deploying flaps to give themselves more time to correct problems that
can't be fixed at slower speeds. The higher speed was officially adopted into
Boeing's 737 operating manual last March.
</P>
<P>
	   The court documents included depositions from US Airways officials. The
documents were part of a petition filed by attorneys for families of two of the
crash victims. The families are seeking punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
	   James Gibbs, who was flight manager for USAir -- now US Airways -- at the
time of the crash, was quoted as saying that if Boeing had not withheld the
data, the crew would have been able to fly out of the situation.

<HEADLINE> America West Faces Computer Glitch  </HEADLINE>
    By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Nicole Pillsbury was supposed to have spent the day at a
California spa in preparation for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she spent Friday at an airport with a pillow, blanket and snacks
provided by local fire officials.
</P>
<P>
	   En route from Boston, her flight to Orange County was one of at least 128
America West Airlines flights canceled nationwide Thursday and Friday because of
a glitch in the airline's computer system that prepares flight plans for pilots
and crews.
</P>
<P>
	   Pillsbury and hundreds of other passengers were forced to camp out at
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got off the plane and it was just chaos," Pillsbury said. "There was not
one person to tell us where to go, what to do, what's up with our bags, nothing.
And then when we would approach someone to ask them and no one had any
information."
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch was the latest in an array of unrelated problems for the airline,
including hefty maintenance fines and consistent rankings as one of the
country's worst airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline was fined $5 million by the Federal Aviation Administration in
July 1998 over maintenance and safety violations. The airline ultimately paid
$2.5 million; the FAA waived the rest last year.
</P>
<P>
	   America West also had the highest rate of passenger complaints to the
Transportation Department and the poorest on-time arrival record of any major
airline in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tempe-based airline is the nation's ninth-largest carrier, with hubs in
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the problems, America West is still turning record profits. America
West Holdings Corp., the parent company of America West Airlines and a travel
package arm, The Leisure Co., reported in January that it earned a record $119.4
million, or $3.03 per share, in 1999. It marked a 26 percent increase over 1998
for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're a low cost carrier that serves two big growing markets -- Phoenix
and Las Vegas -- that are very popular with tourists," said Ray Neidle, an
analyst who follows the airline industry for ING Barings in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   However, if a company's success is measured by its customers' satisfaction,
the airline has work to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be able to deliver a product that's consistent and when you
have situations like this, it reinforces the negative image you have," Neidle
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline was operating on a backup system Friday while investigating the
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline spokeswoman Patty Nowack said the airline gave away 1,500 hotel
rooms in Phoenix Thursday night. She disputed the airport's numbers for people
spending the night in the terminal, saying it was less than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   But amid the confusion, lost baggage and long waits, it appeared the airline
could do nothing to appease some of its angry customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will never fly America West again," said Mike Stark of Chicago, who
managed to get a hotel room.

<HEADLINE> Trade Ministers Seek Better Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The world's poorest nations must be allowed to
improve their economies through increasing global trade, negotiators to a U.N.
conference on Third World development agreed today.
</P>
<P>
	   But the message of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development was watered
down more than many participants would have liked, with the world's two biggest
economies, the United States and the European Union, balking at key proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   As UNCTAD ended its 8-day conference today, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero said ministers had been "instrumental in creating an atmosphere of
greater mutual understanding on the complexities of the globalization process."
</P>
<P>
	   The "Bangkok Declaration" agreed today sets the agenda for the 190-nation
forum for the next four years, urging rich and poor countries to work to create
a "prosperous, peaceful and secure world based on true partnership."
</P>
<P>
	   But the declaration gave few specific directions for resolving the disputes
that have derailed negotiations for a binding trade deal in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and E.U. officials made it clear from the outset they don't want UNCTAD
-- which is supposed to be a forum for helping developing nations -- moving onto
the WTO's turf. Washington sent only a low-level delegation to Bangkok, saying
trade disputes should be resolved by the WTO, which has the power to enforce
treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   Many developing nations, and their allies in the developed world, want rich
economies to open their markets fully to all products from the world's 48
poorest countries -- with no tariffs or quotas imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of the 15-nation European Union have agreed to open their
markets to most, but not all Third World goods. The United States has also
expressed reluctance to dropping all quotas.
</P>
<P>
	   The final declaration only urged UNCTAD to "build consensus" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   It also made only passing reference to the issue of subsidies -- a large
dispute in the WTO, where the European Union has defended its heavy agricultural
subsidies against critics who want them removed.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD delegates focused on the rapid globalization of the world economy,
which critics say has enabled the rich to get richer, while leaving poor
countries lagging far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the international community, just as for each and every national
society, the ultimate test lies in the way it treats the weaker members of the
community," UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
	   The UNCTAD delegates gathered a little more than two months after the
embarrassing collapse of WTO talks in Seattle, where the 135 WTO members were
unable to agree on launching a new round of commerce talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Geneva-based WTO sets rules for world trade, while UNCTAD plays more of
an advisory role, issuing non-binding declarations about how to help the poor do
better.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington on Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky held
separate discussions with Japanese Foreign Minister Yehei Kono and Pascal Lamy,
the top EU trade negotiator, to seek ways on restarting the WTO talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky said afterward she believed the world's largest economies are
ready to try to resolve the sticking points that wrecked the Seattle summit.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor nations have clamored for relief from foreign debts they say hinders
their ability to grow, and Algeria's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, said today
at UNCTAD that some loan write-offs have been too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the macabre specter of someone visiting a dying man and saying,
'Well, die happy. You won't have any debts to pay,"' Bouteflika said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Settles Discrimination Charges  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is paying $3.8 million in one of the
largest settlements with the Labor Department involving discrimination in hiring
women or minorities at seven of the company's plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford has agreed to compensate women and minority applicants for lost wages
for entry-level assembly positions at company plants in Louisville, Ky.; Wayne
and Sterling Heights, Mich.; Sandusky, Ohio; Kansas City and St. Louis, Mo.; and
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also will hire 100 women and minorities from previous applicants for
assembly jobs at the plants, according to the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the fifth-largest settlement by a company with the Labor Department's
Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which oversees federal contractors for
compliance with the government's affirmative action and nondiscrimination
requirements, officials said Friday. The department can cancel federal contracts
with companies that do not comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor officials said the agreement also ensured that Ford would hire more
women and minorities at all its facilities because Ford agreed to employ them in
proportion to the percentage that apply.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is significant that the company -- on a corporate-wide basis -- will
change its hiring analysis which will open a pipeline of opportunity to women
and minorities who have too long been excluded from good paying jobs on the Ford
assembly line," said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford did not admit to any discrimination in the settlement. The company said
it wanted to avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to reestablish a good working relationship with the agency," said
Ford spokeswoman Della DiPietro. "We fully share the same goals regarding
diversity in the workforce. Prolonged litigation is not in the best interest of
our employees or our shareholders or our consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the money -- $2 million -- is going to qualified female applicants
who were not hired at the Kentucky Truck Plant in 1993, shortly after the
facility underwent a major expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   At the plant, federal officials identified 318 qualified female applicants
who were not hired. Women composed 38 percent of qualified applicants, but only
about 25 percent of those hired for the assembly jobs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiPietro said a majority of those 318 female applicants subsequently were
hired at the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The other Ford plants are: Michigan Truck Plant; Sterling Axle; Sandusky;
Kansas City Assembly; St. Louis Assembly; and Norfolk Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The consent decree goes into effect today, closing a total of 10
discrimination cases involving Ford that federal officials started at various
plants and facilities from 1989 to 1998. There was no formal finding of
discrimination at the other three facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest Labor Department settlement involving allegations of
discrimination by a federal contractor was $14 million paid by Harris Bank of
Chicago in 1989.

<HEADLINE> INS Won't Change Elian's Custodian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Immigration officials say moving Elian Gonzalez to a new
temporary custodian in Miami, as his father in Cuba wants, would be too
disruptive to the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, they said they were continuing to press in federal court
for Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service outlined its stance in a letter
Friday to Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency declared that ``transferring Elian temporarily to a new and
unfamiliar environment would not be advisable for the child after already
experiencing the trauma of leaving his home in Cuba and losing his mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida last Thanksgiving,
Elian has been temporarily placed in the custody of a great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, whose family is waging a legal battle to keep the boy in this country
permanently. His mother and 10 others died in a boat wreck while fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father had requested that Attorney General Janet Reno shift the
boy's temporary custody to another of his great-uncles in Miami, Manolo
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   The father had complained that Lazaro Gonzalez and his family had given the
news media too much access to Elian, had arranged psychiatric treatment for the
boy by doctors who had not been approved by his father and had allowed relatives
with criminal records to be around the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   An INS statement said the agency shares the father's concerns about the
boy's well-being ``and therefore will request information from Lazaro Gonzalez
concerning the credentials of any psychiatrist or psychologist who has seen
Elian, as well as any treatment that may have been prescribed for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also promised to obtain details of Elian's schooling in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami-based nongovernmental organization visited Lazaro Gonzalez's home to
verify that it was an adequate setting for Elian, the INS said. It also said it
was aware that Lazaro had past convictions for driving under the influence of
alcohol, but its current information does not suggest his home is inadequate for
Elian's temporary care.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Reno rejected a request to meet with Elian during a visit Friday
to Miami, her hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez's family had asked Reno to meet with them and Elian in hopes
she would sympathize with their fight to keep the child in the United States.
She spoke at an awards ceremony for an organization that provides legal
assistance to neglected children.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno would prefer to meet Lazaro's family in Washington next week so that
INS Commissioner Doris Meissner also could also attend, Associate Deputy
Attorney General James Castello said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Castello wrote, however, that Reno believes it is ``unnecessary'' for Elian
to attend, explaining that the adult relatives could convey any new information
they want her to hear.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although unemployment is at a 30-year low among young
people, too many of those without jobs lack training, education and economic
standing, President Clinton said today in announcing $223 million in grants to
attack the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to make sure our children are prepared for this new economy, by
helping every child enter school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed,''
Clinton said in his weekly radio address, which also paid tribute to February's
observance of Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``More Americans -- and more African-Americans -- are going on to college
than ever before,'' the president said. ``But we must give every child that
chance and we must help their families shoulder the burden.''
</P>
<P>
	   The $223 million in federal grants are earmarked for job training and summer
jobs programs in 36 low-income areas, as well as initiatives to encourage young
people to stay in school and prepare for college.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will provide a lifeline of opportunity to any young person willing to
work for a better future,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money comes from a $250 million fund in the current budget for what the
administration calls Youth Opportunity grants. The White House envisions a
five-year, $1.3 billion program with participation from government, business and
nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the grants will help an estimated 44,000 young people
aged 14 to 21 in places as diverse as inner-city Baltimore and the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   In Baltimore, an $11 million grant to the city's employment development
office would provide computer classes, high school equivalency programs, career
counseling, internships and career counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Pine Ridge Reservation, which Clinton visited last year, the Oglala
Sioux tribe and several partners would use $4 million to set up job training,
drug and alcohol counseling, tutoring and other services for an estimated 750
young people.

<HEADLINE> Shaw Endorses Earning Limits Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By CASSANDRA BURRELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security beneficiaries shouldn't be penalized for
staying on the job after turning 65, the chairman of a House panel that oversees
the retirement said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The House could vote as early as March 2 on a GOP plan to repeal the Social
Security ``earnings penalty'' for working Americans age 65 to 69, Rep. Clay
Shaw, R-Fla., said in the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage could mean bigger benefit checks for older employees who continue to
hold down a job.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would do away with a rule requiring the government to
subtract $1 in Social Security benefits from every $3 beneficiaries up to age 70
earn over a prescribed limit, currently $17,000 a year. Earlier this week,
President Clinton said he would sign the bill if passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This may sound obscure, but millions of older Americans know exactly what
the Social Security earnings penalty is because they have lost literally
billions of dollars in benefits because of it,'' said Shaw, who chairs the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's worse, millions more soon-to-be seniors in the baby boom generation
could be hit by this work penalty if we don't change the law now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw described the dilemma of a 66-year-old Florida constituent who received
about $5,000 a year in benefits. If the woman, described only as Janet, took a
part-time job as a grocery store cashier, she could earn as much as $18,000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But since that is $1,500 over the current earnings limit, Janet would lose
one-third of that amount, or $500, in Social Security payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's just not fair,'' Shaw said. ``Americans pay into the Social
Security system their entire working lives, and working seniors deserve their
benefits just like everyone else does. They shouldn't be penalized because they
want to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the earnings limit is an issue dear to the hearts of older
Americans, an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in their
struggle for control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 seniors lose part or all of their benefits because of the
earnings limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. The
earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost the government roughly $22.7 billion
over 10 years, according to GOP estimates.

<HEADLINE> Putin Uses Discipline To Woo Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGELA CHARLTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian high school students will soon be taking new lessons:
how to clean and fire Kalashnikov assault rifles. Some 14- to 16-year-olds will
be drafted as military trainees, to combat juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
	   The revival of these Soviet-era programs is part of acting President
Vladimir Putin's design for strengthening discipline and, in turn, strengthening
Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Russians have an army that can barely feed its soldiers and a government
that cannot pay its bills. Legions of bureaucrats earn dismal salaries, and many
subsist on bribes. Russia's global voice, once a roar, has faded.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters embrace Putin's ``make Russia mighty again'' motto and are expected
to elect him president next month. Some in the West are less charmed, fearing a
new Russian menace or a crackdown on freedoms Russians won with the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin believes in a strong state and obedient citizens, regardless of what
he says about protecting rights,'' says Alexander Kostinsky of the human rights
group Memorial. ``Russians also say they want a strong state -- maybe they want
it so badly they will sacrifice some rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 15-year KGB veteran, Putin has flexed Russia's military muscle in
Chechnya, strengthened police patrols and increased monitoring of journalists
and the Internet by security services. The nation's new national security
doctrine broadens the Kremlin's authority to use nuclear weapons and accuses the
United States of trying to weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One must not keep pretending that we do not need state security bodies,''
Putin wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
	   A follower of the Russian Orthodox Church, Putin also calls for restoration
of ``moral values'' to a country steeped in cynicism and crime.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a recent Putin decree, boys aged 14 to 16 who are orphans or
fatherless can be conscripted to serve as trainees in military units.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also decreed that starting in September, students 15 and older will
get combat training and take classes in military history. Education Ministry
officials say the lessons will resemble technically, but not ideologically, a
Soviet-era program dropped in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Boys will also be required to spend five days at a military base to prepare
for Russia's mandatory draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin is not the only one who seeks a sturdy state. Nearly all leading
Russian politicians preach a similar gospel. And Russians have long yearned for
a leader who can make their streets safe and guarantee the banks won't run off
with their savings.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear, however, whether Putin can take his discipline campaign from
the schoolyard to what analysts say is the root of Russia's weakness: corruption
at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's finances are limited, and the Kremlin is under heavy
pressure from tycoons who control the lucrative oil, gas, aluminum and
electricity industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has said a key goal is ``leveling the playing field'' for businesses
by ending privileges for selected magnates. He has purged from his
administration some Yeltsin allies at the heart of that privilege system.
</P>
<P>
	   But those players haven't disappeared, and observers expect fierce
resistance to efforts to root out high-level graft.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russia's economy has shrunk dramatically, ``its elite have not lived
so well since before the 1917 revolution,'' the daily Segodnya wrote last week.
``How can one carry out reforms from the top in this situation, contrary to the
will of the ruling class?''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin himself has not been accused of dirty dealings. But he worked as
deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, when the city became known as
one of Russia's most corrupt and dangerous. He then worked in the Kremlin's
property management office, an agency that Swiss and Russian prosecutors have
accused of taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's hard line initially alarmed the West. But some Western politicians
have decided a strong Russia is in their interest -- with security organs strict
enough to prevent the illicit export of nuclear materials and to punish
organized crime bosses, and a government solvent enough to pay off its foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has stood firm against international criticism of the Chechnya war --
to the delight of most Russians. But he also resumed ties with NATO after almost
a year of impasse caused largely by NATO's bombing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia depends on the West too much for aid and trade to disregard it
entirely,'' says Vyacheslav Nikonov, a former Kremlin aide who heads the
Politika think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin is clever enough to understand this. The question is how harshly he
will punish those who don't agree with his ideas about discipline.''

<HEADLINE> Israelis Want To See Lebanon War End  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAVNE, Israel (AP) -- Arieh Yitah no longer believes in the war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   The career military officer who fought Lebanese guerrillas for years is
unshaven and haggard these days, in mourning for his son, Tsahi, who was killed
by a guerrilla missile attack in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Yitah, now a major general in the reserves, told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak this past week that Israel must bring its troops home quickly, even before
Barak's July target. ``I asked the prime minister to make sure he (Tsahi) will
be the last victim,'' Yitah said.
</P>
<P>
	   His high-profile appeal, broadcast on prime-time TV newscasts, has only
deepened Israelis' confusion over how to end the 18-year war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, Barak's looming deadline and a spate of Israeli casualties
have moved the acrimonious debate into venues where politics were once taboo.
Israelis have been stunned to hear soldiers in front-line posts openly voice
opposition to the army's continued presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   One top commander reportedly called those soldiers ``crybabies.'' Another
derisively referred to the Four Mothers grassroots group that is lobbying for
withdrawal from Lebanon as ``the four dishrags,'' saying they undermine troop
morale.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to destroy the Palestine Liberation
Organization infrastructure there. It more or less succeeded, but at the cost of
antagonizing other groups previously not hostile to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, after it withdrew from other parts of Lebanon, Israel carved out a
``security zone'' in southern Lebanon to protect its northern settlements from
those groups. Since 1985, its major adversary has been Hezbollah, a Shiite
Muslim guerrilla group backed by Iran and Syria. About 250 Israeli soldiers have
died in Lebanon in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak promised to revive moribund peace talks with Syria in a bid to get
Israeli troops out of the ``Lebanon mud'' by July. He got the Syrians back to
the table in December, but by mid-January disagreements over the Israeli-held
Golan Heights broke up the talks. Within days, Hezbollah was intensifying its
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Tsahi Yitah was one of seven Israeli soldiers killed in a little over
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   His father, his black shirt ripped in a sign of Jewish ritual mourning, said
the government must strive to withdraw soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (the soldiers) have no business being there,'' Yitah said as he sat
in a mourning tent near a row of soldiers who served with his son, the family's
eldest who had played keyboard in a band with his siblings.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak needs to get the withdrawal under way ``to prevent others from
dying,'' Yitah said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, the army's chief of military operations,
acknowledged that with the end of the conflict in sight, losses cut even deeper.
Tears streamed down his cheeks as he listened to the Yitahs talk about their
son. The elder Yitah once served under Eiland, whose own son will be posted to
Lebanon next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Blunt talk, even in a time of mourning, has become increasingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are no longer blindly accepting what the government and the army
tells them. They are no longer willing to be passive,'' said Linda Ben-Zvi, a
leader of the Four Mothers movement, which was founded in 1997 by women whose
sons were serving in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben-Zvi, who immigrated to Israel from Colorado six years ago, sees
parallels between Lebanon and the Vietnam War, which she protested against as a
student at New York University in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   With the recent surge of fighting in southern Lebanon, both Israeli TV
stations have broadcast unprecedented battlefield footage of wounded soldiers,
their faces contorted with pain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are now seeing the bodies of our sons in the living room, an exact
replica of what happened in America with Vietnam,'' Ben-Zvi said. ``You can
never win a guerrilla war.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to a Gallup poll published in the newspaper Maariv on Feb. 11, the
day Yitah was killed, 56 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal
from southern Lebanon, 34 percent oppose it and 10 percent are undecided. The
poll questioned 600 Israeli adults and had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Zevulun Orlev, a decorated military veteran who is a lawmaker in Barak's
governing coalition, said the army should send only combat soldiers who
volunteer for service in Lebanon to ensure a dedicated fighting force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is a great disaster that the political debate has entered the
outposts in south Lebanon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tsahi Yitah's 16-year-old sister, Etty, said her brother deeply loved the
army and volunteered for combat duty, even though her mother tried to persuade
him to join one of the army bands.
</P>
<P>
	   Etty has a message for her brother's friends. ``I tell them, `Don't be
heroes, because heroes die,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Arrest Kurd Mayors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish police arrested two prominent Kurdish mayors
Saturday on suspicion of links to Abdullah Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish rebel
group, authorities said. News reports said a third mayor also had been detained.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors for the southeastern cities of Diyarbakir and Siirt were taken
away for questioning on allegations they aided Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party,
or PKK, the regional governor's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Private NTV television said the mayor for Bingol also was detained.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement alleged the mayors ``contributed to the internal and external
activities of the PKK, took part in contacts and meetings relating to the PKK,
took instructions from the PKK and channeled some funds to the organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said authorities were acting on information received following a recent
crackdown on the group, in which 25 alleged PKK members were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions come two days after Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh held
talks with Feridun Celik, the Diyarbakir mayor, and is likely to set back
Turkey's efforts to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU recently made Turkey a candidate for membership and made clear that
membership hinges on improved human rights and greater freedoms for Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   Celik and 36 other pro-Kurdish politicians came to power after sweeping
municipal elections in April throughout the mainly Kurdish southeast. They have
urged increased cultural rights for Kurds, who are barred from teaching and
broadcasting in their own language.
</P>
<P>
	   Their People's Democracy Party faces closure by the constitutional court on
charges of being a front for the PKK.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Lebanon Blast Israel Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Egypt's president paid a landmark visit to Lebanon
on Saturday, meeting with his Lebanese counterpart and expressing support for
the guerrillas who are fighting Israeli occupation of a section of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hosni Mubarak became the first Egyptian leader to visit the
Lebanese capital since Lebanon won independence in 1943. His visit demonstrated
the two nations' solidarity in the face of recent Israeli airstrikes here.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak held talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. In a joint
statement, the two leaders said they support Lebanese guerrillas' right to
resist the Israeli troop presence in a region near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance is a result, not a cause, of the occupation,'' the leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss criticized Beirut
protesters who have called for U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield's expulsion in
recent days. He said targeting an ambassador is ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoss had previously blessed the protesters, who accuse the United States of
blindly backing Israel. His turnabout Saturday was seen as a move to avoid
damaging U.S.-Lebanese relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Tension rose sharply last week in southern Lebanon, the last active
Arab-Israeli war front, after Israel responded to guerrilla attacks on its
troops by carrying out air raids that destroyed power stations and wounded at
least 15 Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak and Lahoud's joint statement Saturday condemned the Feb. 8
airstrikes and Israeli threats of further raids if its soldiers are attacked.
The statement accused Israel of ignoring a 1996 understanding that forbids
attacks on or from civilian areas in southern Lebanon. It said such a policy
``could lead to an escalation with unforeseen consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has said the raids were in retaliation for Hezbollah guerrilla
attacks against Israeli soldiers in the occupied border zone. Seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed since Jan. 25 in the area, which Israel has occupied
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In their statement Saturday, Lahoud and Mubarak said the ``primary
foundation of peace'' in the Middle East lies in Israel's full withdrawal from
occupied lands, including the occupied zone here, the Golan Heights and the
Palestinian territories. They said the right of Palestinian refugees to return
home is also crucial.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Votes for New Parliament  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT FRANCE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Kyrgyzstan's reputation as the lone democratic
state in Central Asia appeared in jeopardy as it prepared to hold parliamentary
elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, international organizations have sent messages to President
Askar Akayev voicing concerns that the election process is being unfairly
restricted. Most opposition parties have been barred from fielding their
strongest candidates, usually on minor technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, hundreds of protesters surrounded election headquarters in the
southern city of Jalal-abad, demanding the resignation of election officials
after an opposition candidate was dropped from the ballot at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate, Marat Kaipov, had been running against presidential aide
Bekbolot Talgarbekov and was barred on a technicality. Jalal-abad residents
accuse Talgarbekov of buying votes with sheep and computers and forcing local
officials to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrgyzstan, a poor, mountainous country of 4 million people, had been
considered the most democratic nation to emerge from former Soviet Central Asia.
But Akayev, who has led the country since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union,
has increasingly cracked down on dissent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   One opposition party, the Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan, was barred from
the elections earlier this month after a court ruled that a party congress to
select candidates failed to reach a quorum. The Poor People's Party was barred
because its charter did not state that it would participate in elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, international organizations monitoring television election coverage in
recent weeks found that state channels are giving positive air time to
pro-government parties and mostly negative coverage to opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Vice President
Al Gore have sent messages expressing concern over the restrictions. The OSCE
said it will be ``extremely difficult'' for the balloting here to meet its
international election standards.
</P>
<P>
	   With very little viable industry and natural resources, Kyrgyzstan relies
heavily on Western aid -- nearly $1.2 billion from 1991 to 1997, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That aid depends on
donors' confidence in Kyrgyzstan's democratic system, the OECD said.
</P>
<P>
	   Results from Sunday's voting were expected Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Curbs on Tax Shelters  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax shelters: They've been described as deals done by
smart people that, if it not for tax advantages, would be very stupid. But the
proliferation of corporate tax shelters is no laughing matter to the U.S.
Treasury, which puts losses at $10 billion a year -- and growing.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is asking Congress for tough new laws to crack down on
companies and the financial advisers who design these complex tax-avoidance
schemes. Reluctant Republicans contend the issue is being overblown in a one-man
crusade by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
	   The attitude of the GOP and corporate opponents of the Clinton
administration proposal was summed up recently by House Majority Leader Dick
Armey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The business of a corporation is to maximize its earnings for its
shareholders,'' Armey, R-Texas, told reporters. ``Since tax is a very large part
of their costs, anything they can do to minimize that share of their costs would
be a legitimate thing. Obviously, they need to do what is legal, and we presume
they are doing that.''
</P>
<P>
	   But evidence to the contrary is increasing.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, corporate tax receipts were down 2.5 percent in fiscal 1999,
even though the U.S. economy is booming and there is no commensurate decline in
company profits. Also, the Internal Revenue Service recently has won a series of
federal court cases exposing tax shelters devised for major companies such as
United Parcel Service, Compaq and Winn-Dixie.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's become a substantial source of competition to provide shelters, to
market shelters, often with confidentiality agreements,'' Summers said in an
interview. ``There is pressure ... otherwise the business will be taken to
another accounting firm.''
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate tax shelters often are wrongly confused with loopholes and
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Loopholes are special provisions inserted in the tax law by Congress to
benefit specific industries or even favored companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Welfare is a term used by political opponents to condemn any broader
government program aimed at assisting certain types of business.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax shelters, on the other hand, are labyrinthine plans to avoid paying
taxes. They are dreamed up by accountants and tax lawyers and sold to companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers says these companies and advisers are playing the ``audit lottery''
in hopes they can devise a scheme so complex that the IRS cannot figure out if
it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are predicated on complexity,'' said Paul Sax, a San Francisco
attorney who heads the tax section of the American Bar Association. ``They are
sold on the basis that examining agents won't understand them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even if a company is caught, it can take the IRS years and great costs to
win a court case. The offending corporation often is liable only for back taxes
and interest -- sometimes an acceptable price of doing business.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers is pushing for tough new penalties, including a 25 percent excise
tax on the marketers and buyers of tax shelters and an increase in the penalty
for corporate tax underreporting from 20 percent to 40 percent. These proposals
would raise about $23 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to Treasury
estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have to be penalties possible if we're going to deter this
activity,'' Summers said. ``Our tax system is based on voluntary compliance.
That compliance depends on people having the sense that others, particularly
those who are more fortunate, pay the taxes they are required to pay.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's proposal would require more disclosure to the
government. It also would put into law several court precedents that essentially
define an illegal tax shelter as a transaction ``devoid of economic substance''
if it did not have tax advantages.
</P>
<P>
	   Not surprisingly, corporate tax executives and accounting firms oppose the
plan and question the $10 billion estimated revenue loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Kies, lobbyist for the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, said the
proposals raise concerns about giving the IRS new powers and muddling tax law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are asking for all these powers and they have never bothered to look
at the facts,'' Kies said. ``Our position has been, show us the problem -- don't
give us anecdotal stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Given the opposition from much of corporate America, Republicans who control
Congress are unlikely to approve Clinton's proposal. The Senate Finance
Committee is planning hearings in the coming weeks, but it is unclear if there
will be much action beyond that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I do my job well, it's not going anywhere,'' Kies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the IRS has created a new tax shelter analysis office as part of
its ongoing reorganization and is beefing up both training and field
coordination to better attack tax shelters around the world. But Larry Langdon,
commissioner of the new IRS division for large and mid-size companies, said new
laws are still needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This phenomenon really undermines the tax system,'' Langdon said. ``We
need to use whatever tools we can to curtail it.''

<HEADLINE> Examples of Corporate Tax Shelters  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Examples from the Treasury Department of recent tax shelters that had no
other economic purpose.
</P>
<P>
	    Lease-In, Lease-Out
</P>
<P>
	   To defer taxes, a U.S. bank leases a long-standing foreign entity, such as a
town hall or a railroad, and then leases it back to the foreign municipality.
Ownership and use of the entity never changes in reality, but the bank is able
to borrow money for its lease that generates deductions for the rent.
</P>
<P>
	   Although these deductions are only temporary, the upshot is deferral of
taxes. New government regulations have effectively denied these tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
	    Basis-Shift Transactions
</P>
<P>
	   A foreign entity has a loan of $5 million secured by five assets, each worth
$1 million. The foreign entity transfers one asset to its U.S. subsidiary, which
then estimates the asset's value, or basis, at the full $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The subsidiary then sells the asset for $1 million and claims a $4 million
loss, which is then used to shelter other income from taxes. Before passage last
year of new laws, the foreign entity could have done the same thing with each of
the other assets.
</P>
<P>
	    Fast-Pay Stock Transaction
</P>
<P>
	   A corporate borrower and a tax-exempt lender contribute $1 million each to a
real estate investment trust. The corporation immediately borrows back the full
$2 million, at 7 percent interest. Because such interest is deductible, the
corporation deducts $140,000 from its taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the tax-exempt lender receives stock from the corporation that
pays a 14 percent dividend. The real estate investment trust can fully deduct
that dividend, offsetting all of its income from the loan payments made by the
corporate borrower. Eventually, the corporation buys back the stock from the
tax-exempt lender at much lower prices -- effectively paying back the original
$1 million loan.
</P>
<P>
	   The upshot is that the borrower is able to deduct both principal and
interest on the loan, instead of just the interest. Proposed regulations would
deny these tax benefits.

<HEADLINE> Asia Avoids Sting of Oil Price Hike  </HEADLINE>
    By DEAN VISSER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Soaring oil prices have the Western world bracing for the
worst, but many Asian countries may be better positioned to avoid a sting.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC has limited oil production, increasing prices from $12 a barrel last
year to about $30 a barrel in recent months. At the peak of the Asian economic
crisis about two years ago, the jump would have plunged the region into a deeper
slump.
</P>
<P>
	   But things have changed in Asia. Currencies and businesses are on the
rebound, nuclear reactors are used more for energy, and changes in manufacturing
practices mean less reliance on heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil is a lot less important these days," said Scott Weaver, deputy head of
research at ING Barings Securities' Taiwan branch.
</P>
<P>
	   In Asia, the oil market is diverse, ranging from Japan, which imports all
its oil, to Indonesia, a big oil producer that sees the price increase as a
windfall.
</P>
<P>
	   If the prices continue to rise, economists say consumers in Asia could be
hit by general inflation, a common result of high oil prices. But across the
region, even a huge price jump is nowhere near the nightmare it would have been
only a few years earlier, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   "As incomes are rising, people are spending more on things like mobile
phones, housing, health care and other services," Weaver said. "Fuel would've
been a higher percentage of their costs 20 years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   Big, modern manufacturing centers such as Taiwan and Hong Kong are somewhat
vulnerable. But in the past two decades they've moved from making mostly plastic
goods and textiles to stereos and computer chips that require a lot less oil
byproducts and energy.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy sources have also changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuclear reactors now supply more than a third of Japan's electricity,
compared with 6.5 percent during the oil crisis of the mid-1970s, according to
the country's energy agency.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea, an industrial giant that also imports nearly all its oil, is
not panicking but is preparing, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to inform people how much energy imports we can reduce by just
turning off the lights...," South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   In tropical Southeast Asia, many countries have a natural defense against
high oil prices: year-round hot weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "The situation is a lot worse in the Northern Hemisphere because of the
demand caused by cold weather," said Jorge Montepeque, Singapore-based Asia
Pacific editorial director of Platt's, a global commodity news service
headquartered in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers across the Asia-Pacific may feel a pinch, but most analysts
believe it will be slight, and offset by economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Premium gasoline in Australia, for example, could rise in the next year from
the current $1.79 per gallon to over $2.39 per gallon -- but only in rural parts
of the country, where the cost of transporting fuel drives up the price, said
Michael Economides, University of Houston professor of petroleum engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   But free-market reforms and consumer thrift left over from the Asian
financial crisis, which began in 1997, may force big corporations and
governments to take more of the punches.
</P>
<P>
	   "Big industrial users are feeling the pain -- pulp mills, glass makers,
steel mills," said Martin Pennay, a derivatives marketer for Citibank in Sydney.
"It's difficult for them to pass on an increase in fuel prices to consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel prices for consumers are kept artificially low by the governments of
China and India, both of which have obvious political reasons for their
reluctance to lower subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   In Indonesia, a reduction in fuel subsidies sparked massive riots that
toppled powerful President Suharto less than two years ago. Despite that, the
government is considering doing that again.
</P>
<P>
	   This month, in Manila, angry mobs locked the gates of the Philippines'
largest oil company to protest price increases by the country's three major oil
companies. Police also clashed with rioters who tried to vandalize a Caltex
building in December.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Gold Demand To Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The global demand for gold is likely to
increase in 2000, going by last year's trend, the chief economist of the World
Gold Council said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The price was also likely to rise, George Milling-Stanley told reporters in
Dubai.
</P>
<P>
	   Milling-Stanley said his prediction was based on "a pretty encouraging
picture" of strong demand from the world's largest market, India, and the
continuing growth in the second largest market, the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based council said recently that demand for gold rose 21 percent
in 1999 to 3,278.4 tons.
</P>
<P>
	   Milling-Stanley said strong gains were also recorded in several other
countries, including Egypt, Mexico, Japan, Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
	   He said prices would be bolstered by the agreement among 15 leading central
bankers to limit (central bank) sales of gold to 2,000 tons over the next five
years and by the continuing decline of supplies from mines.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Gold Council is a nonprofit organization of major gold producers.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Down Russian Helicopter  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebels holding out in Chechnya's southern mountains
shot down a Russian helicopter that was targeting the militants' last
strongholds, killing 15 troops, Russia's interior minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have squeezed the Chechens into a few regions in the breakaway
republic's rugged south, and concentrated air and artillery fire Saturday on the
Argun and Vedeno gorges.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than 150 missions in Chechnya
over the previous 24 hours, striking targets in the two gorges, which slice
south through the mountains to the Georgian border, the military command said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said rebels shot down a Russian
helicopter on Friday, sending it plunging 50 yards into ``one of the gorges in
southern Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yesterday was a tragic day,'' he told reporters during a visit with
wounded soldiers at a Moscow hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   He said 15 servicemen were killed, but provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Rushailo discussed the conflict during a meeting later Saturday with acting
President Vladimir Putin, who launched the popular war last September.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the rebels have retreated to the mountains since abandoning the
capital, Grozny, to federal forces earlier this month, and are hoping to wage a
prolonged guerrilla war from the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   The military estimates 7,000 fighters are based in the mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the Armed Forces General Staff,
said on Friday that the Russians now controlled most strategically important
areas in Chechnya. He showed reporters a map depicting the latest concentrations
of rebels, and said ``the area where the militants can still stay is
shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sappers continued Saturday defusing mines that riddle roads, bridges and the
few remaining buildings in Grozny, Russian television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command has sealed Grozny until at least March 1. Russian
officials say the capital must be closed to thwart possible rebel attempts to
sneak in civilian guise, and to give sappers time to defuse mines planted among
the ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, meanwhile, about 100 protesters demanding an end to the war
marched to the former KGB headquarters, and sent hundreds of blue balloons with
the slogan ``No War'' sailing over the city. Anti-war protests have been rare,
since most Russians support the offensive because of widespread crime and
violence in and around Chechnya in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters, who included members of the respected Soldiers' Mothers
Committee, also demanded an end to Russia's mandatory military draft. Many of
the troops in Chechnya are conscripts.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya has had de-facto independence since the end of a 1994-96 war with
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into the territory again last September, after
Chechnya-based militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. The
Chechens also are blamed for four apartment bombings in Russia in September that
killed 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Lose Trust in Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- At first, ethnic Albanians living in
the northern Kosovo town of Kosovska Mitrovica saw the arriving French NATO
troops as liberators. Eight months later, they are regarded with a mixture of
mistrust and fear.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks of sporadic violence in Kosovo's only ethnically divided town may
have dealt the final blow to already severely strained relations between ethnic
Albanians and the French troops who control the peacekeeping operation in the
northern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The French are perceived as favoring the Serbs living in northern Kosovska
Mitrovica. Ethnic Albanians accuse them of allowing the Serbs to act with
impunity in terrorizing the small number of Albanians who remain there, while
reacting harshly to any unrest generated from the southern, ethnic Albanian part
of town.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials have frequently stressed the multinational nature of the
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, which began after the end of a 78-day NATO air
campaign aimed at ending oppressive Serb rule of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
	   But ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica are leveling criticism only at
the French contingency stationed in their town, and say it does not reflect
their feelings for the peacekeeping mission as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French soldiers are as bad as the Serbs,'' said Halit Berani, head of
the ethnic Albanian human rights council in Kosovska Mitrovica. ``The French
army is responsible and guilty for the mistrust between the Albanians and the
French soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mistrust climaxed during the latest round of violence, which began when
a rocket was fired at a U.N. bus on Feb. 2, killing two Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of grenade attacks, shootings and clashes the next night in
northern Kosovska Mitrovica left at least eight ethnic Albanians dead and 28
Serbs and Albanians injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanians claim the French troops stationed in the north did nothing
to help their brethren when groups of Serbs roamed the town, beating and
shooting ethnic Albanians and throwing hand grenades into homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several U.N. police officers stationed in the town also have said the French
troops -- part of the peacekeeping force known as KFOR -- were slow to react
when a mob of between 1,000 and 2,000 angry Serbs rampaged through the northern
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French KFOR isn't security for us. We fear them almost as much as the
Serbs,'' said Sadije Niksic, 35, a Bosnian Muslim living among the small Bosnian
minority in the Serb part of Kosovska Mitrovica. ``We had trust in them but
we've lost it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others claim the French even provided cover for rampaging Serbs. ``When the
Serbs attacked us, they hid behind French tanks,'' said 50-year-old Adem Tolaj.
``They have helped ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the French insist they did everything possible, stressing that it would
be impossible to station soldiers outside every ethnic Albanian home in the
northern part of town to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the French had not done their job, ... it would have been a massacre,''
the French commander, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Perceptions that French troops are reluctant to protect ethnic Albanians
could further escalate violence in a town which remains one of the most tense
areas of Kosovo, a province still awash with weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern, Serb-majority part of town last week, unidentified gunmen
and snipers turned their weapons on French peacekeepers, wounding two. A gun
battle raged in the town for the next four hours, leaving at least one person
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial reports from the French troops indicated that most of those firing
had been ethnic Albanians. Out of 46 people arrested in connection with the
incident, 45 were Albanian and only one was a Serb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good relations with the population are vital to the peacekeeping
mission,'' said Lt. Commander Philip Anido, KFOR spokesman, adding: ``I have no
reason to doubt the professional capability of the French.''
</P>
<P>
	   But French troops searching for snipers possibly hiding in apartments after
Sunday's gun battle appear to have further soured relations, with some ethnic
Albanians saying their doors were smashed and they were ordered to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't even let us get our shoes,'' said Lirije Gllareva, 19, the
next day as she stood in her slippers on the southern part of a bridge over the
Ibar River dividing the town. Her father had been arrested in the sweep, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   French troops insist people were not expelled from their homes, and counter
that searching the flats was imperative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If doors were broken, it must be seen in context. The priority was to find
the shooters and limit the possibility of further injuries,'' said Lt. Matthieu
Mabin, a spokesman for the French troops.

<HEADLINE> Search for Long-Lost Plane Resumes  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUPUNGATO, Argentina (AP) -- Hoping to solve one of the Andes' great
riddles, army mountaineers set off Saturday to climb the 21,848-foot Tupungato
volcano in search of a British plane that vanished 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two camouflage green army trucks carrying soldiers sped out of an army base
in this mountain town hours from the volcano base, despite cloudy weather
threatening to delay the first day of the trip. The team of Argentine army
officers is on a quest to bring down bodies and pieces of wreckage that may shed
light on the airplane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll drive about four or five hours through mountains to the volcano's
base,'' said Col. Mario Luis Chretien, who heads the regiment leading the
expedition. ``If the weather remains as is, we'll start probably delay the
actual climb a day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Successfully recovering the plane's remnants could help solve one of the
longest-running aviation mysteries in the Andes, the mountain range that was a
virtual graveyard for planes during the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   Operated by the now defunct British South American Airways, the plane called
Stardust was carrying 11 people -- five crew members and six passengers -- and
was headed to Santiago, Chile when it vanished during a snowstorm on Aug. 2,
1947. The passengers included three Britons, a German woman, a Palestinian and a
Swiss man.
</P>
<P>
	   The last message from the plane has puzzled aviation investigators for
years. Radio operators in Chile reportedly received a Morse code message reading
``STENDEC'' -- an acronym investigators say has no meaning.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the crash, search teams from England, Chile and Argentina combed
the area by air and on skis but turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Theories abounded about the plane's disappearance. Some speculated it had
been sabotaged to kill a British diplomatic messenger reportedly on board.
</P>
<P>
	   But severe weather was believed by many to have been the cause. Records
indicate heavy snow fell for three days at the time the plane vanished over the
South American mountain chain, and aviation experts said the plane -- a
converted World War II bomber -- did not have de-icing capabilities and was
unfit to travel through frigid conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane and its passengers went undetected for more than five decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But then, in January, five mountaineers climbing through ice fields atop
Tupungato, just east of the Argentine-Chilean border, stumbled across the
remains of the four-engine plane. Argentine army official Alberto Quinones said
the group of climbers discovered pieces of the propeller, wing and fuselage
along with scraps of clothing spread across a two-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinones said the remains of at least three passengers had also been spotted
-- their limbs almost perfectly preserved in year-round subfreezing temperatures
atop Tupungato.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing news of the discovery, authorities quickly arranged the recovery
mission before the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer and the onset of harsh
weather conditions that dominate Tupungato the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very lucky,'' Chretien said. ``With warmer temperatures the past
few years, the glaciers (on the mountain) have been moving quite a bit. That's
how we were able to find the remains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Federico Frugoli said he hoped the remains would be brought down
during the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Frugoli said Argentine army mountaineers and air force personnel have spent
days mapping a path to the upper reaches of the volcano, where the wreckage sits
at 16,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   After acclimating themselves to the high altitude and freezing conditions,
elite mountaineers shadowed by journalists were expected to venture out on the
last leg of the climb -- a rigorous seven-hour mountaineering ascent of the
snowcapped volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   Using ski poles to balance themselves and wearing special cleats, the
climbers will ascend the steep southern face of the volcano -- a side that
rarely sees the sun and whose peak is mostly covered in snow and ice.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Ready for Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Yasser Arafat said Saturday he is ready to
press ahead with now-stalled peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Palestinian leader repeated a recent warning: If there is no deal by
September, he said, Palestinians have the right to declare statehood
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat also said there is no longer a need to negotiate a framework, or
outline, for a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The sides
failed to finish a framework agreement by Feb. 13, the planned date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The deadline for the framework agreement has ended, so we should move
directly to the comprehensive accord,'' Arafat told reporters after a meeting
with German President Johannes Rau. He said the sides should focus on their next
goal: Reaching a final agreement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's chief negotiator, Oded Eran, has said he believes it is still
possible to reach a framework by the end of March. But Israel hasn't said
whether it will insist on reaching such a framework first or whether it will
accept the Palestinian proposal to skip it and move to full treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The full treaty talks will encompass the thorniest issues between the sides,
including the borders of an eventual Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem
and the future of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news conference Saturday with Rau, Arafat reaffirmed that the
Palestinians can declare statehood in September, whether or not a final treaty
has been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is clear, that the end of negotiations is September 13, and
we have the right to declare statehood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat has often threatened to declare statehood unilaterally when peace
talks have bogged down. Recently, however, those threats have increased in
frequency, with two major PLO bodies -- the Palestinian Central Council and the
Fatah Revolutionary Command Council -- also saying statehood will be declared
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat insisted Saturday that Israel carry out a third interim troop
withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has angered Arafat by saying it wants to
fold a third withdrawal into the final peace deal instead of doing it in
advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Disagreements about Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank have been one of
the roadblocks to the peace talks. Talks were suspended after Israel refused to
withdraw from densely populated Jerusalem suburbs -- an area the Palestinians
demanded -- as part of the second pullback, which was initially due Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE> Shaw Endorses Earning Limits Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security beneficiaries, now losing billions of
dollars in benefits, shouldn't be penalized for staying on the job after turning
65, the chairman of a House panel that oversees the national retirement plan
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The House could vote as early as March 2 on a GOP plan to repeal Social
Security's ``earnings penalty'' for working Americans 65 to 69, Rep. Clay Shaw,
R-Fla., said in the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage could mean bigger benefit checks for older employees who stay on the
job after they pass retirement age.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would erase a rule requiring the government to deduct $1 in
Social Security benefits from every $3 over a prescribed limit earned by
beneficiaries up to age 70. The limit is currently $17,000 a year. President
Clinton said last Monday he would sign the bill if passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Millions of older Americans know exactly what the Social Security earnings
penalty is, because they have lost literally billions of dollars in benefits
because of it,'' said Shaw, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's worse, millions more soon-to-be seniors in the baby boom generation
could be hit by this work penalty if we don't change the law now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw described the plight of a 66-year-old Florida constituent who received
about $5,000 a year in Social Security benefits. If the woman, identified only
as Janet, took a part-time job as a grocery store cashier, she could earn as
much as $18,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But since that is over the current earnings limit, Janet would lose
one-third of that amount, or $500, in Social Security payments, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's just not fair,'' Shaw said. ``Americans pay into the Social
Security system their entire working lives, and working seniors deserve their
benefits just like everyone else does. They shouldn't be penalized because they
want to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the earnings limit is an issue important to many older Americans,
an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in their struggle to
control the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 lose part or all of their benefits because of the earnings
limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. Under current law,
the earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost the government roughly $22.7 billion
over 10 years, according to GOP estimates.

<HEADLINE> Early Treatment of Deaf Important  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spotting babies' hearing problems very early in life
appears to substantially improve their chances of having reasonably normal
vocabularies, even though their speech still may be poor, a study shows.
</P>
<P>
	   New technology using electrodes or ear probes can quickly detect infants'
poor hearing. Currently, 27 states require this testing on newborns, and similar
laws are in the works in several more.
</P>
<P>
	   A study at the University of Colorado is the largest yet to see whether this
testing, which typically costs around $25, pays off. The results suggest it
does, because the first six months of life seem to be critical to language
development.
</P>
<P>
	   The research found that youngsters who are fitted with hearing aids and get
other special attention as soon as possible develop close-to-normal vocabularies
and understanding of grammar.
</P>
<P>
	   Their ability to speak is still often less clear than normal children's.
Nevertheless, the Colorado researchers found that three-quarters of deaf and
hard-of-hearing children who get early help can speak intelligibly by the time
they reach school age.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Yoshinaga-Itano presented the data Saturday at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. The work was based 368
hearing-impaired children born in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our research supports the existence of a critical period of language
development in the first six months of life," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among her findings:
</P>
<P>
	   --90 percent of children with bad hearing who are identified early develop
vocabulary that is in the normal range -- though still somewhat below average --
in the first three years of life.
</P>
<P>
	   --Only one-quarter of youngsters identified later have vocabulary
approaching the normal range, and their use of language is similar to the bottom
10 percent of children with good hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   --Since screening began, 2 of every 1,000 babies were found to hear poorly
in both ears; 1 in 1,000 hear poorly in one ear; 3 in 1,000 have temporary
hearing problems that eventually go away.
</P>
<P>
	   A study by Mary Pat Moeller of Boys Town National Research Hospital in
Omaha, Neb., followed up youngsters whose hearing problems were diagnosed in the
1980s and early 1990s, before newborn screening was routine.
</P>
<P>
	   She found that those whose hearing problems were identified before 11 months
of age did much better on vocabulary tests than did those whose hearing problems
were noticed later. However, strong family involvement in working with the deaf
child was even more important than the early diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
	   Without testing, poor hearing typically goes unnoticed until about age 2
1/2. Before that, hard-of-hearing youngsters may babble less, but otherwise they
seem normal.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, hard-of-hearing babies are fitted with hearing aids, and their
parents are instructed in how to care for them. This may include learning sign
language and other ways of communicating with their babies, such as touching
them and looking directly at them when they speak.

<HEADLINE> Modine Plays Another Offbeat Role  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The production notes for the CBS movie "Flowers for
Algernon" report that it is based on a novel by Daniel Keyes. No mention that
the book also provided the basis for "Charly," the film that won Cliff Robertson
an Academy Award for best actor.
</P>
<P>
	   It was no accident, either.
</P>
<P>
	   Any reference to the 1968 movie was placed off-limits to the network after
Robertson, who has his own "Charly" sequel in the works, exacted a legal proviso
that the TV movie be based solely on the novel. Nothing from the 1968 film could
be used -- right down to the spelling of Charly, which was spelled Charlie in
Keyes' book.
</P>
<P>
	   But "Algernon" star Matthew Modine has no such restraint about referring
back to the earlier movie. He and Robertson became friends when they worked on
"Wind," an admirable but overlooked 1992 film about sail racing, and he couldn't
help talking about the Robertson role.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's interesting if you look at the parallel between Cliff's life and the
life of Charlie Gordon," said Modine, citing the title character he and
Robertson portrayed.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the book, one of the guys at the bakery says, 'Here, Charlie, you better
deliver this bread.' When Charlie comes back, the guy pockets the money. When
Charlie becomes more aware, he realizes that he is being a party to this crime."
Some people advise him to do nothing, but Charlie blows the whistle, and he gets
fired from the bakery.
</P>
<P>
	   In real life, Robertson discovered in 1977 that David Begelman, then
production head of Columbia Pictures, had forged Robertson's signature on a
$10,000 check. The actor was advised not to pursue the matter, but he did. The
result of the scandal: Begelman remained a film executive, Robertson was shunned
by the studios for five years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Flowers for Algernon," which appears on CBS Sunday night, Feb. 20, at 9
p.m. EST, tells the story of mentally impaired Charlie Gordon, who undergoes an
intelligence enhancing experiment that has worked on a lab rat named Algernon.
Charlie achieves genius status, but then regresses. Kelli Williams of "The
Practice," Ron Rifkin and Bonnie Bedelia also star.
</P>
<P>
	   Modine, 40, said he needed no research to portray the early stages of
Charlie's condition. He said there was a concentration of Down syndrome students
at the public school he attended while growing up in Utah, and he learned from
them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went to school with a lot of retarded children, and I know that I'm a
better person for the time I spent with them," said the actor.
</P>
<P>
	   Modine was born in Loma Linda, Calif., and spent much of his youth in
various towns in Utah, where his father managed drive-in theaters. At 18, he
moved to New York City to study acting with Stella Adler, who he says derided
movie stars and their acting. When he got his first big break in Robert Altman's
"Streamers," he was puzzled when the director called him "Coop."
</P>
<P>
	   "You remind me of Gary Cooper," Altman explained. Modine, influenced by
Adler, considered that an insult. Only later did he change his thinking.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning, Modine's roles in movies like "Birdy" and "Married to
the Mob" seemed to have the idiosyncratic, dreamy quality of a man not quite in
tune with the rest of the world. But he can also play flat-out heroes in the
Cooper tradition, as in "Full Metal Jacket" and "Memphis Belle."
</P>
<P>
	   "I did a film for Abel Ferrara in which I play a pretty reprehensible
person," he admitted. "It hasn't been released in America as yet.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't get much pleasure from playing such roles. The wonderful thing
about my job is that it gives you the opportunity to learn, to experience
things, to go to places you haven't been to before. If life is a journey, I
can't think of a better one than being an actor or a writer."

<HEADLINE> Rich Countries Offer No Real Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- As the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
ended Saturday, the rich countries showed their reluctance to offer any concrete
hope for the future of the world trading system as a whole, let alone the role
of the developing countries within it.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero consistently billed the meeting in
Thailand as an important part of the "healing process" following the collapse of
the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle and its failure to launch new
free trade talks.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD's meeting fell just two months after the Seattle meeting, and just at
the point when nations were ready to stop licking their wounds and think
seriously about how they could rescue the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Bangkok meeting has succeeded where Seattle failed by producing an
agreement acceptable to all, an agreement urging rich and poor countries to work
to create a "prosperous, peaceful and secure world based on true partnership."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the compromises made here are unlikely to be repeated in the WTO, which
regulates world trade and where the stakes are much higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union says it is a friend of the poor. It went to Seattle
claiming it was looking for a "Development Round."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the EU came into conflict with developing countries over its
agricultural subsidy program and its insistence that issues such as labor rights
and the environment should be considered. Developing nations view this as a
deliberate move to make their goods more expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the major trading powers has been willing to give unconditional
agreement to a program to open its markets completely to goods from the world's
48 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD may have restored a degree of hope to developing nations that their
concerns are being taken seriously, but in the end, the conference can do
nothing directly to influence the World Trade Organization, or to put pressure
on individual countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The WTO certainly isn't making great progress on its own. It did agree
earlier this month to start negotiations on freeing the markets for agriculture
and services, but that was hardly a major victory since members committed to
themselves to that when the organization was founded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations themselves will not really get going for years, and the
method of negotiating is still to be decided. What's more, the EU position on
agriculture is so intractable that it says there is no chance of success unless
it has the opportunity to make tradeoffs in other sectors to which negotiations
have not yet been agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   WTO director-general Mike Moore has said ministers have told him they will
not even consider attending another meeting to launch a new round until it is "a
done deal."
</P>
<P>
	   This week he told delegates: "Has there been a fundamental change since
Seattle? No."
</P>
<P>
	   Many commentators also see domestic politics, especially in the United
States, as a major obstacle to the speedy launch of a new round.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior U.S. officials were conspicuously absent from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the problems is the degree to which the United States can agree to
anything in an election year," said Eveline Herfkens, the Netherlands minister
for development cooperation.
</P>

	   Rita Hayes, U.S. Ambassador to the WTO, denied that, but offered no hope for
any immediate movement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have always said the U.S. elections will not be an obstacle to us moving
forward and expanding trade. It's clear that after Seattle there is a lot of
soul searching and reflection to see how we can move forward," she said in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   It is true that UNCTAD has its own mandate -- providing vital data and
know-how to developing nations to help them improve their capacity to compete in
the global trading system -- but nearly all the great hopes for Bangkok hinged
on the idea that the meeting might kick-start the WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Development Commissioner Poul Nielson expressed the general caution of
the richer countries about what had come out of UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
	   "Having a success or even a relative success at this meeting and having the
machine function in good order is a way of getting back on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "I would warn against easy-fix approaches."

<HEADLINE> Marines Gather for Iwo Jima Reunion  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 600 Marines who endured indescribable carnage
on Iwo Jima gathered this weekend to relive the corps' bloodiest battle and talk
over what the 55 years since has brought their country.
</P>
<P>
	   Many among these veterans speak with sadness of the dwindling numbers of men
and women now choosing military service as careers. It is a symptom, they say,
of a loss among many young Americans of a sense of honor and duty to country.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, said veteran John McElroy, 77, ``You just don't see that respect that
was once there.''
</P>
<P>
	   McElroy and the others who risked their lives to capture a speck of land, no
more than 8 square miles of Pacific island, 660 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle began Feb. 19, 1945. After merciless fighting, five Marines and a
Navy corpsman raised the American flag on Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi four days
later, an event that came to symbolize being a Marine. By the time Iwo Jima was
secured March 16, 6,318 Marine dead were among the corps' 25,851 casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We weren't heroes. We just went where we were sent to go,'' said Russ
Kohloff, 77, of Beloit, Wis. ``The war was on, and we did what young people
did.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among events planned at the anniversary gathering was a wreath-laying at the
Marines' revered Iwo Jima Memorial, Felix DeWeldon's massive bronze statue
modeled on history's most widely reproduced photograph, Associated Press
photographer Joe Rosenthal's picture of the Mount Suribachi flag-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Veterans from all over the country said they wanted to renew the camaraderie
they felt more than half a century ago, to recapture a feeling of devotion they
had to each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's like my brother. We lived together and died together,'' said McElroy,
77, putting his arm around the shoulder of Nick Paciullo, 76. ``The only one who
understands me is him.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two served together in the same company in the 23rd Marines, 4th
Division, and have remained lifelong friends. During the war, both were wounded.
McElroy, of North Bergen, N.J., caught shrapnel his left side and leg. A piece
of shrapnel hit Paciullo, of Hackensack, N.J., in the left eye.
</P>
<P>
	   They Marines' objective in 1945 was to capture Iwo Jima to stop the Japanese
from using it as a base and to provide the Army Air Corps with a field where
crippled bombers could land in emergencies during the expected invasion of the
Japanese mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody got hit. There were wounded and dead all over,'' said Kohloff.
The memory brought tears to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite expressions of disillusionment with the attitude of some young
people, many veterans said they also have renewed hope because of the candidacy
of Sen. John McCain of Arizona for a return to a strong military. McCain, a
naval aviator and prisoner of war in Vietnam, is seeking the Republican
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our country is cutting benefits for veterans,'' Kohloff said. ``McCain's a
tough one. I think maybe he would do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyril O'Brien, 81, of Silver Spring, Md., said eight years of the Clinton
administration has left the armed forces unready to face threats such as he and
his friends faced during World War II. He, too, backs McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I definitely support the strengthening of our military in pay and support
for their families. That's where the morale comes in. And they need the
equipment. You can't skimp on that,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the youngest attending the reunion, 11-year-old Aaron Levin, said he
knows that his desire to be a Marine when he comes of age is increasingly rare.
But Aaron, who accompanied Kohloff from Wisconsin, said he has great respect for
the veterans and hopes one day to live up to their standards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel sorry for what these guys went through,'' the boy said. ``I want to
do what I can.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces $223M in Grants  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered $223 million in education and
job-training grants Saturday to help low-income Americans succeed in the
information-age economy. He called it a ``lifeline of opportunity'' for young
people willing to work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to make sure our children are prepared for this new economy by
helping every child enter school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed,''
Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``More Americans -- and more African-Americans -- are going on to college
than ever before,'' the president said. ``But we must give every child that
chance, and we must help their families shoulder the burden.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Republican critic, Rep. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., who is black, said he agrees
with some of the president's ideas on ``healing the racial divide as well as
helping close the monetary gap in our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference, faulted the
administration for blocking tax incentives for minority communities that he said
would have provided money to allow people to decide for themselves about such
things as training and education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Republicans don't equate the word `minority' with an inability to
determine one's future,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the $223 million in federal grants will be made available to
help 44,000 young people aged 14 to 21 in 36 low-income areas as diverse as the
Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, inner-city Baltimore and the Pine Ridge
Indian reservation in South Dakota. They will be distributed to urban, rural and
American Indian communities and will range from $4 million to $11 million each.
</P>
<P>
	   The grants will emphasize placing young people in jobs along with efforts to
keep them in school, encourage enrollment in college and provide work experience
in community projects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will provide a lifeline of opportunity to any young person willing to
work for a better future,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money comes from a $250 million fund in the current budget. The White
House envisions a five-year, $1.3 billion program with participation from
government, business and nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In Baltimore, an $11 million grant to the city's employment development
office would provide computer classes, high school equivalency programs,
internships and career counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Pine Ridge Reservation, which Clinton visited last year, the Oglala
Sioux tribe and several partners would use $4 million to set up job training,
drug and alcohol counseling, tutoring and other services for an estimated 750
young people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton coupled his remarks with a tribute to national Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
	   The observance highlights the achievements of black Americans such as
abolitionist Frederick Douglass and the Tuskegee Airmen, World War II black
fighter pilots who ``fought fascism in the air and racism on the ground. ...
They helped lead the way to this modern digital age in which there are virtually
no limits to how high our people can fly.''

<HEADLINE> Greek Gov't Mulls TV Censorship  </HEADLINE>
   By DEREK GATOPOULOS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Programmers who allow sexual allegations, scurrilous
innuendo and soap box spouting onto television news in Greece have been put on
notice: tone it down or we'll turn it off.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas outlined a presidential decree Friday
that says private channels could be forced to suspend programs, pay fines of up
to $1.5 million and -- as a last resort -- lose their operating license if they
don't adhere to a bolstered journalistic code.
</P>
<P>
	   The measures are the latest attempt to bring some order to the brash
frontier of the Greek airwaves, where five main private stations and 15 or more
smaller channels increasingly dedicate news programs and talk shows to any topic
-- no matter how flimsy or scathing the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   But some critics believe the crusade could stifle investigative journalism
in a nation that has seen its share of corruption and major foul-ups, including
allegations of police protection to mobsters and last year's bungled attempt to
give sanctuary to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   Commentators have repeatedly warned of a dangerous decline in television
standards, spurred by a ratings battle fueled by sensational news. A man was
driven to suicide several years ago after television sex abuse allegations that
never made it to court. And in December, a private channel aired videotape
footage of a Greek pop singer having sex with an allegedly underage girl.
</P>
<P>
	   The government ax dropped after the host of the popular investigative show
``Jungle'' said he had evidence of a sex scandal involving a Greek politician
and handed a public prosecutor the material. The penalties for the stations are
not new, but the presidential decree adds unprecedented clout and could lead to
the first big crackdowns on the reporting of sexually-tinged rumors called
``pink scandals.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such televised rumors threatened to ``transform our society from one of
principle into a jungle of anarchy.'' Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest claims by the host of ``Jungle,'' Makis Triantafiliopoulos,
touched off intense political speculation just seven weeks before general
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who is he?'' asked the populist Athinaiki daily in a giant front page
headline Saturday. Opposition leader Costas Caramanlis urged supporters this
week: ``Someone is trying to distract you ... turn away from the `pink'
television screens.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Alpha channel on Friday announced the indefinite suspension of
``Jungle'' and its sister show ``Yellow Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the two programs maintained they had been taken off the air
before the revelations became too damaging to Greece's political establishment.
Two years ago, police corruption scandals exposed by ``Yellow Press'' spurred
the replacement of Greece's public order minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Athinaiki suggested Saturday that the television channel had come under
pressure to cancel the shows.
</P>
<P>
	   But the television crackdown was widely applauded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A journalist is not a policeman, a prosecutor or a judge and cannot resort
to keyhole reporting,'' the Athens Journalists' Union said in a statement
</P>
<P>
	   Commentators insisted the television ratings race crossed the line long ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It all started with the unrestricted competition in television which led
to a down spiral into the swamp of mud,'' the Athens daily Eleftherotypia wrote
Saturday. ``Human values were swept away, individual rights were ignored and all
the rules of ethics were trodden on.''

<HEADLINE> Shaw Endorses Earning Limits Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security beneficiaries, now losing billions of
dollars in benefits, shouldn't be penalized for staying on the job after turning
65, the chairman of a House panel that oversees the national retirement plan
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The House could vote as early as March 2 on a GOP plan to repeal Social
Security's ``earnings penalty'' for working Americans 65 to 69, Rep. Clay Shaw,
R-Fla., said in the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage could mean bigger benefit checks for older employees who stay on the
job after they pass retirement age.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would erase a rule requiring the government to deduct $1 in
Social Security benefits from every $3 over a prescribed limit earned by
beneficiaries up to age 70. The limit is currently $17,000 a year. President
Clinton said last Monday he would sign the bill if passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Millions of older Americans know exactly what the Social Security earnings
penalty is, because they have lost literally billions of dollars in benefits
because of it,'' said Shaw, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's worse, millions more soon-to-be seniors in the baby boom generation
could be hit by this work penalty if we don't change the law now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw described the plight of a 66-year-old Florida constituent who received
about $5,000 a year in Social Security benefits. If the woman, identified only
as Janet, took a part-time job as a grocery store cashier, she could earn
$18,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Because that is $1,500 over the current earnings limit, Janet would lose
one-third of that amount, or $500, in Social Security payments, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's just not fair,'' Shaw said. ``Americans pay into the Social
Security system their entire working lives, and working seniors deserve their
benefits just like everyone else does. They shouldn't be penalized because they
want to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the earnings limit is an issue important to many older Americans,
an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in their struggle to
control the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 lose part or all of their benefits because of the earnings
limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. Under current law,
the earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost the government roughly $22.7 billion
over 10 years, according to GOP estimates.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest Against Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By JAN SLIVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- More than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators crammed
a historic Vienna square on a cold, rainy Saturday evening in the largest
protest yet against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, tens of thousands of protesters gathered for smaller
rallies at different spots throughout the city. Others marched through the
streets blowing whistles and shouting slogans critical of the government and
Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, they converged on the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, where thousands
of Austrians welcomed Adolf Hitler in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to prevent right-wing nationalism from creeping into Austria
again,'' Hans Marschalek, head of the inmates association from Austria's
Mauthausen concentration camp, told a cheering crowd of 30,000 gathered in front
of the ornate neo-Grecian parliament building.
</P>
<P>
	   A banner hung from police barricades around the building read: ``Haider is
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vienna police and state television estimated the crowd at 150,000 by
evening. Austrian state television estimated an additional 1,000 people
continued to stream into the plaza each minute an hour after the rally began.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the demonstrations were peaceful. The atmosphere varied throughout
the city, from festive in downtown Vienna -- where artists decorated the
sidewalks of the city's posh shopping district with anti-Nazi symbols -- to that
of an earnest political rally outside parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ringstrasse, the main road around Vienna, was a sea of mostly
hand-painted, colorful banners: ``Being ruled by the Freedom Party hurts our
souls;'' ``Join in to help in the retention of human dignity;'' ``Austria, you
mournful country, being ruined by black and blue hands.'' The latter slogan
referred to the political colors of the Freedom Party and its coalition partner,
the mainstream conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-government rallies have become a near-daily practice in Vienna since
the new government coalition took office Feb. 4. The European Union, Israel and
the United States have taken measures to isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has
since apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who heads the People's Party, told
Switzerland's Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper he expected today's demonstration
to be the last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm counting on people to get carried away with emotion once again ...
when the far-left, the hippie generation, the youth and the Internet generation
have their fling,'' this weekend, Schuessel said. ``Then at some point after
this, things will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of anti-Haider protests have been held in other cities around Europe
in recent weeks. In Paris on Saturday, up to 9,000 people demonstrated against
the Austrian coalition. Smaller protests were held in other cities across
France.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Showing Strong  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In small towns and big cities, reformists promising
wider freedoms appeared to be wresting control of Iran's parliament from
hard-liners Saturday as vote counts from the election trickled in.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 119 results announced by state media by late Saturday, candidates
from the reformist coalition were clear winners of 65 seats in Friday's
election. Ten other winners were known conservatives. Affiliations of the
remaining 44 winners were not known, but many were believed to be independents.
</P>
<P>
	   If the trend continues, which appears likely, reformists will oust
hard-liners from the 290-seat parliament for the first time since the 1979
revolution put clerics in charge of the country. That would be a vindication of
the social and political reforms supported by President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who has tried to change Iran's fundamentalist image even as it
remains under Islamic laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this election all groups accepted that they have to move within the
rules of politics and not beyond that,'' pro-Khatami Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said. ``In this election, the only winner is the Iranian
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the first election-related violence, meanwhile, two people were killed
and 15 injured in the southwestern town of Shush on Saturday, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the trouble started when one group
accused the winning candidate of bribing people to vote for him. It was not
clear whether the conflict stemmed from political differences or local tribal
rivalries unrelated to the conservative-reformist struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Police fired tear gas and bullets in the air to quell the rioters, who set
fire to cars and hurled stones, IRNA said. It confirmed the 15 injuries but did
not report any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear to which camp the victorious candidate, Jassem Sayeri,
belonged.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 5,800 candidates for the 290 parliament seats, and it was
difficult to ascertain all of their political leanings -- especially because the
hard-liners, unlike the reformers, have not released a candidate list. Winners
are announced only by name.
</P>
<P>
	   A record voter turnout in Friday's polls appeared to have helped the
reformists. Of the 38.7 million eligible voters, some 32 million, or 83 percent,
voted.
</P>
<P>
	   The heavy participation was led by Iran's youth. About 20 million Iranians
are in high schools and universities, and many are fed up with the strict
Islamic laws that dictate their personal lives. They are also frustrated at
hard-liners' attempts to stifle critical newspapers and at the clergy's control
over the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Iranians saw hope after Khatami's election in May 1997 and now expect a
reformist parliament to push his proposed changes. Some reformists have even
spoken about normalizing relations with the United States, Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the 1997 vote was a vote for change and reforms, (Friday's) vote was a
vote for speeding up these reforms,'' said political analyst Saeed Laylaz, a
columnist with pro-reformist newspapers, including Hamshahri.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prestigious contests were held in Iran's two largest cities, Tehran
and Isfahan, where top reformers were leading after a partial vote count,
Interior Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those leading in Tehran was the president's younger brother,
Mohammadreza Khatami, along with 14 other reformists. Tehran sends 30 lawmakers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing in the vote count was former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rafsanjani is increasingly
identified with the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners suffered another blow with the election loss of Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, an incumbent from Damavand in northern Iran. Rasouli-Nejad was
one of the people behind the 1998 impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri and last year's unsuccessful bid to impeach Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani, both supporters of Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if they lose their parliamentary majority, hard-liners can still
obstruct the reformists. The Guardian Council, a 12-man body of clerics and
lawyers, must approve all bills passed by parliament. And Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has mostly sided with hard-liners, has the final
word and heads the armed forces, judiciary, and state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Javad Qadimi Zakir, the director general of elections, said final nationwide
results will be announced in less than two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Merkel May Lead German Party  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The front-runner to lead the Christian Democrats out of their
financing scandal defended herself Saturday against criticism that she would not
appeal to all of Germany's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Merkel, now party secretary-general, has emerged as the likely
successor to Wolfgang Schaeuble, who said this week he would not stand for
re-election after his credibility was questioned over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   But the arch-conservative Christian Social Union -- the Christian Democrats'
junior coalition partner in parliament -- cautioned that Merkel would not be
supported by the more right-wing conservatives in the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors are investigating off-the-books donations and secret accounts
made during the 25 years Helmut Kohl led the party. Parliament also is looking
into whether decisions during his 16 years as chancellor were bought.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal has raised fears in Germany that some conservatives would
abandon the Christian Democrats for far-right parties. As Germany's dominant
postwar party, the Christian Democratic Union has been viewed as a middle ground
for all conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Merkel said that, as secretary-general, she'd already proven herself in a
leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As an East German Protestant, I have already met many times with south
German Catholics, and we have understood each other well,'' she told Focus
newsmagazine in a report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a Kohl protege and Cabinet secretary after unification, Merkel was
able to distance herself early in the scandal, and is seen as relatively
untainted by the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   But her more progressive views in areas such as abortion and immigration
could put off the more conservative and nationalistic voters in overwhelmingly
Catholic Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
	   Other party leaders came to Merkel's defense, warning the Bavaria-only
Christian Social Union against meddling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Merkel will make the new beginning of the CDU credible,'' Rita Pawelski, a
member of the Christian Democrats' board of directors, told the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper. ``I strongly recommend that Bavaria take itself out of this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble's likely successor as leader of the conservatives in parliament
has come under less criticism about his suitability for the role. Over the
weekend, Friedrich Merz spoke out about the Kohl issue, saying that he couldn't
see the former chancellor appearing in parliament again anytime soon.

interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.

<HEADLINE> 3 More Register for Russia Election  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGELA CHARLTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Central Election Commission on Saturday approved the
registration of three more candidates for Russia's March 26 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission accepted the applications of Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the
reform-oriented Yabloko movement, hard-line film director Stanislav Govorukhin
and Ella Pamfilova, leader of the liberal Civil Dignity movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamfilova is the first woman to run for president in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone had to dilute this boys' club,'' she joked to reporters after her
candidacy was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission already had registered five candidates: acting President
Vladimir Putin, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, leftist Alexei
Podberyozkin, reformist governor of Samara Konstantin Titov, and Aman Tuleyev,
the hard-line Kemerovo region governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin is the clear favorite. Opinion polls show him winning support of 50
percent to 60 percent of respondents, while Zyuganov has less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The election commission on Saturday rejected the application of businessman
Ismail Ogly Tagi-Zade, saying he had not collected a sufficient number of
signatures supporting his candidacy. The commission also announced that Moscow
politician German Khrustalev had asked to drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the candidates registered Saturday, Yavlinsky has the strongest support
base.
</P>
<P>
	   An economist committed to market reform, he came in fourth in the 1996
presidential election. He formed the Yabloko party in 1993, and has been elected
three times to the State Duma, parliament's lower house.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged voters Saturday to vote for a ``non-Communist, non-criminal, smart
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Govorukhin, a member of the Fatherland-All Russia party, has also been
elected to parliament three times. He has directed several feature films and has
said Russia needs ``morality police.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Saturday he joined the race to shake up the status quo.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamfilova was twice elected to the State Duma, but her party failed to get
the necessary 5 percent of the vote for her to win a seat in the current
legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   To be put on the ballot, each candidate must submit property and income
declarations and the signatures of at least 500,000 supporters to the Central
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the commission rejected the application of fiery nationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, saying he failed to report all his assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Applications from five more candidates are to be considered by the
commission by Monday, the deadline for registering or rejecting them.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pushes for Lower Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK STEVENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson received no promises
and little sympathy from Mexico on Saturday, as he began a trip to lobby
oil-producing countries to lift production limits that have sent heating oil
prices soaring in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican officials said they shared Richardson's concern about inflation, but
would respect a "gentlemen's agreement" with other producers not to increase
output before April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson told a news conference after the meeting that U.S. officials were
worried about production levels and the low level of oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
	   "The high price of oil could contribute to inflation ... and diminish growth
in the world economy," Richardson said. But he was quick to add that it was
unlikely to cause a recession "like in the 1970s or 80s" that caused shock waves
in U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson warned that U.S. inflation could hurt Mexico's own economy.
Almost 85 percent of Mexican exports go to the United States. Mexico also
depends on U.S. tourism and remittances sent home by workers in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican Energy Secretary Luis Tellez said he wanted "high, stable and
profitable prices, but ones that don't hurt the world economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Both Richardson and Tellez were walking a tightrope: Richardson didn't want
to set off a nationalist backlash here by seeming to threaten Mexico, and Tellez
has been ridiculed in the local press this week for suggesting that oil prices
should come down to about $25 a barrel. The price of oil stabilized Friday at
slightly under $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Tellez's statements were ill-received in a country where poverty is
widespread and where the government relies on oil for about a third of
government income.
</P>
<P>
	   "I absolutely don't think prices are too high. Mexico has had prices of as
much as $36 per barrel in the past," said opposition congressman Sergio Osorio,
president of the congressional Energy Committee, who also took part in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a question of national sovereignty, because Mexico's own interests
come first," Osorio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil-producing countries agreed to cut output by 5.2 million barrels per day
after prices plummeted to below $10 per barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. politicians have urged President Clinton to release strategic oil
reserves to the market, something Richardson said he opposes and which Osorio
said would only temporarily depress prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pressure is strong, but politics should not influence (oil) prices,"
Richardson said. "The market should decide prices."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Richardson nor Tellez would set a figure on how much they want
production increased or what they think a reasonable price would be. Richardson
said that was for the producing countries to decide in meetings next month.
</P>
<P>
	   It appears likely that producer nations may agree to boost output by about
1.7 million barrels per day, based on recent statements by Venezuelan and Saudi
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson is scheduled to continue on to Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Norway to lobby for increased production. Sympathy for his appeal is likely
to be limited in countries which have had to slash government spending in
previous years because of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Last year when prices were as low as $7 or $8, we didn't see them (the
Americans) coming around," Osorio said. "I told Mr. Richardson very clearly that
... only on this basis, of equality, can we understand each other."

<HEADLINE> Chicago Sweatshop Plan May Be Model  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The $6.25 an hour wasn't so bad -- it was more than most
were getting. What astounded Marta Esquivel were the conditions inside the hot,
stuffy tortilla factory where she toiled alongside dozens of her fellow Mexican
immigrants for more than a year on Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of times, they didn't let me use the bathroom or even get a drink of
water," the 39-year-old single mother says in Spanish, describing a constant,
deafening noise made by the factory's machinery. "There was only one door, and
they kept it locked at all times."
</P>
<P>
	   They sound like stories from another time. But a survey of the working poor
in Chicago and surrounding suburbs has found otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of the 800 workers questioned -- many of them immigrants
-- described conditions in factories, restaurants and other workplaces that the
federal government would deem "sweatshops."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the garment district in the early 1900s," says Rebekah Levin,
deputy director of Center for Impact Research, one of two nonprofit
organizations that conducted the survey. "This is here in our back yards."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the U.S. Department of Labor and other federal agencies have
taken note -- and some unprecedented steps to tackle a problem they say has
always been tough to quantify.
</P>
<P>
	   Next month, the officials will meet with a newly formed task force to find
ways that community groups -- from Chinese-American and Hispanic to Polish --
can help the government track down employers who are violating wage and safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   If it works in Chicago, the plan will be put into action in cities
nationwide, says Bruce Cranford, a Department of Labor enforcement official
who's helping oversee the task force.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, regulators have investigated sweatshops once a complaint was
filed -- or staged stings targeted at specific industries, particularly garment
districts in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plan is to create networks within immigrant communities to tip
regulators off to trouble. Employers found breaking rules will be given a chance
to clean up their acts before facing fines, Cranford says.
</P>
<P>
	   Surveyors found that immigrants working in this country illegally are most
likely to endure the worst job conditions. According to the survey, 70 percent
of those without green cards worked in sweatshop conditions, which the federal
government defines as places where any two wage, overtime, environmental or
safety violations have been committed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because they don't have papers, the bosses think they can do what they
want," Esquivel says of the tortilla factory from which she was fired last
summer after she didn't show up for work because she couldn't find a
baby-sitter. "But I have my papers. I knew my rights. And I told them."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Levin, a surprising number of workers who are in the country
legally -- including some born here -- also toil in sweatshops. For example, 28
percent of black workers who answered the survey said they worked in such
conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "In many cases, there is a sense that there is nothing better out there,"
Levin says, noting that 28 percent of everyone surveyed said they worked in
conditions that endangered their health. That included exposure to skin-burning
chemicals, dangerous equipment and severe heat or cold.
</P>
<P>
	   A small number of those surveyed -- mostly women -- said they felt they had
to have sex with their bosses to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say it is impossible to determine how many sweatshops there are
nationwide or how many workers are being affected. And they say there has been
little push from the public to find out.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thought is if you come here as an immigrant, you've got to go through
tough times," says Joanna Borowiec, a task force member and director of
education and employment services for the Chicago-based Polish American
Association. "They'll tell you, 'My grandfather was in worse conditions.' It's
not that they don't sympathize. It's just seen as the immigrant experience."
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't exactly the life Esquivel imagined when she swam across the Rio
Grande 15 years ago after her husband died in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually she received a green card, worked in a nursing home in Texas for
$12 an hour, then moved to Chicago, where she worked at a restaurant until it
closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that her unemployment benefits have run out, she says her eldest son,
who is 21, helps pay the rent on her apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   She says she doesn't want to go on public assistance. She wants a job. But
she says applications at factories that make Mexican-style cheese and cream have
gone nowhere once prospective employers check her employment history --
including her time at the tortilla factory.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, her troubles haven't stopped her from speaking publicly about poor
work conditions -- something many are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something has to be done," she says. "They need to see what's going on."

<HEADLINE> India Warned Against War Mongering  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf accused
neighboring India on Saturday of war mongering, and warned that Pakistan would
defend itself against aggressive action from across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India regularly trade fire along the disputed Kashmir border,
with each side accusing the other of firing the first shot. In recent months,
the cross-border firing has increased substantially.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan's armed forces are fully prepared to effectively counter any
aggression against the motherland,'' Musharraf was quoted as saying in an army
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Musharraf made the comments while addressing officers in Multan, in the
eastern Punjab province 240 miles south of the capital, Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused India of inciting violence out of frustration, though he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Pakistani officials said two women were killed when Indian
troops fired a volley of artillery shells into the Neelum Valley. Another seven
people were injured by Indian shells in a nearby village, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are fully alive to the threats being hurled from across the border,''
Musharraf said to his troops. ``We are vigilant and capable (of foiling) any
attempt of adventure by the adversary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons, and conducted tit-for-tat
nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Pakistan and India lay claim to the whole of Kashmir, a former princely
state divided between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   India has been particularly belligerent toward Pakistan since the Pakistani
army took power last October, throwing out the civilian government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Militant Islamic groups waging a secessionist war in Indian Kashmir said
Saturday that, in the weeks before Sharif was deposed, he had embarked on a
crackdown on members headquartered in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The pressure eased after Sharif's ouster, said spokesman Abdullah Muntazir
of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a key Islamic group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif blamed a spate of religiously motivated killings that occurred in the
last months of his rule on religious parties and militants he said were being
trained in neighboring Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Stalin Kin Enters Georgian Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- A grandson of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin submitted
his candidacy Saturday to run for president of his native Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Yevgeny Dzhugashvili, a leftist who calls for restoring the Soviet Union,
does not have a significant following and is not seen as a serious threat to
incumbent Eduard Shevardnadze, who is the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Election Commission is considering whether Dzhugashvili can
legally run, since he is a citizen of Russia, not Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Dzhugashvili said Saturday the commission should rule in his favor for one
simple reason: ``I'm Stalin's grandson.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dzhugashvili is one of 17 contenders hoping to run in the April 9 election,
according to the Central Election Commission. Saturday was the last day for
candidates to submit their nominations to the commission. The nominees must now
gather 50,000 signatures by Feb. 29 to be formally registered.
</P>
<P>
	   A 64-year-old retired Soviet army colonel, Dzhugashvili campaigned in
Russian parliamentary elections last fall, saying he wanted to unite leftist
forces in both former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
	   Stalin was an ethnic Georgian whose original surname was Dzhugashvili.
</P>
<P>
	   Most in the former Soviet Union consider Stalin a loathsome figure who ruled
by terror and killed millions of his own people. But a sizable minority of
mostly older people revere him as the man who built the Soviet Union into a
superpower and presided over its victory in World War II.

<HEADLINE> Museum Offers Peek at 1850s Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHERINE ROTH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rolling black clouds turn to sheets of rain, forcing
pedestrians to huddle as they cross a bridge over shimmering blue water. Along a
bridal path, horse dung glistens in autumn light as men and women in bright
kimonos bustle in the background. A brilliant red temple lantern sets off pure
white snow.
</P>
<P>
	   In 100 colorful woodblock prints that seem to breathe life into the daily
scenes they depict, Utagawa Hiroshige captured Tokyo between 1856 and his death
in 1858. In what was then one of the world's biggest cities, it was a pivotal
time.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, what is considered the finest of the world's six known complete
sets of Hiroshige's "One Hundred Famous Views of Edo" -- the name of Tokyo until
1868 -- debuted at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
	   "This represents Japan just after Commodore Perry landed there. It's the end
of an era. ... You see a few Western things, clocks and pantaloons, but it's
quite different," said Amy G. Poster, the show's curator and head of the
museum's Department of Asian Art.
</P>
<P>
	   Hiroshige was one of the most famous masters of what the Japanese call
"ukiyo-e," or pictures of a floating world.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Ando Hiroshige, he worked as a firefighter until, at 31, he began
studying printmaking under Utagawa Toyohiro. He developed the ability to capture
the atmospheric effects of season and place, and later took on the name of his
mentor, Utagawa.
</P>
<P>
	   The prints on display represent Hiroshige's most ambitious work. Because
they are so fragile, it is only the second time the entire set has been
displayed -- the first was in 1987. The new show has limited hours, from noon to
5 p.m., and will remain only through April 23.
</P>
<P>
	   The colors -- natural pigment printed on thick mulberry bark paper -- are
stunningly bright.
</P>
<P>
	   In almost every print, mica is mixed with the pigment to give shaded
surfaces a reflective quality and add a subtle glittering effect.
</P>
<P>
	   The prints also feature the technique of gradation, or "bokashi." Color is
carefully wiped off a block before printing to give lush texture and shading to
water, sky and other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the set was donated to the museum in 1930, the works were never
recorded with other Japanese prints and were not listed in the library catalog,
Poster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after Poster started at the museum, she began going through back
bookshelves looking for Japanese prints. In 1970, she discovered an overlooked
album containing the entire collection.
</P>
<P>
	   Poster is now battling to keep the prints safe, carefully examining requests
to show them to ensure they are not subjected to harmful conditions. A few were
loaned to Washington's National Gallery of Art last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were so good they were too good to be true. But nobody would take the
time with all that embossing and the mica if they weren't real. And they are now
the most famous in the world. People are coming here from all over the world to
see them," she said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Albania on Expansion  </HEADLINE>
   By MERITA DHIMGJOKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Saturday against expansionist desires in Albania, saying the international
community would no more accept a Greater Albania than it would a Greater Serbia
or a Greater Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   In her first visit here since the end of the 78-day NATO air campaign
against neighboring Serbia in June, Albright promised financial and political
support for Albania's efforts to join international organizations. She called on
Albanians to help lead southeast Europe into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also urged Albanians to use their influence to help and support the
people of neighboring Kosovo in the hope that they will be guided by ``an
attitude of tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The southern Serbian province is populated mainly by ethnic Albanians, who
share a common language and culture with Albania proper, and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb forces killed thousands of ethnic Albanians during Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists in Kosovo. After
NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw this spring, ethnic Albanians
began attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   On the idea of a Greater Albania -- an expansion of Albania to include
Serbia's Kosovo province and Albanian-populated areas of western Macedonia --
Albright said Albanians must not allow themselves to be used by others who would
create conflict in the region by trying to ``redraw the map of southeast
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said any attempts to extend boundaries are ``an invitation to
violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary of state promised a $9 million grant to improve security
further and help the country attract foreign investment, in addition to $12
million granted last month as state budget support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to support your efforts to build a professional and accountable
police, an efficient customs service and an impartial judiciary that defends the
rights of citizens and upholds your laws,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright held talks with Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and Prime
Minister Ilir Meta. About 2,000 people gathered outside Meta's office to greet
her. Some waved American flags and signs written in English that said ``Welcome
Friend'' and ``NATO + USA  Free Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several top U.S. officials have canceled visits to Albania in recent months,
fearing attacks by Islamic terrorist groups believed to have been operating in
the country under the shield of humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 Islamic terrorist suspects have been arrested in Albania since
last June. Some of them were believed to be collaborating with the terrorist
group of Osama bin Laden, the man U.S. authorities suspect of masterminding the
1998 bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Appear To Lead Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In small towns and big cities, reformists promising
wider freedoms appeared to be wresting control of Iran's parliament from
hard-liners Saturday as vote counts from the election trickled in.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 119 results announced by state media by late Saturday, candidates
from the reformist coalition were clear winners of 65 seats in Friday's
election. Ten other winners were known conservatives. Affiliations of the
remaining 44 winners were not known, but many were believed to be independents.
</P>
<P>
	   If the trend continues, which appears likely, reformists will oust
hard-liners from the 290-seat parliament for the first time since the 1979
revolution put clerics in charge of the country. That would be a vindication of
the social and political reforms supported by President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who has tried to change Iran's fundamentalist image even as it
remains under Islamic laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this election all groups accepted that they have to move within the
rules of politics and not beyond that,'' pro-Khatami Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said. ``In this election, the only winner is the Iranian
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the first election-related violence, meanwhile, two people were killed
and 15 injured in the southwestern town of Shush on Saturday, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the trouble started when one group
accused the winning candidate of bribing people to vote for him. It was not
clear whether the conflict stemmed from political differences or local tribal
rivalries unrelated to the conservative-reformist struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Police fired tear gas and bullets in the air to quell the rioters, who set
fire to cars and hurled stones, IRNA said. It confirmed the 15 injuries but did
not report any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear to which camp the victorious candidate, Jassem Sayeri,
belonged.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic violence also was reported in the towns of Boroujen, Boldaji and
Gandoman in central Iran. Supporters of two losing candidates burned tires and
smashed windows of the governor's office and shops, witnesses said. No injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 5,800 candidates for the 290 parliament seats, and it was
difficult to ascertain all of their political leanings -- especially because the
hard-liners, unlike the reformers, have not released a candidate list. Winners
are announced only by name.
</P>
<P>
	   A record voter turnout in Friday's polls appeared to have helped the
reformists. Of the 38.7 million eligible voters, some 32 million, or 83 percent,
voted.
</P>
<P>
	   The heavy participation was led by Iran's youth. About 20 million Iranians
are in high schools and universities, and many are fed up with the strict
Islamic laws that dictate their personal lives. They are also frustrated at
hard-liners' attempts to stifle critical newspapers and at the clergy's control
over the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Iranians saw hope after Khatami's election in May 1997 and now expect a
reformist parliament to push his proposed changes. Some reformists have even
spoken about normalizing relations with the United States, Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the 1997 vote was a vote for change and reforms, (Friday's) vote was a
vote for speeding up these reforms,'' said political analyst Saeed Laylaz, a
columnist with pro-reformist newspapers, including Hamshahri.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prestigious contests were held in Iran's two largest cities, Tehran
and Isfahan, where top reformers were leading after a partial vote count,
Interior Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those leading in Tehran was the president's younger brother,
Mohammadreza Khatami, along with 14 other reformists. Tehran sends 30 lawmakers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing in the vote count was former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rafsanjani is increasingly
identified with the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners suffered another blow with the election loss of Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, an incumbent from Damavand in northern Iran. Rasouli-Nejad was
one of the people behind the 1998 impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri and last year's unsuccessful bid to impeach Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani, both supporters of Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if they lose their parliamentary majority, hard-liners can still
obstruct the reformists. The Guardian Council, a 12-man body of clerics and
lawyers, must approve all bills passed by parliament. And Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has mostly sided with hard-liners, has the final
word and heads the armed forces, judiciary, and state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Javad Qadimi Zakir, the director general of elections, said final nationwide
results will be announced in less than two weeks.

<HEADLINE> 150,000 Protest Against Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By JAN SLIVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- More than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators crammed
a historic Vienna square on a cold, rainy Saturday evening in the largest
protest yet against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, tens of thousands of protesters gathered for smaller
rallies at different spots throughout the city. Others marched through the
streets blowing whistles and shouting slogans critical of the government and
Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, they converged on the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, where thousands
of Austrians welcomed Adolf Hitler in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to prevent right-wing nationalism from creeping into Austria
again,'' Hans Marschalek, head of the inmates association from Austria's
Mauthausen concentration camp, told a cheering crowd of 30,000 gathered in front
of the ornate neo-Grecian parliament building.
</P>
<P>
	   A banner hung from police barricades around the building read: ``Haider is
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vienna police and state television estimated the crowd at 150,000 by
evening. Austrian state television estimated an additional 1,000 people
continued to stream into the plaza each minute an hour after the rally began.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the demonstrations were peaceful. The atmosphere varied throughout
the city, from festive in downtown Vienna -- where artists decorated the
sidewalks of the city's posh shopping district with anti-Nazi symbols -- to that
of an earnest political rally outside parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ringstrasse, the main road around Vienna, was a sea of mostly
hand-painted, colorful banners: ``Being ruled by the Freedom Party hurts our
souls;'' ``Join in to help in the retention of human dignity;'' ``Austria, you
mournful country, being ruined by black and blue hands.'' The latter slogan
referred to the political colors of the Freedom Party and its coalition partner,
the mainstream conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is scandalous that racism and anti-Semitism have once again become
harmless crimes,'' Ariel Muzicant, president of the local Jewish Community, told
the crowd. ``It is a scandal that these crimes have been legitimized by the
People's Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-government rallies have become a near-daily practice in Vienna since
the new government coalition took office Feb. 4. The European Union, Israel and
the United States have taken measures to isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has
since apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who heads the People's Party, told
Switzerland's Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper he expected today's demonstration
to be the last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm counting on people to get carried away with emotion once again ...
when the far-left, the hippie generation, the youth and the Internet generation
have their fling,'' this weekend, Schuessel said. ``Then at some point after
this, things will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of anti-Haider protests have been held in other cities around Europe
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris on Saturday, up to 9,000 people demonstrated against the Austrian
coalition. Smaller protests were held in other cities across France, and about
500 people, including Holocaust survivors, protested outside the Austrian
embassy in London.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Down Russian Helicopter  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebels holding out in Chechnya's southern mountains
shot down a Russian helicopter that was targeting the militants' last
strongholds, killing 15 troops, Russia's interior minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have squeezed the Chechens into a few regions in the breakaway
republic's rugged south, and concentrated air and artillery fire Saturday on the
Argun and Vedeno gorges.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than 150 missions in Chechnya
over the previous 24 hours, striking targets in the two gorges, which slice
south through the mountains to the Georgian border, the military command said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said rebels shot down a Russian
helicopter Friday, sending it plunging 50 yards into ``one of the gorges in
southern Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yesterday was a tragic day,'' he told reporters during a visit with
wounded soldiers at a Moscow hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   He said 15 servicemen were killed, but provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Rushailo discussed the conflict during a meeting later Saturday with acting
President Vladimir Putin, who launched the popular war last September.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the rebels have retreated to the mountains since abandoning the
capital, Grozny, to federal forces earlier this month, and are hoping to wage a
prolonged guerrilla war from the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   The military estimates 7,000 fighters are based in the mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the Armed Forces General Staff,
said Friday that the Russians now controlled most strategically important areas
in Chechnya. He showed reporters a map depicting the latest concentrations of
rebels, and said ``the area where the militants can still stay is shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sappers continued Saturday defusing mines that riddle roads, bridges and the
few remaining buildings in Grozny, Russian television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command sealed Grozny until at least March 1. Russian officials
say the capital must be closed to thwart possible rebel attempts to sneak in
disguised as civilians, and to give sappers time to defuse mines planted among
the ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, meanwhile, about 100 protesters demanding an end to the war
marched to the former KGB headquarters. They sent hundreds of blue balloons with
the slogan ``No War'' sailing over the city. Anti-war protests have been rare,
since most Russians support the offensive because of widespread crime and
violence in and around Chechnya in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters, who included members of the respected Soldiers' Mothers
Committee, also demanded an end to Russia's mandatory military draft. Many of
the troops in Chechnya are conscripts.
</P>
<P>
	   Western nations also have urged Russia to stop the war. But Moscow has shown
no sign of backing down, saying the offensive is necessary to wipe out Chechen
rebels it classifies as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, urged Russia
last week to allow an investigation into human rights groups' reports that
Russian troops were executing and raping Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian authorities denied the allegations, and on Saturday the Foreign
Ministry called Robinson's comments ``unverified'' and ``overtly tendentious.''
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Robinson's) statement is yet another blatant confirmation of the High
Commissioner's nonobjective, biased and one-sided approach to the undeniably
complex situation in the North Caucasus,'' a ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government has rejected Robinson's request to visit or send an
envoy to the areas affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya has had de-facto independence since the end of a 1994-96 war with
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia again sent troops into the territory in September, after
Chechnya-based militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. The
Chechens also are blamed for four apartment bombings in Russia in September that
killed 300 people.

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Three Iraqi civilians were wounded Saturday when U.S.
warplanes bombed a northern city during patrols of the no-fly zone, the official
Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enemy warplanes attacked a civilian site, which resulted in the injury of
three of our citizens,'' an unnamed Iraqi Air Defense Force spokesman told the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military said its planes struck at an air-defense system north of
the city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad, in response to Iraqi artillery
fire during patrols of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
	   All the planes left the area safely, the Germany-based U.S. European Command
said in a statement. The planes are based at Incirlik air base in southern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iraqi spokesman said allied warplanes also flew over cities in the
southern no-fly zone, ``bombing some of our civil and service sites.''
</P>
<P>
	   He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and British planes have frequently attacked Iraqi military sites since
Iraq began challenging the patrols in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Baghdad does not recognize the no-fly zones, which were set up shortly after
the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims in the south and Kurds in
the north from the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Italy Bans Paid Political TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLEN KNICKMEYER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- A new bill to ban paid political ads on network TV needs only
the president's signature to take a powerful campaign edge from right-wing
opposition leader and TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, passed late Friday by the Senate in a 149-15 vote, also would
require both local and network stations to give all parties equal airtime in
unpaid coverage. The bill is expected to take effect in time to pull the plug on
political commercials for April 16 regional elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Berlusconi, who leads the conservative Forza Italia, said Saturday that the
bill amounted to a ``gag law.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have taken from us a measure of freedom,'' said Berlusconi, who rose
to political prominence and a brief spot in the premiership in the 1990s largely
through his television empire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All regimes start when the majority, strong in numbers, strip the
opposition of the chance of becoming the majority -- the tyranny of the
majority,'' Berlusconi told a gathering in Verona.
</P>
<P>
	   Berlusconi pointedly noted that the Senate vote was held late in the evening
on the day of a journalists' strike, when there would be few national media
services to report it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate vote was carried by Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left
coalition, and was boycotted by Berlusconi's conservative bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   D'Alema's government proposed the law, which forbids paid political spots on
all but local stations, in August, after the opposition scored big in European
and regional elections. Many credited the victory to the opposition's intense ad
campaign on Berlusconi's three TV stations, which have grown to rival Italy's
state networks.
</P>
<P>
	   D'Alema argued the ban would bring Italy into line with other European
countries that already limit paid political campaigning on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The statistics are enough: Between the first of February 1999 and the 24th
of January, Forza Italia aired 2,223 political commercials,'' said Vincenzo
Vita, communications undersecretary in D'Alema's government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the definitive approval of ``equal time,'' we've corrected the
tendency of politics to become the privilege of those who have the TV networks
and the financial resources,'' Vita said.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's lower house approved the measure earlier this month. It now awaits
the expected signature of President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

<HEADLINE> Many Rally for Elian at White House  </HEADLINE>
   By GARRETT THEROLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chanting protesters gathered outside the White House on
Saturday to demand that 6-year-old refugee Elian Gonzalez be returned to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is a little boy, not a political toy,'' one sign read.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 protesters marched through Washington's streets to Lafayette
Park across from the White House. Leaders said the Justice Department is not
acting decisively to expedite the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Justice Department has made the right decision that Elian should be
returned, but they are refusing to implement it,'' said Lucius Walker,
co-chairman of the sponsoring Committee to Return Elian to his Father. ``Elian
is trapped in the morally questionable workings of U.S. politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Walker said he believed the Clinton administration is unwilling to oppose
Miami's politically influential Cuban-American community, which overwhelmingly
opposes the boy's extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Hall, 43, of Greensburg, Pa, was among many protesters who brought
children to the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Custody fights are hard enough when it's just between two parents,'' Hall
said. ``It's just plain wrong when governments become involved as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban boy has been the focus of an international custody battle since he
was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast Nov. 25. His mother
and 10 others died when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives are fighting to keep him in the United States,
despite an order by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to reunite Elian
with his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Feud Sparks Killings in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The badly beaten bodies of two Protestant
men were found by a country roadside Saturday, the apparent victims of a feud
between outlawed pro-British groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The slayings were the first political killings in Northern Ireland since
December, when a senior member of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force was shot
dead outside his home near the Protestant town of Portadown. Since then police
and politicians in the area have expected retaliation against the group
responsible, the rival Loyalist Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
	   The feud has wider implications for Northern Ireland's peace process, which
has already fallen into deep difficulties. Both the UVF and LVF are supposed to
be observing cease-fires. With each killing, the risk grows that both groups
might widen their targeting once again to their traditional Catholic victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's victims were found outside Portadown's southern suburb of
Tandragee. A local Protestant politician, Paul Berry, said he knew both victims
and believed they had been abducted while walking home from a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the men had been so badly bludgeoned it was not yet certain
whether they had also been shot through the head, as local reports suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen called the killings ``a horrific
tragedy'' that should spur Northern Ireland's politicians to resolve their
current deadlock and resume sharing power in a Catholic-Protestant government.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain last week stripped the province's four-party Cabinet of powers and
resumed direct control after the coalition's major Protestant participant, the
Ulster Unionist Party, threatened to withdraw because of the Irish Republican
Army's refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists had accepted an American-brokered plan in November to
form the coalition alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party in expectation the
IRA would disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday peace accord of 1998 also called for the IRA and pro-British
groups to scrap all of their weapons stocks by May.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far the LVF is the only outlawed group to offer any weaponry to the
province's independent disarmament commission. The IRA's refusal to disarm has
proved to be politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dublin, Sinn Fein's executive committee debated in private Saturday how
to respond to Britain's demand that the IRA finally spell out whether it ever
intends to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's leaders announced they would hold a special convention next
Sunday in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
	   They continued to blame Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter
Mandelson, for the crisis -- particularly for rejecting a last-minute IRA plan
that hinted at the group's eventual willingness to put weapons ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't get blinded by Peter Mandelson's spins and glosses, and trying to
hide the facts. He knew exactly what was on offer. He chose to ignore it,'' said
Sinn Fein's vice president, Pat Doherty.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA withdrew the offer and broke off all contact with the disarmament
commission after Mandelson stripped the 2-month-old Cabinet of power.

<P>
	   Two weeks of sporadic violence in Kosovo's only ethnically divided town may
have dealt the final blow to already severely strained relations between ethnic
Albanians and the French troops who control the peacekeeping operation in the
northern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The French are perceived as favoring the Serbs living in northern Kosovska
Mitrovica. Ethnic Albanians accuse them of allowing the Serbs to act with
impunity in terrorizing the small number of Albanians who remain there, while
reacting harshly to any unrest generated from the southern, ethnic Albanian part
of town.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, hundreds of U.S. military personnel headed for the troubled
town amid reports that three more Serbs had died in violent attacks across the
province.
</P>
<P>
	   About 350 U.S. personnel are being deployed for at least five days to
reinforce the French troops, said U.S. Sgt. Ian Fitzgerald, a NATO spokesman in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Serb civilians were found shot dead near the village of Gornja
Gusterica, 7 miles southeast of Pristina, NATO said. Another Serb man was found
shot to death in his car near the northern Kosovo town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials have frequently stressed the multinational nature of the
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, which began after the end of a 78-day NATO air
campaign aimed at ending oppressive Serb rule of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
	   But ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica are leveling criticism only at
the French contingency stationed in their town, and say it does not reflect
their feelings for the peacekeeping mission as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French soldiers are as bad as the Serbs,'' said Halit Berani, head of
the ethnic Albanian human rights council in Kosovska Mitrovica. ``The French
army is responsible and guilty for the mistrust between the Albanians and the
French soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mistrust climaxed during the latest round of violence, which began when
a rocket was fired at a U.N. bus on Feb. 2, killing two Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of grenade attacks, shootings and clashes the next night in
northern Kosovska Mitrovica left at least eight ethnic Albanians dead and 28
Serbs and Albanians injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanians claim the French troops stationed in the north did nothing
to help their brethren when groups of Serbs roamed the town, beating and
shooting ethnic Albanians and throwing hand grenades into homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several U.N. police officers stationed in the town also have said the French
troops -- part of the peacekeeping force known as KFOR -- were slow to react
when a mob of between 1,000 and 2,000 angry Serbs rampaged through the northern
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French KFOR isn't security for us. We fear them almost as much as the
Serbs,'' said Sadije Niksic, 35, a Bosnian Muslim living among the small Bosnian
minority in the Serb part of Kosovska Mitrovica. ``We had trust in them but
we've lost it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others claim the French even provided cover for rampaging Serbs. ``When the
Serbs attacked us, they hid behind French tanks,'' said 50-year-old Adem Tolaj.
``They have helped ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the French insist they did everything possible, stressing that it would
be impossible to station soldiers outside every ethnic Albanian home in the
northern part of town to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the French had not done their job, ... it would have been a massacre,''
the French commander, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Perceptions that French troops are reluctant to protect ethnic Albanians
could further escalate violence in a town which remains one of the most tense
areas of Kosovo, a province still awash with weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern, Serb-majority part of town last week, unidentified gunmen
and snipers turned their weapons on French peacekeepers, wounding two. A gun
battle raged in the town for the next four hours, leaving at least one person
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial reports from the French troops indicated that most of those firing
had been ethnic Albanians. Out of 46 people arrested in connection with the
incident, 45 were Albanian and only one was a Serb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good relations with the population are vital to the peacekeeping
mission,'' said Lt. Commander Philip Anido, KFOR spokesman, adding: ``I have no
reason to doubt the professional capability of the French.''
</P>
<P>
	   But French troops searching for snipers possibly hiding in apartments after
Sunday's gun battle appear to have further soured relations, with some ethnic
Albanians saying their doors were smashed and they were ordered to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't even let us get our shoes,'' said Lirije Gllareva, 19, the
next day as she stood in her slippers on the southern part of a bridge over the
Ibar River dividing the town. Her father had been arrested in the sweep, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   French troops insist people were not expelled from their homes, and counter
that searching the flats was imperative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If doors were broken, it must be seen in context. The priority was to find
the shooters and limit the possibility of further injuries,'' said Lt. Matthieu
Mabin, a spokesman for the French troops.

<HEADLINE> Governors Urged To Ease Oil Crisis  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration urged the governors of 18
states on Saturday to use existing powers to help ease the bite of rapidly
rising heating oil costs while Congress debates providing $600 million in
emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna E. Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, reminded the
governors they already have the flexibility to raise state income eligibility
limits to help low and moderate-income families pay their heating bills.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we work with Congress to secure additional funds, I urge you to do
everything possible to ease the hardship in your state,'' Shalala said in a
letter to the governors. ``I would encourage you to make use of all options
available to you to help ease additional costs that are causing hardship for low
and moderate income families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letters went to the governors of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Vermont and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced on Wednesday he is releasing an additional $125
million to help hard-pressed families pay their heating bills while at the same
time calling on Congress to approve an additional $600 million in Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) money.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala said governors can act under their existing authority to ease the
situation without waiting for Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that states are authorized to set the eligibility limit for the
LIHEAP program at 150 percent of the national poverty level or at 60 percent of
the state median income level, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
	   Most states have set their eligibility thresholds well below the maximum
allowable levels, and therefore have the flexibility to raise it in an
emergency, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, she said that most Northeastern states now choose to limit
federal energy assistance for a family of four to those with incomes of about
$25,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said states can raise eligibility for the heating assistance to
$30,000 for a family of four, or even to $40,000 in some cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal law also permits states to target assistance to families that have
particularly severe expenses resulting from price increases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said states also have the option of tapping the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families fund to help very poor families pay heating bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 10 million and 14 million homes are heated by oil, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a year ago to
reduce output by 4.3 million barrels a day. That caused prices to soar from
about $10 a barrel in some cases to about $30 a barrel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Immigration authorities have dropped deportation
proceedings against 23 Indian computer programmers arrested last month during a
raid at an Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, authorities will investigate the U.S. companies that hired them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will try to determine whether two
Houston companies -- Softech Consulting Inc. and Frontier Consulting Inc. --
skirted federal rules requiring Labor Department approval to move the Indian
nationals to Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 20 raid followed a six-month INS investigation into possible visa
fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   INS district director Kenneth Pasquarell said the companies may have been
involved in a type of visa fraud called ``body shopping.'' The practice occurs
when firms tell the government they will place highly skilled foreign workers in
jobs that don't exist and then send them to other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   In this case, Pasquarell said the companies claimed the workers were in
Houston and then later shifted them to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone calls to the companies Saturday were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Appear To Lead Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Reformers promising wider freedoms appeared to be well
on their way toward taking control of Iran's parliament from hard-liners
Saturday, according to results for more than half the contested seats.
</P>
<P>
	   State television said results have been declared for 168 of the 290 seats,
but it did not give the affiliations of the elected lawmakers. But the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said about 67 percent of those seats --or about 112
-- went to reformists, 25 percent were won by hard-liners and the rest were
taken by independents.
</P>
<P>
	   If the trend continues, which appears likely, reformists will oust
hard-liners from power in the parliament for the first time since the 1979
revolution put clerics in charge of the country. That would be a vindication of
the social and political reforms supported by President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who has tried to change Iran's fundamentalist image even as it
remains under Islamic laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this election all groups accepted that they have to move within the
rules of politics and not beyond that,'' pro-Khatami Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said. ``In this election, the only winner is the Iranian
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the first election-related violence, meanwhile, two people were killed
and 15 injured in the southwestern town of Shush on Saturday, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the trouble started when one group
accused the winning candidate of bribing people to vote for him. It was not
clear whether the conflict stemmed from political differences or local tribal
rivalries unrelated to the conservative-reformist struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Police fired tear gas and bullets in the air to quell the rioters, who set
fire to cars and hurled stones, IRNA said. It confirmed the 15 injuries but did
not report any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear to which camp the victorious candidate, Jassem Sayeri,
belonged.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic violence also was reported in the towns of Boroujen, Boldaji and
Gandoman in central Iran. Supporters of two losing candidates burned tires and
smashed windows of the governor's office and shops, witnesses said. No injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   There were 5,800 candidates for the 290 parliament seats, and it was
difficult to ascertain all of their political leanings -- especially because the
hard-liners, unlike the reformers, have not released a candidate list. Winners
are announced only by name.
</P>
<P>
	   A record voter turnout in Friday's polls appeared to have helped the
reformists. Of the 38.7 million eligible voters, some 32 million, or 83 percent,
voted.
</P>
<P>
	   The heavy participation was led by Iran's youth. About 20 million Iranians
are in high schools and universities, and many are fed up with the strict
Islamic laws that dictate their personal lives. They are also frustrated at
hard-liners' attempts to stifle critical newspapers and at the clergy's control
over the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Iranians saw hope after Khatami's election in May 1997 and now expect a
reformist parliament to push his proposed changes. Some reformists have even
spoken about normalizing relations with the United States, Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the 1997 vote was a vote for change and reforms, (Friday's) vote was a
vote for speeding up these reforms,'' said political analyst Saeed Laylaz, a
columnist with pro-reformist newspapers, including Hamshahri.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prestigious contests were held in Iran's two largest cities, Tehran
and Isfahan, where top reformers were leading after a partial vote count,
Interior Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those leading in Tehran was the president's younger brother,
Mohammadreza Khatami, along with 14 other reformists. Tehran sends 30 lawmakers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing in the vote count was former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rafsanjani is increasingly
identified with the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners suffered another blow with the election loss of Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, an incumbent from Damavand in northern Iran. Rasouli-Nejad was
one of the people behind the 1998 impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri and last year's unsuccessful bid to impeach Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani, both supporters of Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if they lose their parliamentary majority, hard-liners can still
obstruct the reformists. The Guardian Council, a 12-man body of clerics and
lawyers, must approve all bills passed by parliament. And Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has mostly sided with hard-liners, has the final
word and heads the armed forces, judiciary, and state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   Javad Qadimi Zakir, the director general of elections, said final nationwide
results will be announced in less than two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Lebanon Blast Israel Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Egypt's president paid a landmark visit to Lebanon
on Saturday, meeting with his Lebanese counterpart and expressing support for
the guerrillas who are fighting Israeli occupation of a section of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hosni Mubarak's visit demonstrated the two nations' solidarity in
the face of recent Israeli airstrikes here.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak held talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. In a joint
statement, the two leaders said they support Lebanese guerrillas' right to
resist the Israeli troop presence in a region near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance is a result, not a cause, of the occupation,'' the leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel occupies a strip of territory inside Lebanon, where its soldiers
engage guerrillas to keep them away from the border. The Hezbollah guerrilla
group is trying to force the Israelis to withdraw. The area is the last active
Arab-Israeli war front.
</P>
<P>
	   Tension rose sharply in southern Lebanon last week, after Israel carried out
air raids that destroyed power stations and wounded at least 15 Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak and Lahoud's joint statement Saturday condemned the Feb. 8
airstrikes and Israeli threats of further raids if its soldiers are attacked.
The statement accused Israel of ignoring a 1996 understanding that forbids
attacks on or from civilian areas in southern Lebanon. It said such a policy
``could lead to an escalation with unforeseen consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Mubarak as saying that he raised the
issue in a phone call with Barak earlier this week, but the Israeli leader
denied Israel was targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak replied: ``You are striking against civilians in Beirut, hospitals,
installations and infrastructure,'' MENA said, adding that Barak did not
respond. ``This behavior is rejected and unacceptable,'' Mubarak told Barak,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has said the raids were in retaliation for Hezbollah attacks against
Israeli soldiers in the occupied border zone. Seven Israeli soldiers have been
killed since Jan. 25 in the area, which Israel has occupied for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak arrived earlier Saturday on the previously unannounced visit. He
flew in after holding talks in Cairo with Jordan's prime minister on the need to
break the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   His visit was first time an Egyptian leader has visited Lebanon in decades.
Egypt was boycotted by several Mideast nations, including Lebanon, after
becoming the first to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Israeli-Egyptian
relations cooled following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In addition, few
Arab leaders visit the tiny country, which is still recovering from its 1975-90
civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   In their statement Saturday, Lahoud and Mubarak said peace in the Middle
East requires Israel's full withdrawal from occupied lands, including the
occupied zone here, the Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories. They said
the right of Palestinian refugees to return home is also crucial.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks are stalled over a number of disagreements,
including the terms of a partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian-Israeli negotiations, meanwhile, are postponed indefinitely because
Syria wants assurances that Israel will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.
Israel does not want to offer such a guarantee in advance of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss criticized Beirut
protesters who have called for U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield's expulsion in
recent days. He said targeting an ambassador is ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoss had previously blessed the protesters, who accuse the United States of
blindly backing Israel. His turnabout Saturday was seen as a move to avoid
damaging U.S.-Lebanese relations.

<HEADLINE> Drug Suspect Jailed in St. Kitts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- A St. Kitts man wanted in Florida on cocaine
smuggling charges has been taken to the United States, ending U.S. officials'
long fight for his extradition, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had been fighting since 1996 for St. Kitts and Nevis, a small
island country southeast of Puerto Rico, to extradite Charles ``Little Nut''
Miller. Miller waived his rights to fight extradition while in court Thursday on
local firearms and drug charges, and U.S. officials took him on a plane Saturday
morning, Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller was believed sent to Miami, but officials there would not immediately
confirmed his arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   Formerly known as Cecil Connor, Miller was an accused member of a
Jamaican-dominated gang known for trafficking tons of cocaine in the 1980s.
Authorities blame the gang for some 1,400 murders in Miami, Los Angeles, New
York and in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller is wanted on a 1995 indictment charging him with smuggling more than
1,000 tons of cocaine. A St. Kitts court had twice blocked his extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   His case took a high profile in 1998 when U.S. officials accused him of
threatening to kill U.S. students at St. Kitts' Ross University if he was
ordered extradited.
</P>
<P>
	   About two weeks ago, employees of the St. Kitts newspaper The Observer said
Miller came into their office with a gun to complain about news coverage of the
extradition dispute.

<HEADLINE> 150,000 Protest Against Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By JAN SLIVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- More than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators crammed
a historic Vienna square on a cold, rainy Saturday evening in the largest
protest yet against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the day, tens of thousands of protesters gathered for smaller
rallies at different spots throughout the city. Others marched through the
streets blowing whistles and shouting slogans critical of the government and
Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, they converged on the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, where thousands
of Austrians welcomed Adolf Hitler in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to prevent right-wing nationalism from creeping into Austria
again,'' Hans Marschalek, head of the inmates association from Austria's
Mauthausen concentration camp, told a cheering crowd of 30,000 gathered in front
of the ornate neo-Grecian parliament building.
</P>
<P>
	   A banner hung from police barricades around the building read: ``Haider is
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vienna police estimated 150,000 people attended the main rally. It ended
peacefully Saturday night after four hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the demonstrations were peaceful. The atmosphere varied throughout
the city, from festive in downtown Vienna -- where artists decorated the
sidewalks of the city's posh shopping district with anti-Nazi symbols -- to that
of an earnest political rally outside parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ringstrasse, the main road around Vienna, was a sea of mostly
hand-painted, colorful banners: ``Being ruled by the Freedom Party hurts our
souls;'' ``Join in to help in the retention of human dignity;'' ``Austria, you
mournful country, being ruined by black and blue hands.'' The latter slogan
referred to the political colors of the Freedom Party and its coalition partner,
the mainstream conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is scandalous that racism and anti-Semitism have once again become
harmless crimes,'' Ariel Muzicant, president of the local Jewish Community, told
the crowd. ``It is a scandal that these crimes have been legitimized by the
People's Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-government rallies have become a near-daily practice in Vienna since
the new government coalition took office Feb. 4. The European Union, Israel and
the United States have taken measures to isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has
since apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who heads the People's Party, told
Switzerland's Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper he expected today's demonstration
to be the last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm counting on people to get carried away with emotion once again ...
when the far-left, the hippie generation, the youth and the Internet generation
have their fling,'' this weekend, Schuessel said. ``Then at some point after
this, things will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of anti-Haider protests have been held in other cities around Europe
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris on Saturday, up to 9,000 people demonstrated against the Austrian
coalition. Smaller protests were held in other cities across France, and about
500 people, including Holocaust survivors, protested outside the Austrian
embassy in London.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Denounces U.S. Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By FILADELFO ALEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A leader of Colombia's second most powerful
leftist rebel group says that a $1.6 billion U.S. aid package ``will be used
against the guerrillas and that will escalate the war'' in his country.
</P>
<P>
	   Pablo Beltran, a top official of the National Liberation Army, said the
package proposed last month by President Clinton ``is supposedly for the fight
against drug trafficking, but it is really for the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can they expect us to disarm when they're reinforcing the army?'' he
asked reporters Friday during the Sao Paolo Forum, an annual gathering of Latin
American leftist parties and factions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our fight will have to grow, and we will not disarm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say the aid would help Colombia's army tackle growing cocaine
production in the country, where both leftist guerrillas and rightist
paramilitary groups have forged links with drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   It would pay for new equipment, including 63 new helicopters, and training
of two new anti-drug battalions of Colombia's military meant to retake
rebel-held jungle areas where cocaine production is increasing.
</P>
<P>
	   Some would also go to help peasant farmers shift away from growing coca.
</P>
<P>
	   Beltran's group has in recent weeks launched a nationwide sabotage campaign,
blockading major highways and dynamiting electricity pylons and oil pipelines.
The attacks have forced power rationing for hundreds of thousands of Colombians.
</P>

	   The group, known by its Spanish initials ELN, is demanding that President
Andres Pastrana withdraw troops from a swath of northern Colombia to allow peace
negotiations in a 35-year insurgency that has killed 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1998, the government pulled the army from a Switzerland-sized
region in the south as a condition for opening talks with the country's largest
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

	   Last week, thousands of peasants in the region blocked six main roads in a

<HEADLINE> Russian Banks Deny Wrongdoing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian bankers linked to a massive money laundering probe
involving the Bank of New York denied any wrongdoing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two suspects pleaded guilty in U.S. court last week to aiding Russian
bankers in a $7 billion money-laundering scheme: a former vice president at Bank
of New York, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice, Alexei Volkov, said Saturday he had done nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkov, speaking in Moscow, said on ORT television that he had helped Berlin
process $6 billion in Russian money transfers, and that they were all above
board.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Russian funds were illegally transferred abroad by two
Russian banks, DKB and Flamingo, using correspondent bank accounts at The Bank
of New York, to avoid Russian taxes and customs duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Oleg Solovov, former deputy manager at DKB, also said his bank had done
nothing wrong according to Russian law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If someone wants to send money abroad ... if they submit all the proper
papers, the bank has no right not to conduct the transfer,'' he told ORT.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters or government coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   Solovov admitted that corrupt officials could use such a transfer system to
send embezzled government money overseas, but claimed that DKB avoided dealing
with state funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Russian banks don't exist for lending or protecting savings accounts,
but for serving business -- including those who want to hide income from the
government. DKB and Flamingo, like other Russian banks, apparently were set up
specifically for funneling money overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   The DKB and Flamingo banks have gone out of business, but the prominent
banks that established them, Sobinbank and MDM, are still on the scene.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Visits Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Egypt's president paid a key visit to Lebanon on
Saturday, meeting with his Lebanese counterpart and expressing support for the
guerrillas who are fighting Israeli occupation of a section of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hosni Mubarak's visit demonstrated the two nations' solidarity in
the face of recent Israeli airstrikes here.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak held talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. In a joint
statement, the two leaders said they support Lebanese guerrillas' right to
resist the Israeli troop presence in a region near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance is a result, not a cause, of the occupation,'' the leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel occupies a strip of territory inside Lebanon, where its soldiers
engage guerrillas to keep them away from the border. The Hezbollah guerrilla
group is trying to force the Israelis to withdraw. The area is the last active
Arab-Israeli war front.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has said he will withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon by July.
However, he is reluctant to pull out unilaterally, and is still holding out for
a peace treaty with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
	   Tension rose sharply in southern Lebanon last week, after Israel carried out
air raids that destroyed power stations and wounded at least 15 Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak and Lahoud's joint statement Saturday condemned the Feb. 8
airstrikes and Israeli threats of further raids if its soldiers are attacked.
The statement accused Israel of ignoring a 1996 understanding that forbids
attacks on or from civilian areas in southern Lebanon. It said such a policy
``could lead to an escalation with unforeseen consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Mubarak as saying that he raised the
issue in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak earlier this week,
but the Israeli leader denied Israel was targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak replied: ``You are striking against civilians in Beirut, hospitals,
installations and infrastructure,'' MENA said, adding that Barak did not
respond. ``This behavior is rejected and unacceptable,'' Mubarak told Barak,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has said the raids were in retaliation for Hezbollah attacks against
Israeli soldiers in the occupied border zone. Seven Israeli soldiers have been
killed since Jan. 25 in the area, which Israel has occupied for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak arrived earlier Saturday on the previously unannounced visit. He
flew in after holding talks in Cairo with Jordan's prime minister on the need to
break the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   His visit was first time an Egyptian leader has visited Lebanon in decades.
Egypt was boycotted by several Mideast nations, including Lebanon, after
becoming the first to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Israeli-Egyptian
relations cooled following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In addition, few
Arab leaders visit the tiny country, which is still recovering from its 1975-90
civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   In their statement Saturday, Lahoud and Mubarak said peace in the Middle
East requires Israel's full withdrawal from occupied lands, including the
occupied zone here, the Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories. They said
the right of Palestinian refugees to return home is also crucial.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks are stalled over a number of disagreements,
including the terms of a partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian-Israeli negotiations, meanwhile, are postponed indefinitely because
Syria wants assurances that Israel will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.
Israel does not want to offer such a guarantee in advance of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss criticized Beirut
protesters who have called for U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield's expulsion in
recent days. He said targeting an ambassador is ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoss had previously blessed the protesters, who accuse the United States of
blindly backing Israel. His turnabout Saturday was seen as a move to avoid
damaging U.S.-Lebanese relations.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Ready for Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Yasser Arafat said Saturday he is ready to
press ahead with now-stalled peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Palestinian leader repeated a recent warning: If there is no deal by
September, he said, Palestinians have the right to declare statehood
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat also said there is no longer a need to negotiate a framework, or
outline, for a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The sides
failed to finish a framework agreement by Feb. 13, the planned date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The deadline for the framework agreement has ended, so we should move
directly to the comprehensive accord,'' Arafat told reporters after a meeting
with German President Johannes Rau. He said the sides should focus on their next
goal: Reaching a final agreement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's chief negotiator, Oded Eran, has said he believes it is still
possible to reach a framework by the end of March. But Israel hasn't said
whether it will insist on reaching such a framework first or whether it will
accept the Palestinian proposal to skip it and move to full treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The full treaty talks will encompass the thorniest issues between the sides,
including the borders of an eventual Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem
and the future of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news conference Saturday with Rau, Arafat reaffirmed that the
Palestinians can declare statehood in September, whether or not a final treaty
has been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is clear, that the end of negotiations is September 13, and
we have the right to declare statehood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat has often threatened to declare statehood unilaterally when peace
talks have bogged down. Recently, however, those threats have increased in
frequency, with two major PLO bodies -- the Palestinian Central Council and the
Fatah Revolutionary Command Council -- also saying statehood will be declared
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat insisted Saturday that Israel carry out a third interim troop
withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has angered Arafat by saying it wants to
fold a third withdrawal into the final peace deal instead of doing it in
advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Disagreements about Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank have been one of
the roadblocks to the peace talks. Talks were suspended after Israel refused to
withdraw from densely populated Jerusalem suburbs -- an area the Palestinians
demanded -- as part of the second pullback, which was initially due Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, an Israeli army spokesman said that Israeli forces foiled an
attempt to smuggle weapons from Egypt to the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   After noticing suspicious activity along the Israeli-Egyptian border, army
forces pursued four suspects, but two fled back into Egypt and the other two
fled into Gaza. During the pursuit the suspects left behind a large number of
weapons, the army said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Arrest Kurd Mayors  </HEADLINE>
   By SUZAN FRASER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police detained two prominent mayors from the
country's only legal pro-Kurdish party Saturday on suspicions that the men had
ties with Abdullah Ocalan's outlawed rebel group.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions, which were likely to increase tensions with EU members, came
just two days after one of the mayors met with Swedish Foreign Minister Anna
Lindh, who has also stressed that Turkey must grant cultural rights to Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   Police detained Mayor Feridun Celik of Diyarbakir, the largest city in the
overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast, and Mayor Selim Ozalp of nearby Siirt,
according to a statement from the regional governor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Private NTV said police also detained the mayor of Bingol, another city in
the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were questioned on allegations that they aided Ocalan's Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as a minority, and does not
grant them the right to teach and broadcast in their language -- rights that are
granted to recognized minorities, such as Jews, Armenians and Greeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, or HADEP, swept into power in
April's national elections in more than 35 cities and towns in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Celik spent time before the election in police detention, and the chief
prosecutor has been fighting to have the party closed, accusing the group of
being a front for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's statement alleged that the mayors met with PKK members, took
instructions from the PKK and channeled funds to the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   It said authorities were acting on information received after the arrest of
25 suspected PKK members.
</P>
<P>
	   The government shut down three earlier pro-Kurdish parties on charges of
ties to the PKK, and several pro-Kurdish deputies are in prison for separatism.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey fears that, now that Ocalan's rebels have renounced their armed
struggle, European nations will pressure Turkey into granting more rights to
Kurds. Ocalan was captured by Turkish forces last year and sentenced to death.
His rebels have been fighting for 15 years for autonomy in the southeast.

<HEADLINE> Congo Leader Willing To Share Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- President Laurent Kabila says he is willing to share
power with an elected legislative assembly in war-torn Congo, though opposition
parties want nothing to do with such a body.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila created a 15-member committee by presidential decree Friday to
prepare for assembly elections, which he said could take place in the next few
weeks. He did not, however, appoint any of the committee's members.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila, whose forces swept across the vast Central African nation in 1997,
currently rules without a legislative body. The 300-member assembly would
involve the Congolese people in the running of the country and its defense
against aggressors, Kabila said at a ceremony to announce his plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He provided no further details of the body's powers and functions.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition politicians, said the assembly was an attempt to bypass a
national dialogue on Congo's political future that would lead to general
elections, which form part of an often-violated cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Congolese civil war erupted in August 1998, a year after Kabila
overthrew the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The rebels accuse Kabila of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering.
</P>
<P>
	   An Italian missionary news service reported Saturday that two Protestant
ministers were missing and believed killed after an armed attack on a village in
northeast Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed men kidnapped the two pastors from Vuatsinge, a village in Virunga
National Park not far from the border with Uganda, the MISNA news service said
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   A third man was killed in the same raid Wednesday, the missionary news
service said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the names nor the denominations of the two ministers were confirmed,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Calif. Highway Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILROY, Calif. (AP) -- A car moving at least 60 mph crossed the center line
of a highway in Northern California early Saturday and smashed head-on into a
pickup truck, killing all seven people in the vehicles, the state Highway Patrol
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash happened on state Highway 25 near Gilroy, about 75 miles south of
San Francisco, about 4:20 a.m., said California Highway Patrol dispatcher Cindy
Dichiara.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men in the car and three adults and two children in the pickup were
reported dead at the scene. The car was believed to be moving between 60 and 65
mph in a 55 mph zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses traveling in a vehicle behind the car told police they made
several attempts to get the car back onto the right side of the road by flashing
their headlights, Highway Patrol Officer Adam Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very surreal, very disturbing to see such death has to happen that
way when it's actually all very preventable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway 25 was closed in both directions at the scene of the crash for about
10 hours.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supporters Bathe in Victory  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON and MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A victorious roar went up inside George W. Bush's
hotel suite Saturday night and the Texas governor wore a lip-busting grin.
Seated between his wife, Laura, and South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins
on a wraparound couch, he savored his victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I knew we had a tough fight here,'' Bush said moments before John McCain
called to concede the Republican primary, and as the governor, his family and
friends celebrated with soft drinks in front of a television as the news came
in. ``I knew we were in a major battle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hot victory felt better than his cold defeat in New Hampshire to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got knocked down in the snows and I knocked the snow off my suit and I
came down to South Carolina,'' he said, still wearing his blue pinstripe. ``I
looked at my leaders and I said, `Just put me in front of the people. We're
going to win this state.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   A small, restrained crowd milled around McCain's party before he arrived,
sipping drinks and asking themselves what happened, as a happier crowd flew by
on their way to a concert hall next door.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to the good party,'' said Mike Mallard, of Charleston, as he
and his pals headed to a concert headlined by ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain? Yeah, I like him ...'' said Terry Ford, of Charleston, who said he
was a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   He grinned a bit when asked if he'd voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was too busy working on my car,'' he said. ``Going to be a great concert
though.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the McCain party the music was loud, but the crowd was thin and the
conversation restrained. At poll closing time, the ballroom was about a third
full with roughly 250 people in attendance. Racks of campaign memorabilia
outside remained unsold, and food uneaten inside.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Balloons, banners and buffet tables were in place at Alan Keyes' party at
the Clarion Townhouse in downtown Columbia. But there was no one there to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
	   A half dozen people -- two national campaign coordinators for Keyes --
simply stood and waited.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bush had checked in with his father, calling on a cell
phone from the tarmac at the airport in Greenville. ``Dad's real nervous,'' the
younger Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to his election rally, flying from Greenville to Columbia, a
flight attendant shut the curtain between the first- and coach-class cabins on
Bush's campaign plane, but the barrier didn't block the sound of hearty laughter
from spilling over the divider.
</P>
<P>
	   Staffers munched on pizza brought aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The first confirmation that Bush might win came just after 1 p.m., when the
governor's chief political strategist, Karl Rove, pulled him aside on the tarmac
at Columbia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   A howling wind drowned out the words, but Bush thrust his right index finger
into the sky -- the universal No. 1 sign -- as Rove told him he had learned that
McCain was already conceding defeat to his staff. A half hour later, Rove told
Bush that exit polls showed he would win.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked if I thought the numbers would hold and settled down for a power
nap,'' the strategist recalled. ``And then he went for a run.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's final appearance before the votes came in was at a VFW meeting in
Greenville, a somber affair where he spent a lot of time about ``being in prison
a long time ago and far away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The audience was elderly and subdued, as was McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope we prevail today, but if we don't prevail, my friends, we know we
have taken the honorable way, not only in our service to the country in the
military but our service to the VFW and our nation,'' said McCain. ``I am proud
of the honorable way that we have conducted this campaign and I am most honored,
most honored by your approval and your friendship.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the conclusion of most campaign events, the crowd crushes toward McCain
seeking a handshake or autograph, but these more reserved veterans merely stood
and clapped.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   As the sunlight began to fade on McCain's South Carolina hopes, and the
senator's defeat grew apparent, staffer Rebecca Hanks strolled alone across a
darkened parking lot. Spotting a reporter, she diverted to plead: ``Give me some
good news, give me some good news.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assured there was little, she sighed deeply. ``I know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reminded these things happened, she said: ``We just never thought it would
happen to us.''

<HEADLINE> France Reports 7 Listeria Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Seven people, including two newborn infants, have died from
listeria poisoning since the end of November, France's agriculture minister said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 23 cases of listeriosis have been detected around France, and
authorities believe a single food source is responsible, though they haven't yet
pinpointed the source, Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 7, officials reported two deaths and four other poisonings by
Listeria, a potent bacteria found most often in cheese and meat products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an epidemic,'' Glavany told reporters, and said specialists were
searching for the source at stores frequented by those contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope to have results by the middle of the week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeria poisoning causes fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea and
diarrhea. Healthy people typically recover quickly, but listeria can cause
serious, even fatal infections in children, the elderly and people with weak
immune systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The bacteria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, because it can
cause miscarriages and stillbirths even if the mother experienced no symptoms.
Listeriosis can take up to eight weeks to incubate.
</P>
<P>
	   Glavany advised caution for consumers most at risk of falling ill from
listeriosis, saying they should avoid products like cheese, pate and rillette,
the coarsely chopped pate in which fat is added and the bacteria can flourish.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Restores Bush As Front-Runner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By DAVID ESPO  AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Carolina Republicans have a history of choosing
front-runners over insurgents and the stakes had never been higher than the
clash between George W. Bush, scion of the establishment, and John McCain, its
scourge. The establishment won Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina restored Bush's front-runner credentials so badly shattered
in New Hampshire. The defeat leaves McCain in need of a new bounce to keep his
campaign alive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor pieced together his triumph the time-tested way. He ran
strongest among staunch Republicans, the very conservative, abortion opponents,
members of the religious right and Palmetto State natives.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the voters said they preferred a candidate who was loyal to
the Republican Party, and Bush won their support by an overwhelming margin of
4-1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who stunned Bush with a double-digit victory in New Hampshire two
weeks ago, ran best among independents, moderates and those who were not native
to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The state was a pivot point for both men. Just ahead is a three-week string
of primaries that will likely decide the winner in the nomination battle.
Without momentum, McCain is at a disadvantage against Bush's 50-state
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that with a win in South Carolina, there'd be no stopping him --
and not many Republicans had the stomach for arguing with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush looked to South Carolina -- the first of several campaign firewalls he
claims around the country -- to slow his rival, but also to steady the nerves of
his supporters in Congress and elsewhere in the GOP establishment. Without
naming names, he derided some of his supporters last week as weak-kneed for
fearing his campaign was about to unravel.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolinians have been here before, even if Bush and McCain have not.
The state's GOP voters embraced George Bush in 1988 and 1992, after he had been
scared in earlier contests. And it served as a Bob Dole firewall in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The balloting marked the culmination of a tough 18-day campaign, one in
which Bush successfully co-opted McCain's message as a reformer of the political
system by stressing his credentials as a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks
showed about 23 percent of the voters said Bush was the real reformer in the
race. McCain was chosen by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the same polls show that Bush benefitted from the
perception among the voters that McCain had unfairly attacked him. Almost half
the voters said McCain had unfairly attacked the Texas governor. Only one-third
said Bush had attacked unfairly.
</P>
<P>
	   In retrospect, negative advertising seems to have been a key tactical issue,
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Angered by an attack on him by a veteran campaigning for Bush, McCain
authorized negative commercials, including one that said the Texas governor
twisted the truth like Bill Clinton. Then, when his internal polls showed
support eroding, he ordered the ads stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   But that left Bush free to run all the negative commercials he wanted
without risk of retaliation -- at the same time he complained that McCain had
sullied his reputation by likening him to Clinton. ``That's about as low a blow
as you can give in a Republican primary,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides, a close-knit group, disagree on who advocated the first
negative commercials and how sharply worded they should be -- a sign that the
strategy was not as successful as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   In victory, neither Bush nor his surrogates claimed the nomination was
theirs. At the same time, Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Bush's liaison to the
House, said, ``It will be hard for McCain to transition from this two-state
strategy into a 50-state effort without a boost of energy like he got in New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan votes in two days' time, the first of the classic general election
swing states to hold a primary. That makes it a critical test of McCain's claim
to be the more electable of the two contenders. And he's up against a different
kind of firewall in the state, one erected by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina outcome could also impact voting in Virginia on Feb. 29.
It was not in McCain's original playbook -- that called for victories in New
Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan, followed by California on March 7. But
he has a modest effort under way in the Old Dominion, with its large military
and retired military population, and was waiting for South Carolina's results
before deciding whether to ratchet up the campaign in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Man Accused of Shooting Parents  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOYT, Kan. (AP) -- Investigators believe a 27-year-old man shot his parents
to death, set their home on fire and then died in the rural Kansas blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were found dead Friday night at the scene of a standoff that
began with the wounding of a sheriff's deputy and ended in a fire that destroyed
the house about 15 miles north of Topeka.
</P>
<P>
	   The house was allowed to burn down because authorities said they were afraid
firefighters would be shot if they approached.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's Deputy John Schoen had been sent to the house after the woman's
employer reported that she failed to show up to work. The officer, who was
wearing a bulletproof vest, entered the house and was hit in the chest with what
apparently was a shotgun blast, said Sheriff Daina Durham.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the shooting, a 911 call was made from the house by a man who
said, ``I shot your officer ... send me more,'' Durham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other officers responded to the scene, and a second 911 call was received
from the house in which a man requested a negotiator. A gunshot was heard later
and the house caught fire, Durham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schoen suffered wounds in his arms, hands and face that were described as
not life-threatening. His police dog was killed in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators tentatively identified the man whose body was found inside the
house as Ilesh Ashok Abdir. The bodies of a man and woman, presumed to be his
parents, were found about 500 yards away. They were tentatively identified as
Snettalata Shimpi, 58, and Ashok Shimpi, 59.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush breezed past Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina's Republican primary Saturday, reclaiming momentum from his insurgent
rival as the GOP race turned toward larger states that will likely settle the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' said Bush, who was rocked by a landslide defeat in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain told supporters: ``We have just begun to fight,
and I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 19 percent of the precincts reported, Bush had 53 percent of the vote
to McCain's 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among his base supporters -- conservatives and Republicans. Six
out of 10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Alan Keyes was also on the ballot, running a distant third at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory earned him the state's 19 at-large delegates with 18 others
to be allocated according to the winner of each congressional district. He now
has 46 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination with
McCain at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have to recover quickly. In just three days
Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of Arizona, and
then in three other states a week later. On March 7, thirteen states conduct
elections that could settle the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain. Aides say it will be difficult,
if not impossible, to mount a serious challenge against Bush without regaining
momentum Tuesday, and they believe the Midwest state will be friendly territory
than South Carolina. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban Detroit
will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign increased its TV ad buy in Michigan late last week,
matching a recent increase by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed that McCain failed to best Bush on what should have been
his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively recruited
veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man who rides
the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't fare any
better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling, conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP
and television networks, also showed that Bush also was able to turn the tables
on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush were
unfair, a bigger group than those that thought that about Bush's attacks on
McCain. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain -- double
the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a strong statement from Republicans who are looking for someone
who can unite our party,'' the Texas governor told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain said in pugnacious remarks to
supporters. ``He's going to need it my friends for we have just begun to fight
and I cannot wait for the next round. I'm going to fight with every ounce of
strength that I have, but I'm going to keep fighting clean. I'm going to keep
fighting fair. And I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, dismissed the Bush victory, saying
the governor couldn't have won without ads that inflamed South Carolina's
influential social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush disagreed. ``I think it's more than social conservatives,'' he said.
``I united the party. I brought elements of the party together. I convinced the
people of this state that I have an agenda that is positive and hopeful and that
I'm a reformer who has good results when given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The voter survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described
conservatives who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters
strongly believed the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and
cited moral values as their top issue. The religious right preferred Bush, as
did people native to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare. Almost a third of the voters
were new GOP primary voters, and they preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost a third of the voters were new GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   VNS predicted turnout to exceed the 276,000 who voted in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and tore up the GOP playbook to openly court
Democrats and independents. Bush portrayed McCain as more of a hypocrite than a
reformer and his punches landed. McCain was left to proclaim, ``I don't just say
it, I live it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of large-scale defections from GOP establishment
figures if he lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Broadway 'Cats,' To Close  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's the last meow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," the longest-running show in Broadway history, is to close in June
after a record-breaking 7,397 performances.
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, nearly two decades after it opened at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater in October 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am sad that 'Cats' has to close on Broadway at the end of June, but it is
a day of great celebration," Lloyd Webber said Saturday in a story posted on The
New York Times Web site. "Eighteen is a great age for a cat."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the feline musical, based on T.S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of
Practical Cats," will still have the London production, which has been playing
there since 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   At Broadway and 50th Street in New York, the giant marquee for the musical,
which features the show's simple logo of a pair of yellow cats' eyes, has long
been a tourist destination. Some 10 million theatergoers will have seen "Cats"
in New York by the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated at more than $380
million. Yet in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling,
with some weeks falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean
winter months after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats" was the first of the big British musicals with lavish settings and
pop scores to invade Broadway in 1980s. It earned a fortune for Lloyd Webber and
producer Cameron Mackintosh, who went on to bring "Les Miserables," "The Phantom
of the Opera" and "Miss Saigon" to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats" had its signature song in "Memory," a plaintive plea sung by
Grizabella, a once-elegant but now faded creature who, in the show's opulent
finale, is led to "the heavy-side layer," a sort of cats' version of heaven.
</P>
<P>
	   The musical became Broadway's longest running show in June 1997, surpassing
"A Chorus Line," which ran for 6,137 performances, from 1975 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Cats' appeals to everybody. Little kids love the movement and the fun,
grannies and grandpas like the spiritual side of it, and lovers, young and old,
like the uninhibitedness of the show," Gillian Lynne, the musical's
choreographer and assistant director, has said in assessing the show's
longevity.
</P>
<P>
	   In its advertising, "Cats" never used quotes from the critics, preferring
instead to call itself "Now and forever." But as Mackintosh said when the show
finally passed "A Chorus Line" three years ago, "Records are made to be broken.
And there will always be other shows."

<HEADLINE> Drug Suspect Jailed in St. Kitts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- A St. Kitts man wanted in Florida on cocaine
smuggling charges has been taken to the United States, ending U.S. officials'
long fight for his extradition, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had been fighting since 1996 for St. Kitts and Nevis, a small
island country southeast of Puerto Rico, to extradite Charles ``Little Nut''
Miller. Miller waived his rights to fight extradition while in court Thursday on
local firearms and drug charges, and U.S. officials took him on a plane Saturday
morning, Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller has been turned over to the U.S. Customs Service, the agency said
Saturday. It said Miller had been sought following a joint investigtion by the
Customers Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Formerly known as Cecil Connor, Miller was an accused member of a
Jamaican-dominated gang known for trafficking tons of cocaine in the 1980s.
Authorities blame the gang for some 1,400 murders in Miami, Los Angeles, New
York and in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller is wanted on a 1995 indictment charging him with smuggling more than
1,000 pounds of cocaine. A St. Kitts court had twice blocked his extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   His case took a high profile in 1998 when U.S. officials accused him of
threatening to kill U.S. students at St. Kitts' Ross University if he was
ordered extradited.
</P>
<P>
	   About two weeks ago, employees of the St. Kitts newspaper The Observer said
Miller came into their office with a gun to complain about news coverage of the
extradition dispute.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Conservatives Lift Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Conservatives, especially the religious right, drove
George W. Bush's victory in the South Carolina Republican primary Saturday. The
Texas governor also poked holes in challenger John McCain's reformer image, exit
polls found.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans also strongly backed Bush, offsetting a slightly larger than
usual turnout of Democrats and independents in the open primary. Six in 10
voters called themselves Republicans and they favored Bush by more than 2-to-1,
while McCain won about 60 percent of independents and 80 percent of the 1 in 10
self-described Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polling by Voter News Service for The Associated Press and television
networks indicated that as the campaign turned sharply negative after the Feb. 1
New Hampshire primary, Bush's attacks hurt McCain. They also suggest the Arizona
senator may have hurt himself with attacks on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, just 15 percent of voters viewed McCain unfavorably; that
increased to 30 percent in a preliminary exit polling in South Carolina. Bush's
favorable rating rose from 60 percent to 73 percent. And more voters said McCain
attacked Bush unfairly than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues McCain hoped would sway independents and Democrats failed to
register strongly enough to overcome the state's conservative, establishment
tilt. Only 1 in 20 said campaign finance reform, a centerpiece of McCain's
message, was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush succeeded in neutralizing McCain's emphasis on that issue with his new
line of attack in the past week accusing McCain of saying one thing but doing
another when it comes to campaign finance -- nearly half of voters agreed with
Bush on that.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit poll found that more than a third of voters said moral values was
the most important issue for them, and Bush won half that vote. He also won
three-quarters of the votes cast by those who said they voted based on the
candidate who best represented their conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two-thirds of voters Saturday called themselves conservative, and
Bush won more than 6 in 10 of them. Bush ran especially strongly among those who
called themselves ``very conservative.'' A third called themselves part of the
religious right, and Bush won two-thirds of their votes. Bush also drew strong
support from abortion foes, who made up 60 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing decisively to McCain in New Hampshire, Bush changed his message
to ``reformer with results'' -- and it apparently worked. Six in 10 voters said
Bush is a real reformer, while little more than half considered that term fit
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analysts said McCain erred by airing ads that compared Bush to
President Clinton. A quarter of those who voted for McCain said he unfairly
attacked Bush. Just 15 percent of Bush voters said they thought his attacks
against McCain were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That probably helped deep six him in the last week,'' said Neal Thigpen, a
Francis Marion University political scientist and McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Kamber said he flirted with voting for McCain before doing more reading
on the candidates. He decided on Bush. ``Had I gone with the ads alone, I
probably would have gone with McCain,'' Kamber said after voting in an upscale
Columbia neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results were from interviews of 1,401 voters in 40 precincts around
South Carolina. The margin of sampling error was plus of minus 3.5 percentage
points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> St. Kitts Suspect Taken to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- A St. Kitts man wanted in Florida on cocaine
smuggling charges has been taken to the United States, ending U.S. officials'
long fight for his extradition, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had been fighting since 1996 for St. Kitts and Nevis, a small
island country southeast of Puerto Rico, to extradite Charles ``Little Nut''
Miller. Miller waived his rights to fight extradition while in court Thursday on
local firearms and drug charges, and U.S. officials took him on a plane Saturday
morning, Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller has been turned over to the U.S. Customs Service, the agency said
Saturday. It said Miller had been sought following a joint investigtion by the
Customers Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Formerly known as Cecil Connor, Miller was an accused member of a
Jamaican-dominated gang known for trafficking tons of cocaine in the 1980s.
Authorities blame the gang for some 1,400 murders in Miami, Los Angeles, New
York and in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller is wanted on a 1995 indictment charging him with smuggling more than
1,000 pounds of cocaine. A St. Kitts court had twice blocked his extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   His case took a high profile in 1998 when U.S. officials accused him of
threatening to kill U.S. students at St. Kitts' Ross University if he was
ordered extradited.
</P>
<P>
	   About two weeks ago, employees of the St. Kitts newspaper The Observer said
Miller came into their office with a gun to complain about news coverage of the
extradition dispute.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush breezed past Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina's Republican primary Saturday, reclaiming momentum from his insurgent
rival as the GOP race turned toward larger states that will likely settle the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' said Bush, who was rocked by a landslide defeat in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain told supporters: ``We have just begun to fight,
and I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 19 percent of the precincts reported, Bush had 53 percent of the vote
to McCain's 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among his base supporters -- conservatives and Republicans. Six
out of 10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Alan Keyes was also on the ballot, running a distant third at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory earned him the state's 19 at-large delegates with 18 others
to be allocated according to the winner of each congressional district. He now
has 46 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination with
McCain at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have to recover quickly. In just three days
Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of Arizona, and
then in three other states a week later. On March 7, thirteen states conduct
elections that could settle the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain. Aides say it will be difficult,
if not impossible, to mount a serious challenge against Bush without regaining
momentum Tuesday, and they believe the Midwest state will be friendly territory
than South Carolina. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban Detroit
will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign increased its TV ad buy in Michigan late last week,
matching a recent increase by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed that McCain failed to best Bush on what should have been
his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively recruited
veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man who rides
the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't fare any
better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling, conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP
and television networks, also showed that Bush also was able to turn the tables
on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush were
unfair, a bigger group than those that thought that about Bush's attacks on
McCain. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain -- double
the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a strong statement from Republicans who are looking for someone
who can unite our party,'' the Texas governor told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain said in pugnacious remarks to
supporters. ``He's going to need it my friends for we have just begun to fight
and I cannot wait for the next round. I'm going to fight with every ounce of
strength that I have, but I'm going to keep fighting clean. I'm going to keep
fighting fair. And I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, dismissed the Bush victory, saying
the governor couldn't have won without ads that inflamed South Carolina's
influential social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush disagreed. ``I think it's more than social conservatives,'' he said.
``I united the party. I brought elements of the party together. I convinced the
people of this state that I have an agenda that is positive and hopeful and that
I'm a reformer who has good results when given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The voter survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described
conservatives who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters
strongly believed the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and
cited moral values as their top issue. The religious right preferred Bush, as
did people native to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare. Almost a third of the voters
were new GOP primary voters, and they preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost a third of the voters were new GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   VNS predicted turnout to exceed the 276,000 who voted in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and tore up the GOP playbook to openly court
Democrats and independents. Bush portrayed McCain as more of a hypocrite than a
reformer and his punches landed. McCain was left to proclaim, ``I don't just say
it, I live it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of large-scale defections from GOP establishment
figures if he lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Linked to INS Agent Expelled  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department ordered the expulsion Saturday of a
Cuban diplomat linked to the Cuban-born U.S. immigration official arrested in
Miami on spy charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The diplomat, whose name was not released, was given seven days to leave the
country, spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban official was ordered out of the country for activities
``incompatible with his diplomatic status,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Foley did not go into detail, the diplomat apparently was a
Washington contact of Mariano Faget, a 34-year veteran of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service who was arrested Thursday night as the results of a
government sting operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, 54, a supervisor in the Miami office of the INS, may have been
passing on classified information about Cuban defectors for some time,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in
Miami on at least two occasions, contacted officials with the Cuban mission in
Washington and had regular contact with a man he called last week in the sting
-- a New York businessman with ties to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the State Department acted against the Cuban diplomat in response
to evidence presented by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Felix Wilson, the acting head of the Cuban diplomatic mission, formally
known as the Cuban interests section, was summoned to the State Department
Saturday afternoon and informed of the expulsion order.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the diplomat was expected to leave the country as requested.
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana, however, the Cuban government said it would not willingly
withdraw the diplomat, but would urge that ``this compatriot, so vilely accused,
remain in United States territory to give testimony and demonstrate the total
falseness of this accusation, whatever the consequences may be.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear what procedures would be followed if the
diplomat, indeed, refused to leave voluntarily. Under international law,
diplomats hold a guest-like status in the country where they serve, with no
legal rights to remain there if asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   A news release from the interests section in Washington offered no comment
on the ordered expulsion but said the allegation of Cuban espionage is a
``colossal slander.'' It said the purpose of the Cuban mission is to promote
better relations between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The release said it is no coincidence that the espionage accusations are
being leveled at a time when the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez is reaching
a critical stage. Court proceedings are scheduled in the coming week in the case
involving efforts by the 6-year-old refugee's relatives to forestall a Clinton
administration order that he be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   This is believed to be the first Cuban diplomat asked to leave the United
States since 1996. Then, the mission spokesman, Jose Luis Ponce, was asked to
leave in retaliation for the expulsion of an American diplomat from Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1996, Cuba expelled Robin Meyer, a diplomat with the
political-economic section of the U.S. mission in Havana. Her primary
responsibility was human rights. Cuba charged that Meyer had carried out
activities ``incompatible with her diplomatic status.''
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, the immigration official now charged with spying, was arrested after
falling into a trap set by the FBI, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it fed him phony information about a pending defection and then
caught him passing it on just 12 minutes later to a contact with ties to the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they had been investigating Faget for a year but wouldn't
say how long they believe he had been passing on classified information. They
also said they were uncertain about the effects of his alleged espionage --
whether any Cubans were prevented from defecting, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget (pronounced fy-EHT'), who was arrested Thursday, is charged with
violating the federal Espionage Act and making false statements to a federal
officer. The first charge carries up to 10 years in prison; the second could
bring five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in court Friday, Faget was ordered held until a bail hearing Feb.
24.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Joel Kaplan would not comment. Nor would Faget's family
members and friends.

<HEADLINE> Broad Winter Storm Packs Punch  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A winter storm that spread sleet and snow from the Midwest to Maine brought
more snow to the Northeast Saturday, while floodwaters caused problems for
residents of several states that got hit with heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire picked up 5 inches of snow Saturday, another 4 inches fell on
Portland, Maine and Boston had an inch and a half of new snow, bringing two-day
totals to about 10 inches in many areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's Logan International airport saw 60 percent of its flights canceled
Friday night. Spokeswoman Georgeane Tacelli said by midafternoon Saturday, there
were no problems outbound and delays of about 35 minutes on incoming planes.
</P>
<P>
	   At Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Northwest Airlines had 17 arriving flights
and eight departing flights canceled Saturday, mostly because of bad weather in
other cities, airline spokesman Matt Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ohio, water in several Ohio River tributaries began to fall after
cresting above flood stage in some areas. But the river was still rising and not
expected to crest until Tuesday afternoon in Cincinnati. Some roads throughout
the region remained closed because of high water and some flood warnings
remained in effect. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Five northeastern Kentucky counties near the Ohio River or its tributaries
were declared disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barring further rainfall, I think the tributaries have done all the damage
they can do at this point,'' Ray Bowman, a spokesman for the Kentucky Division
of Emergency Management. ``The Ohio's a different story, but I don't think it's
going to be too bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three deaths on Friday were blamed on the heavy rain: two motorists drowned
after driving into flooded roads and a woman died when her car hydroplaned on an
interstate.
</P>
<P>
	   West Virginia's Gov. Cecil Underwood declared a state of emergency in 10
counties after heavy rain and flash floods were blamed for three deaths. The
declaration allowed the National Guard to help clear roads, deliver emergency
medication and assist where ambulances or other emergency vehicles could not
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   During a rescue attempt, an inflatable boat capsized on a swollen creek
outside Charleston, W.V., leaving two people dead and another presumed drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   As floodwaters began to recede around the state, residents started returning
home. The American Red Cross had set up at least eight temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   In southwestern Pennsylvania, the rain and melting snow caused flooding that
filled cars and crept up on homes and businesses, sending residents to higher
ground. Homes were evacuated in two counties as flood warnings were issued to
areas on the Monongahela River.
</P>
<P>
	   Some New Yorkers awoke to as much as a foot of snow Saturday, and state
troopers reported hundreds of car accidents, including one in which two people
were killed when their car slid across a highway into the path of a
tractor-trailer.
</P>
<P>
	   The winter storm meant plenty of snow for skiers heading to the slopes for
the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We couldn't have scripted this week any better than this,'' said Dave
Anderson, marketing director of Loon Mountain ski resort in Lincoln, N.H.
``Right now I'm looking out my window at a winter wonderland.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush defeated Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina's Republican presidential primary Saturday, snatching momentum from his
insurgent rival as the race heads into a rapid-fire homestretch with 18 contests
in 17 days. McCain was pugnacious in defeat, declaring, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' said Bush, who was rocked by a landslide defeat in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of his campaign. ``I cannot wait for the next round,''
he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of reform and an
empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a third of the vote counted, Bush had 74,083 votes, or 53 percent to
McCain's 58,787, 42 percent. Alan Keyes ran a faraway third at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among his base supporters -- conservatives and Republicans. Six
out of 10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory earned him the state's 19 at-large delegates with 18 others
to be allocated according to the winner of each congressional district. He now
has 46 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination with
McCain at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have to recover quickly. On Tuesday Republicans
will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of Arizona, and then in
three other states a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct GOP contests that
could settle the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a pre-South carolina poll
by the Detroit Free Press showed the candidates locked in a tight race. Aides
say it will be difficult, if not impossible, for McCain believe the Midwest
state will be friendlier territory than South Carolina. Independents and
conservative Democrats in suburban Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their strategy
for after Michigan. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for
Virginia's 56 delegates on Feb. 29, based on their assumption that the state's
voters are as conservative as those in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Resources they had planned for Virginia will likely now go to Washington
State. another Feb. 29 primary state but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before that. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush
-- with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the
delegates go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to
increase his spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign increased its TV ad buy in Michigan late last week,
matching a recent increase by Bush.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Not Willing To Welcome Diplomat  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba said Saturday that it will not willingly bring home a
Washington-based diplomat targeted for expulsion, and instead will instruct him
to defend himself against accusations of spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba accused the U.S. government of using the espionage issue to try to
block 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's return to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Cuba will not pull back any official,'' Fernando
Remirez, head of the Cuban mission in Washington, said in a statement broadcast
Saturday afternoon at a huge televised rally in eastern Cuba.
</P>

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Tied in Michigan Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The race between John McCain and George W. Bush is too close
to call in Michigan just days before the state's crucial GOP primary, a poll
suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was taken Tuesday through Thursday, before Bush's Saturday victory
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey in Sunday's editions of The Detroit News indicates McCain was
supported by 40 percent and Bush by 38 percent. Five percent said they would
vote for someone else and the other 17 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of 594 likely voters was conducted by Mitchell Research and
Communications Inc. and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   A Detroit News poll a week earlier showed McCain backed by 43 percent of
likely voters while Bush was favored by 34 percent. The latest poll showed
McCain with a huge lead among Democrats and a 30-point lead among independents,
while Bush widened his edge among Republicans to 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary invites all 6.7 million Michigan voters to participate,
no matter which party they prefer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is supported by Michigan Gov. John Engler, increased his lead
among rank-and-file Republicans from 11 to 18-points, with 49 percent saying
they favored Bush and 31 percent favoring McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   As in South Carolina, turnout will be a key question, said News pollster
Steve Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our polling suggests about 65 percent of voters will be Republicans; 20
percent independents and 12 percent Democrats,'' Mitchell said. Both Bush and
McCain plan to campaign in Michigan this holiday weekend.

<HEADLINE> Search for Long-Lost Plane Resumes  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUPUNGATO, Argentina (AP) -- Hoping to solve one of the Andes' great
riddles, army mountaineers set off Saturday to climb the 21,848-foot Tupungato
volcano in search of a British plane that vanished 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two camouflage green army trucks carrying soldiers sped out of an army base
in this mountain town hours from the volcano base, despite cloudy weather
threatening to delay the first day of the trip. The team of Argentine army
officers is on a quest to bring down bodies and pieces of wreckage that may shed
light on the airplane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll drive about four or five hours to reach a smaller camp before trying
to climb up on Sunday,'' said Col. Mario Luis Chretien, who heads the regiment
leading the expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   Successfully recovering the plane's remnants could help solve one of the
longest-running aviation mysteries in the Andes, the mountain range that was a
virtual graveyard for planes during the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   Operated by the now defunct British South American Airways, the plane called
Stardust was carrying 11 people -- five crew members and six passengers -- and
was headed to Santiago, Chile when it vanished during a snowstorm on Aug. 2,
1947. The passengers included three Britons, a German woman, a Palestinian and a
Swiss man.
</P>
<P>
	   The last message from the plane has puzzled aviation investigators for
years. Radio operators in Chile reportedly received a Morse code message reading
``STENDEC'' -- an acronym investigators say has no meaning.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the crash, search teams from England, Chile and Argentina combed
the area by air and on skis but turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Theories abounded about the plane's disappearance. Some speculated it had
been sabotaged to kill a British diplomatic messenger reportedly on board.
</P>
<P>
	   But severe weather was believed by many to have been the cause. Records
indicate heavy snow fell for three days at the time the plane vanished over the
South American mountain chain, and aviation experts said the plane -- a
converted World War II bomber -- did not have de-icing capabilities and was
unfit to travel through frigid conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane and its passengers went undetected for more than five decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But then, in January, five mountaineers climbing through ice fields atop
Tupungato, just east of the Argentine-Chilean border, stumbled across the
remains of the four-engine plane. Argentine army official Alberto Quinones said
the group of climbers discovered pieces of the propeller, wing and fuselage
along with scraps of clothing spread across a two-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinones said the remains of at least three passengers had also been spotted
-- their limbs almost perfectly preserved in year-round subfreezing temperatures
atop Tupungato.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing news of the discovery, authorities quickly arranged the recovery
mission before the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer and the onset of harsh
weather conditions that dominate Tupungato the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very lucky,'' Chretien said. ``With warmer temperatures the past
few years, the glaciers (on the mountain) have been moving quite a bit. That's
how we were able to find the remains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Federico Frugoli said he hoped the remains would be brought down
during the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Frugoli said Argentine army mountaineers and air force personnel have spent
days mapping a path to the upper reaches of the volcano, where the wreckage sits
at 16,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   After acclimating themselves to the high altitude and freezing conditions,
elite mountaineers shadowed by journalists were expected to venture out on the
last leg of the climb -- a rigorous seven-hour mountaineering ascent of the
snowcapped volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   Using ski poles to balance themselves and wearing special cleats, the
climbers will ascend the steep southern face of the volcano -- a side that
rarely sees the sun and whose peak is mostly covered in snow and ice.

<HEADLINE> Bob Hite Dies at Age 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Hite Sr., whose rich baritone voice brought
children scrambling to the radio at the start of The Lone Ranger with a booming:
``From out of the past came the thundering hoof beats of the great horse
Silver!'' has died. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Hite died Friday under the care of Hospice of Palm Beach County, two days
after he slipped into a coma.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a wonderful, generous man,'' journalist Walter Cronkite told The
Tampa Tribune. ``I considered him one of my very closest friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hite, an Indiana native, was a young man in the 1930s when he went to work
at Detroit radio station WXYZ. There, he announced The Lone Ranger and other
radio shows, including the Green Hornet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could read you the phone book and make you want to buy the numbers,''
fellow radioman Dick Osgood wrote in ``Wixy Wonderland,'' a book about WXYZ.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II, Hite worked for CBS in New York City, where he met
Cronkite and kept radio listeners informed about the war with reports from
journalists on the front lines. He also announced the war's end.
</P>
<P>
	   When a young Frank Sinatra appeared with the Tommy Dorsey band for the first
time, Hite introduced him.
</P>
<P>
	   Away from work, Hite spent time sailing on Long Island Sound, and he and
Cronkite often sailed together.
</P>
<P>
	   As Hite's boat would pass, other boaters often yelled out: ``Give us the
ranger. Give us the ranger,'' Cronkite recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   Hite retired from CBS in 1979 and moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his widow, Nancy Boyle Hite, 80, of Sarasota; his son,
Hite Jr., 52; and three daughters, Nancy Speck, 57; Cindy Hite Content, 46; and
Kimberly Schad, 37.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush defeated Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina's Republican presidential primary Saturday, snatching momentum from his
insurgent rival as the race heads into a rapid-fire homestretch with 18 contests
in 17 days. McCain was pugnacious in defeat, declaring, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' said Bush, who was rocked by a landslide defeat in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of his campaign. ``I cannot wait for the next round,''
he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of reform and an
empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a third of the vote counted, Bush had 74,083 votes, or 53 percent to
McCain's 58,787, 42 percent. Alan Keyes ran a faraway third at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among his base supporters -- conservatives and Republicans. Six
out of 10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory earned him the state's 19 at-large delegates with 18 others
to be allocated according to the winner of each congressional district. He now
has 46 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination with
McCain at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have to recover quickly. On Tuesday Republicans
will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of Arizona, and then in
three other states a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct GOP contests that
could settle the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a pre-South carolina poll
by the Detroit Free Press showed the candidates locked in a tight race. Aides
say it will be difficult, if not impossible, for McCain believe the Midwest
state will be friendlier territory than South Carolina. Independents and
conservative Democrats in suburban Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their strategy
for after Michigan. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for
Virginia's 56 delegates on Feb. 29, based on their assumption that the state's
voters are as conservative as those in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Resources they had planned for Virginia will likely now go to Washington
State. another Feb. 29 primary state but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before that. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush
-- with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the
delegates go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to
increase his spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign increased its TV ad buy in Michigan late last week,
matching a recent increase by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed that McCain failed to best Bush on what should have been
his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively recruited
veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man who rides
the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't fare any
better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling, conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP
and television networks, also showed that Bush also was able to turn the tables
on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush were
unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain -- double
the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain said in pugnacious remarks to
supporters. ``He's going to need it my friends for we have just begun to fight
and I cannot wait for the next round. I'm going to fight with every ounce of
strength that I have, but I'm going to keep fighting clean. I'm going to keep
fighting fair. And I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign dismissed the Bush victory, saying the governor couldn't
have won without ads that inflamed South Carolina's influential social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush disagreed. ``I think it's more than social conservatives,'' he said.
``I united the party. I brought elements of the party together. I convinced the
people of this state that I have an agenda that is positive and hopeful and that
I'm a reformer who has good results when given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The voter survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described
conservatives who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters
strongly believed the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and
cited moral values as their top issue. The religious right preferred Bush, as
did people native to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare. Almost a third of the voters
were new GOP primary voters, and they preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   VNS predicted turnout to far exceed the 276,000 who voted in the 1996
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and tore up the GOP playbook to openly court
Democrats and independents. Bush portrayed McCain as more of a hypocrite than a
reformer and his punches landed. McCain was left to proclaim, ``I don't just say
it, I live it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of large-scale defections from GOP establishment
figures if he lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina campaign was a rancorous, negative one.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain opened the contest with two ads comparing Bush's integrity to
President Clinton's. The Texan responded in kind. Polls quickly showed McCain's
approval rating dropping, and he abruptly shifted strategy and pulled the ads
off the air with a promise not to run negative spots again.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush continued his attacks on TV and on the stump, suggesting that the
Arizona senator is a hypocrite on a series of issues including his signature
topic of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative special interests, who consider McCain's reform plans a threat
to their political influence, funded a full-throated assault on the senator
through TV and radio ads, mailings and calls to conservative radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls showed that Bush ended the race considered as much of a reformer as
McCain, a sign that his criticism had stuck.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina's Republican presidential primary was born in 1980, the
brainchild of strategist Lee Atwater who wanted to help elect Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   Atwater convinced state GOP leaders in 1979 that South Carolina could build
its Republican party and reap political importance by dumping the tradition of
picking presidential candidates at state conventions and holding an open, early
primary election.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and independents turned out to help elect Reagan. As McCain
courted those same voters, Bush and his Republican backers accused Democrats of
encouraging participation just to make mischief.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina does not register voters by party and any registered voter
could cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Independents and Democrats historically have not participated in large
numbers. But the state's Democratic primary March 9 was canceled in favor of a
caucus, giving McCain's camp even more reason to appeal across party lines.
</P>
<P>
	   In an example of the tight GOP race, two longtime friends, next-door
neighbors, Saturday breakfast partners, said they were splitting their votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Wells, 65, said: ``I like John McCain, but he said some things that he
wants to do that are going to be impossible to do. To make all the changes in
lobbying and all that, I don't think either party will let him do that.
</P>
<P>
	   Of Bush: ``I think he represents all of America, and he's a good family
man.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Ragsdale, 71, retired Air Force chief master sergeant, said voting for
McCain, a storied ex-POW and Naval officer, would allow veterans ``a chance to
get back at a group that would elect someone who would to a degree dodge the
draft,'' speaking of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel that either of the Republican candidates have a good chance of
going all the way,'' he said, adding that no matter who prevails, ``I'm hoping
at the national convention they can patch it all up.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Conservatives Drive Bush Win  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Conservatives, especially the religious right, drove
George W. Bush's victory in the South Carolina Republican primary Saturday. The
Texas governor also poked holes in challenger John McCain's reformer image, exit
polls found.
</P>
<P>
	   Another key for Bush: He won back his party's core. Bush lost the New
Hampshire's leadoff GOP primary Feb. 1 in part because self-described
Republicans only narrowly favored him over McCain, who has drawn his strongest
support from independents and crossover Democrats. But in South Carolina, Bush
took roughly 70 percent of those who call themselves Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   The party faithful offset a slightly larger than usual turnout of Democrats
and independents in the South Carolina GOP's open primary, according to exit
polling by Voter News Service for The Associated Press and television networks.
Democrats were 9 percent of the electorate, compared to 5 percent in the 1996
South Carolina GOP primary, and 80 percent of them backed McCain, who also won
60 percent of independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush runs with strong backing from the Republican establishment. While a
majority of exit poll respondents said they preferred a candidate who is not
tied to party leaders, Bush won three quarters of the remainder who said they
favor someone loyal to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey indicated that as the campaign turned sharply negative after the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, Bush's attacks hurt McCain. They also suggest the
Arizona senator may have hurt himself with attacks on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, just 15 percent of voters viewed McCain unfavorably; that
increased to 30 percent in South Carolina. Bush's favorable rating rose from 60
percent to 73 percent. And more voters said McCain attacked Bush unfairly than
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was leaning to McCain until he compared Bush to Bill Clinton, and that
poisoned him for me,'' Willis Cox, of Florence said. ``They were both negative,
but no stone was thrown like that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issues McCain hoped would sway independents and Democrats failed to
register strongly enough to overcome the state's conservative, establishment
tilt. Only 1 in 20 said campaign finance reform, a centerpiece of McCain's
message, was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush succeeded in neutralizing McCain's emphasis on that issue with his new
line of attack in the past week, accusing McCain of saying one thing but doing
another when it comes to campaign finance. More than 4 in 10 voters agreed with
Bush on that.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit poll found that more than a third of voters said moral values was
the most important issue for them, and Bush won more than half of them. He also
won 8 in 10 of those who said they voted based on the candidate who best
represented their conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two-thirds of voters Saturday called themselves conservative, and
Bush won more than 6 in 10 of them. Bush ran especially strongly among those who
called themselves ``very conservative.'' A third called themselves part of the
religious right, and Bush won two-thirds of their votes. Bush also drew strong
support from abortion foes, who made up 60 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who did not call themselves part of the religious right, a
majority supported McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing decisively to McCain in New Hampshire, Bush changed his message
to ``reformer with results'' -- and it apparently worked. Six in 10 voters said
Bush is a real reformer, while little more than half considered that term fit
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analysts said McCain erred by airing ads that compared Bush to
President Clinton. A quarter of those who voted for McCain said he unfairly
attacked Bush. Just 15 percent of Bush voters said they thought his attacks
against McCain were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That probably helped deep six him in the last week,'' said Neal Thigpen, a
Francis Marion University political scientist and McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results were from interviews of 2,078 voters in 40 precincts around
South Carolina. The margin of sampling error was plus of minus 3 percentage
points, larger for subgroups.

Kemper Diehl
</P>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Kemper Diehl, who became one of Texas' most respected
journalists, died Friday after a battle with prostate cancer. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Diehl began his newspaper career in 1939 as a cub reporter for the San
Antonio Light and retired in 1996 after a 32-year run with the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
	   Diehl wrote a 1985 biography on former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros,
which he co-wrote with former San Antonio Express-News colleague Jan Jarboe
Russell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kemper Diehl was one of the great Texas reporters. He had the respect of
everybody in both political parties. He was honest. He was straightforward, and
no one ever accused him of throwing a curve ball. I loved the man and respected
him greatly,'' former President Bush said by phone from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Diehl was a third-generation newspaperman.
</P>
<P>
	   His grandfather, Col. Charles S. Diehl , a co-owner of the defunct San
Antonio Light, covered the Indian campaigns in the 1870s against the Sioux and
Sitting Bull. His father, Chandler Diehl, also worked for the Light. Diehl's
first newspaper job was at the Light, where he covered City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   In his last political column, which was published in 1996 for the San
Antonio Express-News, Diehl recalled his days as a cub reporter earning $16 a
week.
</P>
<P>
	   He served as assistant city editor of the Light before moving to the San
Antonio Express-News in 1964 as a political writer and columnist.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include two sons, Jackson Diehl, is assistant managing editor of
national news for the Washington Post; Dr. Andrew Diehl of San Antonio; and six
grandchildren.
Ken Dugan
</P>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ken Dugan, who coached David Lipscomb University to
two NAIA baseball championships over 37 seasons, died Friday from complications
of Parkinson's disease. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
	   Dugan had also been suffering respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Dugan won NAIA championships in 1977 and 1979. He retired in 1996 due to ill
health.
John C. Gardiner
</P>
<P>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- John C. Gardiner, who ran a tennis ranch popular
with U.S. presidents and celebrities, died Tuesday of complications from heart
surgery. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, as well as stars John
Wayne, Cary Grant and Lucille Ball, all batted around tennis balls at John
Gardiner's Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardiner also ran a tennis ranch in Scottsdale, Ariz., and held tennis
clinics across the country, but he was best known for his idyllic 25-acre
Monterey County ranch, which had 14 tennis courts and 14 cottages.
</P>
<P>
	   Other luminaries to have played at Gardiner's ranch included: Richard Nixon,
Allen Greenspan, Jimmy Stewart, Shirley Temple, Kirk Douglas, Eva Gabor, Gene
Hackman, Johnny Carson and Clint Eastwood.
Bob Hite Sr.
</P>
<P>
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Hite Sr., whose rich baritone voice
brought children scrambling to the radio at the start of ``The Lone Ranger''
with a booming: ``From out of the past came the thundering hoof beats of the
great horse Silver!'' died Friday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Hite, an Indiana native, was a young man in the 1930s when he went to work
at Detroit radio station WXYZ. There, he announced ``The Lone Ranger'' and other
radio shows, including the Green Hornet.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II, Hite worked for CBS in New York City, where he met
Walter Cronkite and kept radio listeners informed about the war with reports
from journalists on the front lines. He also announced the war's end.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a wonderful, generous man,'' Cronkite told The Tampa Tribune. ``I
considered him one of my very closest friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   When a young Frank Sinatra appeared with the Tommy Dorsey band for the first
time, Hite introduced him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hite retired from CBS in 1979 and moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, his son and three daughters.
Helen Lane
</P>
<P>
	   CROSSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Helen Lane, an East Tennessee housewife whose
weather predictions based on woolly worms and corn shucks gained national
attention, died Thursday after suffering from bone cancer. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane learned the old-fashioned forecasting tactics from her father, a
Cumberland County farmer. In the 1940s she began predicting the weather,
particularly in the winter, based on the color of woolly worms, the thickness of
corn shucks and the number of fogs in August.
</P>
<P>
	   When one of her predictions published in the Crossville Chronicle came true
after the winter of 1959-60, which brought 6 feet of snow to the area, Lane
became a media darling.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, every summer for nearly four decades, reporters from across the
state would seek her view on the upcoming winter.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years Lane's health problems made forecasting more difficult. She
relied on relatives and friends to look for spiders spinning their webs on the
ground (a sign of a bad winter) or hornets building their nests high (a sign of
a mild winter).
Henry MacLeod
</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Henry MacLeod, a lifetime Seattle Times employee who retired
as managing editor in 1975, died Friday of pneumonia. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times won two Pulitzers during MacLeod's tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, MacLeod saw his son, Alex, become The Times' managing editor and
his daughter, Mimi, become an executive assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Tacoma, he entered Washington State College in Pullman. When his
father died, he and his mother moved to Seattle, where he graduated from the
University of Washington in 1931.
</P>
<P>
	   MacLeod initially worked as a ``press agent'' for the city's Parks
Department. Hoping to break into the newspaper business, he wrote sports stories
free for The Seattle Times for a few months until a sportswriter quit and he
made it to the payroll.
</P>
<P>
	   He became sports editor when he was still in his 20s and a few years later
was named city editor. He became managing editor in 1959.
</P>
<P>
	   MacLeod won the 1976 Susan Hutchinson Bosch Award, which acknowledges
``professional excellence and personal humanity'' in journalists. He served six
years on the board of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association and was
a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the son and daughter, survivors include another son and two
daughters.
Martin Weissman
</P>
<P>
	   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Martin Weissman, better known as ``Trader Jon,'' was
never in the Navy, but he was renowned among naval aviators for serving up
cheer, loyalty and friendship at his ramshackle saloon.
</P>
<P>
	   The proprietor of Trader Jon's for nearly half a century died Friday at the
age of 84. He never fully recovered from a 1997 stroke that left him partly
paralyzed and with impaired speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Trader Jon's was a fixture for aviators from Pensacola Naval Air Station,
the Navy's training headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The impish Weissman treated everyone with equal affection, from raw recruits
to war heroes, astronauts and celebrities, retired Vice Adm. Jack Fetterman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a loving, caring guy who never said anything bad about anybody,''
Fetterman recalled. ``You talk about bonding, and you talk about brotherhood,
and you talk about what naval aviation was all about. Trader kind of provided
that foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weissman was an honorary flight leader of the Blue Angels precision flying
team, based at Pensacola, and they would sometimes give him rides in their jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York City native opened Trader Jon's in 1953 in an old brick
building, once a ship chandlery, on Pensacola's waterfront after serving in the
Army and tending bar in Miami and Key West.
Miles White
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Miles White, a costume designer for Rodgers and
Hammerstein's first two Broadway hits, ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Carousel,'' died on
Thursday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   In a career that touched seven decades, White also worked on dozens of other
musicals, movies, ballets, ice shows and circuses.
</P>
<P>
	   He moved freely among periods, places and modes of dress, outfitting
cowboys, showgirls, circus performers and rock stars.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, he used an old mail-order catalog to create a realistic look for
``Oklahoma!'' patterning the show's outfits after those the state's citizens
might have once selected themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   That year, White also worked on ``Ziegfeld Follies,'' which featured Milton
Berle. Two years later, he worked with Rodgers and Hammerstein again, creating
the New England costumes for ``Carousel.''
</P>
<P>
	   White received an Academy Award nomination for his work on the Cecil B. de
Mille film ``The Greatest Show on Earth.''

<HEADLINE> Who Voted in South Carolina and Why  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some preliminary findings from exit polls of voters in the South Carolina
GOP primary:
</P>
<P>
	   HOW BUSH WON: George W. Bush won a substantial majority of Republicans and
conservatives to overwhelm John McCain's attempt to pull together a coalition of
moderate, independents and Democrats. Almost six of 10 said they wanted a
candidate loyal to Republican leaders, and that group went overwhelmingly for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush successfully turned the tables on McCain on the issues of negative
campaigning and reform. Almost half said McCain attacked Bush unfairly, while a
third said Bush did that to McCain. And more said they saw Bush as the real
reformer, though McCain made that the centerpiece of his campaign. In fact,
nearly half of voters agreed with Bush's claim that McCain says one thing but
does another when it comes to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH SUPPORTERS: Bush found his strongest support among Republicans,
conservatives, conservative Christians, abortion opponents and those who think
he is the Republican candidate most likely to win in November. Bush also did
well among those who had voted in a previous Republican primary and South
Carolina natives. Almost four of five Bush supporters were Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN SUPPORTERS: McCain found his strongest support among older voters,
independents, veterans, new voters, those with post-graduate education,
self-described moderates and those who said their financial situation was better
than four years ago. He also found support among those who did not consider
themselves part of the religious right and those born outside South Carolina.
More than four of 10 McCain voters were independent, more than a third were
Republican and one of five was Democratic. He won among the 30 percent who said
they were first-time GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   WHO VOTED: Six of 10 voters said they were Republican and two thirds of them
voted for Bush. And slightly more six of 10 said they were conservative and
again, almost two-thirds of them voted for Bush. Four of 10 voters were
non-Republican, about the same mix as in many of the pre-election polls. Only
one of 10 was a Democrat, a group that went for McCain by better than a 4-to-1
margin. McCain was up by more than 20 points among independents, but Bush had
almost a 40-point advantage among Republicans. In 1996, about three of 10 voters
in the South Carolina primary were non-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW HAMPSHIRE CONTRAST: In New Hampshire, McCain ran close to Bush among
Republicans and had a 40-point edge among independents. When New Hampshire
voters were asked which candidate says what he believes instead of what people
want to hear, half said McCain and fewer than a fifth picked Bush. In South
Carolina, just over half felt that both McCain and Bush say what they believe.
</P>
<P>
	   DECISION TIME: A third of voters say they made their decision in the final
week, and Bush won more than half of those votes, while McCain got more than a
third of them.
</P>
<P>
	   VETERANS: More than a fourth of voters said they were veterans and they
split equally between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ELECTABILITY: Bush was seen by a majority of voters, almost six in 10, as
the candidate most likely to win in November, and that group voted
overwhelmingly for Bush. In New Hampshire, voters named Bush and McCain about
equally when asked that question.
</P>
<P>
	   ISSUES: The top issue for South Carolina voters this year was moral values,
chosen by almost four out of 10, followed by Social Security and then taxes.
Four years ago, economic issues were dominant -- taxes, the economy and jobs,
and the deficit were all close to the top. Only one in 20 said campaign finance
reform was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   CONFEDERATE FLAG: People were about evenly divided on whether the
Confederate flag should be flown over the South Carolina capitol. Those who said
'yes' were inclined to vote for Bush, while those who said ``no'' tended to vote
for McCain. Christian conservatives, South Carolina natives and those who
considered themselves very conservative strongly supported flying the flag.
Sentiment for flying the flag dropped among those with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   CANDIDATE CHOICE: An overwhelming majority of people were satisfied with
their choice of candidates in 2000, with almost nine of 10 saying they were
happy with the current choice. Four years ago, half were satisfied and almost
that many dissatisfied with their choice in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH KNOWLEDGE: More than a fifth of voters said they don't think Bush has
the knowledge to serve effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. VNS surveyed 2,078 voters as they
came out of precincts Saturday. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Man Found Bound in Burned Frat House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Firefighters rescued a man who was bound with duct
tape and barricaded inside a fraternity guest room during a blaze early Saturday
that caused extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was injured in the fire at the Sigma Nu fraternity house at
Washington State University, but 20 students had to be evacuated from the
building, said Fire Department spokesman Glenn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was tentatively attributed to a candle left burning on the
windowsill in a resident's room, said fire Capt. Richard Dragoo.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters checking the house to make sure everyone had been evacuated
found one man well away from the fire but with his wrists and ankles bound with
duct tape and the door barricaded with furniture.
</P>
<P>
	   The college is investigating ``the highly inappropriate behavior of taping
the body and feet of a fraternity member and leaving him in a guest room in the
house,'' the school's interim provost, Rom Markin, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said the wing where the fire broke out was burned to the point it
was uninhabitable. He said the wing was built in 1968, before city fire codes
required sprinklers, and the building does not have a sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
	   Markin's statement said the university was ``launching an immediate
investigation into all aspects of fraternity-house fire safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fraternity's vice president, Josh Knowles, did not immediately return a
phone call for comment Saturday.

</P>
<P>
	   Hite died Friday under the care of Hospice of Palm Beach County, two days

<HEADLINE> Cuba Not Willing To Welcome Diplomat  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba said Saturday that it will not willingly bring home a
Washington-based diplomat targeted for expulsion, and instead will instruct him
to defend himself against accusations of spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba accused the U.S. government of using the espionage issue to try to
block 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's return to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Cuba will not pull back any official,'' Fernando
Remirez, head of the Cuban mission in Washington, said in a statement broadcast
Saturday afternoon at a huge televised rally in eastern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the government would recommend that the Cuban official ``remain in
United States territory to give testimony and demonstrate the total falseness of
this accusation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez statement was the first official reaction here to the U.S. State
Department's announcement earlier in the day that it had ordered the expulsion
of a Cuban diplomat linked to a Cuban-born U.S. Immigration official arrested in
Miami on spy charges. The diplomat, whose name was not released, was given seven
days to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   President Fidel Castro, Remirez, and other top members of the communist
government leadership were among the tens of thousands in the audience at the
rally in Santiago called to press for the return of the 6-year-old to his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war since Nov. 25
when he was rescued off the coast of Florida. His mother and 10 others perished
in the sea journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This (the expulsion) takes place exactly 3 1/2 days before the hearing in
federal court in South Florida that must analyze and make a decision about the
motion by the kidnappers of the boy Elian Gonzalez against the decision by the
INS in favor of his return,'' Remirez statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very clear and impossible to hide the attempt to strongly pressure
and influence the federal judge's decision with this desperate and spectacular
maneuver,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Restores Bush As Front-Runner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By DAVID ESPO  AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Carolina Republicans have a history of choosing
front-runners over insurgents and the stakes had never been higher than the
clash between George W. Bush, scion of the establishment, and John McCain, its
scourge. The establishment won Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina restored Bush's front-runner credentials, so badly shattered
in New Hampshire. The defeat leaves McCain in need of a new bounce to keep his
campaign alive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor pieced together his triumph the time-tested way. He ran
strongest among staunch Republicans, the very conservative, abortion opponents,
members of the religious right and Palmetto State natives.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the voters said they preferred a candidate who was loyal to
the Republican Party, and Bush won their support by an overwhelming margin of
4-1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who stunned Bush with a double-digit victory in New Hampshire two
weeks ago, ran best among independents, moderates and those who were not native
to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The state was a pivot point for both men. Just ahead is a three-week string
of primaries that will likely decide the winner in the nomination battle.
Without momentum, McCain is at a disadvantage against Bush's 50-state
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that with a win in South Carolina, there'd be no stopping him --
and not many Republicans had the stomach for arguing with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush looked to South Carolina -- the first of several campaign firewalls he
claims around the country -- to slow his rival, but also to steady the nerves of
his supporters in Congress and elsewhere in the GOP establishment. Without
naming names, he derided some of his supporters last week as weak-kneed for
fearing his campaign was about to unravel.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolinians have been here before, even if Bush and McCain have not.
The state's GOP voters embraced George Bush in 1988 and 1992, after he had been
scared in earlier contests. And it served as a Bob Dole firewall in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The balloting marked the culmination of a tough 18-day campaign, one in
which Bush successfully co-opted McCain's message as a reformer of the political
system by stressing his credentials as a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks
showed about 23 percent of the voters said Bush was the real reformer in the
race. McCain was chosen by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the same polls show that Bush benefitted from the
perception among the voters that McCain had unfairly attacked him. Almost half
the voters said McCain had unfairly attacked the Texas governor. Only one-third
said Bush had attacked unfairly.
</P>
<P>
	   In retrospect, negative advertising seems to have been a key tactical issue,
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Angered by an attack on him by a veteran campaigning for Bush, McCain
authorized negative commercials, including one that said the Texas governor
twisted the truth like Bill Clinton. Then, when his internal polls showed
support eroding, he ordered the ads stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   But that left Bush free to run all the negative commercials he wanted
without risk of retaliation -- at the same time he complained that McCain had
sullied his reputation by likening him to Clinton. ``That's about as low a blow
as you can give in a Republican primary,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides, a close-knit group, disagree on who advocated the first
negative commercials and how sharply worded they should be -- a sign that the
strategy was not as successful as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   In victory, neither Bush nor his surrogates claimed the nomination was
theirs. At the same time, Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Bush's liaison to the
House, said, ``It will be hard for McCain to transition from this two-state
strategy into a 50-state effort without a boost of energy like he got in New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan votes in two days' time, the first of the classic general election
swing states to hold a primary. That makes it a critical test of McCain's claim
to be the more electable of the two contenders. And he's up against a different
kind of firewall in the state, one erected by Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina outcome had an immediate impact on Virginia, which votes
on Feb. 29. It was not in McCain's original playbook -- that called for
victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan, followed by California
on March 7. But he had a modest effort under way in the Old Dominion, with a
large military and retired retired military population, and was ready to
reevaluate his plans if South Carolina had gone his way. Instead, aides decided
to shift resources to Washington, which votes the same day, and not make a
serious play for Virginia's 56 delegates.

<HEADLINE> Mexico School Activists Seize Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Angered by the arrest of students and supporters,
activists in a rural school dispute surrounded dozens of unarmed police officers
and held them in a town plaza on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The confrontation followed a growing dispute between activists and
administrators at the El Mexe teachers' college in Tepatepec, a town 50 miles
north of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of officers being held was unclear. Hidalgo state Gov. Manuel
Angel Nunez confirmed that ``about 40 police officers had been seized by
protesters.'' But protest spokesman Victor Soto said by telephone they were
holding 65 officers. And the state Notimex news agency said the at least 50
officers were being held and had been stripped of their shirts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are asking for their return, in good health in all senses,'' Nunez said
in an interview distributed by the state government.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute at the school increased when students demanded the ouster of
administrators, whom Soto claimed had ties to state officials profiting from the
proceeds of the school's lands. The students then began occupying the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Around dawn Saturday, government officials said the police entered the
school and held 176 students inside for questioning.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Three Soldiers Hurt in Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Guerrillas based in Iraq attacked a border post in
western Iran, injuring three soldiers, the state television reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the guerrillas fired bullets from across the border on Friday night
but fled when Iranian forces returned fire. The attack took place in Kermanshah
district, the television said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   The television did not give any details beyond saying that three soldiers
were injured. The border area is 375 miles west of the capital, Tehran.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the attack was carried out by ``the hypocrites,'' a term the
government uses for the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a fax sent to The Associated Press in Cairo, the Mujahedeen Khalq claimed
responsibility for attacks in the region, saying ``large numbers of enemy forces
were killed or wounded.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group seeks the overthrow of Iran's Islamic government. It has more than
30,000 men and women with military training in camps in Iraq near the Iranian
border.

<HEADLINE> Man Found Bound in Frat Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Firefighters rescued a man who was bound with duct
tape and barricaded inside a fraternity guest room during a blaze early Saturday
that caused extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was injured in the fire at the Sigma Nu fraternity house at
Washington State University, but 20 students had to be evacuated from the
building, said Fire Department spokesman Glenn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was tentatively attributed to a candle left burning on the
windowsill in a resident's room, said fire Capt. Richard Dragoo.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters checking the house to make sure everyone had been evacuated
found one man well away from the fire but with his wrists and ankles bound with
duct tape and the door barricaded with furniture.
</P>
<P>
	   The college is investigating ``the highly inappropriate behavior of taping
the body and feet of a fraternity member and leaving him in a guest room in the
house,'' the school's interim provost, Rom Markin, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said the wing where the fire broke out was burned to the point it
was uninhabitable. He said the wing was built in 1968, before city fire codes
required sprinklers, and the building does not have a sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
	   Markin's statement said the university was ``launching an immediate
investigation into all aspects of fraternity-house fire safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fraternity's vice president, Josh Knowles, did not immediately return a
phone call for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pledges Health Center Help  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill Bradley, on a campaign visit to a neighborhood health
clinic, said Saturday all Americans should enjoy primary and preventive care in
such intimate and accessible settings.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley said his plan for universal health care would reduce the number
of people forced to wait for treatment until they are so sick they need
emergency-room care.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Country Doctor Community Health Center, Bradley chatted briefly with
patient Kendall Seale-Diakhate, who praised the care she received while pregnant
with her 7-month-old daughter, Hafsah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a small-town feeling,'' she said. ``You're not treated like cattle.
You're treated like a person.''
</P>
<P>
	   The clinic, which gets 40,000 patient visits a year, uses a sliding fee
schedule to serve predominantly low-income and uninsured people in Seattle's
Capitol Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised that, as president, he would make ``a major investment in
community health clinics like this one.''
</P>
<P>
	   He says his overall health-care plan, with an estimated annual price tag of
$65 billion, would ensure near-universal access to affordable health coverage by
subsidizing premiums for children and adults in low- to middle-income families
and by offering everyone a tax break for premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, also
recommends changing the nation's health-care system but wants it done
``carefully, realistically, and step-by-step.'' His own wide-ranging package of
reforms is aimed at bringing millions of uninsured Americans, and eventually
every child in the nation, into the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   Later on Saturday, Bradley previewed one line of argument he pursue Monday
in a debate with Gore in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley noted that Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign is trying to
say Republican New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has not always fully favored
abortion rights. Bradley says the same of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm saying on choice is similar to what Hillary Clinton is saying on
Giuliani,'' Bradley said in a satellite interview with an Albany, N.Y.
television station. ``It's important to have a person who's been consistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   And still later, at a rally in St. Louis, Bradley suggested to his
supporters that Texas Gov. George Bush's victory over Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina opens the way for his own campaign to make a renewed pitch for some of
the independent and moderate Democratic voters who have been moving into the
McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we're back,'' Bradley said. ``We're able to make the case that we're
out there to get all the votes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The clinic Bradley visited on a balmy morning is on the corner of 19th
Avenue and, as luck would have it, Republican Street. Bradley noted the
coincidence but insisted, ``what we're talking about is a core Democratic
principle, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
	   After losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bradley is hoping for a boost in
Washington state's Feb. 29 primary, which does not count in assigning delegates
to the convention but is the only contest before 16 states hold primaries and
caucuses on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, the first elected official to endorse Bradley at
the start of his campaign, urged a crowd of 75 outside the clinic to ``do for
Bill Bradley what New Hampshire did for John McCain'' -- that is, provide the
sort of upset victory that fueled McCain's Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, a physician and Bradley supporter who joined him
in Seattle, said it is unacceptable that 44 million uninsured Americans get
health care in emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot solve the health-care crisis unless everyone is inside the
tent,'' Kitzhaber said. ``Of all the candidates in this race, only Bill Bradley
has recognized that and has put together a comprehensive health care plan built
around the premise that each and every American should have access to affordable
health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign said a recent analysis by the UCLA Center for Health
Policy Research estimated 11.6 million uninsured adults between the ages of 19
and 64 who have no children and earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level. It
said Bradley's plan would make almost 9.4 million of them eligible for
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   In the state of Washington, the campaign said, Gore's plan would insure
565,000 fewer people than Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore's campaign, said an Emory University
study showed Bradley's plan covers only about 1 percent more of the population
than Gore's plan but costs three times as much.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the clinic, Bradley attacked Gore directly. ``In Congress he was
against national health insurance,'' Bradley said. ``When he joined the Clinton
administration, he was for the Clinton administration approach (for universal
coverage). And now he's for a step-by-step approach that is really nibbling
around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about that, Hattaway said, ``Al Gore shares the goal of achieving
universal health insurance but is going about it in a much more realistic way.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into 18-state sprint over 17
days. McCain was pugnacious in defeat, declaring, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of his campaign. ``I cannot wait for the next round,''
he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of reform and an
empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 64 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 181,534 votes, or 54 percent
to McCain's 140,032, or 41 percent. Alan Keyes ran a faraway third at 5 percent.
The dramatic campaign produced a record turnout, but it didn't help McCain as he
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed his victory here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months
his campaign has seen South Carolina as a ``firewall'' state whose traditional
Republican constituencies could blunt any damage from the chars of New
Hampshire. The Texas governor had a huge lead in early polling but McCain closed
the gap in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory earned him at least 25 of the state's 38 delegates and now
has 52 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain is
at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit Free
Press showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if
not impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates on Feb. 29, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29
primary state but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign increased its TV ad buy in Michigan late last week,
matching a recent increase by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round. I'm going to fight with every ounce of strength that I have, but I'm
going to keep fighting clean. I'm going to keep fighting fair. And I'm going to
keep fighting the battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign dismissed the Bush victory, saying the governor couldn't
have won without ads that inflamed South Carolina's influential social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush disagreed. ``I think it's more than social conservatives,'' he said.
``I united the party. I brought elements of the party together. I convinced the
people of this state that I have an agenda that is positive and hopeful and that
I'm a reformer who has good results when given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and cited moral values
as their top issue. The religious right preferred Bush, as did people native to
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare. Almost a third of the voters
were new GOP primary voters, and they preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and tore up the GOP playbook to openly court
Democrats and independents. Bush portrayed McCain as more of a hypocrite than a
reformer and his punches landed. McCain was left to proclaim, ``I don't just say
it, I live it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Adirondack Avalanche Kills One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- A rare avalanche in northern New York's Adirondacks
killed one skier and injured five others Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The avalanche occurred about 1 p.m. on the northeast side of Wright Peak, on
the outskirts of Lake Placid, Department of Environmental Conservation forest
rangers said. Toma Jacob Vracarich, 27, of Lake Placid was found buried beneath
the snow about five hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This area is not on the beaten path,'' said Wesley Hurd, a forest ranger.
``That's totally legal, but if people are going to do this, they have to be
aware of what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rangers said avalanches are unusual in New York and Saturday's slide may
have occurred because heavy rain during Hurricane Floyd saturated the vegetation
and soil, pulling them away and making the mountainside slick.
</P>
<P>
	   The region also has been hit hard by recent snowstorms. Skiers have reported
wandering into snow that reached up to their armpits and searchers had to use
'avalanche poles' to poke through snow drifts to find Vracarich.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been doing this for 26 years,'' Hurd said, ``and this is the first
one (avalanche) I've ever had anything to do with that had any people
involved.''

McCain, Bush Tied in Michigan Poll
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The race between John McCain and George W. Bush is too close
to call in Michigan just days before the state's crucial GOP primary, a poll
suggests. The poll was taken Tuesday through Thursday, before Bush's victory
today in South Carolina. The survey in tomorrow's editions of The Detroit News
indicates McCain was supported by 40 percent and Bush by 38 percent. Five
percent said they would vote for someone else and the other 17 percent were
undecided. The poll of 594 likely voters was conducted by Mitchell Research and
Communications Inc. and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

Cuba Not Willing To Welcome Diplomat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba said today that it will not willingly bring home a
Washington-based diplomat targeted for expulsion, and instead will instruct him
to defend himself against accusations of spying. Cuba accused the U.S.
government of using the espionage issue to try to block 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez's return to his communist homeland. That was the first official
reaction here to the U.S. State Department's announcement earlier in the day
that it had ordered the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat linked to a Cuban-born
U.S. Immigration official arrested in Miami on spy charges. It was not
immediately clear what procedures would be followed if the diplomat, indeed,
refused to leave voluntarily.

Man Found Bound in Burned Frat House
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Firefighters rescued a man who was bound with duct
tape and barricaded inside a fraternity guest room during a blaze early today
that caused extensive damage. No one was injured in the fire at the Sigma Nu
fraternity house at Washington State University, but 20 students had to be
evacuated from the building, said Fire Department spokesman Glenn Johnson. The
fire was tentatively attributed to a candle left burning on the windowsill in a
resident's room, said fire Capt. Richard Dragoo. Firefighters checking the house
to make sure everyone had been evacuated found one man well away from the fire
but with his wrists and ankles bound with duct tape and the door barricaded with
furniture.

Mexico School Activists Seize Police
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Angered by the arrest of students and supporters,
activists in a rural school dispute surrounded dozens of unarmed police officers
and held them in a town plaza today. The confrontation followed a growing
dispute between activists and administrators at the El Mexe teachers' college in
Tepatepec, a town 50 miles north of Mexico City. The number of officers being
held was unclear. Hidalgo state Gov. Manuel Angel Nunez confirmed that "about 40
police officers had been seized by protesters." But protest spokesman Victor
Soto said by telephone they were holding 65 officers. And the state Notimex news
agency said the at least 50 officers were being held and had been stripped of
their shirts.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Guerrillas based in Iraq attacked a border post in
western Iran, injuring three soldiers, the state television reported Saturday.
It said the guerrillas fired bullets from across the border on Friday night but
fled when Iranian forces returned fire. The attack took place in Kermanshah
district, the television said without elaborating. The television did not give
any details beyond saying that three soldiers were injured. The border area is
375 miles west of the capital, Tehran.

Glendon Alexander scored 18 as No. 8 Oklahoma State moved back into a tie for
the Big 12 lead with a 94-55 victory over Nebraska tonight. The Cowboys (21-3,
10-2) are tied with Iowa State and Texas for the conference lead, with a tough
week ahead. They travel to Missouri on Monday night -- the Tigers are in fourth
place in the league -- and play at Iowa State today.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supporters Bask in S.C. Win  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON and MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A victorious roar went up inside George W. Bush's
hotel suite Saturday night and the Texas governor wore a lip-busting grin.
Seated between his wife, Laura, and South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins
on a wraparound couch, he savored his victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I knew we had a tough fight here,'' Bush said moments before John McCain
called to concede the Republican primary, and as the governor, his family and
friends celebrated with soft drinks in front of a television as the news came
in. ``I knew we were in a major battle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hot victory felt better than his cold defeat in New Hampshire to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got knocked down in the snows and I knocked the snow off my suit and I
came down to South Carolina,'' he said, still wearing his blue pinstripe. ``I
looked at my leaders and I said, `Just put me in front of the people. We're
going to win this state.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   A small, restrained crowd milled around McCain's party before he arrived,
sipping drinks and asking themselves what happened, as a happier crowd flew by
on their way to a concert hall next door.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to the good party,'' said Mike Mallard, of Charleston, as he
and his pals headed to a concert headlined by ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain? Yeah, I like him ...'' said Terry Ford, of Charleston, who said he
was a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   He grinned a bit when asked if he'd voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was too busy working on my car,'' he said. ``Going to be a great concert
though.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   At his non-victory party, a smiling McCain pumped up supporters with a
high-energy rally and a battle cry to carry on: ``Our crusade grows stronger!''
he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas,'' he added as shouts and
cheers interrupted his speech and American flags waved amid a sea of supporters
several hundred strong.
</P>
<P>
	   He plunged into the crowd and came up smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On to Michigan,'' he cried before heading to his campaign bus and the next
stop in his crusade.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Over 500 people turned out at the Bush victory party at the Columbia
Sheraton Hotel and Convention Center and they were served a reminder from the
early days of the campaign: hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   The all-American food was a staple of early Bush fund-raisers, when the
campaign was portraying an image of frugality. Of course, that was before the
Bush money machine spent $50 million of the $70 million it raised even before
New Hampshire voters went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanie Killey of Columbia, a niece of Sen. Strom Thurmond, one of Bush's big
backers in the state, said she was relieved by the outcome and now could finally
get some rest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was losing sleep all week over this. I thought the Democrats were going
to get their people to come out and sabotage our selection of a Republican
candidate,'' Killey said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Balloons, banners and buffet tables were in place at Alan Keyes' party at
the Clarion Townhouse in downtown Columbia. But there was no one there to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
	   A half dozen people -- two national campaign coordinators for Keyes --
simply stood and waited.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bush had checked in with his father, calling on a cell
phone from the tarmac at the airport in Greenville. ``Dad's real nervous,'' the
younger Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to his election rally, flying from Greenville to Columbia, a
flight attendant shut the curtain between the first- and coach-class cabins on
Bush's campaign plane, but the barrier didn't block the sound of hearty laughter
from spilling over the divider.
</P>
<P>
	   Staffers munched on pizza brought aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The first confirmation that Bush might win came just after 1 p.m., when the
governor's chief political strategist, Karl Rove, pulled him aside on the tarmac
at Columbia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   A howling wind drowned out the words, but Bush thrust his right index finger
into the sky -- the universal No. 1 sign -- as Rove told him he had learned that
McCain was already conceding defeat to his staff. A half hour later, Rove told
Bush that exit polls showed he would win.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked if I thought the numbers would hold and settled down for a power
nap,'' the strategist recalled. ``And then he went for a run.''

<HEADLINE> Who Voted in South Carolina and Why  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some preliminary findings from exit polls of voters in the South Carolina
GOP primary:
</P>
<P>
	   HOW BUSH WON: George W. Bush won a substantial majority of Republicans and
conservatives to overwhelm John McCain's attempt to pull together a coalition of
moderate, independents and Democrats. Almost six of 10 Republicans said they
wanted a candidate loyal to Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush successfully turned the tables on McCain on the issues of negative
campaigning and reform. Almost half said McCain attacked Bush unfairly, while a
third said Bush did that to McCain. And more said they saw Bush as the real
reformer, though McCain made that the centerpiece of his campaign. In fact,
nearly half of voters agreed with Bush's claim that McCain says one thing but
does another when it comes to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH SUPPORTERS: Bush found his strongest support among Republicans,
conservatives, conservative Christians, abortion opponents and those who think
he is the Republican candidate most likely to win in November. Bush also did
well among those who had voted in a previous Republican primary and South
Carolina natives. Almost four of five Bush supporters were Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN SUPPORTERS: McCain found his strongest support among older voters,
independents, veterans, new voters, those with post-graduate education,
self-described moderates and those who said their financial situation was better
than four years ago. He also found support among those who did not consider
themselves part of the religious right and those born outside South Carolina.
More than four of 10 McCain voters were independent, more than a third were
Republican and one of five was Democratic. He won among the 30 percent who said
they were first-time GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   WHO VOTED: Six of 10 voters said they were Republican and two thirds of them
voted for Bush. And slightly more six of 10 said they were conservative and
again, almost two-thirds of them voted for Bush. Four of 10 voters were
non-Republican, about the same mix as in many of the pre-election polls. Only
one of 10 was a Democrat, a group that went for McCain by better than a 4-to-1
margin. McCain was up by more than 20 points among independents, but Bush had
almost a 40-point advantage among Republicans. In 1996, about three of 10 voters
in the South Carolina primary were non-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW HAMPSHIRE CONTRAST: In New Hampshire, McCain ran close to Bush among
Republicans and had a 40-point edge among independents. When New Hampshire
voters were asked which candidate says what he believes instead of what people
want to hear, half said McCain and fewer than a fifth picked Bush. In South
Carolina, just over half felt that both McCain and Bush say what they believe.
</P>
<P>
	   DECISION TIME: A third of voters say they made their decision in the final
week, and Bush won more than half of those votes, while McCain got more than a
third of them.
</P>
<P>
	   VETERANS: More than a fourth of voters said they were veterans and they
split equally between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ELECTABILITY: Bush was seen by a majority of voters, almost six in 10, as
the candidate most likely to win in November, and that group voted
overwhelmingly for Bush. In New Hampshire, voters named Bush and McCain about
equally when asked that question.
</P>
<P>
	   ISSUES: The top issue for South Carolina voters this year was moral values,
chosen by almost four out of 10, followed by Social Security and then taxes.
Four years ago, economic issues were dominant -- taxes, the economy and jobs,
and the deficit were all close to the top. Only one in 20 said campaign finance
reform was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   CONFEDERATE FLAG: People were about evenly divided on whether the
Confederate flag should be flown over the South Carolina capitol. Those who said
'yes' were inclined to vote for Bush, while those who said ``no'' tended to vote
for McCain. Christian conservatives, South Carolina natives and those who
considered themselves very conservative strongly supported flying the flag.
Sentiment for flying the flag dropped among those with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   CANDIDATE CHOICE: An overwhelming majority of people were satisfied with
their choice of candidates in 2000, with almost nine of 10 saying they were
happy with the current choice. Four years ago, half were satisfied and almost
that many dissatisfied with their choice in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH KNOWLEDGE: More than a fifth of voters said they don't think Bush has
the knowledge to serve effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. VNS surveyed 2,078 voters as they
came out of precincts Saturday. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Split Veterans' Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   South Carolina military veterans were a key to John McCain's strategy of
winning the state's Republican presidential primary and he made them central to
his campaign. But McCain and George W. Bush split the veterans' vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A look at how veterans, who made up 3 of 10 in the electorate, voted:
</P>
<P>
	   --More than nine of 10 veterans were men, and they tilted slightly for
McCain. Almost one in 10 veteran voters were women, and they went slightly for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   --Veterans' priorities were not a lot different from those of overall voters
in the GOP primary. The veterans picked moral values first and Social Security
second, while taxes and world affairs tied for third. Bush won the moral values
group, while McCain won the Social Security group. Bush won among those who said
taxes and McCain among those who thought world affairs was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   --For veterans, the top candidate quality was standing up for what you
believe, a group won 2-1 by McCain. The next two qualities were having
conservative values and being a strong leader, and Bush won among both of those
groups.
</P>
<P>
	   --Republican veterans went for Bush by a 2-1 margin. McCain was backed by a
3-1 margin among independent and Democratic veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among ideological groups, McCain won among liberals and moderates, split
the somewhat conservative group and the very conservative veterans went for Bush
3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   --McCain won among the veterans in the upstate and lowcountry, while Bush
led among those in central Sputh Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   --More than a fourth of veteran voters thought Bush did not know enough to
be president, slightly higher than the number overall who had that concern. The
veterans were split on who was most likely to win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   --Six of 10 veterans wanted a candidate not tied to the party leadership,
and most of them supported McCain.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into 18-state sprint over 17
days. McCain was pugnacious before supporters, declaring, ``We have just begun
to fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of the governor's campaign. ``I cannot wait for the
next round,'' he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of
reform and an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 77 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 225,689 votes, or 54 percent
to McCain's 173,902 or 41 percent. Alan Keyes ran a faraway third at 5 percent.
The dramatic campaign produced a record turnout, but it didn't help McCain as he
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months his
campaign had seen South Carolina as a tradition-minded ``firewall state'' which
could blunt any damage from the chars of New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a
huge lead in early polling but McCain closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only
to see Bush mount a $4 million campaign with help from interest groups and
surrogates who questioned McCain's conservative credentials..
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earning at least 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush has 61 of the
1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain is at 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit Free
Press showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if
not impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29 primary state
but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and the religious right
preferred Bush by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and Bush portrayed McCain as more of a
hypocrite than a reformer and his punches landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pledges Health Center Help  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill Bradley, on a campaign visit to a neighborhood health
clinic, said Saturday all Americans should enjoy primary and preventive care in
such intimate and accessible settings.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley said his plan for universal health care would reduce the number
of people forced to wait for treatment until they are so sick they need
emergency-room care.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Country Doctor Community Health Center, Bradley chatted with patient
Kendall Seale-Diakhate, who praised the care she received while pregnant with
her 7-month-old daughter, Hafsah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a small-town feeling,'' she said. ``You're not treated like cattle.
You're treated like a person.''
</P>
<P>
	   The clinic, which gets 40,000 patient visits a year, uses a sliding fee
schedule to serve predominantly low-income and uninsured people in Seattle's
Capitol Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised that, as president, he would make ``a major investment in
community health clinics like this one.''
</P>
<P>
	   He says his overall health-care plan, with an estimated annual price tag of
$65 billion, would ensure near-universal access to affordable health coverage by
subsidizing premiums for children and adults in low- to middle-income families
and by offering everyone a tax break for premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, also
recommends changing the nation's health-care system but wants it done
``carefully, realistically, and step-by-step.'' His own wide-ranging package of
reforms is aimed at bringing millions of uninsured Americans, and eventually
every child in the nation, into the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   Later on Saturday, Bradley previewed a line for his Monday debate with Gore
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley noted that Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign is trying to
say Republican New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has not always fully favored
abortion rights. Bradley says the same of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm saying on choice is similar to what Hillary Clinton is saying on
Giuliani,'' Bradley said in an interview with an Albany, N.Y. television
station. ``It's important to have a person who's been consistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the St. Louis rally, Bradley told supporters that Texas Gov. George
Bush's victory over Sen. John McCain in South Carolina opens the way for his own
campaign to make a renewed pitch for some of the independent and moderate
Democratic voters who have been moving into the McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we're back,'' Bradley said. ``We're able to make the case that we're
out there to get all the votes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Lambert St.
Louis International Airport, turning around about 18 minutes into the flight
from St. Louis to Baltimore after the pilot said an indicator light went on,
although the problem wasn't immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
	   The charter DC-930 landed safely as fire trucks surrounded the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   After losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bradley is hoping for a boost in
Washington state's Feb. 29 primary, which does not count in assigning delegates
to the convention but is the only contest before 16 states hold primaries and
caucuses on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, the first elected official to endorse Bradley at
the start of his campaign, urged a crowd of 75 outside the clinic to ``do for
Bill Bradley what New Hampshire did for John McCain'' -- that is, provide the
sort of upset victory that fueled McCain's Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, a physician and Bradley supporter who joined him
in Seattle, said it is unacceptable that 44 million uninsured Americans get
health care in emergency rooms.
</P>

	   ``You cannot solve the health-care crisis unless everyone is inside the
tent,'' Kitzhaber said. ``Of all the candidates in this race, only Bill Bradley
has recognized that and has put together a comprehensive health care plan built
around the premise that each and every American should have access to affordable
health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign said a recent analysis by the UCLA Center for Health
Policy Research estimated 11.6 million uninsured adults between the ages of 19
and 64 who have no children and earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level. It
said Bradley's plan would make almost 9.4 million of them eligible for
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   In the state of Washington, the campaign said, Gore's plan would insure
565,000 fewer people than Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore's campaign, said an Emory University
study showed Bradley's plan covers only about 1 percent more of the population
than Gore's plan but costs three times as much.

<HEADLINE> Chat Room Encounter Stops Suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A chance Internet encounter between a Wisconsin man and a
Boston woman ended with police rushing to the woman's apartment after she
declared in cyberspace that she was trying to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
	   As the frightening situation unfolded on his computer screen, Jeff Erlanger,
29, of Madison, Wis., had three vital pieces of data about the woman: her first
name, her online screen name and that she lived in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was really unbelievable and terrifying,'' Erlanger said of his role in
Thursday night's rescue.
</P>
<P>
	   When he first signed on to the public America Online chat board and noticed
a woman named Sarah, Erlanger decided to start a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
	   He learned that she was from Boston and was a dentist. But Sarah also said
she was manic-depressive, that she had been hospitalized, and that she had
previously attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then the next thing she told me was that she had cut herself and blood was
going down her arms,'' he told The Boston Globe. ``I tried to get her to tell me
her last name and she wouldn't. I asked her if she wanted help. She said no.''
</P>
<P>
	   Erlanger initially wasn't sure if the suicide attempt was real or a hoax.
When he decided he had to call authorities, he realized his computer modem was
occupying his only phone line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was stuck between, do I keep talking to her, or do I leave and go to
another phone and leave her hanging?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Without telling Sarah he was leaving his computer, Erlanger rushed to a
phone in the lobby of his building. But the 911 operator in Boston told Erlanger
police could do little to help Sarah without her last name or address.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes had passed by the time Erlanger got back to his computer. But
when Sarah abruptly signed off, he called Boston police once again.
</P>
<P>
	   They told him federal law allowed online companies to reveal a person's full
name in emergencies. Erlanger gave police an America Online phone number and the
woman's screen name.
</P>
<P>
	   When Boston police arrived at Sarah's apartment they found her with fresh
cuts on her wrists, refusing to seek help. She was taken to a Boston hospital
where she was treated, police spokesman Kevin Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into an 18-state sprint over
17 days. McCain was pugnacious, declaring to supporters, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of the governor's campaign. ``I cannot wait for the
next round,'' he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of
reform and an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 85 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 253,772 votes, or 54 percent
to McCain's 194,728 or 41 percent. Alan Keyes was a faraway third at 5 percent.
The dramatic campaign pushed primary turnout to a resounding record, but it
didn't help McCain as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months his
campaign had seen South Carolina as a tradition-minded ``firewall state'' which
could blunt any damage from the chars of New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a
huge lead in early polling but McCain closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only
to see Bush mount a $4 million campaign with help from interest groups and
surrogates who questioned McCain's conservative credentials..
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earning at least 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush has 61 of the
1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain is at 11 in the
AP delegate count.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit News
showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29 primary state
but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and the religious right
preferred Bush by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and Bush portrayed McCain as more of a
hypocrite than a reformer and his punches landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Lose Trust in Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- At first, ethnic Albanians living in
the northern Kosovo town of Kosovska Mitrovica saw the arriving French NATO
troops as liberators. Eight months later, they are regarded with a mixture of
mistrust and fear.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks of sporadic violence in Kosovo's only ethnically divided town may
have dealt the final blow to already severely strained relations between ethnic
Albanians and the French troops who control the peacekeeping operation in the
northern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The French are perceived as favoring the Serbs living in northern Kosovska
Mitrovica. Ethnic Albanians accuse them of allowing the Serbs to act with
impunity in terrorizing the small number of Albanians who remain there, while
reacting harshly to any unrest generated from the southern, ethnic Albanian part
of town.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, hundreds of U.S. military personnel headed for the troubled
town amid reports that three more Serbs had died in violent attacks across the
province.
</P>
<P>
	   About 350 U.S. personnel are being deployed for at least five days to
reinforce the French troops, said U.S. Sgt. Ian Fitzgerald, a NATO spokesman in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Serb civilians were found shot dead near the village of Gornja
Gusterica, 7 miles southeast of Pristina, NATO said. Another Serb man was found
shot to death in his car near the northern Kosovo town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials have frequently stressed the multinational nature of the
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, which began after the end of a 78-day NATO air
campaign aimed at ending oppressive Serb rule of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
	   But ethnic Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica are leveling criticism only at
the French contingency stationed in their town, and say it does not reflect
their feelings for the peacekeeping mission as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French soldiers are as bad as the Serbs,'' said Halit Berani, head of
the ethnic Albanian human rights council in Kosovska Mitrovica. ``The French
army is responsible and guilty for the mistrust between the Albanians and the
French soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mistrust climaxed during the latest round of violence, which began when
a rocket was fired at a U.N. bus on Feb. 2, killing two Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of grenade attacks, shootings and clashes the next night in
northern Kosovska Mitrovica left at least eight ethnic Albanians dead and 28
Serbs and Albanians injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanians claim the French troops stationed in the north did nothing
to help their brethren when groups of Serbs roamed the town, beating and
shooting ethnic Albanians and throwing hand grenades into homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several U.N. police officers stationed in the town also have said the French
troops -- part of the peacekeeping force known as KFOR -- were slow to react
when a mob of between 1,000 and 2,000 angry Serbs rampaged through the northern
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The French KFOR isn't security for us. We fear them almost as much as the
Serbs,'' said Sadije Niksic, 35, a Bosnian Muslim living among the small Bosnian
minority in the Serb part of Kosovska Mitrovica. ``We had trust in them but
we've lost it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others claim the French even provided cover for rampaging Serbs. ``When the
Serbs attacked us, they hid behind French tanks,'' said 50-year-old Adem Tolaj.
``They have helped ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the French insist they did everything possible, stressing that it would
be impossible to station soldiers outside every ethnic Albanian home in the
northern part of town to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the French had not done their job, ... it would have been a massacre,''
the French commander, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Perceptions that French troops are reluctant to protect ethnic Albanians
could further escalate violence in a town which remains one of the most tense
areas of Kosovo, a province still awash with weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials said Saturday that a large stash of weapons and ammunition
was discovered in a search of Serb and Albanian houses in northern Kosovska
Mitrovica, including eight high-powered rifles, four rocket launchers and 10
hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern, Serb-majority part of town last week, unidentified gunmen
and snipers turned their weapons on French peacekeepers, wounding two. A gun
battle raged in the town for the next four hours, leaving at least one person
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial reports from the French troops indicated that most of those firing
had been ethnic Albanians. Out of 46 people arrested in connection with the
incident, 45 were Albanian and only one was a Serb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good relations with the population are vital to the peacekeeping
mission,'' said Lt. Commander Philip Anido, KFOR spokesman, adding: ``I have no
reason to doubt the professional capability of the French.''
</P>
<P>
	   But French troops searching for snipers possibly hiding in apartments after
Sunday's gun battle appear to have further soured relations, with some ethnic
Albanians saying their doors were smashed and they were ordered to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't even let us get our shoes,'' said Lirije Gllareva, 19, the
next day as she stood in her slippers on the southern part of a bridge over the
Ibar River dividing the town. Her father had been arrested in the sweep, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   French troops insist people were not expelled from their homes, and counter
that searching the flats was imperative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If doors were broken, it must be seen in context. The priority was to find
the shooters and limit the possibility of further injuries,'' said Lt. Matthieu
Mabin, a spokesman for the French troops.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon Files To Be Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the FBI to release notes from a
phone conversation and two letters about John Lennon, the Beatles singer who was
murdered in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Magistrate Judge Brian Q. Robbins made the ruling Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FBI, 10 pages of Lennon's file were withheld at the request
of a foreign government that had given the FBI the documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Eliasberg, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said he
believes the request to block the release came from British intelligence
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The release of the documents was prompted by author and historian Jon
Wiener, who filed a federal Freedom of Information Act request in 1983 to obtain
all U.S. government documents on Lennon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think that the national security is really at stake here," Weiner
said. "We think this is 30-year-old, trivial information about the activities of
a dead rock star."
</P>
<P>
	   Wiener's book, "Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files," was published
in January by The University of California Press in Berkeley. The book
reproduces 100 pages of FBI files on Lennon that have been released, including
some that were entirely blacked out for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU, which joined Wiener's attempt to obtain the files, said the FBI
under the Nixon administration used surveillance in an attempt to deport Lennon
due to his opposition to the Vietnam War.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina military veterans were a key to John
McCain's strategy of winning the state's Republican presidential primary and he
made them central to his campaign, but McCain and George W. Bush split the
veterans' vote today. More than nine of 10 veterans were men, and they tilted
slightly for McCain. Almost one in 10 veteran voters were women, and they went
slightly for Bush. Veterans' priorities were not a lot different from those of
overall voters in the GOP primary. The veterans picked moral values first and
Social Security second, while taxes and world affairs tied for third.

Cuba Not Willing To Welcome Diplomat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba said today that it will not willingly bring home a
Washington-based diplomat targeted for expulsion, and instead will instruct him
to defend himself against accusations of spying. Cuba accused the U.S.
government of using the espionage issue to try to block 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez's return to his communist homeland. That was the first official
reaction here to the U.S. State Department's announcement earlier in the day
that it had ordered the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat linked to a Cuban-born
U.S. Immigration official arrested in Miami on spy charges. It was not
immediately clear what procedures would be followed if the diplomat, indeed,
refused to leave voluntarily.

fire was tentatively attributed to a candle left burning on the windowsill in a

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Tied in Michigan Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The race between John McCain and George W. Bush is very close
in Michigan just days before the state's crucial GOP primary, a poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was taken Tuesday through Thursday, before Bush's Saturday victory
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey in Sunday's editions of The Detroit News indicates McCain was
supported by 40 percent and Bush by 38 percent. Five percent said they would
vote for someone else and the other 17 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of 594 likely voters was conducted by Mitchell Research and
Communications Inc. and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   A Detroit News poll a week earlier showed McCain backed by 43 percent of
likely voters while Bush was favored by 34 percent. The latest poll showed
McCain with a huge lead among Democrats and a 30-point lead among independents,
while Bush widened his edge among Republicans to 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary invites all 6.7 million Michigan voters to participate,
no matter which party they prefer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is supported by Michigan Gov. John Engler, increased his lead
among rank-and-file Republicans from 11 to 18-points, with 49 percent saying
they favored Bush and 31 percent favoring McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   As in South Carolina, turnout will be a key question, said News pollster
Steve Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our polling suggests about 65 percent of voters will be Republicans; 20
percent independents and 12 percent Democrats,'' Mitchell said. ``If Democrats
and independents comprise 40 percent of the turnout, then I think McCain wins.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Conservatives Drive Bush Win  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Conservatives, especially the religious right, drove
George W. Bush's victory in the South Carolina Republican primary Saturday. The
Texas governor also poked holes in challenger John McCain's reformer image, exit
polls found.
</P>
<P>
	   Another key for Bush: He won back his party's core. Bush lost the New
Hampshire's leadoff GOP primary Feb. 1 in part because self-described
Republicans only narrowly favored him over McCain, who has drawn his strongest
support from independents and crossover Democrats. But in South Carolina, Bush
took roughly 70 percent of those who call themselves Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   The party faithful offset a slightly larger than usual turnout of Democrats
and independents in the South Carolina GOP's open primary, according to exit
polling by Voter News Service for The Associated Press and television networks.
Democrats were 9 percent of the electorate, compared to 5 percent in the 1996
South Carolina GOP primary, and 79 percent of them backed McCain, who also won
60 percent of independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush runs with strong backing from the Republican establishment. While a
majority of exit poll respondents said they preferred a candidate who is not
tied to party leaders, Bush won three quarters of the remainder who said they
favor someone loyal to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey indicated that as the campaign turned sharply negative after the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, Bush's attacks hurt McCain. They also suggest the
Arizona senator may have hurt himself with attacks on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, just 15 percent of voters viewed McCain unfavorably; that
increased to 30 percent in South Carolina. Bush's favorable rating rose from 60
percent to 73 percent. And more voters said McCain attacked Bush unfairly than
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was leaning to McCain until he compared Bush to Bill Clinton, and that
poisoned him for me,'' Willis Cox, of Florence said. ``They were both negative,
but no stone was thrown like that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issues McCain hoped would sway independents and Democrats failed to
register strongly enough to overcome the state's conservative, establishment
tilt. Only 1 in 20 said campaign finance reform, a centerpiece of McCain's
message, was the top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush succeeded in neutralizing McCain's emphasis on that issue with his new
line of attack in the past week, accusing McCain of saying one thing but doing
another when it comes to campaign finance. More than 4 in 10 voters agreed with
Bush on that.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit poll found that more than a third of voters said moral values was
the most important issue for them, and Bush won more than half of them. He also
won 8 in 10 of those who said they voted based on the candidate who best
represented their conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two-thirds of voters Saturday called themselves conservative, and
Bush won more than 6 in 10 of them. Bush ran especially strongly among those who
called themselves ``very conservative.'' A third called themselves part of the
religious right, and Bush won two-thirds of their votes. Bush also drew strong
support from abortion foes, who made up 58 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who did not call themselves part of the religious right, a
majority supported McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing decisively to McCain in New Hampshire, Bush changed his message
to ``reformer with results'' -- and it apparently worked. Six in 10 voters said
Bush is a real reformer, while little more than half considered that term fit
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analysts said McCain erred by airing ads that compared Bush to
President Clinton. A quarter of those who voted for McCain said he unfairly
attacked Bush. Just 11 percent of Bush voters said they thought his attacks
against McCain were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That probably helped deep six him in the last week,'' said Neal Thigpen, a
Francis Marion University political scientist and McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results were from interviews of 2,078 voters in 40 precincts around
South Carolina. The margin of sampling error was plus of minus 3 percentage
points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 111, Bucks 100  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Michael Dickerson scored 26 points and Shareef Abdur-Rahim
added 24 as the Vancouver Grizzlies beat Milwaukee 111-100 on Saturday night,
giving the Bucks their fifth straight home defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the Grizzlies were playing one night after a 103-91 loss in Minnesota
in the midst of a four-game Midwest road swing, Vancouver buried the Bucks with
a stellar offensive performance against the Bucks' typically lax defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies made a 15-4 run to start the third quarter and then hit eight
of their first nine shots -- all from the perimeter -- in the fourth. Dennis
Scott, Brent Price and Doug West all made big jumpers as Vancouver streaked to a
99-81 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver, which shot 51.4 percent, won for the third time in four games and
continued to improve under coach Lionel Hollins, who coached the Griz to an
impressive victory with prospective new owner Michael Heisley watching.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdur-Rahim was 12-of-14 from the free-throw line, while Dickerson threw
down a pair of fearsome dunks to go with his outside prowess. Michael Bibby had
13 points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Allen led the Bucks with 32 points, while Sam Cassell had 16 points and
10 assists. Glenn Robinson had 21 points, but gave away at least that many with
subpar defense as Abdur-Rahim decisively won their battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee hasn't been the same since returning from a successful Western
road swing, during which the Bucks beat Vancouver 92-87. Since then, the Bucks
are 1-5 and are threatening to fall out of the Eastern playoff picture, with
just a 1 1/2-game lead over Orlando for ninth place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley Center crowd booed the Bucks at nearly every second-half dead
ball.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the Grizzlies' shots were wide-open jumpers like the ones the Bucks
surrendered with alarming frequency to Toronto, Portland, New York and Indiana
in the first four games of their home losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee's 14-12 home record is easily the worst among the league's 16
teams with winning records. Unfortunately for the Bucks, five of their next
seven games are at home.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pledges Health Center Help  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill Bradley, on a campaign visit to a neighborhood health
clinic, said Saturday all Americans should enjoy primary and preventive care in
such intimate and accessible settings.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley said his plan for universal health care would reduce the number
of people forced to wait for treatment until they are so sick they need
emergency-room care.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Country Doctor Community Health Center, Bradley chatted with patient
Kendall Seale-Diakhate, who praised the care she received while pregnant with
her 7-month-old daughter, Hafsah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a small-town feeling,'' she said. ``You're not treated like cattle.
You're treated like a person.''
</P>
<P>
	   The clinic, which gets 40,000 patient visits a year, uses a sliding fee
schedule to serve predominantly low-income and uninsured people in Seattle's
Capitol Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised that, as president, he would make ``a major investment in
community health clinics like this one.''
</P>
<P>
	   He says his overall health-care plan, with an estimated annual price tag of
$65 billion, would ensure near-universal access to affordable health coverage by
subsidizing premiums for children and adults in low- to middle-income families
and by offering everyone a tax break for premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, also
recommends changing the nation's health-care system but wants it done
``carefully, realistically, and step-by-step.'' His own wide-ranging package of
reforms is aimed at bringing millions of uninsured Americans, and eventually
every child in the nation, into the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   Later on Saturday, Bradley previewed a line for his Monday debate with Gore
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley noted that Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign is trying to
say Republican New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has not always fully favored
abortion rights. Bradley says the same of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm saying on choice is similar to what Hillary Clinton is saying on
Giuliani,'' Bradley said in an interview with an Albany, N.Y. television
station. ``It's important to have a person who's been consistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the St. Louis rally, Bradley told supporters that Texas Gov. George
Bush's victory over Sen. John McCain in South Carolina opens the way for his own
campaign to make a renewed pitch for some of the independent and moderate
Democratic voters who have been moving into the McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we're back,'' Bradley said. ``We're able to make the case that we're
out there to get all the votes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Lambert St.
Louis International Airport, turning around less than 10 minutes into the flight
from St. Louis to Baltimore after the pilot said an indicator light went on.
</P>
<P>
	   The charter DC-9 30 series landed safely as fire trucks surrounded the
plane. Campaign spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said the warning light indicated a
``potential problem with the landing gear.''
</P>
<P>
	   After losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bradley is hoping for a boost in
Washington state's Feb. 29 primary, which does not count in assigning delegates
to the convention but is the only contest before 16 states hold primaries and
caucuses on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, the first elected official to endorse Bradley at
the start of his campaign, urged a crowd of 75 outside the clinic to ``do for
Bill Bradley what New Hampshire did for John McCain'' -- that is, provide the
sort of upset victory that fueled McCain's Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, a physician and Bradley supporter who joined him
in Seattle, said it is unacceptable that 44 million uninsured Americans get
health care in emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot solve the health-care crisis unless everyone is inside the
tent,'' Kitzhaber said. ``Of all the candidates in this race, only Bill Bradley
has recognized that and has put together a comprehensive health care plan built
around the premise that each and every American should have access to affordable
health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign said a recent analysis by the UCLA Center for Health
Policy Research estimated 11.6 million uninsured adults between the ages of 19
and 64 who have no children and earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level. It
said Bradley's plan would make almost 9.4 million of them eligible for
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   In the state of Washington, the campaign said, Gore's plan would insure
565,000 fewer people than Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore's campaign, said an Emory University
study showed Bradley's plan covers only about 1 percent more of the population
than Gore's plan but costs three times as much.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into an 18-state sprint over
17 days. McCain was pugnacious, declaring to supporters, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of the governor's campaign. ``I cannot wait for the
next round,'' he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of
reform and an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 85 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 253,772 votes, or 54 percent
to McCain's 194,728 or 41 percent. Alan Keyes was a faraway third at 5 percent.
The dramatic campaign pushed primary turnout to a resounding record, but it
didn't help McCain as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months his
campaign had seen South Carolina as a tradition-minded ``firewall state'' which
could blunt any damage from the chars of New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a
huge lead in early polling but McCain closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only
to see Bush mount a $4 million campaign with help from interest groups and
surrogates who questioned McCain's conservative credentials..
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earning at least 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush has 61 of the
1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain is at 11 in the
AP delegate count.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit News
showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29 primary state
but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and the religious right
preferred Bush by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.

<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and Bush portrayed McCain as more of a
hypocrite than a reformer and his punches landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

<HEADLINE> Vanderbilt 85, No. 5 Tennessee 72  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM SHARP AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Perhaps Vanderbilt coach Kevin Stallings should
have these chats with Anthony Williams more often.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach had been telling me in order for us to be successful, I had to get
down in the paint and start scoring more," Williams said after leading the
Commodores to an 85-72 victory over No. 5 Tennessee on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams had a career-high 22 points and added 12 rebounds as the Commodores
(17-6, 7-5 Southeastern Conference) won the season series from their cross-state
rivals for the first time in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anthony Williams was great for every minute he was out there," Stallings
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodores shot 53 percent from the floor and took excellent care of the
ball, committing only seven turnovers. As a result they did not need another
monster night from SEC scoring leader Dan Langhi, who had 31 in the first
meeting in Knoxville but settled for 17 Saturday, including a breakaway slam at
the buzzer that sent the Vandy students onto the floor to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
	   James Strong added 15 points for the Commodores.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought our team played the best game we've played this season,"
Stallings said. "Tennessee is the best team in the league. I think they've shown
that this season."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee coach Jerry Green gave the credit to the Commodores, who dogged is
team into an especially poor shooting night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought Vanderbilt played as well as I've seen them play," Green said.
"Thirty-nine percent (Tennessee's field goal percentage) was one of the cruxes,
but I think Vanderbilt had something to do with that."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee (21-4, 9-3) hit just 26 of 66 from the floor and fell into a
four-way tie with Kentucky, Florida and Auburn for the SEC lead. The Vols
launched 29 3-point attempts and hit seven (24 percent).
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee also got a terrible performance from leading scorer Tony Harris
(15.3 points per game), who was 1-of-14 from the field and finished with three
points to go with one assist and three turnovers. He was 0-8 on 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent Yarbrough led the Vols with 25 points. Ron Slay had 13 and Terrence
Woods added 10, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee came into the game as the league's best road team at 7-1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vols had won three straight and seven of their last eight, but had no
answer for Williams. The 6-foot-7 junior, primarily an inside player, got off to
an auspicious start when he banked in an 18-footer on his first shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied 29-all late in the first half before Vanderbilt closed the
half with a 12-4 spurt to lead 41-33 at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee cut it to five points on a three-point play by Yarbrough with just
under 13 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanderbilt stretched its lead to 14 on a 3-pointer by Sam Howard, who had 11
points. Yarbrough answered with a 3, Howard hit another and Yarbrough answered
again, all in the space of less than a minute, and the Commodores were up 65-54.
</P>
<P>
	   From there it was all Vanderbilt. Langhi's 3-pointer edged the margin back
up to 14 and the Vols got no closer than eight the rest of the way.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Coach Leaves for Treatment  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- His voice shaky but still delivering punchlines,
Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger Neilson announced Saturday night he will leave
the team for the rest of the regular season due to cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson will begin scheduled, aggressive treatment Monday for multiple
myeloma, a rare form of bone marrow cancer he was diagnosed with Dec. 9.
Assistant Craig Ramsay will take over as coach, with help from assistant Wayne
Cashman and minor league coach Mike Stothers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Starting right now, Rammer and Cash are the coaches," Neilson said after
the Flyers gave him a victorious sendoff with a 4-2 victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson told his team in what he described as a minute-long meeting
following the morning skate. He is expected to be out until at least mid-April,
or through the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mark Recchi said, 'Let's go out there and win this game for Roger. It's his
last game for a long time,"' goaltender Brian Boucher said. "I think we were
inspired by that."
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson's doctor, Isadore Brodsky, remained upbeat that the treatment will
work. But the doctor acknowledged after Neilson's news conference that there's a
chance the coach won't be able to return at all this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, there's that possibility," Brodsky said. "He knows that. He'll listen
to what we tell him to do. We're not going to jeopardize his life."
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson, 65, joked that he did not instruct his team that it had better
still be playing when he returns. He has joked since being diagnosed with the
incurable disease that maybe it would be best if he weren't around for the first
round, where Philadelphia has lost the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never had to leave a team in the middle of the year, so that's the
difficult part," said Neilson, who has coached more NHL teams than anyone and is
ninth in career victories.
</P>
<P>
	   Captain Eric Lindros said, "We're going to miss him, obviously. But he's
implemented a game plan that's pretty basic of what he wants us to do. It takes
a lot of hard work. Rammer's been with him a long, long time and knows what he
wants."
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson will begin aggressive treatment Monday, including chemotherapy and
the removal of bone marrow cells. Brodsky said chemotherapy has already
significantly reduced the cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
	   "That means everything is on schedule and I can go ahead with the
transplant," Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   After some marrow cells are removed, Neilson will receive a massive dose of
chemotherapy to "totally obliterate his marrow," Brodsky said. The clean marrow
will be returned in a transplant procedure in about two weeks, and Neilson will
need 3-6 weeks after that for recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Brodsky drew a laugh from Neilson when he said, "Knock on wood, we haven't
lost a patient from the stem cell transplant."
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, that's good to hear," Neilson said, clapping his hands and smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers coach has been undergoing chemotherapy for a rare form of bone
cancer since mid-December when he began waging a public fight against it.
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson has multiple myeloma, which strikes about 15,000 people a year and
causes about 10,000 deaths annually in the United States. Neilson's sister, Joan
-- his last living relative -- died from the same form of cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no cure, but patients have lived 10 years or more. Doctors said the
average life expectancy for patients who receive transplants is 2-3 years, with
half the patients making it five years.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Iowa St. 101, Missouri 66  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State shot its way out of a two-game losing streak
and back into first place in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Megan Taylor made six of her team's school-record 18 3-pointers in scoring
26 points and sparked a fast start that carried No. 10 Iowa State to a 101-66
victory over Missouri on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State's first 100-point game in 23 years came after the Cyclones (19-5,
10-3 Big 12) had played poorly in back-to-back losses to Kansas State and Kansas
that dropped them out of the league lead. They're now tied for first with
Oklahoma, Texas Tech and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Missouri just caught us on a bad night," Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly
said. "They got our A-A, plus-plus game. You hate to see it get out of hand like
that. We just played well."
</P>
<P>
	   The quick turnaround was so stunning that Fennelly said he forgot to wave to
his wife when it was over, something he does after ever game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just really numb about how we played," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stacy Frese broke out of a shooting slump with 20 points and hit five 3s for
the Cyclones, who took advantage of Missouri's defense collapsing in the lane to
get wide open shots on the perimeter. The Tigers (16-8, 6-7) were a step slow to
contest those shots and Iowa State made them pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State shot 54 percent overall and was 18-of-29 (62 percent) on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anybody in the country could have beat Iowa State tonight,"
Missouri coach Cindy Stein said. "We just happened to be the lucky ones in the
gym."
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State's old record for 3s was 16 against Colorado last season. It was
Iowa State's first 100-point game since beating Grand View 100-82 on Jan. 11,
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven Iowa State players made at least one 3, with Taylor going 6-for-8 and
Frese 5-for-7. Taylor was 10-for-13 overall and Frese, 4-for-29 from the field
in the three previous games, finished 6-for-10.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some days you don't have it, some days you do," Frese said. "People kept
saying that I-we were in a slump, but it never felt that way. They all felt the
same. We were bound to start making them. We've been missing so many lately."
</P>
<P>
	   Marlena Williams led Missouri with 16 points and Julie Helm scored 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, finding an open spot just to the left of the key, hit four
3-pointers and two layups in the first 9 1/2 minutes as Iowa State jumped to a
23-8 lead and was never threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   "Missing can be contagious. So can making," Fennelly said. "It was nice to
see Megan making some early. The kids really sensed Megan was feeling it and we
got it to her early and often. When that happens, then everybody relaxes."
</P>
<P>
	   Frese hit back-to-back 3s and Francis had one in a 13-0 run that made it
37-14. The Cyclones led by 27 late in the half and were up 46-20 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri committed five turnovers in the first four minutes and never got in
synch offensively against Iowa State's zone. Iowa State had more 3-point baskets
(9) in the opening half than Missouri had total field goals (7).
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers shot 24 percent in the half and 39 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State led by as many as 41 in the second half and kept scoring long
after Frese and Taylor were resting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "Iowa State is a great team," Stein said. "I think you're looking at a team
that hit a lull, which every team does, especially at this time of year. I think
they've snapped out of it pretty well."

<TEXT>
<P>
    SUNRISE (AP) -- Martin Straka scored the eventual game-winning goal early in
the third period to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 2-1 victory over the
Florida Panthers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Aleksey Morozov also scored for the Penguins, who are 6-1-1 in their last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaroslav Spacek scored for the Panthers, who had their four-game home
winning streak snapped in front of their first sellout crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean-Sebastien Aubin, filling in for Tom Barrasso who is on an extended
leave to be with his ailing father, made 21 saves to improve his road record to
2-10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers came close to tying it twice in the last two minutes. With 1:52
remaining, a shot from the point caromed off Rob Niedermayer's skate and off the
post. Then, with Mike Vernon out of the net, Aubin stopped Scott Mellanby in the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Straka, a former Panther, redirected Ian Moran's slap shot from the point
past Vernon for a 2-1 Penguins lead 29 seconds into the period. Straka played
for the Panthers from 1995-97 before being released.
</P>
<P>
	   Spacek's slap shot from the top of the left face-off circle beat Aubin to
the glove side for a 1-0 lead at 3:41 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   At 8:11 of the first, Morozov took a centering pass from Alexei Kovalev and
flicked it in to make it 1-1. It was Morozov's ninth goal, and third in his last
five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin made a big save on Ray Sheppard during a third-period power play and
also gloved Peter Worrell's deflection to preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
	   In a highly publicized matchup of two of the NHL's top scorers, Pavel Bure
and Jaromir Jagr, neither 28-year-old All-Star notched a point. Both took four
shots in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew Barnaby sat out the third game of his five-game suspension for his
participation in an off-ice scuffle with the New York Islanders' Eric Cairns.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into an 18-state sprint over
17 days. McCain was pugnacious, declaring to supporters, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of the governor's campaign. ``I cannot wait for the
next round,'' he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of
reform and an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 291,848 votes, or 53 percent,
to McCain's 229,202 or 42 percent. Alan Keyes was a faraway third at 24,281, or
5 percent. The dramatic campaign pushed primary turnout to a resounding record,
but it didn't help McCain as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months his
campaign had seen South Carolina as a tradition-minded ``firewall state'' which
could blunt any damage from the chars of New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a
huge lead in early polling but McCain closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only
to see Bush mount a $4 million campaign with help from interest groups and
surrogates who questioned McCain's conservative credentials..
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earning at least 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush has 61 of the
1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain is at 11 in the
AP delegate count.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit News
showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29 primary state
but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and the religious right
preferred Bush by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and Bush portrayed McCain as more of a
hypocrite than a reformer and his punches landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame 76, No.23 Seton Hall 74  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM CANAVAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- David Graves grabbed an offensive rebound and
hit a 10-foot jumper with three tenths of a second left to give Notre Dame a
wild 76-74 victory over No. 23 Seton Hall on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Murphy matched his season high with 35 points as Notre Dame (16-10, 7-5
Big East) blew a late 10-point lead and then came back to hand Seton Hall (18-6,
10-4) its second straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Rimas Kaukenas had 22 points and freshman center Samuel Dalembert added a
career-high 18 for the Pirates, whose first stay in the Top 25 since 1993 is
likely to end after a week.
</P>
<P>
	   After Kaukenas tied it with a layup with 37.5 seconds to play, Notre Dame
took over and played for a last shot, but the Pirates never let Murphy get near
the ball.
</P>
<P>
	   An off balance 30-foot 3-pointer by Matt Carroll with four seconds to play
bounced off the rim, but the Pirates were fooled when the shot-clock horn
sounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Graves never stopped. He grabbed the rebound to the right of the lane and
popped back up and hit a fallaway jumper with three tenths of a second to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials reviewed the play and didn't change anything.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy batted away a length-of-the-court pass at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall almost made a great comeback after a 19-2 Notre Dame spurt helped
the Irish take a 62-51 lead with 7:53 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin was 67-57 with 5:52 to go and the Irish still led 71-62 after
Murphy hit two free throws with 4:49 to go, his last points.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaheen Holloway and Kaukenas hit consecutive 3-pointers to ignite a 10-0
run that Ty Shine capped with a steal and a layup for a 72-71 lead with 1:54 to
go.
</P>
<P>
	   Graves, who had 15 points, countered with a 3-pointer for a 74-72 lead with
1:36 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Dalembert missed two free throws with 1:22 to play, but after Murphy missed
a baseline jumper, Kaukenas tied it with a driving layup with 37.5 seconds to
go.
</P>
<P>
	   Notre Dame, which was down seven at the half, trailed 49-43 after Lane hit a
somewhat controversial three-point play with 15:37 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irish then held Seton Hall to just one basket over the next eight
minutes while scoring 19 points. Graves started the run with a 3-pointer and
Murphy chipped in nine along the way to give Notre Dame a 62-51 lead with 7:53
to play.

<HEADLINE> St. John's 76, No. 9 Syracuse 75  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie Jessie's rebound basket with 28 seconds to play was
St. John's only points of the final 4:45 but it was enough to give the Red Storm
a 76-75 victory over No. 9 Syracuse on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orangemen, trailing 74-63 with 4:48 to play, scored 12 straight points,
taking a 75-74 lead on a free throw by Preston Shumpert with 51 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   It looked as if St. John's, playing under the cloud of an NCAA investigation
and with point guard Erick Barkley in obvious discomfort with dehydration, was
going to repeat its finish last month against Ohio State. In that game, also at
Madison Square Garden, the Buckeyes scored the final 11 points for a 65-64
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   When Shumpert missed the second free throw, St. John's (18-6, 10-3 Big East)
worked the ball to Lavor Postell on the left side. His fallaway jumper was well
off the mark but it bounced off the backboard and to Jessie, who laid it in for
his fifth and sixth points of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse (21-3, 10-2), which didn't have a timeout, worked the ball around
and Allen Griffin's drive with six seconds left was off the mark. Jessie grabbed
his eighth rebound of the game and was fouled with 5.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed the front end of a 1-and-1 but the rebound bounced long and
Syracuse's Jason Hart fell to the floor trying to control it and the ball
bounced away as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Boosty Thornton finished with 22 points for St. John's, 10 in the opening
five minutes of the second half when the Red Storm took the lead and held it
until the final minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart's 3-pointer with 5:11 left brought the Orangemen within 71-63, but
Thornton answered with his fourth 3 of the game 30 seconds later. Those would be
St. John's final points until Jessie converted the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan Blackwell's 3-pointer with 2:34 left brought Syracuse within 74-70.
Griffin stole a pass by Barkley near midcourt and went for a dunk that made it a
two-point game with 2:13 left. Hart tied the game on a drive with 1:25 left,
capping an run.
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley, who got sick to his stomach during one timeout and was doubled over
in pain quite a bit as the game wound down, missed the front end of a 1-and-1
with 1:14 left and Shumpert went to the line with 51 seconds left to give
Syracuse the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   When the game ended, Barkley fell to the floor near midcourt and laid there
until teammate Donald Emanuel carried him to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Glover and Barkley each had 16 points and Barkley had nine assists.
Lavor Postell finished with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart had 18 points for Syracuse, Blackwell added 15 and Thomas and Shumpert
12 each.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the 1,600th for St. John's, the fifth school to reach that
figure, behind Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas and Duke.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 4, Lightning 2  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Rod Brind'Amour, Sean Hill and Martin Gelinas scored
second-period goals as the Carolina Hurricanes beat Tampa Bay 4-2 Saturday
night, handing the Lightning its eighth straight road loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina moved within two points of the New York Rangers in the crowded race
for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Brind'Amour also assisted on Hill's goal for his first multi-point game
since being traded for Keith Primeau on Jan. 23. Meanwhile, Hill, a defenseman,
scored his fifth goal in as many games this season against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina led 1-0 after one period, but jumped on the Lightning early in the
second as Brind'Amour scored 16 seconds into the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill's power-play goal 7 1/2 minutes later made it 3-0 and Tampa Bay was
well on its way to its 14th loss in its last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent Lecavalier did score his team-leading 18th goal with 7:15 left in
the second to close the gap to 3-1, but Gelinas scored his 11th from a sharp
angle 1:25 later and the rout was on in a penalty-filled game.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay is 0-7-1 in February and has a dismal 3-22-3 road record. Fredrik
Modin scored his 17th with 3:44 left to close out the scoring for the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   Lightning goaltender Rich Parent was caught out of position behind the net
on Carolina's first goal as Jeff O'Neill centered a pass from the corner to
Bates Battaglia, who put it into an open net 7:18 into the game. The goal was
Battaglia's 11th of the season but only the second in his last 31 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay's Mike Johnson appeared to have stuffed one by Arturs Irbe during
a power play later in the period, but after reviewing the play referee Paul
Devorski said the entire puck had not crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams went without a top player Saturday night. Carolina goal leader
Sami Kapanen missed all but three shifts with a bruised shoulder, while Chris
Gratton, Tampa Bay's No. 2 scorer, missed the game with a bruised right foot.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 74, Clippers 72  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Carr hit a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left, and Will
Perdue made his only free throw of the game 13 seconds later to seal the Chicago
Bulls' 74-72 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night in a
matchup of the NBA's worst teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Piatkowski tipped in Michael Olowokandi's miss with 5.8 seconds to go,
but the Clippers dropped the inbounds pass on their next possession and Troy
Hudson missed a long 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss gives the Clippers the dubious distinction of fewest victories (11)
and worst winning percentage (.208) in the league. It also spoiled the bench
debut of Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Clippers' newest assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the victory, the Bulls won't look back on this one with pride. They
shot just 10 percent -- yes, you read that correctly -- in the third quarter,
and tied the NBA season-low with 28.6 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But when a team is barely in the double digits with victories, they'll take
every one they can get. Carr led the Bulls with a season-high 19 points and
Hersey Hawkins added 14. Elton Brand had another double-double, grabbing 18
rebounds to go with his 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Hudson tied his career high with 22 points, and Lamar Odom added 19 for
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing by as much as 11 in the third quarter, the Bulls tied it at
63 on a 3-pointer from Hawkins and two free throws from Carr with 4:36 left in
the game. The Clippers pulled ahead three times only to have the Bulls answer
right back.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, with 44 seconds left, Hudson made the second of two free throws to
give the Clippers a 70-69 lead. After a timeout, Brand took a short jumper,
missed, grabbed his own rebound and then kicked out to Carr on the right wing
for the 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson missed a jumper and Perdue grabbed the rebound and was fouled.
Perdue, who missed his first five free throws, made the second shot to make it
73-70.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the Bulls been playing anyone but the Clippers, they probably wouldn't
have been around to make a comeback. The Bulls made only two of their 20 shots
in the third, while the Clippers went on an 11-0 run and took a 53-42 lead with
7:35 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bulls were saved all night by their free throws. They went to the
line 27 more times than the Clippers (40-13) and made 23 shots. They were
9-of-11 in the third quarter, including Ron Artest's two with 7.5 seconds left
that kept Chicago within 58-54.

<HEADLINE> Bonaly, Boitano Win at Goodwill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Surya Bonaly flipped. So did the judges.
</P>
<P>
	The five-time European champion from France took the figure skating gold medal
Saturday night in the Winter Goodwill Games, barely beating Yuka Sato of Japan.
</P>
<P>
	Bonaly, who performed her signature backflip for the second time in the
competition and added two triple jumps, finished with a score of 197.3 and got
one perfect 10 for artistry.
</P>
<P>
	Sato, tied for the lead with Bonaly entering the evening, fell coming out of a
triple jump in her routine and finished at 197.2.
</P>
<P>
	Oksana Baiul, third coming in, fell just seconds after her music stopped. The
Ukrainian star, who beat Nancy Kerrigan for the gold in Lillehammer six years
ago, dropped to fourth behind Kerrigan, who hit three triple jumps in a flawless
routine.
</P>
<P>
	Ageless Dorothy Hamill, who hadn't skated competitively since her 1976 victory
in Innsbruck, was just behind Baiul in fifth. Katarina Witt of Germany was
sixth.
</P>
<P>
	As usual, figure skating piqued the most interest, attracting a sellout of more
than 7,000 at the Olympic Ice Arena.
</P>
<P>
	And the competition was unique, with names from the past dusting off jumps they
hadn't performed in the years since they turned professional. Witt, a two-time
Olympic champion, said it didn't matter who won, and it really didn't.
</P>
<P>
	In a replay of their finish in the 1988 Calgary Olympics, Brian Boitano of the
United States won gold, Brian Orser of Canada took silver, and Russia's Victor
Petrenko got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
	Boitano, in first place coming in, hit a triple toe loop, a double toe loop and
a double loop in succession and had one 10 to finish with a score of 197.4.
</P>
<P>
	``I worked really hard to get prepared for this,'' Boitano said. ``I didn't
make a mistake, but I felt pressure both nights. Skating last you just stew. You
know what's happening, and it's hard waiting.''
</P>
<P>
	Petrenko may not have won, but his performance was memorable. Skating with a
doll strapped to his neck and feet, he elicited waves of laughter as he moved to
the Latino beat of Mambo No. 5, nailing a triple toe loop and double axel.
</P>
<P>
	``It's really difficult to do the jumps with the doll,'' said Petrenko, who had
no name for his inert partner. ``When I first tried it in practice, I fell very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
	France's Philippe Candeloro, who fell in the first five seconds of his tiring
six-minute routine, was fourth and Alexei Urmanov of Russia was fifth. Rudy
Galindo, who was last after the technical program Thursday, withdrew from the
men's singles because of illness.
</P>
<P>
	In dance, Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow of the United States
took gold. The pair, who scored two perfect 10s in the technical portion
Thursday night, received four more Saturday for a total of 197.9.
</P>
<P>
	Taking silver at 197.3 were Maya Usova and Evgeny Platov of Russia, followed by
the Russian team of Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko and Finland's Susanna
Rahkamo and Petri Kokko.
</P>
<P>
	Before Punsalan and Swallow performed, they had to watch as their closest
competitors scored a pair of 10s.
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard to see a perfect score before you go out,'' Punsalan said.
``But we were skating more for the audience and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day in women's skeleton, Royal Air Force intelligence officer
Alex Hamilton won gold. The 26-year-old Hamilton, who won the World Cup title
this year, finished the four runs on her steel sled in 4 minutes, 11.22 seconds,
a little more than a second ahead of Maya Bieri of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kelly of Canada won bronze, edging Lee Ann Parsley of the United
States in a race that featured the top four women in the world.
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped to do well,'' said the Belgian-born Hamilton, who was recruited
for the British team only in 1997. ``But the competition wasn't taken for
granted. We had a good race.''
</P>
<P>
	Kari Traa had a good race, too. The Norwegian freestyle skiing star edged
defending World Cup moguls champion Ann Battelle of the United States for the
gold in the women's moguls at Whiteface Mountain in what has become a budding
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking, go for it,'' said Traa, whose stunning double twister
spread propelled her to victory.
</P>
<P>
	Janne Lahtela of Finland won the men's moguls over Jean-Luc Brassard of Canada.
Ryan Riley of the United States took bronze.
</P>
<P>
	Over on another slope of the mountain, Ian Price and Christopher Klug gave the
United States gold and bronze in the men's snowboarding super-G race. Alexander
Maier of Austria, younger brother of skiing star Hermann Maier, took silver, but
it wasn't so simple, really. Never is with that name.
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's not easy for me,'' Maier said. ``When they say, 'Now comes
Alex, the brother of Hermann Maier,' there is much pressure. Everyone thinks
that you also must make a good place.''
</P>
<P>
	In the Nordic combined, Felix Gottwald of Austria came from behind in the final
sprint to edge teammate Mario Stecher. Stecher, who won the jumping portion of
the event, lost the seven-second lead he had over Gottwald entering the sprint.
Todd Lodwick of the United States took the bronze after blowing his lead on the
last uphill climb.
</P>
<P>
	One day after NASCAR driver Geoffrey Bodine was involved in a horrific crash at
Daytona, Brian Shimer drove his USA-1 bobsled into medal contention after two
runs in the two-man at Mount Van Hoevenberg. Shimer was third behind the leading
sled of Sandis Prusis of Latvia and the Germany-1 sled of Andre Lange.
</P>
<P>
	Bodine, who was listed in serious condition at a Florida hospital with a
concussion, three broken bones and some burns, has been a big supporter of the
U.S. team and helped develop the sleds the team uses.
</P>
<P>
	``The Bo-Dyn sled is flying,'' Shimer said, his voice breaking with the emotion
of the moment. ``I'd like to wish Geoff a speedy recovery. ``He's here with us
this weekend. Geoff, this one's for you.''
</P>
<P>
	Not long after the heat, tragedy struck at nearby Wright's Peak. Six
back-country skiers were trapped at midday by a sudden snowslide. State police
said five were rescued and evacuated by helicopter, but the sixth, 27-year-old
Toma Jacob Vracarich of Lake Placid, was found dead just after nightfall.
</P>
<P>
	Troopers said the five survivors were also from the region.
</P>
<P>
	In men's skeleton, local favorite Jim Shea had a comfortable lead of more than
a second over Snorre Pedersen of Norway and Chris Soule of the United States
after two runs.
</P>
<P>
	Shea, whose grandfather won two speedskating gold medals at the 1932 Winter
Olympics in Lake Placid, did not expect to have a restful night.
</P>
<P>
	``During the World Championships I was a little bit ahead,'' said Shea, who won
that race. ``But in the blink of an eye it could all change. It's nowhere near
over.''
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of it all, Ted Turner announced that the 2005 Winter Goodwill
Games would be staged in Calgary, which at the time will be celebrating the
100th anniversary of the confederation of the province of Alberta.
</P>
<P>
	A host city for 2003 still had not been determined. Sarajevo, site of the 1984
Winter Olympics but since devastated by war, and Salt Lake were possibilities,
Turner said. He would not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in S.C. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into an 18-state sprint over
17 days. McCain was pugnacious, declaring to supporters, ``We have just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved,'' acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. ``Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to regroup, McCain both congratulated Bush for his victory and
criticized the negativity of the governor's campaign. ``I cannot wait for the
next round,'' he said, saying he would offer ``a choice between a record of
reform and an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 301,050 votes, or 53 percent,
to McCain's 237,888 or 42 percent. Alan Keyes was a faraway third at 25,510, or
5 percent. The dramatic campaign pushed primary turnout to a resounding record,
but it didn't help McCain as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pundits were saying a big turnout would be harmful to my candidacy,''
said Bush, ``when in fact this campaign ignited and united the Republican
base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's surge, and indeed for months his
campaign had seen South Carolina as a tradition-minded ``firewall state'' which
could blunt any damage from the chars of New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a
huge lead in early polling but McCain closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only
to see Bush mount a $4 million campaign with help from interest groups and
surrogates who questioned McCain's conservative credentials..
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews conducted by Voter News Service indicated that Bush won by a
lopsided margin among bedrock conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of
10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and Democrats, but the
size of that coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the force that created
his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina with a new energy in our campaign,''
said Bush. '' ... We're on our way to Michigan and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earning 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush had 61 of the 1,034
delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. McCain gained three
delegates, increasing his total to 14 in the AP delegate count.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator will have a quick chance to recover his footing. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, 13 states conduct
GOP contests that could go a long way toward settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan may be a must-win state for McCain, and a poll by the Detroit News
showed the candidates in a tight race. Aides say it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for McCain to overcome Bush's financial and organizational
advantages without a Michigan victory, and they believe the Midwest state will
be friendlier territory. Independents and conservative Democrats in suburban
Detroit will be prime McCain targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some
of his strongest points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively
recruited veterans, but only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man
who rides the ``Straight Talk Express'' didn't score as a reformer and he didn't
fare any better than Bush when voters were asked to name the candidate who says
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the polls closed, McCain advisers began adjusting their
strategy. They decided Saturday night not to make a serious play for Virginia's
56 delegates, shifting resources to Washington, another Feb. 29 primary state
but one with more independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said McCain will campaign through March 7, no matter what happens
before. He will be forced to focus his resources on fewer states than Bush --
with Ohio and California being his foremost targets, because all the delegates
go to the winner of those contests. Bush, meanwhile, is expected to increase his
spending in all 13 states in hopes of spreading McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is a dramatic turnabout for McCain, who stormed out of New
Hampshire and narrowed or closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country,
threatened to undercut the Texans' fund-raising advantage and destroyed his
rival's carefully cultivated image as the only GOP candidate who can win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina exit polling showed that Bush also was able to turn the
tables on negative campaigning. Almost half thought McCain's attacks on Bush
were unfair. And three out of 10 voters had an unfavorable view of McCain --
double the number who felt that way in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was giving no ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him a happy
celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain told supporters. ``He's going to
need it my friends for we have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the
next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   The VNS survey showed that Bush supporters were self-described conservatives
who valued loyalty to the Republican Party. Bush supporters strongly believed
the Confederate flag should fly atop the state Capitol, and the religious right
preferred Bush by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters were divided on their top issue between moral values and
their concern about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides complained when some precincts in were not operational in
Greenville, an area they suspected would be a stronghold for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary week here bustled with the excitement of a heavyweight boxing match,
pitting McCain's populist appeal and political momentum against the sheer weight
of Bush's tough ads, prominent surrogates and deep political organization.
McCain swore off negative TV ads and Bush portrayed McCain as more of a
hypocrite than a reformer and his punches landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had faced the threat of defections from GOP establishment figures if he
lost South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Forced to solidify his base early in South Carolina, the governor made some
tactical decision that could hurt him beyond the state. He visited Bob Jones
University, a hotbed of South Carolina social conservatives that, according to
critics, has a history of intolerance toward blacks and Catholics. Some Bush
advisers fear the trip could hurt him in primary states with large Catholic
populations, such as Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's primary is open, helpful to McCain. Bush is supported by Gov.
John Engler.

Bush Is Victorious in S.C. Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush rallied Republican conservatives
Saturday to defeat Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's GOP primary, snatching
momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into an 18-state sprint over
17 days. "I'm relieved," acknowledged Bush, who was buried in a landslide in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary nearly three weeks ago. "Relieved is not the right
word. I'm excited and energized." McCain was pugnacious, declaring to
supporters, "We have just begun to fight." With 99 percent of the vote counted,
Bush had 301,050 votes, or 53 percent, to McCain's 237,888 or 42 percent. Alan
Keyes was a faraway third at 25,510, or 5 percent.

Veterans' Vote Split in S.C.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina military veterans were a key to John
McCain's strategy of winning the state's Republican presidential primary and he
made them central to his campaign, but McCain and George W. Bush split the
veterans' vote Saturday. More than nine of 10 veterans were men, and they tilted
slightly for McCain. Almost one in 10 veteran voters were women, and they went
slightly for Bush. Veterans' priorities were not a lot different from those of
overall voters in the GOP primary. The veterans picked moral values first and
Social Security second, while taxes and world affairs tied for third.

150,000 Protest Against Haider
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- More than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators crammed
a historic Vienna square on a cold, rainy Saturday evening in the largest
protest yet against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
Vienna police estimated 150,000 people attended the main rally. It ended
peacefully Saturday night after four hours. Anti-government rallies have become
a near-daily practice in Vienna since the new government coalition took office
Feb. 4. The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has
since apologized.

Texas Execution Moratorium Urged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Death-penalty opponents Saturday increased their
pressure on Gov. George W. Bush to declare a moratorium on executions in Texas,
claiming the safeguards against wrongful convictions are inadequate. Activists
held a forum Saturday at the University of Texas and called for an end to
capital punishment. The organizers said they saw new hope for their cause after
Illinois Gov. George Ryan last month said there would be no executions until he
finds out why more death sentences in Illinois have been overturned than carried
out.

U.S. Pushes for Lower Oil Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson received no promises
and little sympathy from Mexico on Saturday, as he began a trip to lobby
oil-producing countries to lift production limits that have sent heating oil
prices soaring in the United States. Mexican officials said they shared
Richardson's concern about inflation, but would respect a "gentlemen's
agreement" with other producers not to increase output before April 1.
Richardson told a news conference after the meeting that U.S. officials were
worried about production levels and the low level of oil inventories.

Man Found Bound in Fraternity Fire

	   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- A man was found bound with duct tape and barricaded
inside a fraternity guest room during a blaze that caused extensive damage. No
one was injured in the fire at the Sigma Nu fraternity house at Washington State
University, but 20 students had to be evacuated from the building, said Fire
Department spokesman Glenn Johnson. The college is investigating "the highly
inappropriate behavior of taping the body and feet of a fraternity member and
leaving him in a guest room in the house," the school's interim provost, Rom
Markin, said in a news release.

	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- A rare avalanche in northern New York's
Adirondacks killed one skier and injured five others Saturday. The avalanche
occurred about 1 p.m. on the northeast side of Wright Peak, on the outskirts of
Lake Placid, Department of Environmental Conservation forest rangers said. Toma
Jacob Vracarich, 27, of Lake Placid was found buried beneath the snow about five

	   SUNRISE (AP) -- Martin Straka scored the eventual game-winning goal early in
the third period to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 2-1 victory over the
Florida Panthers on Saturday night. Aleksey Morozov also scored for the
Penguins, who are 6-1-1 in their last eight games. Jaroslav Spacek scored for
the Panthers, who had their four-game home winning streak snapped in front of
their first sellout crowd of the season.
