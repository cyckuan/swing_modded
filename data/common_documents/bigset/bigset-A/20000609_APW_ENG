<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dave Hansen hit a tiebreaking pinch-homer in
the seventh inning, and Chan Ho Park pitched seven strong innings
for his third straight victory as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the
Houston Astros 5-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a makeup of an April 17 rainout, only the second
game postponed by inclement weather at Dodger Stadium in 12 years,
and just the 17th in the ballpark's 39-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen batted for Park (7-4) with one out and drove a 1-2
breaking pitch from Chris Holt (3-7) just inside the right-field
pole for his third homer -- all as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of Hansen's 20 career homers have come as a substitute
swinger. His home run ended a season-worst string of 36 consecutive
innings without one by the Dodgers, who are on a club-record pace
with 88 in 57 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros, who had two RBIs, made it 4-2 with an RBI
ground-rule double that knocked out Holt with none out in the
eighth. Shawn Green scored moments later on Joe Slusarski's wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed two runs, five hits and three walks, striking out
six. Alan Mills started the eighth and hit his first batter, Craig
Biggio, who rolled the ball back to the mound while Mills walked
toward home plate to get a new one from umpire Chris Guccione.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey followed with a single before Mills struck out
Jeff Bagwell. Terry Adams came in and struck out Ken Caminiti and
retired Moises Alou on a close call at first base after a nice play
behind second by shortstop Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was immediately ejected by umpire Jerry Meals after arguing
the call, then kicked his batting helmet halfway to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters got three outs in the ninth for his first NL save,
and first since 1998 with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the three-time defending NL Central champs'
record to 21-38, worst in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind in the second inning on Alou's seventh
homer, the Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in the third on two-out RBI
singles by Green and Karros, whose hit ended an 0-for-11 career
drought against Holt.
</P>
<P>
   But Biggio led off the sixth with his second homer of the
season, and first in 187 at-bats since April 10 at Enron Field
against Pat Hentgen of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, trying to win consecutive starts for the first time this
season, was charged with five runs and nine hits in seven-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It looked like a scene out of ''Kojak.'' Prior to batting
practice, Mills was on his knees in front of Adams' adjacent
locker, meticulously forming an outline of a dead body with masking
tape on the carpet of the Dodgers' clubhouse. Apparently, Mills
wanted to send a not-so-subtle message to Adams about encroaching
into his space. When Kevin Brown walked by and asked ''Who died?,''
Mills pointed up at the nameplate above Adams' locker. ... The
crowd of 23,648 was the smallest at Dodger Stadium since last Sept.
1, when 23,616 watched Milwaukee beat the Dodgers 5-4. ... Alou's
homer came on the first pitch he saw against the Dodgers this
season. The injury-prone outfielder missed the other five meetings
because of an injured right calf that cost him 16 games.

<HEADLINE> Rail Killer Ties Self to Fla. Crime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- In a letter to a central Florida sheriff,
convicted railroad killer Angel Maturino Resendiz admitted killing
two teens in his district three years ago and gave details about
the slayings that investigators said no one but the killer and
investigators would know.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot say 100 percent he did it,'' Maj. Patti Lumpkin,
supervisor of the Marion County Sheriff's major crimes unit, said
in Friday's Ocala Star-Banner. ''Until we have all the facts,
interview Resendiz in person, we just cannot say right now. We do
not want to pin a murder on him just because he has been convicted
of another.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz wrote to the Marion County Sheriff's office
that the killings occurred on the railroad tracks between Tampa and
Baldwin, which is about 20 miles east of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks run through Belleview, where 19-year-old Jesse Howell
was found slain on March 23, 1997. His 16-year-old traveling
companion, Wendy VonHuben, was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have never made public what type of weapon was
used to fatally beat Howell, but Maturino Resendiz correctly
identified the weapon in his letter, officials told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   They said Maturino Resendiz provided two maps in his recently
received letter that showed where he says he killed the man and
buried the girl, but they said the maps were not specific enough.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 39, was sentenced to death in Texas last
month for the 1998 rape and murder of a Houston-area doctor. His
lawyers have conceded that he killed eight other people in Texas,
Illinois and Kentucky. All were killed at or near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Marion investigators have long considered Maturino Resendiz
their leading suspect in Howell's death and VonHuben's
disappearance. The day before Howell was killed, Maturino Resendiz
was issued a trespass warning by railroad officials at a switching
station 90 miles north of Belleview.
</P>
<P>
   Marion detectives traveled to Texas in July to interview
Maturino Resendiz, but his lawyers blocked their interview attempt.
Investigators did not say when they will attempt to interview him
again.

<HEADLINE> Stars, Devils Scoreless in OT  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils, in their
first attempt to wrest the Stanley Cup from Dallas, played into the
early morning with the Stars after the teams failed to score
through five full periods Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey holds a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and one
more victory will clinch the second Cup in Devils' history. Dallas,
the defending champion, lost two straight games at home after
splitting the first two at New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were kept in the game during the second overtime by
goalie Martin Brodeur, who time and time again kept the puck out of
the net while the Stars dominated his seemingly fatigued teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas mounted serious charges in the final five minutes of the
period, including consecutive possessions in which Brodeur made
multiple stops. Guy Carbonneau sent a shot in that Brodeur stopped,
but left a rebound in front. Mike Keane and Brenden Morrow were
there but couldn't convert.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had 12 shots in the period, two more than they had in
the third period and first overtime combined. By the end of the
second overtime, the game became the fifth longest in finals
history. Thirteen have required overtime and four have ended
series. It was the only eighth overtime in the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Ed Belfour made 45 saves through five periods.
</P>
<P>
   For a while in the first overtime, the Stars seemed to be
hanging on as the Devils roamed around their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Nemchinov nearly ended it four minutes in when his shot
slipped past Belfour and just missed getting inside the post. Bobby
Holik, around the puck and the net all night, had the puck get past
him when Claude Lemieux fed a pass on a 2-on-1 eight minutes in.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas recovered to have more of the better chances late. Jere
Lehtinen swatted a pass from Mike Modano, but his shot flew over
the New Jersey goal. The Devils, who have outshot Dallas in each
game, took 37 shots through the first overtime to the Stars' 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who held a 27-22 shots advantage in the first three
periods, had not gone into overtime in 22 straight playoff games,
dating to last season. Dallas is 1-0 in overtime in these playoffs,
beating Colorado in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly in the third period, the tight-checking teams
played fairly wide open -- creating numerous scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the period was mostly played in the Devils
zone, where Brodeur kept the Stars off the board. Dallas' best
chance came with 10:51 left when Grant Marshall was denied by
Brodeur who made a sliding pad stop on a shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull set up Lehtinen three minutes later, but his shot
from in front sailed wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had a fruitless 2-on-1 chance when rookie Scott Gomez
couldn't beat Belfour. Holik was stopped by Belfour in front after
a 3-on-2.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey had the third period's only power play, when Morrow
went off for foolishly tripping Scott Niedermayer on a Dallas rush
into the offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora went off with 5:17 left in the second when he hit
Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor with a high stick. Dallas registered
three shots with the man advantage, including one by Lehtinen that
Brodeur stopped by stacking his pads.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2:59 remaining in the second, Lehtinen hit Patrik
Elias with his stick and was sent off. Holik, who earlier hit the
post, was denied by Belfour's right pad. A rebound attempt hit the
outside the net.
</P>
<P>
   Holik's try was New Jersey's only shot on goal with the man
advantage, but the Devils outshot the Stars 11-6 in the middle
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' best opportunities in the first came on their first
and last charges into the Dallas zone.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo's quick deflection of Lemieux's shot 2:03 in was
stopped by Belfour, who made seven saves in the period. New Jersey
also had a 2-on-1 break during the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took 11 shots on Brodeur. Marshall took two pokes at a
rebound midway through the period, but Brodeur was able to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Each team spent 42 seconds on the power play in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is trying to become the first team since Vancouver in
1994 to win an elimination game in the finals. Six teams have
captured the Stanley Cup with 1-0 victories, the last was Colorado,
which swept Florida in 1996 when Uwe Krupp scored in the third
overtime of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the Cup last year in six games when Hull beat the
Buffalo Sabres late in the third overtime with a controversial
goal.

<HEADLINE> House Aims To Fight Money Laundering  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government would be able to ban some
transactions between U.S. banks and offshore havens under
legislation to fight money laundering that has cleared the House
Banking Committee and appears headed toward House passage.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's vote Thursday came as a trial opened in Florida of
five people accused of participating in a money-laundering and
investment scam that allegedly bilked some 400 victims, including
Dionne Warwick, of $60 million. The case, dubbed ''Operation Risky
Business,'' which used a Caribbean bank, is said to be the biggest
money-laundering case not involving drugs ever pursued by the U.S.
Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Most money laundering involves illicit profits from drug
trafficking, prostitution or other criminal activities, which are
moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts to make them
appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering absorbs nearly $600 billion annually, or up to
5 percent of the world's gross domestic product. Public attention
focused on money laundering after last summer's revelations that
the Bank of New York, one of the nation's largest, had served as a
conduit for an astonishing $7 billion in Russian money, some of it
believed to be from criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Committee voted, 31-1, to approve the legislation,
the fruit of cooperation between the Clinton administration and key
Republican lawmakers. It combines earlier anti-money-laundering
proposals from the administration and Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the
banking panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation will give the Secretary of the Treasury
additional tools to root out international money-laundering havens,
which are used to funnel dirty money ... into the legitimate
international financial network,'' Leach said before the vote.
''Unfortunately, the U.S. banking system is hardly immune from the
dirty money that flows all too freely through the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the Treasury Department the power to ask
U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an offshore bank or financial company. In cases
where foreign governments shield banks from investigation, Treasury
would have the authority to cut them off from the U.S. financial
system without seeking congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in a speech in March,
identified Russia, Colombia and Nigeria as among the biggest
sources of illicit money. He named the Caribbean islands of
Dominica and Antigua, Nauru in the South Pacific and Liechtenstein
in Europe as some of the leading money-laundering centers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Summers called the Banking Committee vote ''a
significant step forward in our fight to protect the U.S. financial
system against international money laundering and to confront those
countries that serve as ready havens to hide and move dirty money
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote sent the bill to the full House, but the Senate has yet
to act on similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Risky Business'' case, law enforcement officials say
the defendants set up a bank on Antigua to hide profits from their
scam, which offered venture capital loans in ads in major U.S.
newspapers. Prospective borrowers, including Warwick, were asked to
pay ''advance fees'' ranging from $50,000 to $900,000, and to sign
a contract requiring them to obtain a letter of credit from a bank
for $2 million to $20 million -- within a week -- as a guarantee for
the loan.
</P>
<P>
   When the borrowers were unable to get letters of credit that
quickly, they were told they had violated the contract and their
''advance fees'' were taken from them, according to law enforcement
officials. Some people involved in the scheme already have pleaded
guilty. The trial of five defendants opened in federal court in
Gainesville, Fla., this week.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Warwick was approached in January
1996 by someone offering her a contract for a venture capital loan
for her design company, and she agreed to pay $100,000 as an
''advance fee.'' Warwick later was told she was in default of the
contract and she was unable to recover the $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Suffers Through Drought  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Much of Florida's emerald landscape has
turned brown, its wells are being tapped dry and sinkholes have
opened up, swallowing parts of houses, streets and back yards.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlanta metropolitan area, the state has imposed tough
water-use restrictions for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Southeast, farmers are watching their crops wither in
the fields, and cattle are being sent to the slaughterhouse now
because soon there may be nothing for the animals to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast is in the grip of a drought the likes of which
some states have not seen in generations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Chris Gonzalez used to treasure their pond stocked
with fish and waterfowl at their home near Tampa. All they see
these days are buzzards circling overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come for the dead fish,'' Robert Gonzalez said. ''There
isn't enough water to keep the fish alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought extends from South Carolina through Georgia,
Alabama, Florida, Gulf Coast Louisiana and parts of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Along Florida's Gulf Coast, it has been the driest spring since
at least 1915, when records were first kept. The drought index in
some counties there rivals that of Arizona's deserts, and tourists
are being asked to use their towels twice so hotel laundry rooms
can save water.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has posted the driest May this year since 1895. Some
streams have run dry and rivers are at record lows.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, farmers have stopped planting cotton and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Speir, a farmer in Georgia's Terrell County, said he has
lost 130 acres of corn and may lose 300 acres of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leaves on the corn are like paper. It'll just crumble in
your hand,'' Speir said.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, produce farmer Mike Donnell has seen his crops die
in the field and had to feed his prize tomatoes, ruined by dry rot,
to the hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another week and another week would come and the weather
people would say it was going to rain on the weekend,'' Donnell
said. ''And week after week we would be missed by the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists would like to promise that relief will come soon, but
they can't.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is we don't really know where we are headed,''
said Granville Kinsman, manager of water data at the Southwest
Florida Water Management District, which oversees much of the
state's Gulf Coast. ''It might be over next year, it might last 10
years. Historical records show there are droughts that last 100
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought is believed to be a result of La Nina, the cooling
phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean that produces warmer winters and
drier-than-normal conditions in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama state officials are preparing to use the National Guard
to dispense drinking water in towns where wells are in danger of
running dry. Plans are also being made to ask trucking companies to
help haul hay from dry, but not critical, northern Alabama into
southern Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural officials in Florida plan to ask the federal
government to declare a disaster, allowing farmers to receive
relief money.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the summer rains begin to fall soon, most of the crops
are already destroyed, said Whit Chase of the Florida Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranchers are reporting the grass in their pastures is
gone. Northern Florida's hay crop is badly damaged, and that will
force ranchers to buy hay from other states at much higher prices.
Ranchers are culling their herds by selling calves to market early.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Svoboda, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation
Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said some relief will
come with the summer tropical storm season. But other experts said
it will take more than the normal rainfall to correct the damage
that has been done.

<HEADLINE> Japan Carpentry Traditions Revived  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Shinichi Yasuda sinks his bamboo plume into
glistening coal dust and marks lines on a wooden block with the
care of a calligrapher.
</P>
<P>
   As power saws shriek and swirl nearby, he goes about his trade
the traditional way, using many of the manual tools that built the
temples of Kyoto and carrying on techniques passed on by his
father, who stands by sternly as he works.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuda and other younger people like him are at the center of a
revival of interest in Japan's traditional methods of woodworking
and architecture. But while preserving the past, the new generation
of carpenters is carving out a style all its own.
</P>
<P>
   For a glimpse of Japanese street fashions, look no further than
the urban building site: Young workers with dyed hair, baggy pants
and bright bandanas balance confidently on wooden foundation beams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yasuda father-and-son team is a study in contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Jiro looks every bit the traditional artisan
with a cloth wrapped around his head, weathered knickerbockers and
thonged sandals. Shinichi, 40, wouldn't be out of place in a trendy
nightclub with his flowing ponytail, Converse sneakers and smart
green windbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working outside in the freezing cold of winter and the heat of
summer is extremely hard, but in many ways you have more freedom,''
said Shinichi Yasuda. ''You can go home when you want and wear what
you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpentry colleges and workshops are gaining popularity as young
people increasingly shun the suit-and-tie office jobs that were the
ideal of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people don't feel they have to enter a big corporation
and feel freer to choose their profession according to what
interests them,'' said Isao Sakamoto, an architecture professor at
Tokyo University.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled carpenters became a rarity in the postwar era when Japan
lost faith in its traditions and embraced things Western --
including the prefab dwellings that have become more characteristic
of the urban landscape than winged eaves and cypress lintels.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a movement is afoot to ensure that the construction
methods Yasuda learned from his father do not die out.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the war, attitudes toward Japanese culture swung 180
degrees, and everything had to be new,'' said Kazuhiro Kiyosawa, a
director of the Minka, or rustic home, Reuse and Recycle
Association. ''But people are getting fed up with the postwar
disposable society.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiyosawa's association, a network that restores abandoned
farmhouses, has attracted more than 1,300 applications from people
seeking to live in traditional homes listed in the group's
database. It gets about 100 new requests a month.
</P>
<P>
   About 88 percent of Japanese say their ideal dwelling is made of
wood. Of those, nearly 70 percent said they would like to live in a
home built in the traditional Japanese style, according to a 1999
survey conducted by the Prime Minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Japan's spare building aesthetic on giants of
modern architecture from Frank Lloyd Wright to Germany's Bauhaus
school is well known. But the manual tools used in building the
structures are also the stuff of legend among Western woodworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Japanese carpenters shun sandpaper and instead
finish surfaces with the ''kanna,'' or block plane, that curls up
yards-long ribbons of wood a fraction of an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels and saws evolved into high-precision tools that allowed
carpenters to create the puzzle-like mortise and tenon joints that
held structures together without the use of nails or glue.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects traditional wooden structures to return to the
prominence they once enjoyed in Japan, largely because of the time
and expense involved in building homes the old way.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the drafty corridors and poor insulation of
traditional homes with modern amenities is also costly. And there
is always the fire risk that wooden buildings pose in a land
crisscrossed by earthquake fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   Those disadvantages aside, the resurgence of interest in
Japanese carpentry and the country's new breed of craftsmen have
raised hope that time-honored building techniques will remain
alive, a vibrant part of Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more and more people who even as a hobby are trying
to learn ancient techniques, like whetting and planing and creating
their own works,'' said Hiroshi Okimoto, of the Takenaka Carpentry
Tools Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difference in style, Yasudas senior and junior
share similar ideas about their trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carpenters throw away bad tools and keep using the good ones
for decades,'' says Shinichi. ''That's the way Japanese should
think of building -- you should preserve the things of true value.''
</P>
<P>
   His father smiles and nods.

<HEADLINE> Activists Senounce Widows' Death  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In Tanzania, at least 500 widows were
stoned to death or otherwise killed as suspected witches over the
past year, women's activists say, while in parts of Nigeria widows
are not allowed to wash for an entire year after their husband's
death to prove they did not kill him.
</P>
<P>
   These are just two examples of the harrowing plight of widows
denounced by grass-roots groups at a panel Thursday on the myths
and realities of widowhood.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Africa and south Asia face a kind of ''social death''
when their husbands die: They are disinherited, rejected, even
raped or killed, according to activists at the U.N. women's
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when they are most vulnerable, in the shock of
losing their husbands, they are systematically hounded from their
homes, robbed of their household possessions, and forced into
destitution by male relatives, usually on the husband's side,''
said Margaret Owen of Empowering Widows in Development, a
London-based group that tries to create networks of widows to
improve their status.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, for example, only 25 percent of widows actually
receive any share of their husband's estate, said Owen, the author
of a study on widowhood across the world.
</P>
<P>
   In certain areas of Africa, the widows themselves are seen as
part of their husband's inheritance, said Eleonor Nwadinobi,
president of the Nigeria-based Widows Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Widows have no succession rights to their husband's property
because they are chattels to be inherited along with land and
household property by the deceased's brother,'' said Nwadinobi,
describing the results of case studies in southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, even the custody of a widow's children is
transferred to her husband's family, said Joanna Foster, regional
coordinator of the Zimbabwe-based Women in Law and Development in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, a widow may be forced to sit on the floor -- at times
half naked -- for 28 days, said Nwadinobi. She will then be forced
to wear black clothes for a year and not allowed to bathe.
</P>
<P>
   After that time, women are brought to a river to be purified and
their clothes are burned.
</P>
<P>
   Widows have been left off the agenda at this week's U.N. General
Assembly special session to accelerate progress toward women's
equality, attended by ministers from more 180 countries, advocates
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Widows are noticeable only by their absence'' from the
150-page platform for action adopted at the 1995 U.N. women's
conference in Beijing, and from the final document that will emerge
from this week's follow-up session, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a silence about the number of women who are murdered
because they are widows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania last year, Owen noted, at least 500 widows ''accused
of being witches were stoned to death or killed in other terrible
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Widows are targets because they are suspected of having killed
their husbands, or because they have already experienced sex but
are no longer linked to a man, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of attention means there are few statistics relating to
widowhood, but the numbers appear to be increasing as AIDS and wars
sweep through Africa, activists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a number of countries in South Asia and Africa, in
particular those affected by the AIDS pandemic or armed conflict
and ethnic cleansing, as many as 70 percent of all adult women may
be widows,'' Owen said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Family Awaits Soldier Return  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Stranded in thick fog as their boat
drifted off the coast 13 years ago, a dozen South Korean fishermen
suddenly found themselves in the hands of the North Korean navy.
They have never come home.
</P>
<P>
   The families of those fishermen and hundreds more believed to be
abducted by the communist North have felt helpless in face of
decades-old enmity between the two countries that has all but
closed off any negotiations for their release. Now, with leaders of
the Koreas planning to meet next week, some cautiously hope for
news of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the landmark summit might lead to
reconciliation cheered the family of Choi Jong-suk, one of the
fishermen seized in January 1987. It is unclear, however, whether
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung will raise that case and others
when he meets Kim Jong Il, his North Korean counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ''My long-dead hope was rekindled when I heard of the summit,''
said Choi's 29-year-old daughter, Woo-young.
</P>
<P>
   She heads the Family Action to Rescue Abductees in North Korea,
a group formed shortly after the April announcement of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, North Korea offered to exchange Choi and the other
fishermen for a family of 11 North Koreans who had defected to
South Korea. Seoul rejected the offer and Pyongyang responded by
accusing the crewmen of spying and refusing to repatriate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seoul government says North Korea has abducted 3,756 South
Koreans since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. All but 454 of
them -- mostly fishermen -- were sent back to the South.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang has denied kidnappings or detaining citizens of the
South, calling the allegations a smear campaign. There have been no
reported abductions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say North Korea has kidnapped South Koreans for use as
instructors to train spies, foreigners as language teachers or
simply as tools of Pyongyang's propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Kim has said he and Kim Jong Il should discuss any
issue at the June 12-14 summit. The reunion of separated families,
economic aid for the North from the South and the North's nuclear
and missile programs are expected to be among the topics.
</P>
<P>
   But the families of South Koreans believed to be held in the
North have tried to keep their hopes in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it won't be too long before my husband comes back home.
But if it is impossible, I would like to know at least if he is
alive and healthy,'' said 52-year-old Lee Yon-soon, who believes
her husband, Ahn Seung-woon, was kidnapped by northern agents in
July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ahn, a Protestant pastor, was working at a church in China when
he disappeared. The Pyongyang government said Ahn defected to North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But South Korean church officials believe agents of the North
abducted him as a warning to activists in the South who helped
North Koreans illegally staying in China to seek food and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Among South Koreans who were seized by North Korea were 12
people aboard a Korean Air plane that was hijacked in 1969 and 20
sailors taken from a navy boat in 1970, Seoul officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, South Korean film director Shin Sang-ok was
abducted by North Korean agents during a visit to Hong Kong. He
escaped to the West in 1986 after making several films, including
''Pulgasari,'' a North Korean version of ''Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials also say some 40,000 South Korean prisoners of
war never returned home after the Korean War. Citing defectors,
they say 300 POWs are believed to be still living in the North.
Pyongyang denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is also demanding that North Korea provide information
about 10 missing Japanese citizens allegedly abducted by North
Korean spies in Japan more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, meanwhile, several dozen convicted North Korean
spies also want to go home after serving long prison terms. In
1993, Seoul sent former North Korean guerrilla Ri In Mo home in a
humanitarian gesture. North Korea responded by denouncing Seoul for
allegedly torturing Ri and keeping him in jail for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, South Korea has halted repatriation of convicted
northern spies.

<HEADLINE> Date Rape Drug Found With Criminal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A sex offender pleaded guilty to a
federal drug charge after authorities said he bought a 55-gallon
drum containing 98,000 doses of a substance used to manufacture the
''date rape'' drug GHB.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Roth faces up to 20 years in prison when sentenced Aug.
29. Convicted in 1995 of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under
16, he pleaded guilty Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Kenneth
Ryskamp to one count of possession with intent to distribute GHB.
</P>
<P>
   GHB is a colorless, odorless drug that sells for $5 to $10 a
dose. A teaspoon of the compound, mixed with alcohol, can render a
person unconscious within 20 minutes. Victims frequently have no
memory of what happened and the drug is difficult to trace, often
leaving the body within 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Bug Bombs Make People Sick  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Automatic pesticide dispensers used in
restaurants and other public places have sickened 97 people over 13
years, according to government researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The illnesses occurred from 1986 to 1999 and most of them
resulted when the dispensers were placed within 12 feet of food
handling, dining or work areas, the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said Thursday. In some cases the devices
were placed too close to ventilation currents.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first to document pesticide-related illnesses
caused by the automatic dispensers, commonly used in schools,
hotels, offices, supermarkets, hospitals, day-care centers and
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said the devices can reduce the number of flying insects
when used properly but can be a health hazard when they malfunction
or are installed improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Dispensers typically are set to automatically spray a mist of
insecticide every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals can cause various health problems ranging from
dermatitis and eye irritation to asthma, dizziness and vomiting.

<HEADLINE> High Schoolers Report More Drug Use  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite years of government-funded media
campaigns urging teen-agers to stay clean and sober, cocaine,
marijuana and cigarette use among high school students increased
during the 1990s, according to a new federal study.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol use has remained steady since 1991 and other risky
behavior was down among teens, according to the study released
Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fewer teens are having sex and those who do are
more likely to use condoms. Additionally, more students wear seat
belts and fewer are carrying weapons or contemplating suicide, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is reason to feel optimistic about many of the trends in
risk behaviors among our young people,'' CDC Director Jeffrey
Koplan said. ''However, we have much left to do. Too many of our
children are still engaging in activities that put them at risk for
health problems now and into adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Every two years since 1991, the CDC has distributed
questionnaires to a scientific sampling of students to measure
behavior that endangers their health. The current survey involved
15,349 students in grades nine through 12.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 14.7 percent of students surveyed said they use
marijuana. That number steadily increased to 26.7 percent in 1999.
Students who said they have tried marijuana at least once increased
from 31.3 percent to 47.2 percent over the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 1.7 percent of the students surveyed said they used
cocaine at least once in the prior month. By 1999, that number rose
to 4 percent. Those who had at least tried cocaine increased from
5.9 percent in 1991 to 9.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Simon, spokesman for the New York-based Partnership for a
Drug-Free America, said the past decade brought increased drug use
among teen-agers, but he expects more recent figures will show
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reversed those trends and started to edge back down
just in the last year,'' he said. ''But don't get me wrong, we're
still at the top of a very dangerous and disturbing mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also suggests that more teens appear to be smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 27.5 percent of the students surveyed reported they had
smoked at least once in the previous month. That increased to 36.4
percent in 1997 then dropped to 34.8 percent last year. Frequent
cigarette use climbed from 12.7 percent to 16.8 percent over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think 35 percent is alarmingly high, especially with all
that we know about the devastating affects of tobacco use,'' said
Cassandra Welch, spokeswoman for the American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   She said the indication that tobacco use may have peaked in 1997
is a good sign that efforts to discourage smoking may be working.
</P>
<P>
   In other trends, fewer high school students said they have had
sex, a trend that gradually decreased from 54.1 percent in 1991 to
49.9 percent in 1999. The number of students who said they were
currently sexually active remained fairly consistent since 1991 at
around 36 percent. However, more reported using a condom -- 58
percent in 1999 compared to 46.2 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer students also reported having had four or more sex
partners and 90.6 percent reported having been taught about AIDS in
school in 1999, an increase over the 83.3 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 29 percent of the high school students reported
contemplating suicide, a trend that gradually declined to 19.3
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Family Battles Over Transplant  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- No matter how you do the math, it never
adds up for Brandy Stroeder -- or Gov. John Kitzhaber, or Brandy's
doctors, or the Oregon Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for 18-year-old Brandy, who needs a $250,000
combination liver and lung transplant her family cannot afford and
the health plan refuses to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Without the procedure, the teen will die from cystic fibrosis, a
genetic disorder that fills lungs with mucus and kills its victims
just when they should be blossoming into young adults.
</P>
<P>
   With it, the odds are that Brandy will still die young -- but,
doctors say, it could buy her precious time, maybe even a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan created by Kitzhaber, a former emergency room
doctor, Oregon became the first state in the nation to combine
state and federal funding to form a safety net for the sick who
cannot afford medical care. The system supports about 350,000 poor,
disabled and uninsured state residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature decided the only way it can afford to pay for
coverage is by drawing up a list that ranks treatment according to
the medical odds -- the best chances of recovery go to the top and
the worst drop to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Other numbers are factors, too, such as how many people would
benefit. The more who would be helped, the better the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   In Brandy's case, the cost is high and the benefits apply to
just a tiny handful of people. The governor says the numbers don't
add up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tragedy brought about by the reality of limited public
resources,'' said Kitzhaber, who has backed the decision of the
state Office of Medical Assistance Programs to deny coverage for
the double transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as simple as one plus one equals two,'' said Hersh
Crawford, the agency's director.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get into multiple organ transplants, you get into a
more complicated medical outcome,'' he said. ''Multiple organ
transplant surgery is not being done at the level as single organ
transplantation is being done today, and it does not have the long
history of single transplant procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandy's family has gone to court to overturn that decision. A
preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 15 in McMinnville, the
teen's home town, where she graduates from high school the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Frank Weiss, is seeking an injunction ordering an
evaluation at Stanford University Medical Center to determine
whether she's a good candidate for the procedure. If Stanford,
which has never performed the combined transplant, decides she
qualifies, she could be placed on the organ recipient list.
</P>
<P>
   If a judge denies the request, Weiss will have to turn to the
Oregon Court of Appeals. He fears a decision may come too late to
help Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it doesn't happen soon, it could be a hollow victory,''
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, only six
liver-lung transplants were performed nationally in 1998, the
latest available figures. In France in 1995, 10 such operations
were performed. Seven of the patients survived at least a year,
providing the best evidence of success so far.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the numbers, the decision should rest on medical
judgment, not policy, according to Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, a health
policy researcher with the University of California at San
Francisco who has studied the Oregon Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   He said every health-care system wastes money on administration
and ineffective treatment, so it is not a question of saving
$250,000 on Brandy and putting it to use for other patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cost-effectiveness analysis is not rocket science,''
Bodenheimer said. ''It's just numbers. Sometimes you have to ask
whether this will help this individual patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandy's mother, Karen Stroeder, who works two jobs to support
her two children, said Brandy just wants a chance to start her
dream of becoming a chef and maybe even run a bed-and-breakfast inn
some day.
</P>
<P>
   She said a policy that pays for transporting heroin addicts to
clinics for methadone treatment but refuses to pay for a
life-or-death operation for a teen-ager needs to be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the way Brandy and I both look at it is, if it doesn't
help her, it will help another kid down the line,'' Stroeder said.
''There will be another kid that will get a chance at life.''

<HEADLINE> DNA Legislation Pushed For  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A week after Gov. George W. Bush delayed an
execution to give a death row inmate time for new DNA tests,
lawmakers promised to pursue a law that would give inmates access
to the tests during appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation is approved next year, Texas would join New
York and Illinois in permitting DNA testing during appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Touting DNA as ''an incredible tool in the fight for justice,''
Democratic state Sen. Rodney Ellis said measures he will propose
will include a provision allowing post-conviction DNA testing of
evidence if identity was an issue at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the state is to administer the ultimate penalty -- the death
sentence -- then Texas law must allow for this important technology
to be used in appeals,'' Ellis said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Sen. David Sibley, a former prosecutor, joined
Ellis in backing the DNA measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most fair-minded people in the United States and the
state of Texas would not object to all evidence being tested, and
especially if it might prove that we have the wrong person in
prison,'' Sibley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has drawn
criticism for overseeing the busiest execution house in the nation.
Last week, he issued a 30-day stay of execution to convicted killer
Ricky Nolen McGinn so a DNA test could be performed on evidence in
his case.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's first such move since he became governor in 1995.
He has also pardoned three people who were wrongly convicted and
later cleared by DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones said Thursday it is too early to say
whether the governor would back the post-conviction DNA testing law
the senators are proposing.

<HEADLINE> Inmate's Complaints May Be Used  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Complaints that an execution by
injection took too long and caused the condemned man unnecessary
pain may be used in an appeal by the next convict scheduled to die
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Thomas Provenzano, who is set to die June 20, said
Wednesday's execution of Bennie Demps raised the question of the
state's ability to properly carry out an execution.
</P>
<P>
   While strapped to a gurney before his death, Demps said: ''They
butchered me back there. ... I was in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps complained that officials took nearly an hour to prepare
him for execution and that they cut his groin and leg to look for a
vein into which they could insert an intravenous tube.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Rod Smith said an observer from his office
watched as a medical examiner looked over Demps' body. There was a
large-bore needle mark in the right groin and a small incision in
the right ankle. Puncture wounds were found in the right and left
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to locate veins as quickly as possible, but if we
don't, we take as much time as we need,'' Department of Corrections
spokeswoman Debra Buchanan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Florida switched to lethal injection from electrocution in
January to stave off a U.S. Supreme Court review of whether the old
method was constitutional. In previous years, an inmate in the
electric chair bled from the nose and another had flames shoot from
his mask.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Reiter, an attorney for Provenzano, said he would
investigate whether Demps' lethal injection should be part of his
client's appeal. Provenzano, 50, faces execution for a murder 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Sayfie, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush, said Demps'
execution proceeded appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a slight delay but other than the delay the
execution was carried out according to law,'' Sayfie said. ''And we
don't believe there's any need to investigate a successful
execution.''

<HEADLINE> Argentina Economic Plan Defended  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- As workers pressed ahead with
plans for a national work stoppage, Argentine President Fernando De
la Rua defended his contentious austerity package of higher taxes
and spending cuts as a step toward economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, speaking at the Government House after announcing a
new agreement to boost agricultural exports, said that ''right now
what's important is to bring news like this that the country is
growing, progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike isn't justified and it's no good for the
country,'' he said of the nationwide walkoff planned for today.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Argentine workers were preparing to stay home in a
one-day protest against De la Rua's cost-cutting moves to revive
Argentina's faltering economy, mired in a 22-month-old recession
that has sent joblessness to 14 percent. If as widely adhered to as
expected, the strike stood to be one of the most severe in years --
keeping thousands of bus, subway, railway and airline operators
home, forcing hospitals to run on skeleton crews and leaving many
stores shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is the latest in a series of union-organized
demonstrations which have mottled De la Rua's first six months in
office. It marks the second nationwide walkout this year: Thousands
of bus drivers, teachers, garbage collectors and state employees
stayed home May 9.
</P>
<P>
   The latest protest was sparked by De la Rua's May 29
announcement of a new round of spending cuts aimed at resuscitating
South America's second-largest economy. He called for sharp cuts in
state salaries and state pensions to trim a $7.1 billion deficit by
$2.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   That and other cost-cutting moved are designed in part to help
Argentina maintain access to standby funds from the International
Monetary Fund, if necessary. Shortly after taking office in
December, De la Rua pushed through an unpopular tax hike and labor
reform which helped Argentina secure a $7.4 billion standby loan.
</P>
<P>
   Days ahead of today's planned strike, leaflets were plastered
throughout Buenos Aires urging people to take part. Labor union
groups placed newspaper ads appealing to workers to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   In an ad headlined ''Why we're striking,'' one group charged
that recent salary cuts were unfairly digging into the pockets of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe ... reform should be done with and by the people,
not against them,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Moyano, the leader of hardline unions driving the walkout,
on Thursday denounced the government's austerity moves but said
union leaders were willing to negotiate with the government on
revising De la Rua's plan.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a five-point program calling for a subsidy for 1
million unemployed heads of household, an increase in retirees'
pensions and the minimum wage, the elimination of a value-added tax
on basic goods and a tax and tariff structure that he said would
encourage growth. He didn't say how such a plan would be financed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there would be more stoppages after today's, he
responded: ''That doesn't depend on us. We don't want more strikes
and we hope there are no more strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage comes ahead of De la Rua's first official
visit to the United States. He is to meet with Wall Street
financiers Monday in New York and President Clinton on Tuesday in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Rights an Issue at Conference  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With leaders demanding faster progress
toward women's equality and a deadline looming, delegates at the
U.N. women's conference here worked to resolve issues that have
divided them, including sexual rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators met into the wee hours Thursday to try to finish a
final document before the deadline, set for midnight tonight. They
reported some progress but were still far from consensus on many of
the same reproductive and sexual health issues that dominated the
landmark 1995 U.N. women's conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing concern that the document produced by this gathering
might retreat from the ambitious 150-page platform adopted in
Beijing, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made an unusual plea to
the delegates from 180 countries Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general urges all member states to work together
in a spirit of cooperation to ensure that the gains made by women
in Beijing five years ago are consolidated, protected and advanced
further,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Annan's call for a ''forward-looking'' document,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the special U.N. General
Assembly session that the meeting ''and obliges us to chart a path
that will lead to ever-more rapid progress in the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health
Coalition, said all the separate negotiating groups ''expressed a
desire to come out with a good, comprehensive document'' when they
met Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens in the divided atmosphere here remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western nations have crossed swords with the Vatican and a
handful of Islamic and Catholic countries -- including Libya,
Algeria, Iran, Sudan and Nicaragua -- over parts of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and a number of conservative countries object to the
Beijing platform's reference to nontraditional families, which they
view as an implied blessing of homosexual unions, single parents
and couples living together out of wedlock. And a coalition of
anti-abortion and religious activists have blamed rich Western
nations for pushing ''radical language'' on abortion, sexual rights
and homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pro-Beijing activists have accused the Vatican and
the handful of Islamic and Catholic countries of blocking consensus
on the final document.
</P>
<P>
   Germain, a member of the U.S. delegation to Beijing, said
important unresolved issues include adolescents' access to
reproductive and sexual health services, women's rights to have
access to safe abortions in countries where it is legal. References
to sexual rights and sexuality also remain bracketed, indicating
disputed language.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, delegates have agreed on strong planks
calling for AIDS education programs for adolescents, education
programs to enable men to practice safe, responsible sexual
behavior and greater focus on reducing maternal deaths. Activists
said the follow-up document also calls for prosecution of all forms
of domestic violence, now including marital rape, and asks
governments to consider gender-related persecution and violence as
grounds for asylum.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Items up for Auction  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of items
used in film and television productions went on the auction block
Thursday as the oldest prop house in Hollywood began a five-day
sale of its million-item inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Props &AMP; Graphics is closing after 92 years in business
because rentals are declining as film and TV production
increasingly leaves Los Angeles, said Keith Burns, a consultant for
auction organizer Remarketing Associates.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile items included a life preserver used in
''Titanic,'' and one of Darth Vader's light sabers from ''Star
Wars.'' The light saber, a backup prop that wasn't used in any of
the films, fetched $8,000, the most paid for any item on the first
day of the auction, said Ellis spokeswoman Cathy Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Other items recalled decades of Saturday matinees: assorted
skeletons and boxes of bones, an electric chair, a Radio Flyer
wagon, a fake buffalo on wheels, patrol car light bars, ship
anchors, a ''plasma ray gun'' and assorted drums, mummies and Army
canteens.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the offerings was much more ordinary: salt shakers,
books, canes, costume jewelry, bicycles, eyeglasses, typewriters,
grandfather clocks and suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 people bid in person at the Universal Hilton and many
others took part online during the auction's first day.
</P>
<P>
   The vast collection was acquired beginning in 1908, when a pawn
shop, Ellis Mercantile, began renting merchandise to early
filmmakers. According to Ellis Props, it began when a studio
employee wanted to buy a glass eye. The pawn shop decided to rent
it in case the owner returned, and it continued the practice with
other items.
</P>
<P>
   ''The props are irresistible, you really feel like you want to
make a movie,'' said Susan Zatarain, who went to a preview
Wednesday in the dim and dusty building in search of posters or
anything else ''that strikes me as being interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prop houses, including History for Hire and Disney
Imagineering, sent buyers to the auction.
</P>
<P>
   An antique phone sold for $3,800, and Laverne's suitcase from
the ''Laverne and Shirley'' show sold for $500.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-barrel Gatling gun used by Clint Eastwood in ''The
Outlaw Josey Wales'' is expected to sell for more than $35,000,
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not all the items were actually used in movies or TV
productions could not be authenticated because some of the records
were destroyed by a previous owner, said Jeri Dubner of Remarketing
Associates. But she said she didn't expect that to hurt sales,
saying, ''a lot of it has memorabilia value.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Steve Young Set To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young still wants and believes
he can play. That's just not enough to keep his brilliant career
going.
</P>
<P>
   Young, sidelined since September by a devastating hit that
caused his fourth concussion in three years, is walking away into a
reluctant retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time league MVP, who led the San Francisco 49ers to a
Super Bowl title in the 1994 season, will announce his retirement
at a farewell news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two team sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
38-year-old Young, married in March and now an expectant father,
spent months agonizing over what to do before finally calling it
quits.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made up his mind,'' one source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day has been set,'' the other club source said. ''The only
issue is the setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who succeeded Hall of Famer Joe Montana and went on to
carve out his own championship legacy, leaves the game as the
highest-rated passer in the NFL's 80-year history.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a dazzling, powerful runner, rushing for an NFL
record 43 touchdowns, including a tackle-busting 49-yard run
against Minnesota in 1988 that endures as a testament to his
rough-and-tumble style.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill Walsh is aware of Young's decision and
confirmed he would make an announcement Monday. Walsh would say
only that all signs point to Young retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we all have a sense of what's occurring,'' Walsh said
before leaving team headquarters Thursday evening for a weekend
getaway. ''But it's for Steve Young now to do the personal
statements and relate his feelings to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh added that the 49ers will go ahead and pay Young a $1
million roster bonus that was coming due on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a reflection of our appreciation for Steve and what
he's contributed to the 49ers,'' Walsh said. ''We would love to
have Steve Young with us for the next 20 years, but I think he's
got bigger and better things to do. He might have my job, I don't
know. But I think we're agreed, if he were to retire, he can look
forward to a very successful life, whatever his endeavor, from
politics to broadcasting to sports to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was not available for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Young wanted to wait until Monday to make his
retirement announcement to give his family, college coach and other
key figures in his life a chance to be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement is now expected to generate up to $2 million in
payroll relief for the 49ers, who have struggled throughout the
offseason with salary cap problems.
</P>
<P>
   While no formal announcement was made, players leaving the
team's minicamp took word of Young's decision in stride. Former
Canadian Football League star Jeff Garcia will move into the job
held by Young and Montana for the last 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been preparing myself for that situation all offseason,
so I'm ready for it,'' said Garcia, adding he won't be fazed by
following in the footsteps of Young's Hall of Fame-caliber career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in a situation (in Calgary) where I've been behind a
legend before, maybe in a different league, but Doug Flutie was one
of the best to ever play in the CFL, and I was kind of looming
behind him for a couple of seasons before I got my break up
there,'' Garcia said. ''Maybe it wasn't on the scale that the NFL
is, but I've been introduced to it somewhat and I think I can
handle those sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci said the thought of replacing Young was
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you lose a great player, you have to replace his
production on the field, which is nearly impossible -- he's the most
efficient quarterback of all time and nobody is really even
close,'' Mariucci said. ''He's difficult to replace from a
leadership standpoint, from an image standpoint, from the
standpoint of a certain team swagger and confidence level.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has been struggling to choose among three options: play
for the 49ers, join another NFL team or retire. He hasn't played
since a head blow Sept. 27 at Arizona left him with his latest
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, did not return phone calls
seeking comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Young, whose wife, Barbara, is expecting the couple's first
child in December, has been mentioned as a candidate for the
vacancy in the ''Monday Night Football'' booth. ABC is expected to
announce a choice later this month.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Monday that Young's options had been reduced to
retirement or playing elsewhere after Walsh all but ruled out his
return to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh backed off the remarks the next day. He said the
return of the two-time league MVP was possible if he gained medical
clearance from a series of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Young met with Broncos coach Mike Shanahan in Denver on Monday,
but he said there were no negotiations or contract talks. He said
he was visiting Shanahan, who is a close friend, simply to get
advice.

<HEADLINE> John Rocker Heads to Minor Leagues  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) -- Standing in the shadows of reporters and
cameras, John Rocker was muttering to himself again. This time his
fastball was the source of his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker spent his first day back in the minor leagues Thursday
smoothing out his delivery on a bullpen mound. He didn't see any
action Thursday with the Triple-A Richmond Braves against the
Toledo Mud Hens.
</P>
<P>
   The reliever who has become a target of fans across the nation
for his offensive remarks was welcomed with a standing ovation and
only a few boos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked by how the fans love him,'' said Richmond third
baseman Wes Helms.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting two days to report to his minor league assignment,
Rocker finally was in uniform with Richmond. He signed autographs
for fans and a sheriff's deputy before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Edwards, a fan from Bowling Green, couldn't believe there
were cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pathetic,'' he said. ''That's the last reaction I
would suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   There were far more fans holding signs like ''Rocker You Don't
Offend Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to look at ourselves closely when we take a
pitcher more serious than our president,'' said Matthew Barton of
Bowling Green. ''People who show up at a minor league baseball game
are here for the love of the game, not for the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's appearance drew 6,212, Toledo's second largest crowd
this season.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few boos and some people left once it became
apparent Rocker wouldn't see any action in Toledo's 10-4 victory.
Rocker was expected to pitch today in a relief appearance against
the Mud Hens.
</P>
<P>
   The reception in the clubhouse was just as friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it was like old times,'' Helms said. ''He gave
everybody a warm hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker wouldn't speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 20 minutes throwing in the bullpen before Thursday's
game, working on his delivery. At times, he appeared frustrated
with the command of his fastball, muttering to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides working on his pitching, the Braves hope Rocker will
work out his off-the-field problems. Atlanta assistant general
manager Frank Wren said some of the pitcher's problems come from
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically, he's throwing the ball better than ever,'' Wren
said, ''but this has taken a real toll on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wren was at the ballpark to oversee Rocker's arrival. The
reliever signed a few autographs at the Toledo airport for
passengers on his flight before he and Wren drove away, avoiding
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike major leaguers, Rocker had to carry his own bag off the
plane. But it was obvious he was not just another player going down
to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker arrived at Ned Skeldon Stadium in this Toledo suburb in a
rental car instead of on the team bus. When Rocker walked onto the
field, several Toledo players taking batting practice stopped to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Wren said he was not disappointed that Rocker waited until the
last minute to show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most players take their time when they're sent down,'' Wren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves last season with Atlanta, was banished
to the minor leagues Monday for control problems. He also was fined
$5,000 for a confrontation before Sunday's home game in Atlanta
with Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman. In December,
Pearlman had written a story on Rocker's comments about gays,
minorities, and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had 10 saves in 11 opportunities and a 3.93 ERA this
season with Atlanta, but walked 25 batters in 18 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight in Toledo for Rocker's first appearance.
Temporary fences kept fans away from a walkway both teams use on
the way to the field.
</P>
<P>
   There were 18 sheriff's deputies on duty instead of the usual
four. Major League Baseball security officials also were at the
game, assisting with the crush of media members and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and photographers were limited to where they could
stand. Both clubhouses were closed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Missile Details Awaited  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Russians don't like Washington's
plan to deploy a missile defense system in the United States, and
the NATO allies hope Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev is going to
tell them what Moscow would do instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, a Russian field marshal, is in Brussels to participate
in today's NATO-Russia Joint Permanent Council with the alliance's
19 defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The allies hope he has brought details of President Vladimir
Putin's proposal, announced just a few days ago, to cooperate with
NATO in the construction of a joint European missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unclear exactly what the Russians have in mind,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday, the first day of the
NATO defense ministers' meeting. Whatever the Russian proposal
involves, he said, it would not be a replacement for the American
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the prospect of cooperation in principle, but as a
supplement, not as a substitute for the timely deployment of the
system which we have in mind,'' said Walter Slocombe, U.S.
undersecretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   A final test of the American system -- a small number of
interceptors that would shoot down incoming missiles fired by
''rogue states'' -- is scheduled for early July. President Clinton
is to decide in the fall whether to begin deployment.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain whether Sergeyev would be able to provide
details of Putin's proposals. Sergeyev said Thursday that the
meeting would define future Russia-NATO cooperation after a
yearlong hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ''After our relations have been frozen due to NATO's use of
force against sovereign Yugoslavia, we should join efforts to
restore mutual trust,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says its intelligence assessment indicates
that certain ''rogue states,'' such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq,
will be able to launch long-range missiles by 2005 and any plans to
create a defensive umbrella must be started soon to be operational
by that time.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says the American missile defense plan is a threat to
European security because it could be expanded to defeat a Russian
missile attack. The United States insists that's not true, but
Putin has warned Moscow will pull out of all nuclear arms
agreements if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty is breached.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty prohibits the kind of system Washington is
considering. The United States says it wants to modify the treaty
to allow defense against new kinds of threats. The Russians, Cohen
says, have now recognized that the threat exists and are at least
willing to consider modifications to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I perfectly well understand why the Americans are convinced
about the threat to them,'' said British Defense Secretary Geoffrey
Hoon. ''It remains important for us to reach an agreed position.''

<HEADLINE> Rising Temps Forecast Changes  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a grim forecast: Salmon quit running the
Columbia River as the cold water fish move farther north; sugar
maples in New England disappear; the barrier islands off the
Carolinas are swept away by higher seas.
</P>
<P>
   These changes in landscape and ecosystem are but a few of the
projections outlined in the first-ever detailed ''national
assessment'' of what could be expected to occur in the United
States -- region by region -- if the nation's climate becomes 5
degrees to 10 degrees warmer over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment, likely to be made public next week, is the
product of four years of study, numerous workshops and reviews by
hundreds of scientists both in and out of government who examined
global warming's likely regional impacts as well as its effect on
human health, agriculture, forests and coastal areas across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other studies that have examined general global impacts,
this assessment was directed by Congress to focus on the United
States specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue the analysis is little more than guess work and
that computer climate models, heavily relied upon in the
assessment, cannot predict impacts on a regional basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This document is an evangelistic statement about a coming
apocalypse, not a scientific statement about the evolution of a
complicated system with significant uncertainties,'' John Christy,
a climatologist at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, wrote
during a review of an early draft of the 128-page overview.
</P>
<P>
   Christy, who is among a group of scientists skeptical about the
likelihood of significant global warming, did not return telephone
calls seeking to know whether his views have changed about later
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   The overview report, a recent draft copy of which was obtained
by The Associated Press, acknowledges ''significant uncertainties
in the science underlying climate-change impacts'' particularly
related to human health. Still, it concludes ''based on the best
available information, most Americans will experience significant
impacts'' from the Earth's warming.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast predicts ''a complex mix of positive and negative
impacts'' and concludes there may be surprises. ''It is very likely
that some aspects and impacts of climate change will be totally
unanticipated,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   But the assessment predicts entire ecosystems likely will shift
northward as temperatures increase, and coastal areas will have to
cope with higher sea levels and the prospects of more frequent
storms. Cities will swelter in more frequent heat waves, and
droughts will become more likely in parts of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the warmer, wetter climate will cause larger
crop yields for many farmers and cause tree growth to flourish in
the Northwest, although forests in the Southeast likely will break
into ''a mosaic of forests, savannas and grasslands'' and sugar
maples could disappear from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The warming will cause ocean levels to rise, causing barrier
islands to disappear and -- when the geography allows -- force
wetlands and marshes inland. But the Great Lakes are predicted to
decline because of increased evaporation, causing yet different
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tree, fish and animal species will migrate northward everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, the salmon may shift farther north
because of the warmer streams and offshore waters and be replaced
by warmer-water species. And in Alaska the rising temperature is
expected to cause further thawing of permafrost, damaging roads and
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Some coastal cities, faced with sea level rise and more frequent
storm surges, may have to redesign and adapt water, sewer and
transportation systems, the study says. It makes no attempt to
estimate the costs of such improvements.
</P>
<P>
   An early draft of the overview summary was attacked in December
as having ''an extreme, alarmist tone'' on predicting impact on
human health. It since has been revised with more emphasis on the
uncertainties of predicting health impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the study says higher temperatures and increased
rainfall likely will exacerbate air pollution, saddle large cities
with more frequent and severe heat waves, and lead to the spread of
waterborne or insect-carrying diseases, including malaria in the
Southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the country, winter will be much milder. The result:
fewer opportunities to ski and more time for mountain hiking and
other mild-weather recreation. The warmer weather will reduce the
mountain snowpack, cutting summer runoff that feeds irrigation
across much of the West. More rain in the arid Southwest could
bring new vegetation to desert lands, but also more flash floods.

<HEADLINE> E.Coli Sufferers Offered Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- Officials in Canada's Ontario province
have announced a multimillion-dollar compensation package for
residents devastated by a deadly bacterial outbreak if they waive
their right to participate in class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's going to cost millions of dollars,'' Attorney
General Jim Flaherty said Thursday. ''This is about doing the right
thing. It isn't about money.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven people died and up to 2,000 others were sickened
by E. coli bacteria that turned up three weeks ago in the drinking
water in the farming community of Walkerton, 90 miles west of
Toronto. Four other deaths are being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic -- Canada's worst E. coli outbreak -- is thought to
have been triggered after a torrential May 12 downpour washed

   Flaherty said that although Canada's Supreme Court has imposed a
limit of $186,000 per person on pain and suffering damages, there
is more assistance available from the government of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be future loss of income claims, medical expenses
not covered by (health care), future rehabilitation expenses that
kind of thing, which can result in very large sums of money,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is going to a group of victims and saying ...
'You're going to be compensated quickly and there is no limit on
your compensation,''' said Flaherty, who added that insurance and
Ontario's budget surplus would cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Although residents who accept government money waive their right
to pursue class-action suits, the province said it would fund
initial legal fees incurred by residents who decide to seek legal
recourse.
</P>
<P>
   At least six law firms have said they plan to launch
class-action suits on behalf of residents.

Rail Killer Ties Self to Fla. Crime
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- In a letter to a central Florida sheriff, convicted
railroad killer Angel Maturino Resendiz admitted killing two teens in his
district three years ago and gave details about the slayings that investigators
said no one but the killer and investigators would know. Maturino Resendiz wrote
to the Marion County Sheriff's office that the killings occurred on the railroad
tracks between Tampa and Baldwin, which is about 20 miles east of Jacksonville.
The tracks run through Belleview, where 19-year-old Jesse Howell was found slain
on March 23, 1997. His 16-year-old traveling companion, Wendy VonHuben, was
never found.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Writers Guild of America has created a contract to
protect people who write for the Internet. Web sites that want to hire
professional film and television writers who belong to the guild will have to
contribute to the union health and pension plan and pay writers a guaranteed
minimum if a Web show is later sold as a television pilot or movie, said Grace
Reiner, director of contract administration for the guild. Unlike other
contracts, the new contract does not set wage scales. Web sites will be free to
negotiate salaries or one-time payments with writers, Reiner said.

UN-Iraq Aid Program Agreement Near

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With just minutes to spare, the Security Council
agreed late Thursday to extend the U.N. relief program in Iraq for another six
months and authorize a far-reaching study on the humanitarian situation in the
country. The unanimous vote on the British and French-drafted resolution capped
a divisive week of negotiations that saw the perfunctory extension of
oil-for-food program turn into a highly politicized debate. Despite appeals by
U.N. officials to focus only on getting more aid to Iraqis suffering under
sanctions, negotiations took unusual turns and split traditional alliances
before ending in a compromise.

<HEADLINE> City Council Has Gay Majority  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON MANORS, Fla. (AP) -- Sexual orientation has not gotten in
the way of politics in this community where homes flying the
American flag sit next to ones with rainbow-colored gay pride
banners.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in this Fort Lauderdale suburb have joined West
Hollywood, Calif., as the only other U.S. city with a gay majority
on its city council, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund,
a Washington, D.C.-based political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   John Fiore was elected mayor in March, joining two other gay
council members on the five-member panel. He had served on the city
council since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't run as a gay candidate for mayor,'' said Fiore, 46.
''I ran as a candidate who happened to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had large support from the straight community,'' said Fiore,
who estimates as many as 40 percent of Wilton Manor's 12,000
residents are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure some people voted for my opponent because I was gay,
but a lot of people voted for me because of my past on the
council.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 500,000 elected officials in America, less
than 200 of them are openly gay or lesbian, said Sloan Wiesen, a
spokesman for the Victory Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community remains largely without open representation and
without basic protection from discrimination,'' Wiesen said. ''This
is not a matter of someone wanting something at somebody else's
expense. The country is better off when all Americans are
represented in our government.''
</P>
<P>
   The group supports at least 50 other candidates in various
political campaigns, including the re-election of U.S. Rep. Tammy
Baldwin, D-Wis., and U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in the GOP-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With 41, California has the most elected officials who are
openly homosexual, according to the Victory Fund. New York is
second with 22, Massachusetts has 12 and Florida 10.
</P>
<P>
   More gay and lesbian candidates are running for office and
getting elected because they are becoming more politically
sophisticated, better funded and better organized, said David
Elliot, a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as more gays come out of the closet, attitudes toward
homosexuals are changing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they're your friends and neighbors and colleagues, then
it's easier to see gay and lesbian candidates as completely human,
and then it's easier to support the notion of them holding
office,'' Elliot said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Habecker, 29, said she and her family live on the same
street in Wilton Manor as retired couples, gay couples and Haitian
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all look out for each other and get along fine,'' she said.
''It's that kind of exposure that builds tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Council member Joanne Fanizza, who is straight, said she is
pleased that many in the community don't consider sexual
orientation an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope people look at their elected officials as being
competent for the job regardless of whether they're gay or
straight, male or female, black or white,'' Fanizza said. ''Does
this person do a good job for me? Do they represent my interests?
That's the only question voters should be asking.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Hire Ramsay as Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Craig Ramsay waited 15 years for an
opportunity that came at the expense of his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay was hired Thursday as the 13th coach of the Philadelphia
Flyers after stepping in for ailing Roger Neilson during the season
and leading the team within one victory of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson, who twice hired Ramsay to be an assistant coach, hoped
to return as head coach, but said he wasn't surprised by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy for Craig. It's something he's earned and I'm
sure he's going to do a great job,'' Neilson said. ''Naturally, I
wish it wasn't my job, but he deserves it and I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay said he understood Neilson's disappointment, and was glad
to have had him as a tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done a lot of things together over the years from junior
hockey to NHL hockey,'' Ramsay said. ''I played for him. I coached
with him. It's been a great experience for me and I learned an
awful lot from, in my mind, one of the best hockey people.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first head-coaching opportunity for Ramsay, who
spent 15 years in various assistant roles after his 14-year playing
career with Buffalo ended in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some doubt you'll get the chance, but I never doubted
I can do the job,'' Ramsay said about the long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay finished the regular season with a 16-8-1 record after
Neilson stepped aside in February for cancer treatment. He led
Philadelphia to a seventh game in the Eastern Conference finals
against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old coach took over for Neilson after he left the
team Feb. 19 to pursue aggressive treatment for multiple myeloma.
Neilson was diagnosed with the rare form of bone-marrow cancer in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson wanted to return for the first round of the playoffs in
April. But general manager Bob Clarke and Neilson's doctors decided
the 65-year-old coach wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke told Neilson of his decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't fun calling Roger,'' Clarke said. ''There will be a
job for him here if he needs one. He won't be an assistant coach.
There are plenty of jobs in the organization for a hockey man.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson wants to be a head coach, and the Flyers have given him
permission to look elsewhere for that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've talked to the three teams that don't have coaches right
now -- the two expansion teams and Calgary, so we'll just have to
wait and see what happens,'' Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also announced that John Stevens will replace Bill
Barber as coach of their AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms.
Barber also is seeking an NHL head-coaching position and is
interviewing for the job with the Columbus Blue Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stothers, an assistant with the Phantoms, will join the
Flyers as an assistant. Wayne Cashman, former head coach with the
Flyers, will not return to his assistant position. Cashman is
interviewing for an assistant job with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Barber may return to fill the assistant vacancy with the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were 29-17-1 with Neilson this season. Ramsay helped
the team overcome a 15-point deficit to capture the top spot in the
conference. The team then beat Buffalo in the opening round of the
playoffs and Pittsburgh in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The demands here are high,'' Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay, who spent two seasons with the Florida Panthers as an
assistant to Neilson, rejoined him with the Flyers in 1998 after
two seasons with the Ottawa Senators. He spent the 1995-96 season
as a scout for the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   His coaching experience also includes three seasons in the
mid-1980s with the Buffalo Sabres as an assistant coach and interim
head coach. He went 4-15-2 in 1986 before being replaced by Ted
Sator as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson, hired as Flyers coach in March, 1998, said Clarke
promised him he could return after he recovered from a stem cell
bone-marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, he criticized the organization, telling a Toronto
radio station, ''I don't think they want a cancer patient who is a
friend of Eric Lindros behind the bench right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson said at the time he had an agreement with Clarke on a
new contract in February that was withdrawn. He called the
situation a ''nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good and I felt that way ever since I came back
from Florida in the first round,'' Neilson said Thursday. ''I
certainly wanted to coach then and I would have liked to coach next
year, too, but that wasn't to be and that's the way it is in this
game.''

<HEADLINE> Devils Fail To Win Cup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Bobby Holik didn't want to hear
anything about playing in one of the greatest hockey games of all
time. Not one word.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup was there for the taking against the Dallas
Stars in Game 5 on Thursday night and the New Jersey Devils just
didn't take it despite having at least two dozen great scoring
chances against Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   And no one failed to convert more than Holik, who had eight
shots, including four great scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not easy, definitely,'' Holik said after the Devils
bid to win their second Stanley Cup since 1995 was derailed in a
1-0 triple overtime loss to the Stars. ''One of the things you
don't like to do too often. We put ourselves in this position
because we had opportunities to put them away and we didn't take
advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the longest 1-0 game in Cup finals history, the Devils threw
48 shots at Ed Belfour without success and then lost when Mike
Modano got the winner at 6:21 of the third OT -- 1:13 a.m. EDT
Friday -- by tipping in a shot by Brett Hull past Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those things where someone had to lose and
tonight it was us,'' Holik said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' win narrowed the Devils' lead in the best-of-seven
series to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 is Saturday night in Dallas. If a seventh game is
necessary, it will be played here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams played the same about of time,'' Holik said. ''It
might be easier for them to recover -- they won -- but at the same
time, this team has character. If we didn't have character, we
wouldn't be here. We'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Devils easily could have won had it not been
for Belfour, who was spectacular, as was Brodeur, who faced 41
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Holik and his teammates probably will have nightmares about
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had nothing to show for it,'' Holik said. ''I have to forget
about it and put it behind us. There is nothing we can do. We can't
dwell on it too much or it will drain you. I rather not talk about
it. It was an unfortunate thing. You have all these opportunities
and you have nothing to show for it, other than a post.''
</P>
<P>
   While Belfour had more tough saves, Brodeur was just as good
when called upon, particularly in the second overtime when Dallas
had two outstanding chances to extend the series.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the period, defenseman Derian Hatcher came late on a
3-on-2 rush. The Stars captain got a one-on-one chance against
Brodeur only to be stopped with the top of his blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Devils sniper Alexander Mogilny got a step on the Dallas defense
later in the period, but Belfour made a glove save.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was next to respond, sliding across the crease to stop a
rebound attempt by Mike Keane.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had three magnificent chances to win the Cup in the
first overtime and, of course, Holik had one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The big center cut to the net from the left circle and his shot
in close was stopped by Belfour. The rebound went directly out
front into a group of players crashing the net and the puck caromed
back toward the net and hit the edge of the goal post, with Hatcher
clearing it out of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Bobby hit the post, I thought the puck was sliding in,''
Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ''I almost had my arms up, it
looked like it was sliding in, but it hit the post and they cleared
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin was set up right in front all alone by rookie
Scott Gomez but Belfour came out and took the shot in his chest
with 11:30 left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias had the other good chance breaking in from the left
wing but his backhander glanced off Belfour and went through the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   Holik had two great chances on a second-period power play and
two more late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for Holik came late in the second period with
Jere Lehtinen off for high-sticking. He took a pass low in the left
circle and fired a shot that Belfour stopped with his pad. The puck
came right back to Holik and he had Belfour out of position, but
his shot hit the side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils should have realized it was going to be a long night
early when Belfour stopped Jay Pandolfo and Petr Sykora. Sykora
also had a great chance late in the third from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to keep playing the way we are playing, we're
playing well,'' Daneyko said. ''We can probably go to the net a
little harder, stop in front of the net because goals are going to
be tough to come by with Belfour. But Marty was spectacular, too.
It was a classic goaltender matchup.''

<HEADLINE> Protest Over Phillies Proposed Stadium  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- To outsiders, Chinatown might look like a
tiny community with a hodgepodge of inexpensive restaurants. Those
who know it better see the center of activity for several hundred
thousand people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's proposal to build a new stadium for the Phillies
brought hundreds to march in protest through downtown Philadelphia,
following the first business shutdown by Chinatown merchants in
more than a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   At least 700 people, many neither Chinese nor residents,
demonstrated through downtown Philadelphia, blocking traffic in a
drum-banging display that could have been mistaken for a
celebration except for the protest signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're killing Chinatown,'' said Dorothy Yang, 82, a retired
doctor who does not live in the community, but said she travels
there several times a day. ''I'm here to represent the people who
are deaf and blind to the English language.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinatown merchants closed their stores for the afternoon,
signaling the beginning of the community's first business shutdown
since World War II, when they protested Japanese imperialism in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street's proposal to build the new ballpark on the
community's northern border must be approved by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said it will expand the city's business district,
bring added business to restaurants and shops, and revive an area
now littered with warehouses and parking lots. They claim it will
increase attendance at Phillies games.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, think it will hurt the community's
development, and that the city cannot afford a stadium when other
services are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   While only 3,500 people live in the neighborhood, the
Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation said 250,000 people
in the region rely on Chinatown's services, such as banks,
churches, and hair salons.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers waved yellow flags, banged drums and cymbals, and wore
white T-shirts that read ''No stadium in Chinatown.'' Some held
large metal sheets that they banged with their knees as they
walked, making popping sounds similar to firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens sweated after walking for two hours in the
80-degree heat. A 15-foot-tall white cloth puppet of a human figure
dangled in the wind like a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters sat and knelt for several minutes in the intersection
of Vine and 12th Street, the site of the proposed stadium, tying up
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor has reduced our community to a bunch of
restaurants,'' Song Wa Chung, 16, said to the crowd after the
marchers reached City Hall. ''How many people will actually stick
around after the baseball game? The only people that will be
sticking around will be the drunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Amy Hom Birch lives in the suburbs, she said she marched
to support Chinatown because her family shops in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is Chinatown supposed to grow?'' she asked. ''There are
so many other places for a stadium. And city schools are going
broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman K. Mui, who also marched, grew up in Chinatown, but moved
to Havertown in 1971 when he couldn't find housing in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouldn't build a stadium,'' said Mui, who works in
Chinatown at an insurance company. ''They should build housing.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was seconded by Harry Chin, chairman of the Chinese
Benevolent Association, who had to move from Chinatown when his
home was demolished to make way for an expressway several decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''A stadium is only used at night. It's dead during the day,''
Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Pennsylvania professor Walt Palmer urged other
racial groups, particularly blacks, to support Chinatown, given the
hardships that minority communities have historically faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't live in Chinatown, and I'm not Chinese,'' Joyce
Randolph said. ''But I think the arguments against the stadium have
been ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests were planned to coincide with a midday seminar in
support of a downtown stadium, where speakers likened Philadelphia
to cities such as Cleveland, Denver and Baltimore that have seen
positive effects from new downtown stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started, we had lots of opposition from neighbors and
communities. ... Now, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone not in
favor of Oriole Park,'' said John A. Moag, former chairman of the
Maryland Stadium Authority.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pledges Reform For Washington  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Despite complaining about the lack of
civility in Washington, George W. Bush is being especially critical
of the Clinton administration as he rolls out his proposals for
improving the tone and workings of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Republican activists at a fund-raiser Thursday, the
GOP presidential contender said: ''There's no bigger issue than to
restore confidence in Washington, D.C. There's no bigger issue than
rejecting this type of politics where people are willing to tear
down as opposed to build up. The politics of war rooms and focus
groups and enemy lists -- we've got to get rid of that kind of
politics if we're to have a hopeful 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier in Tennessee, Bush singled out his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to language that has led Gore to adopt a less
aggressive campaign style, the Texas governor told an audience in
Gore's home state: ''Proposals he disapproves of are never just
arguable; they're 'risky schemes.' This kind of unnecessary
rhetoric is characteristic of the tone in Washington, D.C. It's the
war room mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhetoric aside, Bush told residents of Knoxville, Tenn., that he
wanted to make the federal government more efficient through
two-year budgeting, a commission to study wasteful spending and
faster votes on administration appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign complained of inconsistencies between Bush's
words and stated intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doublespeak is George Bush's way of avoiding a real
debate on the issues like the impact of his plan to privatize
Social Security,'' spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ''Instead of
answering legitimate concerns about his plan, he resorts to name
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Today in Philadelphia, scene of this summer's Republican
National Convention, Bush was identifying program cuts he would
make as president to accompany some of the $60 billion in new
spending he has proposed since securing the GOP nomination in
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   He was welcomed to Pennsylvania by Gov. Tom Ridge, who is under
consideration as a candidate for vice president. The two exchanged
a firm handshake on an airport tarmac, then slid their fists around
to interlock their thumbs, with each one patting the grip with
their free hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also paid tribute to the city, the state and its governor
in later remarks to one of three fund-raisers that were expected to
raise $1.75 million in regulated and unregulated campaign funds for
the local and national GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to coming to Philadelphia -- I'm working on
my speech here these days. I'm looking forward to campaigning with
my friend Tom Ridge across this state. I'm looking forward to
carrying Pennsylvania,'' he said to cheers from the hotel audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign reacted to Bush's government reform proposals by
noting that since Bush took office in 1995, the two-year Texas
budget has grown from $72.8 billion to $98.1 billion -- a 36 percent
increase, compared with 21 percent on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat's campaign also cited a January report from the
Texas State Auditor's Office, which found ''gross fiscal
mismanagement'' in the administration of the $201 million Smart
Jobs fund that is overseen by the Texas Department of Economic
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush should try to keep the promises he made to Texas
before making promises to the rest of the country,'' Hattaway said.

<HEADLINE> Early Election Polls Not Predictive  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In half of the presidential elections since
1950, when a strong majority of the public favored a presidential
candidate in June, they still backed him in November. Polls from
the other half of the campaigns were far less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we know from past experience is that polls taken before
late summer are not much better than flipping a coin,'' said Thomas
Mann of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis learned that lesson the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't pay any attention to them, they're worthless,'' said the
1988 Democratic presidential nominee who led in polls during the
early summer of that year. ''We've got an electorate that hasn't
made up its mind ... and probably won't make up its mind for some
time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   What the polls do offer is a glimpse of how the candidates are
connecting with a public that is barely paying attention. When a
popular incumbent president or war hero like Dwight Eisenhower is
running, popularity and name recognition can help carry a candidate
through a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a weakened candidate or no incumbent, the polls
get less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Democrat Al Gore's campaign aides point to the 1988
contest between Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts, and
then-Vice President George Bush, whose son, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, is Gore's Republican rival. Dukakis led Bush by 14 points in
a poll in early June, surging to 17 points after the Democratic
convention. He wound up losing the election by 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, a two-term vice president faces a governor who is
a relative newcomer to the national scene, and some have seized on
the similarities. Dukakis said it's hard to draw parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush isn't Mike Dukakis and vice versa,'' said
Dukakis, now a professor of public policy at Northeastern
University in Boston. ''And the same is true of the two vice
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Teeter, a pollster and top strategist for Bush's 1988
campaign, sees more differences than similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Races are unique because of the times and the issues and the
candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush likes to point to 1960, when John F. Kennedy, an
appealing newcomer led Richard Nixon, a two-term vice president, by
four points in June and held on to win by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
   The polls this year may be unpredictable because many people are
undecided. Six of 10 voters haven't picked a candidate yet, said
Tom Patterson, a Harvard professor and director of the Vanishing
Voter project, which is measuring voter interest in the campaign.
In fact, two-thirds say they don't know who's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means there will be some volatility,'' said Patterson. Of
those who say they have decided, ''there's a true Bush lead ... but
there are a lot up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying issues like the economy, peace and President
Clinton's performance play a large role in deciding the election,
veteran poll watchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get right down to it, the party that will keep us in
peace, keep us in prosperity are key factors in the election, more
than personality,'' said George Gallup, son of the Gallup Poll
founder and a pollster himself who has watched campaigns and polls
over the last half century.
</P>
<P>
   A group of academic forecasters say their models project a Gore
victory because of underlying trends of a strong economy and public
opinion about politics and presidential approval. Gore strategist
Bob Shrum cites Gore's stand on health care, Social Security, the
environment and education as reassurance that the Democrat's poll
numbers will improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue terrain works very strongly for Gore,'' Shrum says.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran poll watchers acknowledge underlying economic strengths
for the Democrats, but say hangover from Clinton's impeachment
battle and the candidates' relative skills as campaigners are also
factors. Bush had 48 percent support and Gore 44 percent in a new
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Thursday. The difference was
within the 5 point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   While the models project Gore should be a favorite, political
scientist Robert Erikson of Columbia University, who developed one
of them, said he was cautious because of the combination of the
current good economy and Gore's problems taking off in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I take into account the strong economy, plus the fact that
Gore is behind,'' Erikson said. ''I would hedge my bets all
around.''

<HEADLINE> Putin To Visit North Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin will visit North Korea
for talks on efforts to defuse the political situation on the
Korean peninsula and U.S. plans to build an anti-missile defense
system, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reports Friday said Putin had also accepted an
invitation to visit South Korea this year during a recent telephone
conversation with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, but Kremlin
officials could not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Putin would visit North Korea this summer, but
did not give any dates. Some Russian media reports said Putin would
stop in Pyongyang on his way to the G-8 summit of industrialized
nations in Japan on July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   While an agenda has not been set for the talks in Pyongyang,
military and strategic issues will be discussed, including U.S.
calls to build an anti-missile defense system, according to Russian
officials and media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is expected to seek further diplomatic support in Asia,
including on Moscow's opposition to the U.S. anti-missile defense
proposal. Some U.S. allies are worried that they would not be
defended by the U.S. system and it could lead to a new
international arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials have scoffed at U.S. claims that North
Korea poses a nuclear threat. Putin's visit to North Korea could be
aimed at undermining U.S claims that North Korea poses a threat to
international stability.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. anti-missile plan will be discussed in Pyongyang,
including possible cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang on the
issue, Georgy Toloraya, a Russian Foreign Ministry official, was
quoted as saying by the Vremya Novostei weekly.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton failed to gain Russian agreement to amend the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty during a summit with Putin last
weekend in Moscow. Washington says the system is needed to defend
against attacks from ''rogue states'' such as North Korea and would
not pose a threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government appeared to concede for the first time
during the summit that such risks could exist, but no agreement was
reached on amending the treaty. Putin repeated Russian calls to
build a joint defense system with the West earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of Putin's visit came just three days before North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South Korea's Kim Dae-jung were to
begin a three-day summit, the first ever between the divided
Koreas. North Korea has been actively courting international
recognition after decades of isolation from much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union supported North Korea, but relations with
Moscow declined following the Soviet collapse. Ties between North
Korea and Russia have improved slightly in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Modano Keeps Stars Alive  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Brett Hull set up this overtime
winner, not to win the Stanley Cup but to prevent the New Jersey
Devils from taking it away.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano deflected in Hull's shot for his first goal of the
finals early Friday morning as the Stars extended the best-of-seven
series to a sixth game with a 1-0 victory over the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought if we got this tonight, we would come back here
Monday night,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended 6:21 into the third overtime, it was the longest
scoreless game in the finals and fourth longest overall.
</P>
<P>
   Hull won the Cup for the Stars last year, eliminating the
Buffalo Sabres in six games, when he scored from the crease. It was
a goal that fans in Buffalo are still screaming shouldn't have
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour, who was routed in the first game of this series,
wouldn't allow any pucks to get past him this time. His cold cured,
Belfour rebounded from his six-goal shelling to stop all 48 New
Jersey shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie played well, he's a very proud person,'' Mike Keane
said. ''The whole team's not going to give this thing up early. We
know the Cup is in the building, and until they win, it's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour won nine straight games following Dallas playoff defeats
until New Jersey won consecutive contests at Reunion Arena to take
a commanding series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It always seems we come up big when the time is needed,''
Modano said. ''Guys seem to rally, we seem to support each other.
We don't get down.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who played a Dallas of high 43 minutes, 33 seconds, and
Hull have been the catalysts throughout the playoffs, accounting
for 21 of the Stars' 51 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have won two of the three games played at Continental
Airlines Arena and return home for Game 6 Saturday night. New
Jersey won Games 3 and 4 at Dallas and is 9-2 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big momentum change,'' Modano said. ''I think we all
feel and finally realize what we have to do and how we have to play
to beat these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once has a team rallied from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to
win the Cup. The Stars became just the 10th club to survive the
fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, the Stars seemed to be the fresher team,
getting more of the better chances and spending large amounts of
time in the New Jersey end.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we felt some chances were coming and we were getting
some good play down low,'' Modano said. ''We were able to wear them
out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoring play came as Dallas worked the puck in the offensive
zone. Hull sent a shot toward the net from the right point. Modano
got his stick on it in midair and put it between the pads of Martin
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of towards the end of a shift,'' Modano said. ''It
was just developing nicely. They were able to get it to Jere
(Lehtinen) and Jere to Brett and it seemed that everybody shifted
to that end of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''His first attempt I think hit his shin or his stick, and he
stuck with the play. As it came through the next time I was able to
get my stick on it. It hit the shaft and went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas could get a boost for Game 6 as Jamie Langenbrunner might
be able to test his injured knee again, which would strengthen
another Stars line.

<HEADLINE> Stars 1, Devils 0, 3 OT  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Stanley Cup was in the
building, and the Dallas Stars weren't about to let go of it -- no
matter how long it took.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano deflected in Brett Hull's shot at 6:21 of the third
overtime, ending the longest scoreless overtime game in Stanley Cup
finals history as the Stars staved off elimination by beating the
New Jersey Devils 1-0 in Game 5 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hull threw the Stars' 41st shot of the game on the net from
along the right wing boards and Modano, who hadn't scored a goal in
the finals, pushed it between Martin Brodeur's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The goal ended a duel between two of the NHL's best big-game
goaltenders, Brodeur and Ed Belfour, both of whom have Stanley Cup
rings.
</P>
<P>
   After the goal, Brodeur stood motionless in the crease, his head
bowed and the puck sitting in the middle of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ''Modano was flying through the middle, going to the net,''
Brodeur said. ''He hit it in midair and it went between my legs.
They're so high now, they've got hope and we've got to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   A third overtime in the finals. The Stars. Brett Hull. The
Devils, who took a 3-1 series lead into the game, should have known
better than to try to win the Stanley Cup this way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know this feeling of endurance tests,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the Stanley Cup with Hull's controversial triple
overtime goal in Game 6 against Buffalo last year, and this time
kept from losing the Cup by winning in a third overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between periods, we tried to remember the overtime games we
played last year and kept using them as motivation,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 will be Saturday night in Dallas, where the Devils seized
their 3-1 lead by winning twice. Now, it's a very precarious 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a cushion -- a little bit,'' Devils coach Larry
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano said, ''We felt if we won tonight, we'd be coming back
here Monday night (for Game 7). That was our whole train of thought
going into tonight. It's a once in a lifetime game when you're
playing overtime in an elimination game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull sensed the Stars getting more chances the longer the game
went.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the game gets long and people get tired, if you stick to
the game plan, you can find some room,'' Hull said. ''People are
tired and playing safe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth-longest Stanley Cup finals game ever and,
early in the third overtime, became the longest scoreless overtime
finals game. Colorado beat Florida 1-0 on Uwe Krupp's goal at 4:31
of the third overtime to complete a four-game sweep in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great. We're running on fumes right now,'' Modano said.
''This was a big winner. We're lucky we're going to see Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, rebounding from a three-goal third period in a 3-1 loss
in Game 4, made 48 saves. Brodeur made 40, but couldn't make the
41st.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie and Marty, to be honest, I don't think I've seen
anything better since I've been in the league,'' Hitchcock said.
''I thought we would have to take a timeout and probably finish
next week. I didn't think anyone would score.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who tied a record held by eight others with his fourth
shutout in these playoffs, said, ''This is the best game I played
since I made 75 saves as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur began his post-game news conference by saying, ''Good
morning,'' reflecting the 1:13 a.m. EDT finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fans certainly got their money's worth,'' Devils
defenseman Scott Stevens said. ''Both of these goalies were
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, the first ever to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win
the conference finals, now are trying to avoid being the second
team to lose a 3-1 lead in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The only team to accomplish such a comeback among the 25 that
tried was Toronto, which won the final four games against Detroit
in 1942 after falling behind 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not thinking about that,'' Stevens said. ''I'm thinking
about being up 3-2, and that's not a bad position to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has never lost any of the three playoff series it led
3-1 and Dallas has never won any of the eight it has trailed, never
once forcing a single Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are the third team in the last 19 years to keep from
losing in a potential elimination game. Vancouver the last to do
it, did so twice against the Rangers in 1994 before losing Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been a road team advantage in the finals, with
the Stars winning two of three in New Jersey and the Devils winning
both games in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still up in the series, and we can't let down,'' Devils
rookie Colin White said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who talked repeatedly on Tuesday and Wednesday of
the necessity of not letting Dallas get back into the series, lost
for the second time in seven games since falling behind
Philadelphia 3-1 in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to have to go back there for a Game 6, but
that's the way it's going to be,'' Devils defenseman Brian Rafalski
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars clearly benefited from having two days off before Game
5, rather than the usual one, especially after they lost a 1-0 lead
in the third period of their 3-1 loss in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got down 3-1 and people said the team's too old and we
can't keep up and we can't play,'' the Stars' Mike Keane said. ''I
think we proved that wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The long game helped make a pumped-up crowd -- one of the few
such the Devils have played before at home this season -- less of a
factor. There were gaps of empty seats as midnight passed in the
second overtime, as even the possibility of a Stanley Cup
presentation couldn't keep some sleepy fans from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   As might have been expected in so important a game from two
teams that have perfected the offense-stifling neutral zone trap,
there was no scoring in regulation. That doesn't mean there weren't
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik had numerous chances for New Jersey, once hitting
the post on an unguarded shot. He also missed wide on a power play,
then missed twice on good opportunities in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had six goals that could have gone in,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the best chances in the third, with Brodeur
flopping to ice to stop Modano, and Lehtinen firing wide on a slick
setup by Hull with about eight minutes left. Lehtinen also missed
from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime was the Devils' first in the playoffs this season.
They were within one game of the tying the 1991 North Stars' record
for most playoff games in a season without overtime (22).
</P>
<P>
   It was only the eighth overtime game in the 2000 playoffs, a
relatively low number -- but one was the five-overtime
Flyers-Penguins game, the second-longest in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   The road team has won the last 11 multiple-period overtime
games.

<HEADLINE> Gore Plan Monument On Columbia River  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASCO, Wash. (AP) -- The 51-mile Hanford Reach, the last
free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, undeveloped for more
than half a century and a security buffer on the edge of the
nation's most contaminated nuclear site, is becoming a national
monument.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was making the announcement today, on
behalf of President Clinton, during a visit to Washington state in
conjunction with his Democratic presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Slade Gorton, put in touch with reporters by the rival
campaign of Republican George W. Bush, beat Gore to the punch by
making the announcement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one disagrees that the Hanford Reach must be protected. It
is a magnificent part of the state that deserves preservation for
generations to come,'' said Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   He said the declaration is hasty and unjustified, and that
management decisions for the reach should be made with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no threat to the reach, since all the property on
either side of the river is owned by the government. The only
'emergency' is the fact that President Clinton will soon be out of
office,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The reach runs along the eastern edge of the Hanford
reservation, the most contaminated nuclear site in the country. The
area remains undeveloped because it served as a security buffer
when the government made plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal
from World War II until the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It also is prime salmon-spawning ground.
</P>
<P>
   While in the state, Gore was to tour the Columbia River, deliver
an environmental speech at Washington State University and address
the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   How best to protect and manage the reach has split the state's
congressional delegation for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really excited at the prospect of this designation. I
think this is a historic moment for the Tri-Cities and the Pacific
Northwest,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is such a tribute to the people of that community and
what they have given to all of us. It's the culmination of a lot of
work by a lot of people with tremendous results,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   County commissioners in the area have opposed federal management
of the reach.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt toured the reach last month
before recommending federal protection for 200,000 acres. No
contaminated areas were included.

<HEADLINE> White House: Gore E-mail Not Stored  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House says some e-mails in Vice
President Al Gore's office from 1998 and 1999 may no longer exist
because they were not captured on computer backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself may have been told about the problem more than a
year ago, says Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who calls the White House's
disclosure about problems with message traffic in Gore's office
''the latest outrage'' in the tale of missing White House e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been investigating why the White House failed to
archive and review thousands of e-mails to determine if they should
have been turned over under subpoena to investigations ranging from
fund raising to Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky. The archive problem
came to light early this year in a lawsuit by a conservative group,
Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said Thursday a witness recently told the House
Government Reform Committee she wrote Gore a memo at the vice
president's request in April 1999 about e-mail in his office not
being properly archived.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's request for the memo ''has led us to discover that'' an
''error apparently prevented e-mail on the OVP server from being
backed up from the end of March 1998 through early April 1999,''
White House lawyer Steve Reich wrote in a letter to the
congressional committee. OVP stands for Office of the Vice
President.
</P>
<P>
   Reich said that the White House has been unable to find any memo
by the witness to Gore on the e-mail archiving problem.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy had no immediate comment on
whether Gore had any recollection about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the vice president's office, computer contractors failed to
schedule a back up of the computer ''E'' drive. However, some of
the e-mails may be available from any paper copies that staffers
kept and any messages staffers stored on their individual
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the e-mails also may be available on backup tapes for
the main White House computer system. Some Gore staffers' computers
were tied in with a computer archive, providing another possible
source for at least some e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail system in Gore's office is separate from the main
White House computer system, where an e-mail archiving problem has
led to missing message traffic for a period of over two years
starting in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 28 interview with The Associated Press, Gore waved
off the issue of missing White House e-mails as a red herring
inspired by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he did not know how much e-mail he'd
written, ''but whatever is there will be disclosed -- fully and
completely.''

<HEADLINE> Patients' Rights Bill Debated  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans pledged to forge ahead with
patients' rights legislation, but said Democrats have damaged
chances of getting a bill passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything the White House and the Democrats have done in the
last few days has been very detrimental to getting a bill
enacted,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., GOP whip and chairman of
a House-Senate committee working on compromise legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans narrowly beat back a patients' rights bill
favored by the White House on Thursday by a 51-48 vote. Democrats
had forced the issue onto the Senate floor, introducing it as an
amendment to a defense bill, after complaining that the conference
committee was getting nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   All 51 votes against the measure were cast by Republicans.
Forty-four of the 45 Senate Democrats, joined by GOP Sens. John
McCain of Arizona, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Lincoln Chafee of
Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, registered their
support. Democrat Kent Conrad of North Dakota did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spoke out for strong patients rights during his
failed presidential bid, said the narrow outcome puts pressure on
Republicans to pass a bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles and Republicans said they would attempt to work with GOP
lawmakers in the House to fashion a measure that could win over
some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But many House Republicans have favored a broader bipartisan
bill similar to the one Nickles helped defeat, so it's unclear
whether the party can unify on the issue and pass a bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vowed to keep pressing the issue. Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass, who spearheaded Thursday's vote, said that the narrowness
of the setback indicated the effort to pass the measure was gaining
ground, and ''a few more days like this and the Republicans will
stop stonewalling.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give patients easier access to emergency rooms as
well as specialists and women would be permitted to see a
gynecologist without needing a referral from a primary care
physician. Patients would also get expanded rights to sue their
health plans if harmed when coverage was denied.
</P>
<P>
   All 161 million Americans with private health insurance would
get the protections. Majority Republicans forced passage of a less
sweeping measure in the Senate last year, one that covered far
fewer people and did not expand rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's two-hour debate, members of both parties
claimed to have the interests of American families at heart.
Republicans argued that passing the bill would hurt their
pocketbooks by driving up premiums and could leave many families
without insurance because business owners will drop health benefits
for workers rather than face expensive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   They accused Democrats of catering to the legal bar by insisting
that patients settle their disputes with HMOs in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their bill would improve health care for
Americans and accused Republicans of writing a bill that protected
HMOs, not patients.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans earlier this week floated a compromise that
envisioned a limited right to sue in federal court, with
restrictions on damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a member of the compromise committee, called the
proposal ''a sham'' but said he was willing to go back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But without a breakthrough, he vowed to bring the bill to the
floor again. ''The next time we'll have the votes,'' he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Disclose Donors  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare Senate victory for campaign finance
reform, lawmakers voted to force secretive political organizations
to say who's paying for TV advertising and other bills.
</P>
<P>
   The measure now moves to the House, where Republicans have
fought off the effort to require disclosure and spending by these
increasingly popular political groups.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders say they are now working on their own version
of a bill but have no timetable for introducing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate attached its measure to an unrelated defense spending
bill on a voice vote after turning back a Republican effort to kill
the measure. Fourteen Republicans joined most Democrats in keeping
the proposal alive on a 57-42 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., who helped lead the effort, argued that the
victory will build momentum for broader efforts to overhaul the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end. This is the beginning,'' said McCain,
who, with the others has worked for years with little or no success
to change campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the provision would force disclosure on
groups that have organized under the once-obscure section 527 of
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was created in 1975 to establish tax rules for
political organizations, such as the national political parties and
political action committees. But unlike these new, sometimes
secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new 527 groups tell the Internal Revenue Service that they
are political organizations, but they maintain that as far as the
FEC is concerned, they are engaged in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential and congressional campaigns have seen a
proliferation of these groups supporting both Democrats and
Republicans. Some are created by established groups; others pop up
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think that our campaign system couldn't possibly
get any worse along comes the discovery of this new loophole,''
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ''Section 527 is the largest,
most disturbing, pernicious loophole in a system rife with backdoor
ways to influence government.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters noted that lawmakers who have opposed efforts to
limit the size of donations have touted disclosure in its place,
saying even large donations are OK as long as the public knows who
is behind them. Thursday's proposal, they argue, simply required
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued that the amendment would doom the
underlying legislation funding defense operations. The Constitution
requires tax bills to originate in the House, and opponents said
that would cover this measure because it changes the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense bill includes this provision, they said, the
House would refuse to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the
bottom of the sea,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a way around those arguments: remove the measure
from the defense bill if the other side agreed to attach it to the
next appropriate legislation. Opponents objected.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argued that the measure should cover other
nonprofit organizations that engage in issue ads. Under current
law, they also are not required to name their donors. But unlike
527s, they must release their tax returns to the public and they
face limits on their political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to do it in a comprehensive way and not leave out
some of the major players on the American political scene,'' said
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, McCain said he would talk with Senate leaders
about including other organizations in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to defeat the measure, opponents offered to consider a
''sense of the Senate'' resolution supporting disclosure and
suggested they would consider it later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is also considering a proposal to force 527 and other
groups to register with the commission and meet its disclosure
rules. Democrats on the panel welcomed the initiative, but
Republican response ranged from wary to outright opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore backs the new disclosure rules. A
spokesman for Republican George W. Bush said the Texas governor has
not yet reviewed the measure.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Workplace Injuries  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organized labor is licking its wounds after
losing another House vote. But this time, the lawmakers' vote to
block federal rules for preventing workers' injuries was a symbolic
defeat on an issue that isn't going away.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 220-203 Thursday to retain legislative language
that would forbid the government to issue requirements that 1.6
million employers take steps to prevent on-the-job injuries. The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which says 1.8
million such injuries are reported annually, plans to issue such
regulations by year's end after a decade of partisan battling over
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants the rules to take effect, and is
virtually sure to veto legislation blocking them. The language
could disappear even sooner, when House-Senate bargainers craft a
final version of the $339 billion spending bill for education,
health and labor programs that contains the provision.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Thursday's vote more important politically than
substantively. And it was far less damaging to labor than the
House's May 24 vote to permanently grant normal trading status to
China. Organized labor opposed that legislation, which was
championed by Clinton, Republican leaders and business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, labor and Democratic leaders did not want Thursday's
vote to even occur. They worried that the effort to block the rules
would prevail and give momentum to the other side. They also said
the vote would let Republicans from districts with strong union
membership cast themselves as pro-labor by supporting the OSHA
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be an effort on the part of some to provide
cover and encourage members to support legislation that is
blatantly anti-family,'' AFL-CIO lobbyist Peggy Taylor said in a
letter that Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., read on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's reference was to the overall spending bill, which some
moderate Republicans might find easier to support after voting to
remove its restrictions on the OSHA rules. Clinton, most Democrats
and organized labor oppose the spending bill because it cuts
Clinton's proposals for many school, job training, child care and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the mostly party-line vote, just 16 Democrats -- mostly from
the South -- voted to block the ergonomics regulations. Fourteen
Republicans, mainly from the industrial Northeast and Midwest,
voted to let them take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups oppose the forthcoming OSHA rules because they
say they would cost too much. In a letter to House members, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the OSHA effort ''exemplifies
irresponsible government at its worst'' and said it might include
the vote in its annual rating of lawmakers' records, which can
effect campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're either on the side of salt of the earth'' small
businesses ''or power-hungry union leaders trying to implement
this,'' Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the rules said they would help prevent many of
the musculoskeletal injuries the governments says 1.8 million
American workers suffer annually. About 600,000 of them end up
missing work days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue about human beings and our dedication to
them,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking control of Congress in 1995, Republicans have
repeatedly approved legislation aimed at delaying the regulations.
The language blocking the ergonomics regulations was written by
Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's effort to let OSHA proceed with its regulations was
driven by Rep. James Traficant, a maverick Democrat from Ohio, and
some Republicans from strong labor districts.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, whose Rust Belt district has a strong organized labor
presence, said he wanted to fight for the regulations to ''help
many of the concerns many working people have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Traficant has also battled openly with top Democrats since
earlier this year, when he accused party leaders of trying to
unseat him in his primary. Democratic leaders have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says the rules would cost business $4.7 billion a year to
implement, but reap $10 billion a year in savings from medical
expenses and workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Various business groups, however, have said the costs to
companies would be tens of billions of dollars in reduced
production and for training and new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups and companies plan to file suit against the
rules as soon as they are finalized.

<HEADLINE> Tissue Bank Industry To Be Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The government plans to investigate the
nation's tissue bank industry, focusing on what families are told
about how body parts of loved ones will be used, a Clinton
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced
the investigation Thursday after meeting with senators from both
parties to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time a public health administrator has had
this level of seriousness about this issue,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation order follows a series of stories on abuses
within the industry reported by The Orange County Register and the
Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The reports detailed questionable practices and the millions of
dollars in profits generated by the collection, distribution and
use of donated tissue. They suggested an inadequate system that did
not monitor whether tissue was distributed where the need was
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The Register detailed how cadaver skin often is used for
cosmetic purposes -- to puff up the lips of models, enlarge penises
or smooth out wrinkles -- while burn wards face a shortage of skin
to treat fire victims.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit tissue banks may obtain body parts useful for up to
100 patients from a single cadaver. The parts are then sold to
companies that make products used by doctors and dentists, and the
banks and businesses share revenues despite laws barring profit
from body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists, the American Red Cross and the industry's association
said they support Shalala's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Tissue Banks appreciates the inquiry
''and we certainly want to participate,'' said Bob Rigney, the
group's chief executive officer.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are higher in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 64 points in today's
early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a
9-5 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 61 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up 9.
</P>
<P>
   The market's initial move higher comes after a generally
favorable report on wholesale inflation for the month of May.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's producer price index was unchanged last
month, as energy prices pulled back from increases in April.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the inflation report, there's not much for the market
to focus on.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 73; Nasdaq Gains 51  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after a tame inflation report
provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 73.46 to 10,742.18.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 9.51 at 1,471.18, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 50.54 at 3,876.10.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that the
Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expected a 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The benign report followed a series of indicators over the last
few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 106.12 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.74 at 520.28.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.83 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.88 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.35 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.81 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Probes Mystery Brit Illness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A mysterious illness has killed 30 intravenous
drug users in Scotland, Ireland and England since April, and U.S.
officials are helping in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have reported 59 people with the ailment,
characterized by swelling and redness at the injection site, low
blood pressure and a high white blood cell count, often followed by
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths came about two days after the patient was
admitted to a hospital, despite treatment with antibiotics and
other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of victims' blood and tissue have uncovered multiple
organisms, but none has been identified as the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said a new illness could be to blame, but a more
likely cause is a known organism behaving in an unfamiliar way.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were called two
weeks ago by health authorities in the United Kingdom to help
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   No cases have been reported in the United States, but the CDC
sent letters of warning last week to state health authorities.

<HEADLINE> General Defends Action in Gay Case  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES PRICHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- The departing commander of Fort
Campbell, where a gay private was bludgeoned to death by another
soldier last July, said today there hasn't been a climate of
homophobia during his nearly 2{ years in charge of the Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark also denied he has tolerated anti-gay
harassment among his soldiers or done little to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter made public Thursday, 30 members of Congress urged
Defense Secretary William Cohen to take action against Clark, who
is being reassigned to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I object to being characterized the way I have been
characterized by people who don't have a clue as to who I am as a
human being or who I am as a commander,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said in their letter that Clark ''is responsible
for tolerating anti-gay harassment on the post'' prior to the
murder of Pfc. Barry Winchell ''and for doing little in the wake of
the murder to stop this type of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an absolutely false statement,'' Clark said at a news
conference prior to a change-of-command ceremony at the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''My style as a commander is well known throughout the Army,''
he said. ''There are thousands of people in the United States Army
who know me and know what I am like as a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchell was beaten to death with a baseball bat by a fellow
soldier after his homosexuality became known.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the post's commander since Feb. 6, 1998, said Fort
Campbell has gone further to educate soldiers on the Department of
Defense policy on homosexual conduct than either the department or
the Army mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When anything, any crisis occurs on this post, the leadership
of the soldiers of this post swarm to the crisis,'' Clark said.
''Such was the case of the Winchell murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army announced earlier this week that Clark is being
reassigned to the post of vice director for operations on the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, an important job in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said Thursday that
Clark would start the new job in a couple of weeks; today is his
last day in command at Fort Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates and some members of Congress are
questioning the Pentagon's decision to reassign Clark before the
Army inspector general completes his investigation of anti-gay
attitudes at the base.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general was due to report his findings May 1 but
has been granted an extension to July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Russ Oaks, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said the
Army is not contemplating any action against Clark and that the
timing of his move to the Joint Chiefs job is unrelated to the
completion of the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Kutteles, Winchell's stepfather, said he believes Clark
should be held responsible for what happened at Fort Campbell, even
if he did not know of anti-gay harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know if he was aware of it, but that's his job to
be aware of it,'' said Kutteles, an Army veteran who lives in
Kansas City, Mo. ''I don't think he cared, and that's a general's
job to care.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, an executive director of the private
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocate for gay rights,
welcomed the lawmakers' plea to Cohen and criticized the Army's
decision to move Clark to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army has sent a mixed message by appearing to reward him
with a prestigious assignment,'' Osburn said, even though Clark has
not been promoted in rank.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Urge Computer Crime Fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European justice ministers urged swifter measures
Friday to combat computer crime and pledged to improve national
judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential to establish a swift and efficient system of
international cooperation ... (in) the fight against crime in a
computer environment,'' the ministers from 41 European nations
including Russia said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued at the end of the two-day annual
meeting of justice ministers from the Council of Europe, which has
expanded to encompass 17 East European nations since the collapse
of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The council acts as a human rights watchdog and helps former
communist countries with legal and constitutional reform. The
European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, France, also
is part of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Despite logging the largest number of complaints brought to the
court last year, Russia will host the next Council of Europe
justice ministers' conference in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the court, which has a big backlog of cases, is to
review complaints from citizens who feel national courts have not
upheld their human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also urged a campaign to educate the 850 million
Europeans whose countries belong to the council about their legal
rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of protesters demonstrated outside London's
Dorchester Hotel, where the ministers met, against the inclusion of
Turkey in the meeting. They chanted slogans accusing Turkey of
brutality against prisoners and other human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Christian Kruger, the council's deputy secretary general,
noted that Turkey had been a member since 1950 and was a signatory
to the European Convention of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many cases pending before the European Court of
Human Rights which concern Turkey,'' Kruger acknowledged, adding,
''this was not a matter for discussion here.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Invites Frank to Gay Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA once avoided hiring people who were
openly homosexual on the theory that gay men and women were
potential targets for blackmail. But, in a sign of the changing
times, the spy agency this week hosted a gay pride celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity aside, the speaker at Tuesday's event at the CIA's
Langley, Va., headquarters, may have raised some eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Not because Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., is openly gay -- but
because he is openly critical of the intelligence community's
spending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Frank joked to the group of about 100 gay and lesbian CIA and
National Security Agency employees that not only had he tried to
cut their funds, but he also wanted to ''out'' the intelligence
budget, which is now classified.

   But, he added, ''Your budget by now is about as big a secret as
my sexuality was before I came out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Frank said he is a ''strong supporter of
their fundamental mission. I want them to catch terrorists. But I
want them to scale the budget down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I didn't go to any place that I've criticized, I'd have to
stay home all the time. And I'm not that crazy about my
apartment,'' Frank added.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the session was sponsored by a
group called the Agency Network of Gay and Lesbian Employees. A
similar event was held last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued an executive order in 1995 prohibiting
the denial of security clearances ''solely on the basis of the
sexual orientation of the employee.'' That reversed a previous
policy that had decreed homosexuality as automatic grounds for
denying a clearance.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after a tame inflation report
provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 91.57 at 10,760.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 8.31 at 1,469.98, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 57.09 at 3,882.65.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that the
Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expected a 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The benign report followed a series of indicators over the last
few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today. Qualcomm rose $3.125
to $80.563 and Sun Microsystems gained $2.438 to $89.938, both on
the Nasdaq. On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component Hewlett
Packard was up $4.563 at $130.438.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
NYSE, where volume came to 254.25 million shares, down from 275.14
million shares on Thursday.

<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.41 at 520.95.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prostitutes will be forbidden to advertise in
telephone booths and may have their telephones blocked, the
government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewd, flimsy cards advertising sexual services proliferate in
London telephone boxes. British Telecom, the country's largest
telephone company, estimates it removes 150,000 cards each month
from 700 booths in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cards are offensive, create a bad impression with
foreign visitors and can be a bad influence on young people,'' Home
Office Minister Charles Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They cost money to remove, and the people that place these
cards in phone boxes can be threatening or violent toward the phone
box cleaning teams and members of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke did not announce details of the legislation or say when
it would be introduced in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The government is consulting with the industry regulator, the
Office of Telecommunications, on the possibility of blocking calls
to numbers advertising sexual services.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Youths Drown in Rio Grande  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two youths drowned as they tried to swim
across the Rio Grande, just yards from U.S. and Mexican border
agents, in a dramatic scene played repeatedly on Mexican television
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the U.S. agents were aware of the men's
plight or could see them through the thick riverside vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   A TV crew with Televisa was filming in Matamoros, across from
Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday when three men tried to swim back
to Mexico, after a Border Patrol squad apparently blocked their
entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The three plunged into the apparently tranquil waters of the Rio
Grande, perhaps 20 yards wide at that point. However, two of the
men quickly began flailing and sinking as the river's current swept
them away.
</P>
<P>
   The third man made it ashore on the Mexican side and ran off,
Televisa reported. The bodies of the other two were not immediately
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Mexicans have drowned in recent years in the Rio
Grande, a point of entry for thousands of illegal immigrants
seeking entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents of Mexico's Grupo Beta, an immigrant protection
agency, tossed ropes to the men, but did not enter the water to try
to save them. The television footage showed one of the victims
sinking below the surface, motionless.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Munoz Puente, regional head of the agency that oversees
Grupo Beta, called the accident ''lamentable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will give our personnel rapid-response training for cases
like the one which occurred today,'' Munoz Puente said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet June 27 with
Armenian President Robert Kocharian, the White House announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Kocharian will discuss U.S. support for peace
efforts in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and restoring economic ties
among Caucasus nations, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
They also will talk about strengthening Armenia's democratic
government and building its economy, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian also will meet with Vice President Al Gore, members of
Congress and officials from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia has had a cease-fire with Azerbaijan for five years, but
has failed to resolve disputes over independence claims by
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is controlled by Armenia but is located
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' primary concern in the region is a planned
pipeline to carry Caspian sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and
European oil companies, across Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean at
Ceyhan, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Open Summit Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAINZ, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French
President Jacques Chirac opened the 75th Franco-German summit today
determined to portray their alliance as strong -- amid signs it may
be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of mutual commitment in this Rhine River
city, the leaders agreed to jointly develop new satellite and radar
systems that would address deficiencies in the Europeans'
surveillance capabilities revealed during NATO's war on Kosovo last
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of their final declaration, Germany also
will join France and Britain in purchasing Airbus A400M military
transport aircraft, abandoning interest in a competing airplane
being developed by Russia, the Antonov An-7X.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Germany's wish to bolster faltering economies in
ex-Soviet states, the declaration says Germany and France will look
for ways to include Russian and Ukrainian companies in building the
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   The A400M, which still has no prototype, would have twice the
capacity and fly 30 percent faster than the C-130s it would
replace.
</P>
<P>
   European Union leaders agreed at their December summit in
Helsinki, Finland, to move ahead with developing a European
military force that could respond to crises without the aid of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   French Defense Minister Alain Richard underlined the concerns in
an interview with the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on
Thursday, saying that France's defense and security policies are
closer to Britain's than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the areas in which the Franco-German
relationship -- key to Europe's stability and bound by the close
friendship between the late former French President Francois
Mitterrand and ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- has shown signs of
fraying in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Germany was upset when France echoed U.S. concerns about its
first candidate to succeed Michael Camdesseus at the International
Monetary Fund. And French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
caused a furor when he said recently that Germany had not been
cured of its Nazi past -- an attack on a German proposal for a
federal-style system to run the 15-nation European Union as it
expands to include a dozen newcomers. He has since apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The partners also are working out disagreements in reform plans
for the European Council: Germany wants a greater proportion of
seats reflecting its population and higher EU contributions; France
wants an equal share.
</P>
<P>
   The French-German alliance has been at the center of the drive
toward greater European integration since the collapse of communism
10 years ago opened up eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is in a state of flux as it seeks to assert its
independence from the United States after the demise of the
communist threat, and even this central relationship, long dubbed
''Europe's motor,'' is experiencing bouts of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   German government officials insisted the summit would
demonstrate that the Franco-German motor ''is not just running, but
out for the long haul.''

<HEADLINE> Report of Theft at Madonna's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A thief who reportedly broke into the grounds of
Madonna's London home this week apparently failed to get into her
house but stole a bag from an outbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard police headquarters, asked about a newspaper
report of the theft, would not identify the resident of the house.
But a spokeswoman said Notting Hill police were investigating a
report of a theft at a house in a street where Madonna is known to
rent a home.
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard newspaper reported that burglars forced
open the gate to the property while Madonna was out having dinner
Wednesday and that she and boyfriend Guy Ritchie returned home to
find the police waiting. The report said intruders broke into the
gardener's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a shoulder bag and its contents were reported stolen
from an outbuilding behind the house between 12:30 a.m. and 7:30
a.m. Wednesday and that the bag belonged to a man employed by the
''householder.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer-actress and Ritchie are expecting a child in
September.

<HEADLINE> David Letterman Goes on Jury Duty  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- No kidding. David Letterman showed up for
jury duty Friday but didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The civic-minded talk show host spent 2{ hours in Superior
Court, taking part in a juror orientation that included watching
two short films.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't make it to the jury box. Only one alternate was
still needed to complete the jury in the case, a lawsuit over a car
accident, and one was chosen before Letterman could be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   By state law, that meant that the New Canaan resident fulfilled
his jury duty, a topic that had been a running joke on his CBS
late-night show for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only am I going to be on the jury, I want to run the
jury,'' he said during a recent show.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's proceedings, he said he was disappointed he was
not picked, but that didn't stop him from joking. ''Maybe I should
commit a crime and go to jail and see how this works on the other
end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he would make a good juror -- ''I'm
considerate and thoughtful'' -- but the lawyer representing the
plaintiff in the case wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want people paying attention to the witnesses, not a
fellow juror,'' said attorney Philip French. ''You don't take a
distraction like that and throw it into the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Hickey recognized the comedian immediately Friday,
and not just from television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had him once in here for speeding,'' Hickey said. ''He's a
very nice man.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his running gags over the past few weeks, Letterman read
from a newspaper article and poked fun at a judge who said he would
be too opinionated to serve on a jury. Letterman looked into the
camera and said he had only one opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's guilty!''

<HEADLINE> British Police Seek Stolen Cat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police were scouring Britain's ports for a rare
and valuable puss named Toni after his owner reported the theft by
a cat burglar wearing orange glasses and muttering in German.
</P>
<P>
   Toni, whose proper name is Antonio B. Pinardan, is a 2-year-old
Ankara Turkish Angora -- a pure, natural breed that probably
originated from the Manul cat domesticated by the Tartars,
according to the Cat Fanciers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Toni commands a stud fee of $1,200, and his owner estimates the
cat could have earned him anywhere from $100,000 to $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I can't put a price on him,'' said Peter Collins, who paid
a breeder in Munich, Germany, $1,500 for the cat before Toni was
born. ''People have asked to buy him, but he's one of our family
now. Losing him has upset my wife deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who lives in Lowestoft, said his other cats alerted him
to the theft Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in my house when I heard what sounded like cats
fighting,'' The Daily Telegraph quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went outside and saw Toni's run had been undone. I thought
my wife must have left it open and I started searching for Toni and
calling him. Then I looked around and saw this woman crouching by
the back gate with a scarf on her head and wearing orange glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toni was in a basket poking out of a holdall that she was
carrying. I demanded the cat back and went to grab the bag over the
fence. I could tell she was foreign because she muttered something
at me in German. I could not get hold of her and she just legged
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman fled in a green Peugeot with a foreign license, driven
by an accomplice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have warned all ports and alerted Interpol, the
Paris-based International Criminal Police Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was described as having a fluffy, mottled coat with a
tiger-striped face, green eyes and white whiskers.
</P>
<P>
   White is the most popular color for the breed, but they are
available in a range of colors. The Cat Fanciers Association will
not register a Turkish Angora unless its ancestry can be traced to
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Judge Ends Ban on Vieques Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday
reversed his order barring 12 protesters and six journalists from
returning to the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, site of a U.S.
Navy bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   All were arrested June 1 along for trespassing on the range,
where 25 protesters held a prayer service to protest the Navy's
presence on the island. Thirteen demonstrators were Vieques
residents, while 12 were from other parts of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   After they were arrested by U.S. marshals, U.S. Magistrate Jesus
Castellanos prohibited all of them except the permanent Vieques
residents from returning to the island -- even to Vieques' civilian
areas, where about 9,400 people live.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he lifted the prohibition from the journalists at
the request of their lawyers. He later extended the exemption to
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters camped out on the bombing range for nearly a year
following a bombing accident that killed a civilian security guard
on Navy land. On May 4, U.S. marshals raided their camps and
arrested more than 200 people.

<HEADLINE> House Expected To Pass Estate Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today moved closer to passing
bipartisan legislation that would gradually repeal the federal
estate tax over the next decade by defeating a less costly
Democratic alternative backed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will erase it from the tax code forever, in hopes it will
never return from the dead to haunt family farms and businesses,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, the House was expected to vote overwhelmingly to
gradually repeal the estate tax by 2010 using an estimated $105
billion from the projected budget surplus. Clinton has threatened a
veto over the cost -- roughly $50 billion a year after full repeal
takes effect -- but sponsors, including at least 46 Democrats, are
hoping a big majority vote might persuade the president otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong for the government to steal a family's legacy,''
said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ''It's not about
money at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the bill would mainly benefit the rich, Democratic
opponents offered a version costing $22 billion over 10 years that
is geared directly toward small-business owners and family farms,
but it was defeated on a 222-196 vote. The Senate Democratic
leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that version is the
only one that has a chance of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want the accomplishment, they're going to have to
compromise,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said they were moving to help people like Mark
Sincavage, owner of a Pennsylvania land excavation and development
business, who says his family has paid more than $600,000 in estate
taxes and legal fees since his mother died in 1999. Much of his
business, he says, will be sold to make up the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family worked hard, and we paid all our personal and
business taxes for more than 35 years,'' Sincavage said. ''We're
going to have to sell a large chunk of our family property just to
pay this unfair tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a letter Thursday to House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said he could support ''targeted, fiscally responsible
legislation to make the estate tax fairer, simpler, and more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he favored a Democratic alternative, but was willing to
work with the GOP leadership to find an acceptable bill. But, he
added, ''If you send me a bill to completely repeal the estate tax,
I will veto it rather than risk the fiscal progress that has
contributed to the longest economic expansion in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of estate tax revenue is paid from a small number of
estates worth $5 million and up. Only a tiny fraction of farms and
small businesses pay the tax because of generous exemptions --
$675,000 this year for individuals, $1.3 million for farms and
small businesses -- but the stories of people like Sincavage has
made the issue irresistible in an election-year Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a priority for many black and Hispanic lawmakers, who
say their constituents fear the tax would threaten businesses they
are now trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   ''You do have a number of small-business people, ranchers,
farmers, who are trying to pass their farm or their business to the
next generation without paying a high tax. I sympathize with
them,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats say the Republican bill goes too far, giving huge
tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America in the name of the
little guys. They are proposing an alternative that would cost far
less -- about $22 billion over 10 years -- and would gear tax relief
more directly to family farms and small businesses. It would also
cut estate tax rates by 20 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bill does much more for family farms and small
businesses,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of complete repeal say the Democratic version
would only provide modest relief from a tax that a wide majority of
Americans oppose, according to public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to do much more than just take the steam out of
repealing the death tax,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a
prime sponsor along with Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn. ''We want to get
rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the latest example of this year's House Republican
strategy to carve up last year's $792 billion tax cut that Clinton
vetoed and pass the more popular items individually. The House has
already passed relief from the ''marriage penalty'' paid by
millions of two-income couples and more bills are planned.
</P>
<P>
   There is support for estate tax repeal in the Senate, but GOP
leaders say the measure would likely have to be combined with
several other tax measures and brought up under special rules that
prevent unrelated amendments from being attached.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Putin Calls Clinton About Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week after the U.S.-Russia summit in Moscow,
President Vladimir Putin called President Clinton on Friday to
discuss several issues, including missile defense -- a subject upon
which the two leaders disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did have some discussion about missile defense and some
of President Putin's ideas,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said. ''But it was a 15-minute call that covered a wide
range of subjects, so I would hesitate to portray it as a detailed
arms control discussion''
</P>
<P>
   Putin opposes Washington's plan for a limited missile defense
system, a small number of interceptor missiles that could shoot
down missiles launched by countries the United States has labeled
''rogue nations.'' The new Russian leader has proposed working with
NATO and Europe on a joint anti-missile defense system, but has yet
to offer any details.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen will meet in Moscow
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's prepared to lay out what the president's thinking
is, where the Pentagon is,'' Lockhart said, adding that Clinton has
not yet decided whether to deploy the system. ''I think Secretary
Cohen is in a good position to allay any concerns the Russians may
have.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Makes Deal on E-signatures  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electronic contracts would gain the same legal
status as handwritten signatures under legislation that has cleared
a key congressional hurdle on its way to becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate lawmakers, after months of negotiations among
themselves and with the administration on such issues as how to
protect consumers from abuses, late Thursday reached a compromise
that could speed the measure toward passage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would set national standards for electronic
signatures and records and give them the same legal validity as
written contracts and documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Electronic signatures and records will help grow the digital
economy by giving American consumers greater confidence in their
online business transactions. This is one of the most important
steps Congress can take to help foster the growth of the digital
economy,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who chairs the House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation will revolutionize the way consumers,
industry and government conduct business over the Internet,'' said
Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., sponsor of the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley said the House is likely to take up the compromise plan
next Tuesday. In the Senate, a hurdle to quick passage was removed
Friday when Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who had balked at some of the final concessions, said he would vote
for ''this historic'' bill.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that language was included to give regulators the
authority to waive aspects of the consumer consent process if they
became too burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate passed e-signature bills with little
opposition last November, but resolving differences between the two
bills has proved to be difficult. The administration and some
Democrats opposed sections they said could weaken consumer
protections while business groups lobbied against provisions on
consumer consent they said would hinder smooth E-commerce
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last issues to be settled was setting March 1, 2001,
as the date when records required by law, such as mortgages and
financial securities, can legally be filed electronically. Some
businesses had sought a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also closed a loophole that would have made it
easier for states to pre-empt the federal law. States can still
demand paper forms on such matters as public health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, consumers must ''opt in'' for electronic
records, ensuring that those who don't have access to computers or
prefer written forms won't be left unaware when a company
electronically serves notice on such matters as warranties, changes
in interest rates or recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Brailov, spokesman for the American Electronics
Association, said his group was pleased with the final product. He
called it ''a vital prerequisite to the continued growth of
E-commerce. It provides legal certainty for online business.''

<HEADLINE> Opera Set in Bartlesville, Okla.  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL COLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- The librettists came from Broadway.
The composer from France. And the slapstick story about Indian
Territory is set right here in Bartlesville.
</P>
<P>
   The opera ''Ochelata's Wedding'' premieres Saturday at the 16th
OK Mozart International Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had to represent a kind of clash of cultures that we
represent,'' said Ransom Wilson, artistic director of the concert
series. ''I mean, we're presenting 18th century European music in a
20th century oil town. With Native Americans around, and buffaloes,
it's an incredible culture clash, but it works ... and I knew it
had to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was written by the Tony-nominated team of Joe Sears and
Jaston Williams (''Greater Tuna'' and ''Tuna Christmas''). The
composer, Jean-Michel Damase, is known for lush, impressionistic
music in the style of Francis Poulenc. Leon Majors of the Boston
Lyric Opera directs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to show the people of Bartlesville that opera can be
fun,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The fictitious story, set in Oklahoma's Osage Hills a century
ago, revolves around the wedding of Wilma, the daughter of Cherokee
Chief Ochelata, and Tito, her Osage bridegroom. As a wedding gift,
a French duchess sends a composer with spinet in tow to provide
music for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Outlaws, however, hide their loot in the spinet to evade
pursuing Texas Rangers. When the spinet gets crated and sent off to
Indian Territory, mayhem unfolds as the outlaws try to recover it.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of baritones playing dual roles as Texas Rangers and
outlaws provide most of the comedy, dashing behind rocks to emerge
as other characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ochelata's Wedding'' began with a brainstorming session in
1995 between Wilson and Nan Buhlinger, executive director of OK
Mozart. With Bartlesville's 1998 centennial approaching, Wilson
suggested commissioning an original opera about life in the
oil-rich territory 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlesville, today a city of about 35,000, sat then at the edge
of Cherokee and Osage land. Frank Phillips, founder of Phillips
Petroleum, entertained outlaws, Indians and Hollywood royalty at
his country home there.
</P>
<P>
   The OK Mozart board received a startup grant from the
WallaceReader's Digest Special Projects Fund. Wilson approached
Damase ''because his music is so charming and light in texture. I
knew his music wouldn't bog down a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Solisti New York Orchestra, which plays throughout the
festival, would provide orchestral accompaniment. The next step was
to find librettists.
</P>
<P>
   Buhlinger suggested Sears, a Bartlesville native who had gone on
to Broadway success with Williams. Wilson attended the premiere of
''Tuna Christmas'' in New York in 1995 and offered them the job
backstage that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a memory of being blown away by his asking us to do
that,'' Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, an Alabama native who works mostly in New York and
travels as a conductor and flautist, remained the go-between.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thought of a Parisian communicating with two 'boys' from
Texas and Oklahoma who kind of celebrate their Southwesternness --
it was hard. They had very little common language,'' Wilson said.
''We were bringing Paris, New York and Texas together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early on that the work wouldn't be ready in time
for Bartlesville's centennial. Sears and Williams, used to writing
breakneck theater comedy, found opera a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, whose family came to Oklahoma in the era in which the
opera is set, had a Cherokee background to draw on and live up to.
''I made sure we didn't contrive anything that would make Native
Americans look bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Performers were selected last fall at auditions in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our idea is that it will go on the road,'' Wilson said. ''We
think that it has such appeal, it will perhaps play even in Europe.
Because whenever I travel in Europe, they all have this fascination
with the exotic West.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen Rejects Russia Defense Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Friday that Russia's proposal for an anti-missile defense
system offers no protection for the United States -- or even Europe
-- and consequently isn't feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and some of the NATO allies oppose Washington's
plan to deploy a limited system aimed at shooting down long-range
missiles fired by ''rogue nations'' at the United States, saying it
would breach the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and tip the
balance of nuclear power in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to head off American plans before
President Clinton makes a final decision this fall, Russian
President Vladimir Putin made a vague proposal to work with NATO to
create a joint European missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
presented the allies with Putin's idea at a meeting of the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, the Russian proposal was still
vague.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unclear to me exactly what Russia has in mind,'' Cohen
told reporters after a meeting between Sergeyev and NATO defense
ministers, and a later bilateral session with the Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I can determine, it's an idea based on a theater
missile defense system, something of intermediate or shorter-range
capability, so it is not a system that could provide protection to
the United States, or to much of Europe,'' Cohen said. ''So at this
point it's an idea that does not appear to be feasible or desirable
for protecting us against the kind of threats that are emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allies didn't want to give the impression they were
rejecting the Russian idea outright, especially at a time when
NATO-Russia relations are starting to warm after a yearlong hiatus
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said the 19-nation
alliance was not yet in a position to evaluate the Russian
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Questions have been asked, and clearly they will be dealt with
at a later stage,'' Robertson said. ''Clarification on such an
important issue is of enormous importance. We were not able to do
it in the meeting today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, a Russian field marshal, did not disclose much to
reporters, saying only that Putin's plan involved creation of a
tactical anti-ballistic missile system and would not violate the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That treaty prohibits the use of long-range defensive missiles.
A 1997 U.S.-Russia agreement, still unratified, defines long range
as essentially any missile capable of flying more than 2,200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said if Putin is talking about a theater missile system --
missiles with a shorter range -- it would not be sufficient to
protect the United States, nor much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Europe is more than 2,200 miles from potential missile
launch sites in Iran, and all of Europe and the United States is
more than 2,200 miles from North Korea, Cohen noted. ''A system
limited to shorter range threats would not protect the American
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cohen said the allies were prepared to continue to
explore ways of meeting the security concerns of Russia, Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says its intelligence assessment indicates
rogue nations will be capable of launching long-range missiles
carrying weapons of mass destruction by 2005 and any plans to
create a defensive umbrella must be started by next year to be
operational by that time.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that schedule, the United States must begin building
radar sites in Alaska by next spring, meaning Clinton must make the
decision by fall.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Russian idea turns out to be, Cohen said,
''it could not be a substitute for the American program that is
currently under research and development.''

<HEADLINE> Graduation Speeches Promote Policies  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the class of 2000 dons its caps and gowns,
the White House's own graduating class is wrapping up another
tradition: using commencement policy addresses to promote the
president's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet secretaries and agency heads have fanned out across the
country in recent weeks to congratulate college students and make
final attempts to support President Clinton, now months away from
becoming the graduate in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala tackled
everything from AIDS research to a patient's bill of rights in her
address to the New York University School of Medicine. The aging of
America and health insurance were featured themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already strengthened Medicare by fighting waste, fraud
and abuse,'' she said. ''Now we must finish the job by setting
aside a portion of the surplus for Medicare and by modernizing
Medicare with sound business practices and a prescription drug
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting she would soon need a new career, Shalala said the
writers of the television drama ''ER'' had invited her to consult
on scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I think I'm more cut out to be a consultant for
'The West Wing,''' she said, referring to the prime-time political
drama whose characters are based on Clinton administration staffers
and their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet economy also was a frequent speech topic,
particularly the ''digital divide'' -- the idea that technology is
widening the chasm between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology cannot give every American access to opportunity
until every American has access to technology,'' Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William E. Kennard told Howard
University graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his audience ''Generation D -- the digital generation,''
Kennard said the promise of the Internet age is not just in
building smarter devices but in building stronger communities.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson echoed those concerns, telling
students of Drew University in Madison, N.J. to value face-to-face
meetings in an age of e-mail. Richardson, whose name has been
floated as potential running mate for Vice President Al Gore, said
the greatest challenge for the class of 2000 would be environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to have horrendous energy and environmental
problems unless we change the way we generate electricity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was jeered by student
protesters opposed to sanctions against Iraq during her speech at
George Washington University, seemed more interested in past
achievements than future policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank President Clinton for the opportunity he has given me
to represent America around the globe,'' she said. ''I am proud
that under his leadership, the United States is helping to create a
more secure world by supporting peace in the Middle East, stability
on the Korean Peninsula, development in Africa and a new spirit of
democracy in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   But even these officials put business aside to supply a
commencement's required moments of inspiration and amusement.
</P>
<P>
   At Marymount University in Arlington, Va., Labor Secretary
Alexis M. Herman told of her struggle to find a job after
graduating from college. She said employers sometimes turned her
down because she was a black woman, noting that one suggested she
become a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I saw him today, I would say: 'Sir, I did become a
Secretary,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a frequent target of hurled
foodstuffs -- most recently a tofu cream pie -- told the graduates of
the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute that one key to
success is a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''How else but with a sense of humor -- or at least a sense of
irony -- can you be a Jewish secretary of agriculture advocating for
the pork industry?'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers acknowledged the need for a well-worn phrase to
put it all in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, quoting the late House Speaker Tip O'Neill, told his
Drew University audience that he would be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ''A graduation speaker is like a corpse at an Irish wake, you're
supposed to show up but not say much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Police Detain More Than 60  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Police detained more than 60 people
for questioning after a suicide bomber killed a government minister
and 22 other people, a senior police official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern battle zone of Sri Lanka's 17-year-old civil
war, a senior army officer said troops launched an offensive east
of Jaffna city Friday against Tamil Tiger rebels -- the group the
government blames for Wednesday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The troops advanced just over half a mile toward the rebel
positions in Kodikamam, about 15 miles east of Jaffna, said the
officer. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement said two soldiers had died and 12 were
wounded in fighting Thursday in Jaffna peninsula, which the rebels
want as the capital of a minority Tamil homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Colombo, several students from Moratuwa
University were detained Thursday, along with 15 men and women
taken from their homes in raids on the neighborhoods around the
bomb site in the Ratmalana suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after a suicide bomber blew himself up Wednesday --
killing Minister for Industrial Development Clement V. Gooneratne
and 22 other people -- police took away four men suspected as
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Daily News said the men were in a cafe nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The senior police official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that based on information the first four suspects
gave, two businessmen were arrested Thursday after their offices in
Colombo were searched.
</P>
<P>
   The police official in Ratmalana said documents were found in
the offices that police believe link the men with Tamil Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The government banned officials in February from giving
information to the press without permission. The local press is
censored. Under an emergency decree extended by Parliament on
Thursday, police and soldiers have wide powers to detain people,
seize property and restrict speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gooneratne had been walking with his supporters collecting money
to aid soldiers' families along Sri Lanka's main thoroughfare, when
the suicide bomber approached him and detonated the explosives
strapped to his body.
</P>
<P>
   Gooneratne's wife, Shyama, was one of 60 people injured in the
bombing. She died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have fought since 1983 to
create a homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east for the 3.2 million
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's 18.6 million population.
</P>
<P>
   The war has killed more than 62,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have been blamed for several assassinations,
including suicide bombings that killed President Ranasinghe
Premadasa in 1993 and former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in
1991.

<HEADLINE> House Will Allow Vote on Donations  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in less than a month,
House Republicans today turned back a Democratic bid to impose
disclosure requirements on secretive new political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The 216-202 vote came after the GOP leadership, under pressure
from moderates within the ranks, agreed to permit a vote on similar
legislation by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the leadership has come to the realization that
this is a growing problem,'' Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said after
attending a meeting with Speaker Dennis Hastert and other top GOP
leaders. The developments came one day after the Senate voted to
impose disclosure requirements on groups that are not covered by
federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP leadership has voiced support in the past for
greater disclosure. Leaders battled recently to defeat one
Democratic attempt to broaden requirements and were working to
derail a follow-up attempt later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as the Sierra Club run political advertising
under the umbrella of groups exempt from disclosure requirements.
But much of the recent attention on the issue has been focused on
other organizations, several of which are tied closely to House GOP
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, and one that aided Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Castle and several other GOP moderates have drafted legislation
that would apply not only to these groups, but others that fall
outside current law.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Senate vote was a rare victory for campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate attached its measure to an unrelated defense spending
bill on a voice vote after turning back a Republican effort to kill
the measure. Fourteen Republicans joined most Democrats in keeping
the proposal alive on a 57-42 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., who helped lead the effort, argued that the
victory will build momentum for broader efforts to overhaul the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end. This is the beginning,'' said McCain,
who, with the others has worked for years with little or no success
to change campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the provision would force disclosure on
groups that have organized under the once-obscure section 527 of
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was created in 1975 to establish tax rules for
political organizations, such as the national political parties and
political action committees. But unlike these new, sometimes
secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new 527 groups tell the Internal Revenue Service that they
are political organizations, but they maintain that as far as the
FEC is concerned, they are engaged in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential and congressional campaigns have seen a
proliferation of these groups supporting both Democrats and
Republicans. Some are created by established groups; others pop up
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think that our campaign system couldn't possibly
get any worse along comes the discovery of this new loophole,''
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ''Section 527 is the largest,
most disturbing, pernicious loophole in a system rife with backdoor
ways to influence government.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters noted that lawmakers who have opposed efforts to
limit the size of donations have touted disclosure in its place,
saying even large donations are OK as long as the public knows who
is behind them. Thursday's proposal, they argue, simply required
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued that the amendment would doom the
underlying legislation funding defense operations. The Constitution
requires tax bills to originate in the House, and opponents said
that would cover this measure because it changes the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense bill includes this provision, they said, the
House would refuse to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the
bottom of the sea,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a way around those arguments: remove the measure
from the defense bill if the other side agreed to attach it to the
next appropriate legislation. Opponents objected.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argued that the measure should cover other
nonprofit organizations that engage in issue ads. Under current
law, they also are not required to name their donors. But unlike
527s, they must release their tax returns to the public and they
face limits on their political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to do it in a comprehensive way and not leave out
some of the major players on the American political scene,'' said
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, McCain said he would talk with Senate leaders
about including other organizations in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to defeat the measure, opponents offered to consider a
''sense of the Senate'' resolution supporting disclosure and
suggested they would consider it later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is also considering a proposal to force 527 and other
groups to register with the commission and meet its disclosure
rules. Democrats on the panel welcomed the initiative, but
Republican response ranged from wary to outright opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore backs the new disclosure rules. A
spokesman for Bush said the Texas governor has not yet reviewed the
measure.

<HEADLINE> Fieger, Darden on New TV Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- Geoffrey Fieger and Christopher Darden,
famous for their courtroom performances for Jack Kevorkian and O.J.
Simpson, will be in the public eye daily on a new television show.
</P>
<P>
   The two -- along with fellow high-profile attorneys Dominic
Barbara and Edward Masry -- are featured on a new syndicated series
called ''Power of Attorney.'' It premieres Aug. 28 on stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger is no stranger to the media. He spent eight years
representing ''Dr. Death,'' ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1998
and was host of a radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   He said he agreed to do the TV show because it focuses on
lawyering and the personalities of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, I think America would get a kick out of seeing me more
often than on Court TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darden was one of the prosecutors in Simpson's murder trial.
Barbara represented Joey Buttafuoco, whose wife was shot by
Buttafuoco's teen-age lover Amy Fisher. Masry employs the real-life
Erin Brockovich, the subject of a recent movie starring Julia
Roberts.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Elisabeth Shue is leaving Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Shue, who earned an Oscar nomination for ''Leaving Las Vegas,''
was among the thousands who donned caps and gowns and graduated
from Harvard University on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shue was one semester short of earning a political science
degree when she dropped out of Harvard 15 years ago to start her
acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, former ''Melrose Place'' star Andrew Shue, was in
the audience at graduation, along with her husband, film director
Davis Guggenheim, and their 3-year-old son, Miles.
</P>
<P>
   The new degree doesn't mean a change in career. Shue's newest
film -- ''Hollow Man,'' a science-fiction thriller starring Kevin
Bacon -- opens July 28.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Speak at Small College  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY H. GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton declined invitations from dozens of other
schools when he decided to deliver the final commencement address
of his administration at little Carleton College in Northfield,
Minn., a sleepy community whose motto is ''The City of Cows,
Colleges and Contentment''
</P>
<P>
   Why would he go there instead of, say, an Ivy League campus for
his potential history-making last hurrah on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   The choice is in keeping with Clinton's pattern each
commencement season of addressing a military academy, a public
university and a private institution, White House spokeswoman Sarah
Gegenheimer said. He spoke earlier this year at the U.S. Coast
Guard Academy in New London, Conn., and Eastern Michigan University
in Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carleton College is well-known for its outstanding academic
reputation,'' Gegenheimer said. Carleton is often near the top in
U.S. News and World Report's annual rankings of national liberal
arts colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the 423 graduates, Clinton will talk about
steps his administration has taken to make higher education more
affordable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably wanted a place where he could be more ruminative
and speak to a smaller but highly attentive audience,'' said
Michael Waldman, who was White House director of speechwriting from
1995 to 1999 and is now at the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. ''For Carleton to be chosen as the last
commencement of his presidency is a real tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also will address a Democratic National Convention
luncheon and attend a Soul Asylum rock concert and Democratic Party
fund-raiser in Minneapolis during his one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   The school about 40 miles south of the Twin Cities has 1,850
students. Normally, the college's outdoor commencement ceremony
draws about 3,700 to 4,000 people. This year, 7,000 are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a president visited Carleton College was in 1956,
when Dwight Eisenhower made a campaign stop amid the rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit will probably go down in Northfield history
right next to an 1876 attempted bank robbery by Jesse James and his
gang and Gov. Jesse Ventura's convocation speech at Carleton last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sen. Paul Wellstone was a professor at Carleton for 21
years, he wasn't involved in recruiting the president. Neither was
Ventura, who has met with Clinton several times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Freedman, a senior adviser to the president and 1985
graduate of Carleton, apparently had as much to do with the final
decision as anyone, said Carleton spokeswoman Marla Holt. Freedman
suggested the school invite Clinton. The school did, and the White
House accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Commencements are one of the few times of year when a president
has plenty of notice and a blank slate for a speech topic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Clinton gave an address at Michigan State University in
the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing. ''You can't love your
country and hate your government,'' Clinton told students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he spoke about the need for racial tolerance in an
address at University of California at San Diego, shortly after
that state passed an anti-affirmative action ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryne Beebe, a graduating Carleton senior who also will
speak, said she feels a little added pressure with the president's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a pretty confident speaker,'' said the 22-year-old English
major from Belton, Mo. ''The size of the crowd doesn't bother me.
What does make me nervous is that everyone is going to be
critiquing my speech. I want to make it an intelligent, elegant
sort of speech. I don't want it to be typical.''

<HEADLINE> German Unions Pick Strike Targets  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Having won strong backing from
members, Germany's public workers unions picked their targets
Friday for a strike that threatens Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
plan to keep the economy growing by holding wages down.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said meter maids, public cashiers, parking lot
attendants and traffic cops will be among the first to strike, with
the first walkouts as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just the initial targets in what could snowball into a
massive strike disrupting everything from garbage collection to
hospital services to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3.1 million workers could be mobilized after the OeTV,
representing mainly blue-collar public workers, and the DAG
white-collar workers union approved countrywide strikes late
Thursday. Their votes followed earlier strike approvals by the
80,000-strong GEW teachers union and the 26,000 member police
union.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will begin with a series of mild attacks of local
strikes, but these public unions have a lot of channels to disrupt
public life and it will eventually become more widespread,'' said
Martin Werding, a labor analyst with the German economic research
organization Ifo.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute compromise, cashiers at museums, public
pools and parks will walk off the job, allowing visitors free
entry. Police have also announced they won't ticket illegal parked
cars in downtown Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are still contemplating a strike for public
transportation workers. And the GEW teachers union has said its
members could in the coming weeks walk out of classes ranging from
kindergarten through adult education.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were to meet Friday to begin negotiating a last-ditch
compromise that could avert a strike. Talks with Interior Minister
Otto Schily, the chief negotiator for public employees, were
expected to last through Monday and possibly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote authorizes the first large public strikes in
Germany since 1992, when garbage piled up in the streets and public
transport and airline traffic were interrupted for 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Werding said the unions have been building their war chests
since then and could afford a longer strike.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strike could deal a blow to Schroeder's image as a
business-friendly Social Democrat, as well as his attempts to
preserve Germany's consensus-led business climate in an
increasingly cutthroat, global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Backing the unions would tarnish his credentials as a fiscal
disciplinarian, but cracking down too hard could weaken him further
with his party's traditional base. A strike also could damage
Schroeder's roundtable talks between business and labor on ways to
bring down Germany's chronically high unemployment. The sixth
summit meeting is scheduled for July 10.
</P>
<P>
   OeTV head Herbert Mai said Friday he was optimistic both sides
could reach agreement, but warned that the government had to bring
a better wage offer to the table for that to happen. If not, Mai
said the unions would strike Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, the unions have set moderate wage goals, so
that they are objectively speaking meetable,'' Christian Zahn,
chief negotiator for the DAG union, told InfoRadio Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Overruling union leaders, who had recommended acceptance, union
members last week rejected a wage package drafted by independent
arbitrators calling for raises of 1.8 percent this year and 2.2
percent in 2001. They had been seeking 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Government employers say higher wages would strain public
coffers and necessitate public sector layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't pay more than what's actually in the till,''
complained Karlheinz Weimer, finance minister from the state of
Hesse.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 30; Nasdaq Up 25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today after a tame inflation
report failed to calm investors' fears that the Federal Reserve
will again raise interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 30.29 at 10,638.43. The blue-chip index was higher
for most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.73 at 1,456.94, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 25.49 at 3,851.05.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially rose today after the Labor Department reported
the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expecting an 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts. That troubled some investors
and derailed the market's early attempt to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer price report followed a series of indicators over
the last few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today. Qualcomm rose $1.25
to $78.688 and Sun Microsystems gained $1.938 to $89.438, both on
the Nasdaq. On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component Hewlett
Packard was up $3 at $128.875.
</P>
<P>
   But some ''old economy'' stalwarts pulled the Dow lower.
McDonald's fell $3.125 to $32.313 after the company reported that
sales growth slowed in May. Analysts said the company faced an
extremely tough comparison with May 1999 figures, because
McDonald's was running a wildly popular Beanie Babies giveaway last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
NYSE, where volume came to 539.25 million shares, down from 571.21
million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.78 at 519.32.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Agree on Defense  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAINZ, Germany (AP) -- France and Germany agreed Friday to
strengthen a common European defense -- one less dependent on the
United States -- during a summit meant to demonstrate the fitness of
the Franco-German motor driving European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques agreed
to jointly develop a European surveillance system and military
transport planes as Europe develops a rapid reaction corps that
would respond to crises without U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   On the 75th summit of Europe's key postwar alliance, held in
this Rhine River city full of symbols of Franco-German cooperation,
the leaders, joined by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, went to
lengths to portray the relationship as strong, even amid signs it
may be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ''For both nations, the results were far-reaching, and the
discussions were held in an atmosphere of friendship,'' Schroeder
said, emphasizing that ''the extent of the agreements we reached on
arms policies defies comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac concurred: ''This summit was an opportunity to again
secure that the unity between Germany and France is not fissured.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit, which included consultations between foreign,
defense, economic and culture ministers, also produced a
declaration stating that the EU should make its Balkans policy
''more cohesive and stronger'' and an agreement that an EU-Balkans
summit should be held to promote democratic progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also said they discussed their shared concern that a
U.S. plan to develop a national missile defense program against
what Washington sees as ''rogue'' states would trigger a new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   The most concrete decisions were in the area of defense. The
leaders agreed to jointly develop a new surveillance system using
complementary French and German satellites that would address
deficiencies in European reconnaissance. The partners said other
European nations would be invited to join the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Germany also will join France and Britain in purchasing Airbus
A400M military transport aircraft, abandoning interest in a
competing airplane being developed by Russia, the Antonov An-7X,
according to the declaration on forging a stronger European defense
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and France will look for ways to include Russian and
Ukrainian companies in building the Airbus, in a nod to Germany's
wish to bolster faltering economies in the former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   The A400M, which still has no prototype, would have twice the
capacity and fly 30 percent faster than the C-130s it would
replace.
</P>
<P>
   The summit comes at a time when the Franco-German relationship,
bound by the close friendship between the late former French
President Francois Mitterrand and ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has
experienced repeated bouts of uncertainty, many resulting from a
shift in relationships since the fall of communism realigned
European priorities.

<HEADLINE> Koreans To Resume Search for MIAs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and North Korea agreed
Friday to resume a joint effort to locate and recover the remains
of thousands of American servicemen who are unaccounted for from
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was struck on the third day of negotiations in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between representatives of the Defense
Department and the North Korean People's Liberation Army, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The first search mission is scheduled for June 25, the 50th
anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Liotta, the lead U.S. negotiator, said in a telephone
interview from Kuala Lumpur that the United States would pay North
Korea about $400,000 for each of five excavation operations, the
last one in November.
</P>
<P>
   Liotta, deputy director of the Pentagon's POW-MIA office, said
wartime records indicate there are upward of 1,500 U.S. servicemen
-- mostly soldiers but also some airmen -- believed to have been
killed in the area to be searched initially. He said it was
impossible to estimate beforehand how many might be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a pretty good chance of bringing back good numbers
of remains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as final preparations are under way in the North
Korean capital, Pyongyang, for a summit meeting starting Monday
between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and North Korea agreed to a series of five
excavations in Unsan and Kujang counties, about 60 miles north of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon believes more than 500 sets of remains could be
recovered near Unsan, a site of major battles between the U.S.
Army's 8th Cavalry Regiment and Chinese troops in November 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement permits the United States to broaden its search
for remains all the way to the Yalu River, on the Chinese border,
Liotta said. Many hundreds of U.S. POWs died in camps on the Korean
side of the Yalu.
</P>
<P>
   By the Pentagon's count, 8,174 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted
for from the Korean War, which began June 25, 1950, with a North
Korean invasion that nearly drove responding U.S. troops off the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal struck Friday in Kuala Lumpur, the
United States will be allowed 20 people on its search teams. Each
mission will last 25 days. In its initial announcement of the deal,
the Pentagon made no mention of what has been one of the stickiest
issues: the amount of financial compensation to be paid to North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For many years after the war ended in 1953 the United States had
no means of recovering remains north of the Demilitarized Zone that
was established to divide the capitalist South from the communist
North. But in the early 1990s, North Korea began unilateral returns
of a small number of remains, and later it negotiated terms of
cooperation on joint recovery missions, the first of which was
conducted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 12 recovery operations inside North Korea since
then, 42 sets of remains believed to be those of American soldiers
were recovered, although only three have been positively identified
by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The searches were halted in November 1999 and a subsequent round
of talks in December broke off when North Korea demanded new
American humanitarian donations, including the construction of
factories to produce children's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Kuala Lumpur was chosen as a neutral venue for this week's
meeting. Previous rounds were held in Hawaii, New York and Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 50; Nasdaq Gains 37  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today after a tame inflation
report failed to calm investors' fears that the Federal Reserve
will again raise interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 50.14 at 10,618.58. The blue-chip
index was higher for most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 5.73 at 1,455.94, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 37.35 at 3,862.91.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially rose today after the Labor Department reported
the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expecting an 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts. That troubled some investors
and derailed the market's early attempt to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer price report followed a series of indicators over
the last few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today. Qualcomm rose $1.75
to $79.188 and Sun Microsystems gained $1.75 to $89.25, both on the
Nasdaq. On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component Hewlett
Packard was up $2.375 at $128.25 and its spinoff, Agilent
Technologies, was up $3.50 at $71.438.
</P>
<P>
   But some ''old economy'' stalwarts pulled the Dow lower.
McDonald's fell $1.625 to $33.813 after the company reported sales
growth slowed in May. Analysts said the company faced an extremely
tough comparison with May 1999 figures, because McDonald's was
running a wildly popular Beanie Babies giveaway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
NYSE, where volume came to 625.22 million shares, down from 671.60
million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.43 at 519.97.

<HEADLINE> Stonehenge Skeleton Poses Mysteries  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA MICHELSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- He could have been a Roman enemy, or an
Anglo-Saxon king. He may have lived among the Druids.
Archaeologists know he was executed at Stonehenge centuries ago,
but virtually nothing about who he was.
</P>
<P>
   They hope new scientific techniques will help them determine the
identity of a man whose skeleton was unearthed at Stonehenge in
1923 and then overlooked in storage until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton, unveiled Friday, provides the first indication of
an execution taking place at Stonehenge, according to English
Heritage, the agency responsible for the upkeep of many historic
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Other remains found there were of people believed to have been
killed in battle or killed elsewhere and buried at the site,
Britain's greatest prehistoric monument.
</P>
<P>
   The male skeleton dates anywhere from 100 B.C. to A.D. 1000.
Nicks in the jaw and neck vertebrae indicate the man was
decapitated from behind by a sharp sword, archaeologists said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   When the remains were found in 1923, scientists assumed the man
died of natural causes. It was only after they were located in May
1999 in storage at London's Natural History Museum that
archaeologists realized he'd been killed.
</P>
<P>
   But while the manner of death is clear, the circumstances
surrounding it remain a mystery, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologist Mike Pitts -- who helped relocate the skeleton --
speculated the man could have been a Druid killed by the Roman army
or the victim of a judicial execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could our man have been a wrongdoer executed for his actions
which, as is so often the case for deeds meriting a death sentence,
at that time would likely have been a political or religious
infringement?'' Pitts asked.
</P>
<P>
   The bones had been believed destroyed along with other artifacts
during the Blitz in World War II. The skeleton was shipped out of
London during the war to keep it safe and was returned without
ribs, hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was rediscovered when Pitts started doing research for a book
and found a letter in an archive suggesting the skeleton was still
in London. On a hunch, he called the Natural History Museum and was
told the skeleton was in storage there.
</P>
<P>
   On display Friday, the reddish-yellow bones appeared strong and
resembled sandstone, barely showing the nicks that revealed the
man's cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   A bone sample is being analyzed using carbon-dating techniques
at Oxford University and a tooth is being studied to determine
where the man was born.
</P>
<P>
   Only three other complete skeletons have been unearthed at
Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   David Miles, chief archaeologist at English Heritage, said the
skeleton serves as an important reminder that the artifacts some
museums hold in storage ''are as much of a treasure as what's in
the galleries themselves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Lisa Marie Presley, whose childhood home
is one of this city's most famous landmarks, wants to give hope --
as well as shelter -- to families who have nowhere to live.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Elvis Presley was in her hometown Thursday to
break ground for Presley Place, housing for the homeless that will
open in January.
</P>
<P>
   Presley Place is a way to give ''hope and opportunity back to
those who may have lost it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley was born into poverty and lived in public housing
in Memphis as a youth. Rock stardom brought him the money to buy
his mansion, Graceland, which is now one of the city's most popular
tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association hopes to begin
construction on Presley Place by the end of June with $1.3 million
donated by the Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Celine Dion Says She's Pregnant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Singer Celine Dion, who took a break from
performing to try to get pregnant after having difficulty
conceiving, said Friday she is expecting a baby next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just found out,'' she said in a statement, adding that she
and husband-manager Rene Angelil were ''completely, totally happy''
with the news.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Francine Chaloult said Dion's baby was expected in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   ''In three weeks, if all goes well, we'll hear the heart of our
baby, beating inside of my tummy,'' said Dion, who has sold
millions of records worldwide and is best known for ''My Heart Will
Go On,'' the theme song to the award-winning film ''Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement also said that Angelil, who had surgery last year
to remove a cancerous lump on his throat, had received test results
that showed no cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, 32, had been undergoing fertility treatments in New York,
forcing her last week to turn down an offer to sing at the Montreal
funeral of Canadian hockey legend Maurice Richard.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Dion filed a $20 million lawsuit against the
National Enquirer tabloid, saying a story it carried reporting she
was pregnant with twins was false. She said the story filled her
with heartache because she had been unable to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time it's for real -- I'm pregnant,'' her statement said.
''We are completely, totally happy. And we thank God for the great
joy we've been given.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over this past year, we went through a terrible test together,
but we made it through stronger, closer, more loving than ever,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidates in Bank Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's top two presidential candidates
found their families embroiled in a national banking scandal
Friday, after the ruling party nominee admitted his brother's debts
had been absorbed by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
told Reforma newspaper that his brother, Eduardo, was among
thousands of businessmen whose debts were absorbed by a
taxpayer-financed rescue fund.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida had denied the same allegation repeatedly, as recently
as two weeks ago, Reforma's front-page story noted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His chief competitor, Vicente Fox of the National Action Party,
had already admitted his family's businesses were touched by the
rescue program, though he denied he was involved -- a claim other
parties have disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Polls ahead of the July 2 election show Fox and Labastida in a
statistical dead heat. The Democratic Revolution Party of
third-place candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has tried to use the
issue to gain ground, so far with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bailout program has been one of Mexico's hottest
scandals, with the cost to taxpayers estimated as high as $100
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The program was meant to save Mexico's banking system from
collapsing under an avalanche of unpaid loans, following the
December 1994 devaluation that sent variable interest rates soaring
more than 100 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   A taxpayer-backed fund absorbed many past-due loans, though many
have since been paid off in full or in part. It was not unclear if
Labastida's brother had paid his debt fully.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's party has blocked efforts to publish details of the
program, saying it would violate banking secrecy and stain the
reputations of many honest people who had paid off their loans or
were trying to.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution politicians have used fragmentary reports
to release partial lists of names including Fox, Labastida and some
of Mexico's richest business figures. The lists often are old,
though, and do not reflect settlements or show if the debts were
paid off fully or only in part.
</P>
<P>
   El Universal newspaper published large advertisements in other
papers Friday accusing Democratic Revolution of an ''error or bad
faith'' in listing it among those who benefitted from the program.
The ad included a copy of a bank letter saying the paper's loan had
been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar
accused Fox of lying about his participation in the companies aided
by the bailout, El Universal reported Friday. Ramirez claimed Fox
received more than $100,000 in company profits between 1995 and
1997, when he was governor of Guanajuato state.

<HEADLINE> Hung jury in murder trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) - A jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict
after four days of deliberations in the case of a man accused of
killing a co-worker's husband at her request.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara County jury reported it was deadlocked Friday
afternoon, after 27 hours of deliberations in the second-degree
murder trial of 29-year-old Michael Northrup. Eight jurors favored
a murder conviction and four were against it. Eleven wanted to
convict on a weapons charge but one voted to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup of Caledonia in Livingston County is accused of
shooting John Montstream in June 1998 and leaving the body in the
victim's minivan in a Niagara Falls parking ramp, where it was
found a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream's 41-year-old wife, Annette, testified that Northrup,
with whom she was romantically involved, volunteered to kill her
husband. She is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in March
to first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said yet whether they will press for a new
trial.

<HEADLINE> Putin Won't Pressure North Korea  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin won't try to persuade
North Korea to drop its missile program during an upcoming state
visit, despite U.S. concerns that the isolated communist country is
a growing threat to world peace, Russia's foreign minister said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin announced that Putin will visit North Korea shortly,
but did not give a date. The visit would be the first by a Russian
leader to North Korea, and comes at a time when Moscow and
Washington disagree over its possible threat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is considering building a limited anti-missile
defense system against ''rogue states'' such as North Korea, a
proposal strongly opposed by Russia, which sees the U.S. plan as a
threat to its own nuclear forces. Putin's visit to Pyongyang could
further strain ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Putin is coming on a visit to a friendly country and
he does not intend to talk anybody out of anything,'' Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference when asked if the
Russian leader would urge North Korea to curb its missile program.
He added that Russia wants to help promote stability on the divided
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's foreign policy aide Sergei Prikhodko said the visit
would be before the meeting of the G-8 industrialized nations in
Japan on July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   Russia firmly rejects Washington's argument that the threat from
''rogue states'' is so great that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty must be amended to allow construction of a U.S. national
missile-defense system. Russia proposes developing an alternate
system jointly with Europe and NATO, but Washington says such a
system is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and President Clinton failed to reach agreement on the ABM
issue during a summit in Moscow last weekend, although Russian
officials acknowledged there was a threat. Putin has warned that
Russia could pull out of all arms control agreements if Washington
breaches the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia is potentially as vulnerable as the United
States to rogue missile attacks, Ivanov said ''we proceed from the
view that currently, there is no realistic threat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of the future, naturally, nothing can be excluded,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, North Korea accused the United States of using
''fictitious'' threats to justify its missile defense plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. employs the trite method of sacrificing small
countries to please big countries, but it is gravely mistaken if it
thinks that will work on (North Korea),'' the North's Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin called Clinton on Friday to discuss several issues,
including missile defense. His impending visit to North Korea was
not discussed, a White House official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   By making the visit, Putin aims both to undermine the United
States and expand Russia's influence in foreign affairs, analysts
said. Restoring some of Moscow's global clout is among Putin's top
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To a certain extent, it's an anti-American move, a Russian
retaliation for the U.S. dismissal of Putin's proposal to jointly
build anti-missile systems,'' said Yevgeny Volk, an analyst at the
Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ivanov said Putin wouldn't try to dissuade North Korea
from its missile program, some analysts suggested Moscow may be
seeking a compromise such as putting the Korean missile force under
international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin may try to reach an agreement that would place North
Korean missiles under international control in exchange for
financial assistance -- a deal similar to that reached before on a
North Korean nuclear program,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the
Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would deprive the United States of its key argument in
favor of anti-missile defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been trying to revive some of its Soviet-era
alliances. Moscow was a key backer of North Korea during the Cold
War, but relations fell apart after the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has been taking small steps toward ending its
isolation. The announcement of Putin's trip came just before North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il was to meet for the first time with the
president of South Korea, President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is trying to return to areas where it was traditionally
present, which puts it on a collision course with the United
States,'' said Ivan Safranchuk, a world affairs analyst at the
PIR-Center independent think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the Russian leader was also considering an
invitation from South Korea, but noted that it was ''too early'' to
speak of anything definite.

<HEADLINE> An analysis of a television ad from Rick Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of Senate candidate Rick Lazio's first
television
advertisement:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Introduction.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Upstate New York markets.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: ''My mom and dad were both veterans. Their very first
date was at a Brooklyn Dodgers game at Ebbets Field. My dad was one
of those guys who came back from World War II without a dime in his
pocket, but he had this dream: his very own auto parts store. I
worked there as a kid stacking mufflers and learning all about hard
work from my dad. I met a wonderful local girl, Patricia Ann
Moriarity. We got married and now we are raising our two daughters,
Molly Ann and Kelsey. I started as a prosecutor and I have been a
congressman for eight years. I work hard on issues like housing and
the environment and with two daughters in New York public schools,
I care deeply about education. I've got a mainstream record and
I've stood up for New York. Now I am in the race for Senate, and
while I may be the underdog, I am ready to work hard. I really want
to earn this job. I'm going to visit every part of this state
listening to you. New York means everything to me. I'd be very
proud to be your Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: The ad features black and white photos of Lazio's mother
and father, shots of his father's auto parts store and pictures of
a young Lazio in a baseball uniform. There is footage of Lazio, his
wife and two children at the beach. There are shots from his
candidacy announcement and of him shaking hands in a parade.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad is designed to introduce the little-known
congressman to upstate New York, a key area for any Republican
candidate running in a statewide race. It strives to portray him as
a nothing flashy, an Everyman figure. To that end, he does all the
talking. By focusing heavily on his wife and children, the ad
serves to remind voters that his Senate rival, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, has gone through marital problems that led to an
unsuccessful attempt in Congress to remove her husband from office.
The ad also stresses his New York roots, everything from his
parents' meeting at a Brooklyn Dodgers game to his daughters being
in ''New York public schools.'' That is meant to remind voters that
the first lady just moved into New York. Lazio also talks about
being a prosecutor and a congressman, a means of reminding voters
that the first lady has never served in elective office. By saying
he has ''a mainstream record,'' he seeks to counter Clinton claims
that he is too conservative. One possible slip by his ad team is
the footage of him shaking hands at a parade. That may remind
voters of the tumble he took at one such parade that left him with
a fat lip for the state GOP convention late last month.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Doctors for Donations  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The message intrigued Dr. Charles DeCarli: A
woman who said she represented House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said
DeCarli was recommended for a national award and should call a
toll-free number to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   When the neurologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center
called the ''Physicians Advisory Board,'' he learned it actually
was a fund-raising pitch for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, the House GOP's political arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so angry at this,'' DeCarli said in a telephone interview
Friday. ''It's what I perceive as a bait-and-switch. I know this
isn't illegal, but I think this is really sham politics.''
</P>
<P>
   An NRCC spokesman, Jim Wilkinson, acknowledged the solicitation
method, which he said is legal and ''happens to be one of our most
successful programs.'' He wouldn't say how much has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only people who seem to get upset about it are the
Democrats. It must be working well,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   DeCarli was offered an ''honorary appointment'' as advisory
board chairman for Kansas. The position required no time
commitment, he was told, but it would let him give leading
lawmakers his views about health care in a conference call. His
name also would be used in a newspaper advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then she said that she wanted a one-time donation between
$300 and $500,'' DeCarli said. ''She said, 'If you don't give me
the money, you don't get to do any of this.' When I told her I
wasn't going to give her the money, that was it. She went away.''
</P>
<P>
   With the presidency and control of Congress at stake, both
political parties are raising money in record amounts. The NRCC has
taken in more than $45 million, while its Democratic counterpart
has raised at least $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are pulling out all the stops and using every vehicle,
every maneuver they can to bring in as much money as possible,''
said Sheila Krumholz, research director for the nonpartisan Center
for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Krumholz was surprised to hear about the technique
employed by the NRCC.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has rightly raised some eyebrows and even the hackles of
these physicians or leaders in the community, who are being led to
believe they are receiving awards based on the merits of their
work, and it turns out they're really being hit up for donations,''
Krumholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats need just six seats to win control of the House,
and both parties believe a handful of competitive races will decide
who holds the majority. Among them is the Kansas City, Kan.,
district where DeCarli lives. It is represented by freshman
Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore.
</P>
<P>
   One of DeCarli's colleagues, Dr. Sharon Lynch, received a
similar solicitation, but Lynch said because she had spoken with
DeCarli, she did not return the call.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to the toll-free number that is left for doctors hear
this recording: ''Thank you for calling the Physicians Advisory
Board. We are transferring your call right now.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCarli, who said he is a Democrat and has contributed to
Democratic campaigns, said he asked the person who answered his
call who was sponsoring the program. She refused to tell him. He
learned it was the NRCC only after speaking to her supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was fuming,'' he said. ''I still believe in the old adage
that you get awards for what you do: hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said there was nothing deceptive about the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''How in the world can this be sham politics?'' he asked.
''There's no law that says you have to participate. If the
recipient is sympathetic, then they support us.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio to tap former top aide to Forbes as campaign manager  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio will name Bill Dal Col, who
ran publisher Steve Forbes' two unsuccessful presidential races, as
manager of his U.S. Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
announcement of Dal Col's appointment would come soon, possibly as
early as late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation from the Lazio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the millionaire publisher failed in his two efforts to win
the White House in 1992 and 1996, Dal Col earned generally high
marks from those who dealt with him during those presidential
races.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great choice,'' said Nelson Warfield, who served as Bob
Dole's presidential campaign spokesman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Number one, Dal Col is the consummate organization man. He'll
bring structure to a fast-growing campaign,'' Warfield said.
''Number two, he actually knows the candidate. They go back to the
Suffolk County Republican vineyards and it is vitally important to
a campaign to have people on board who have a relationship to the
candidate beyond the next paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is from Suffolk County which is where Dal Col cut his
political teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lazio campaign on Friday unveiled its first
television advertisement, a 60-second spot stressing his background
as a New Yorker and his work as a congressman. The ad, in addition
to boosting Lazio's name recognition, is meant to underscore the
fact that Clinton only moved into the state in January and has no
record as an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pro-Lazio TV ads have already begun airing, one
financed by the state Conservative Party and the other paid for by
the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington-based political
action committee that espouses moderate Republican ideas. The
council's advisory board includes New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign took the wraps off a new 30-second TV spots
of its own on Friday in which the first lady talks directly into
the camera and is shown mingling with New Yorkers as she tells
viewers that she has ''traveled to all 62 counties of New York''
and would work to improve health care, save Social Security, reduce
the national debt, create jobs and make college tuition tax
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Dal Col to the Lazio campaign team gives the
operation an even more distinctly presidential flair. Already
working for Lazio's Senate effort are several key players from Sen.
John McCain's presidential run, including media guru Michael
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also reached into the ranks of Pataki's political team
to staff a campaign that only got started on May 19 after Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani quit the Senate race to deal with his prostate
cancer.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan, Ugandan Forces Face Off  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Mortar and artillery shells rained down
and stray bullets whistled through the deserted streets of this
Congo River port Friday, where 200,000 terrified, angry residents
waited in vain for the Rwandan and Ugandan forces to cease their
relentless firing.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said more than 150 civilians have been killed and
700 wounded since the shelling and shooting began Monday. Rwanda
and Uganda use Kisangani as a logistics base to support rival rebel
groups, and despite an agreement to demilitarize the city, have
begun fighting for control of it.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of three people, two of them women, lay decomposing
in the back yard of their home Friday where a mortar round fell
Wednesday night as they were preparing food.
</P>
<P>
   Two more people were buried under rubble inside. Nobody had
dared to collect or bury the bodies because of the constant
shelling and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no food or water. It's all because of Rwandans and
Ugandans. They are killing us,'' said Gabriel Makoko, who lived
next door to the dead. Other neighbors, their faces covered with
shirts to ward off the stench, peered at the bodies and shook their
heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left Beirut like this. Now I have to see it again,'' said
Hussein Abad, a Lebanese who in better days purchased gemstones
from Congolese traders.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the heads of five U.N. humanitarian agencies called
Friday for Rwanda and Uganda to immediately stop fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that the entire civilian population of the northern
town of Kisangani was ''completely cut off from humanitarian
relief,'' the senior U.N. officials said, ''we urge the governments
of Rwanda and Uganda to immediately end the fighting that is
killing innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Both armies were in the process of withdrawing from the city in
accordance with a prearranged plan. But U.N. military observers
said 6,000 mortar shells have fallen on Kisangani since the latest
fighting broke out this week.
</P>
<P>
   The trapped residents of Kisangani, already impoverished by
decades of misrule under former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and
driven to despair by the second civil war in two years, ventured
outside their homes Friday to gather firewood so they could boil
the few cassava leaves they could gather to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal shrapnel sliced through palm trees, which toppled over
onto crumbling, potholed roads. No one had any idea when the firing
would cease.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 unarmed U.N. military observers, based in Kisangani since
the beginning of the year, were desperate because of the failure of
the local Rwandan and Ugandan army commanders to respect a
cease-fire they had agreed to at least 20 times since the fighting
started.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot collect the dead from the street and houses. Part of
the city is destroyed. Doctors cannot move from their homes. There
is no cease-fire,'' said Lt. Col. Danilo Paiva, a Uruguayan who
heads the observer team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Lusaka peace accord signed last July and
August by the Congolese government, the three rebel groups and five
foreign armies involved in the conflict, the observers are supposed
to be reinforced by a 5,537-strong force. So far, only 100 U.N.
personnel have deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies, initially allies in the 22-month war against
President Laurent Kabila, blame each other for firing the first
shot. Kisangani has been a key logistics base for both, and despite
agreeing to a withdrawal, they are loathe to abandon the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lt. Col. Paiva secured a fragile, five-hour lull in
the fighting to drive three U.N. vehicles to two hospitals. The
observers -- dressed in camouflage uniforms, flack jackets and some
wearing blue helmets -- were confronted by weary Congolese patients
and doctors in dire need of power generators, medicine and clean
hypodermic needles.
</P>
<P>
   Faustin Abusa, an administrator at one of the hospitals least
touched by the shelling, said three people had died since
Wednesday, including a 15-year-old girl who was hit by a stray
bullet while lying in bed recovering from a shrapnel wound in her
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Liebeskind, the Red Cross representative, said his car
was hit by gunfire Friday when he went out to inspect the city's
four hospitals. One hospital was hit by a mortar round Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was concentrated along the 3-mile-long Tshopo River
bank, just north of the city center, where Ugandan forces were
trying to advance into Kisangani, but were stopped by heavy Rwandan
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. observers kept talking to both sides, even as they
traded mortar and artillery fire, ignoring the nonexistent truce. A
U.N. aircraft that was supposed to fly another eight observers in
from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, failed to arrive because the
Rwandan army said it could not guarantee a safe landing.
</P>
<P>
   The observers also failed to reach the Ugandan side, where they
planned to monitor Rwanda's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we move with all those bullets flying around?'' said
Lt. Col. Khalid Khan, a Pakistani observer. ''They are fighting
along the same line. And everyday, you see another roof blown off
in the city. What is the objective?''

<HEADLINE> Russia May Run Chechnya for Years  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- As President Vladimir Putin prepares to
put rebel Chechnya under his direct rule, a Russian commander said
Friday that members of a pro-Moscow Chechen militia were being
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The militia recently was disbanded because many of its members
were fighting for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its disarmament has begun,'' Lt. Gen. Ivan Babichev said,
adding that the militia ''should not be subordinate to some leaders
but function in keeping with the laws of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   The militia had been led by Bislan Gantamirov, a one-time
separatist who switched sides to become mayor of the Chechen
capital Grozny, only to be imprisoned on charges of embezzling
Russia funds intended for rebuilding the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Such shifting loyalties underline the difficulty Russia would
face in forming an elected government in Chechnya in the near
future. Putin on Thursday called for imposing direct rule, denying
the republic the right to elect its own regional government.
</P>
<P>
   The move must be approved by parliament, and expressions of
support grew on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's move came as Chechen rebels continued a wave of
hit-and-run attacks on Russian forces in the region despite
Moscow's repeated claims that the insurgents have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Three medical specialists were killed and three others were
wounded Friday in Grozny, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
The group of epidemiologists was riding in a ministry car near a
Grozny hospital when gunmen opened fire, a ministry duty officer
said.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman, who declined to be named, said Friday that
two Interior Ministry soldiers were killed and a third was wounded
in a bomb blast Thursday night in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sappers defused bombs in Grozny and two other Chechen
towns on Thursday, the military said. The rebels have staged a
string of bombings in Russian-held areas in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of the State Duma, the lower chamber of
parliament, said Friday that the chamber would move soon to debate
direct presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Patrushev, who heads the country's main domestic
intelligence service, predicted direct rule would continue for
several years while the republic was returned to normal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said the move was aimed at creating conditions to
restore government, the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the republic would be run by a provisional
administration headed by a Putin-appointed chief answerable to the
president and the Russian federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive against Chechnya, which began in late
September, has stalled for months in the rugged southern mountains.
The rebels have kept up ambushes and bombings in the northern
lowlands that have inflicted a steady stream of losses on Russian
forces and sapped troop morale.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian National Strike Continues  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- A national strike touched off by a 50
percent increase in fuel prices shut banks, offices and gas
stations Friday in the second day of the stoppage in Nigeria's
commercial capital of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines canceled flights because of the strike, and the job
action closed the city's two ports. Enforcers of the strike
commandeered buses at two major terminals to prevent their being
used and attacked buses in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern cities of Abeokuta, Ibadan and Benin City,
youths barricades roads and forced passengers off buses.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation was also paralyzed in the northern city of Kano,
where streets were deserted after clashes Thursday between police
and protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, however, the strike appeared to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   While government offices remained closed in the capital, Abuja,
schools, banks and businesses resumed operations.
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Banks and
offices were open, and there was little sign of strike action in
the major towns.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella Nigeria Labor Congress began the strike Thursday to
protest the price hike, which increased the cost of gas from 76
cents to $1.15 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo, however, says government can no
longer afford the $2 billion annual subsidy required to keep fuel
prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, which has a foreign debt of $30 billion, is also under
pressure from international lending institutions to deregulate and
reduce price subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The government offered Thursday to halve the price hike, but
labor leaders decided to press on with the strike until prices were
brought back to their original levels.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production, the country's economic mainstay, has been
largely unaffected by the strike, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not suffered any disruption in either production or
loading of crude so far,'' a spokesman for oil giant Shell said on
condition of anonymity. ''Our operations are going on smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, some Lagos residents were growing weary of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure by enforcers, some buses were in service, and
traffic was back to normal level in large parts of the city. Stores
started to open again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know for how long this can continue,'' said Ike
Maduka, a factory worker. ''The government has tried to ... reduce
the increase. I want the labor leaders to reconsider their stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's increase in the cost of major petroleum products
prompted violent protests in major cities across southwestern
Nigeria, which remains desperately poor despite Nigeria's being the
world's sixth-largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 19 people in Thursday's rioting in Lagos which
killed at least two people, national radio reported.

County surprised to hear it is nominated for disaster area
designation
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and the state's two U.S.
senators asked that Tompkins County be designated a disaster area
due to heavy rainfall over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The request came as surprising news to county officials, who
said they didn't know the county was nominated for such a
designation, nor think it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any damage from any storms here were nothing we couldn't
repair quickly on our own without federal assistance,'' Tompkins
County Administrator Richard Erb said today.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, State Emergency Management officials were surprised to
hear of the county leader's surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked with the county, we did a preliminary damage
assessment,'' spokesman Dennis Michalski said on Friday afternoon.
He said that all the agencies together determined Tompkins needed
$260,000 for debris removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They more than exceeded the federal threshold which is why the
governor included them,'' Michalski added. ''Obviously we're sorry
the county administrator is unaware of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins was one of 13 counties on Pataki's wish list to be
eligible for funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The letter to FEMA Director James Lee Witt from senators Charles E.
Schumer and Daniel P. Moynihan said that the counties had been hit
with a series of powerful storms, which have caused widespread
flooding and high wind damages.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitation level in Tompkins County has been above normal
but not nearly as high as counties to the east, said Keith
Eggleston, climatologist for the Northeast Regional Climate Center
at Cornell University. Ithaca's precipitation total for 2000
reached 19.22 inches as of Thursday, approximately six inches above
the normal amount.
</P>
<P>
   If the county receives federal funds, Erb said the money would
be put toward bridge maintenance and work on other drainage
projects to prevent any recurring damage on the county's
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Goes To Highest Court  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Defense lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet
on Friday appealed a court ruling that stripped the former dictator
of immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to the Supreme Court was aimed at reversing last
month's decision by a lower court allowing Pinochet to stand trial
on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Defense team lawyer Gustavo Collao said the decision by the
Santiago Court of Appeals was ''a judicial offense'' to the
84-year-old Pinochet, who as a senator for life previously enjoyed
immunity from prosecution. The appeal stressed Pinochet's
innocence, Collao said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no information whatsoever, no indications or
suspicions, that Sen. Pinochet has participated in the acts of
which he is accused,'' said Collao, a retired army colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 110 criminal complaints stemming from abuses
during his 1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the complaints stem from the so-called ''Caravan of
Death,'' in which military officers toured several cities shortly
after Pinochet's coup, dragging political prisoners from jail and
executing them. An official report says 75 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Santiago appeals court voted to remove Pinochet's immunity,
stating that ''there are clear suspicions'' of his responsibility
for the caravan.
</P>
<P>
   But Collao said Pinochet's defense team had asked the Supreme
Court to decree the lower court hearing unfair, because the
ex-dictator was too sick to issue instructions to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the appeal included a request for new medical tests to
determine whether Pinochet could even stand trial -- a request
rejected by the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was detained in London on a Spanish warrant for 16
months, much of it under house arrest. He was released after
doctors determined he was physically and mentally unfit for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Hernan Alvarez said a decision on
the appeal was likely later this month.

<HEADLINE> Professors censure Albertus Magnus for dismissing gay dean  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Albertus Magnus College is taking some
heat from college professors for dismissing a gay dean.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of University Professors censured the
Roman Catholic college Friday, saying it violated the academic
freedom of Michael Hartwig, a former priest who had been an
associate dean and religion professor.
</P>
<P>
   The censure is a stain on the reputation of the school in
academic circles, but it does not mean that association members are
obligated to turn down teaching positions there.
</P>
<P>
   To have the censure removed, Albertus Magnus must make amends to
Hartwig and revise its faculty handbook to clarify dismissal
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-student liberal arts college is not concerned that the
censure will impair its ability to attract students and faculty,
said college spokesman Mike Serpe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vote that was taken today was predetermined, and frankly,
the overall process was biased from the time Albertus Magnus took
the proper steps it did concerning Mr. Hartwig,'' Serpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig responded that he thinks it is unfortunate that the
college has not responded to the AAUP's concerns about academic
freedom and due process in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm grateful that the AAUP works so hard to ensure that
scholars are treated fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The college said it did not renew Hartwig's employment after
Hartwig described himself as ''a priest on leave'' in a newspaper
article. He also was identified as gay and a priest on leave in The
Wanderer, a national Roman Catholic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When Hartwig was hired in 1991, college administrators said they
were told he was a former priest.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between the two terms is significant for the
school because of its religious background. Albertus Magnus leaders
said the controversy put them in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig maintains he was fired in 1997 because he is gay, a
claim college leaders deny. He has sued the school over his
dismissal. The case is pending in Hartford federal court.
</P>
<P>
   An AAUP report claims Hartwig was dismissed so the college could
avoid negative publicity about his sexuality and about a book he
planned to write that was at odds with the church's teaching on
sexual abstinence for homosexuals and other unmarried people.
</P>
<P>
   Because of pending litigation, the college did not participate
in the AAUP investigation and criticized the group for proceeding
with only part of the story.

<HEADLINE> Transgendered Pair: INS Is After Us  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STERLING, Va. (AP) -- A Virginia couple claim the Immigration and
Naturalization Service is persecuting them because she used to live
as a man and he used to live as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are hunting us, and the only reason we can think of is
that we are transgendered,'' the woman, Irish immigrant Katherine
Spray, told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The INS says it is challenging her visa application, which is
based on her marriage to Pat Spray, because he did not disclose a
1975 marriage that may not have been properly dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Pat, once known as Patricia, was born female and lived as a
woman until the 1990s, marrying two men and giving birth to a
daughter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Spray and her former husband split up in 1978, and both
say they thought the other had obtained a divorce. They filed for
divorce in May.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Spray was born in Ireland, with the name Damien
Niland, and lived as a man until 1991. She and Pat Spray -- neither
of whom has had surgery to change gender -- became friends on the
Internet in 1995. They married in North Carolina and applied for a
marriage-based visa for Katherine Spray before settling down in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprays say INS investigators called their marriage a sham
and threatened to throw Katherine into a male detention facility.
The INS contacted Katherine Spray's employer and said her temporary
work permit was no longer valid. She was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment threat and the call to the employer are both
unusual, said Rex Wingerter, the couple's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   William Bittner, the INS officer in charge of the Norfolk
office, said the case has been forwarded for criminal prosecution,
but he declined to say more.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Mexican President Meet  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, in the twilight of their terms, met Friday for
perhaps the last time and witnessed the signing of an agreement
establishing U.S. and Mexican boundary lines in a potentially
oil-rich area of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, reached after two years of negotiations, was signed
in the Roosevelt Room by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green as Clinton and Zedillo
watched over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The division gives Mexico 4,100 square miles of the deep water
area and the United States 2,536 square miles in an area known as
the western gap of the Gulf of Mexico. The two countries also
agreed to declare a 10-year moratorium on exploration and drilling
in a 3\ mile wide buffer zone along the dividing line. That will
allow time for the two countries to consult on how to divide
potential resources in the strip.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 11th meeting between Clinton, who leaves office in
January, and Zedillo, whose six-year term ends in December. In a
gesture of friendship, Clinton and members of his Cabinet welcomed
Zedillo and members of his Cabinet to a luncheon in the Family
Dining Room, usually reserved for the private use of the
president's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think President Zedillo has done a truly remarkable job,''
Clinton said later, standing alongside Zedillo in the Rose Garden
on a warm afternoon. ''Mexico has had five years of growth, in
excess of five percent a year, after the very difficult financial
crisis in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Mexican relations have been troubled by disputes such as
drug trafficking, corruption and abuse of migrants trying to cross
the border into the United States. But the two leaders made no
public mention of these problems, leaving them to Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to be drawn by reporters into a discussion of
Mexico's elections July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Mexican people will vote and make their own
decisions,'' Clinton said. ''It's interesting to observe. It's just
like this election (in the United States). I'm just an observer
now, I'm not running for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Mexico has a democracy that is supported by solid
institutions. ''There is no reason to fear'' that the elections
will change that, he said. He also brushed off questions about
currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The peso is determined by market forces; some days it goes up
a little, some days it goes down a little, but in general it has
been very stable thanks to the consistency of our economic
policies,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Mexico have been at odds over the role of
the Organization of American States and possible sanctions against
Peru for alleged election irregularities. Washington has pushed for
the OAS to be assertive while Mexico has argued for a circumspect
OAS role in election monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the long run, I think that the OAS still has a good
future and a critical future,'' Clinton said. ''And I don't think
there's any difference between the United States and Mexico in our
determination to do whatever we can to keep democracy strong
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so we talked about it today and it's a difficult
problem,'' the president said. ''But I think the trend is good. You
can't look back on the last 20 years and not believe that.''

<HEADLINE> Questions about fledgling lawyers' mental health draw fire  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The committee that decides who can
practice law in Connecticut is under attack for asking would-be
attorneys if they have been treated for psychotic disorders or
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, lawyers and civil rights activists say the
information sought by the Connecticut Bar Examining Committee is
irrelevant, and asking for it is unconstitutional. The committee
decides who can take the bar exam and who should be admitted to the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are asked eight questions about their mental health
and substance abuse history. The committee recently started asking
applicants if they were treated for clinical depression within the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The questions make Connecticut look like it's in the dark
ages,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West
Hartford. ''To ask a question about depression - which 20 percent
of the population is dealing with - is, for lack of another word,
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bauer, a professor at the University of Connecticut School
of Law, said the questions violate the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act and the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he represents a woman whose application to the bar
has been held up by the committee because she answered ''yes'' to a
question that asked whether she had ever been hospitalized for
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was hospitalized for two weeks and treated for
depression nine years ago when she was 17, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman passed the Connecticut bar exam and is allowed to
practice law in another state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bar examiners are making her disclose all her records,
including those stemming from the counseling she sought in college
after being raped, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not cause for shame, but it's something that's been held
against me and that's not fair,'' said the woman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ''There's a huge bias against people who
have gotten treatment and have done what they had to do to help
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he's considering suing the examining committee if
they don't change their questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   He said the questions may be discouraging some new graduates of
the state's three law schools from trying to practice in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know that if they had to get diagnosed or treated for
depression or a mental illness, they'll have to release that
information,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Beckwith, chairman of the examining committee,
acknowledged that questioning applicants about their mental health
has drawn criticism, and said the Bar Examining Committee will
discuss the matter at a meeting next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are matters that are illegal or unconstitutional,
that's up for a court to decide,'' he said. ''We always want our
activities to be within the scope of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the questions are asked because members are concerned
that a mental illness or drug addiction may hamper someone's
ability to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question about treatment of clinical depression was put on
there because of what seems to be considerable consequences that
may flow from that disorder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   F. Mac Buckley, a well-known former defense attorney who is
awaiting trial on charges he stole money from clients, was
diagnosed as a manic depressive shortly after his arrest in April,
1999. He resigned from the Connecticut Bar in September.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Buckley's disorder did not play a role in his
committee's decision to ask bar applicants about treatment for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith estimated that no more than 3 percent of the 1,400
people who apply to take the state bar exam each year say they've
been treated for depression, mental illness or substance abuse.
There are about 27,000 people licensed to practice law in
Connecticut, and the exams are given twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very few people in this category,'' he said.
''People with fitness issues are a very small minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Grabarz, executive director of the Connecticut Civil
Liberties Union, said he has received two complaints about the
committee's questions about mental health within the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that once this is brought to the committee's
attention, they'll change their policy,'' Grabarz said.

<HEADLINE> India's Christians Facing Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's minority Christians are facing
their most serious challenge in five decades, a community leader
said Friday after the killing of a priest and explosions at two
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a definite strategy and plan at the national level
... these forces at work want to intimidate Christians,'' said
Archbishop Alan de Lastic, president of the Catholic Bishops
Conference of India.
</P>
<P>
   De Lastic did not blame any particular group. But Christian
leaders have accused hard-line groups linked to Premier Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Hindu party of orchestrating the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu groups say Christian missionaries use foreign funds to
entice poor, low-caste Hindus to convert. Christians say the
conversions are voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Mathura, 90 miles southeast of New Delhi, police
were investigating the death of the Rev. George Kuzhikandan, who
was beaten to death by unidentified attackers Tuesday night. The
motive for the attack was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs exploded Thursday in two churches in the eastern state of
Andhra Pradesh, injuring three people. Later, an explosion damaged
a church in the western resort town of Goa, and a bomb exploded
outside a church in southern state of Karnataka. No additional
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are intrigued by the response of those in power, and
saddened at the silence of the government to whom we look upon for
support in meeting the gravest challenge our community has faced in
the 53 years since the independence of India,'' de Lastic said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where
Mathura is located, ordered security be provided at all schools run
by Christian missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's Bharatiya Janata Party urged peace between
Hindus and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appeal to the Christian community in particular not to be
misled by political propagandists and blame Hindus,'' party
spokesman Jagdish Prasad Mathur was quoted as saying by Press Trust
of India.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both communities have been living in peace for years,'' and
nothing now should create a rift between them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christians make up just 2.3 percent of India's population of 1
billion people, mostly Hindus.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 55; Nasdaq Up 49  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a quiet session Friday
after a tame inflation report failed to calm investors' fears that
the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates to force a
slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks eked out a modest advance, helping the Nasdaq
composite index close higher for a second consecutive week. But
investors in the broader market couldn't shake worries that higher
interest rates will cut into company profits, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though corporate earnings are good, if the Fed is raising
rates, there's no guarantee that they'll continue to be good,''
said Phil Foreman, senior portfolio manager at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.66 to close at
10,614.06, giving up an early advance. For the week, the Dow fell
180.70.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite rose
49.28 to close at 3,874.84, bringing its gain for the week to 61.46
points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.72 to 1,456.95.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially rose after the Labor Department reported the
Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expecting an 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts. That troubled some investors
and derailed the market's early gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer price report followed a series of indicators over
the last few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher. Qualcomm rose $1.625 to
$79.063 and Sun Microsystems gained $2.438 to $89.938, both on the
Nasdaq. On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component Hewlett
Packard rose $2.125 to $128, and its spinoff, Agilent Technologies,
rose $3.188 to $71.125.
</P>
<P>
   But some ''old economy'' stalwarts pulled the Dow lower.
McDonald's fell $2.063 to $33.375 after the company reported sales
growth slowed in May. Analysts said the company faced an extremely
tough comparison with May 1999 figures, because McDonald's was
running a wildly popular Beanie Babies giveaway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks were also lower as Wall Street analysts continued
to question the profit outlook for the industry. J.P. Morgan fell
$4.188 to $128.563.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies fell $3.125 to $59.75, hurting the S&AMP;P 500.
Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate for the company's fiscal 2000
revenues and profits, saying the company is suffering from a
decline in a leading product line of switches.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 782.64 million
shares, compared with 842.33 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.52 to 523.06.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.4 percent.

<P>
	   SPECULATOR, N.Y. (AP) - A pilot aiming to set his amphibious
craft down in an Adirondack Mountain lake mistakenly lowered his
landing gear and flipped the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Stein of White Sulphur Springs was attempting to land
his Republic Sea Bee plane on Lake Pleasant at 11:45 a.m. Thursday
when the accident happened. With the wheels down below the plane's
floats, the water caught the plane and flipped it over.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was able to get out of the craft and was helped to shore
by a passing fisherman. He was treated and released from a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff's office, state forest rangers and the
Federal Aviation Administration investigated the accident and got
the plane out of the water by 3 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was in the area as part of the Seaplane Seminar at Camp of
the Woods, an annual event that draws 150-250 pilots from across
the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese man who says he didn't know better gets 4 years  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - A loanshark who allegedly preyed on
desperate gamblers was sentenced to four years in prison Friday.
His wife, who also was charged, got probation.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Cong ''Tony'' Van, 40, of Egg Harbor Township, paid $4,000
to get a gambler's 1995 Mercedes out of hock and lent her another
$4,000 to go back to the tables. She went back to Caesars Atlantic
City Hotel Casino and lost that money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The woman contacted police after being told she would have to
pay $12,000 to get the car back.
</P>
<P>
   ''This individual and his wife engaged in a long-term criminal
usury operation,'' said Deputy Attorney General Tama Hughes, who
prosecuted the two.
</P>
<P>
   Van, a Vietnamese immigrant and self-described compulsive
gambler, allegedly charged 400 percent annual interest on loans to
Asian gamblers who came to him when they went broke at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   He routinely hocked his own belongings at ''cash for gold''
shops along the casino strip, paying 10 percent interest, and
didn't believe there was anything illegal about charging high
interest to others, defense attorney Amy Weintrob said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Mr. Van's culture, this is not necessarily considered a
crime,'' she told the judge. ''It was standard practice for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim, whose name wasn't released, was referred to Van by a
pawnbroker who wouldn't accept her car as collateral, Weintrob
said. He refused her three times before agreeing to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''He helps this woman and ends up getting convicted and loses
his entire life,'' Weintrob said.
</P>
<P>
   Van and his wife, Kieu Duong, 26, were arrested Feb. 4, 1999, at
the Trump Taj Mahal's poker room when the victim - accompanied by
an undercover officer - paid the $12,000 to them.
</P>
<P>
   Van was charged with criminal usury, Duong with possession of a
usurious instrument. More than $100,000 was seized from the couple
in a raid at their home and the woman's car was returned, Weintrob
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Superior Court Judge Manuel Greenberg sentenced Duong
to 18 months probation and ordered her to stay out of casinos.
</P>
<P>
   She sat crying in the gallery, accompanied by the couple's
4-year-old daughter, as Van's sister, Terry Van, told the judge Van
wasn't a member of organized crime or a loanshark, just a family
man. ''I beg you with all my heart to grant leniency to my
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry for the crime I did,'' Van told Greenberg. ''If I'd
known, I'd never have jeopardized my family.''
</P>
<P>
   After Greenberg pronounced the sentence, two deputies began
handcuffing Van to take him into custody. In the gallery, Duong
used her hands to cover her daughter's eyes so she wouldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ''She (the victim) got her vehicle back,'' Weintrob said
afterward. ''They're the ones who lost.''

Hung jury in murder trial
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) - A jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict
after four days of deliberations in the case of a man accused of
killing a co-worker's husband at her request.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara County jury reported it was deadlocked Friday
afternoon, after 27 hours of deliberations in the second-degree
murder trial of 29-year-old Michael Northrup. Eight jurors favored
a murder conviction and four were against it. Eleven wanted to
convict on a weapons charge but one voted to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   According to a media report, prosecutors have decided to
petition for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup of Caledonia in Livingston County is accused of
shooting John Montstream in June 1998 and leaving the body in the
victim's minivan in a Niagara Falls parking ramp, where it was
found a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream's 41-year-old wife, Annette, testified that Northrup,
with whom she was romantically involved, volunteered to kill her
husband. She is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in March
to first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Parinello criticized the prosecution's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their case, from the beginning, lacked integrity. And I'm not
talking about the integrity of the prosecutors. The case itself,
the facts, lacked integrity and credibility,'' Parinello said. ''We
live to fight another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror Kevin Grades called it ''a shame'' that the jury couldn't
reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart goes out to the Montstream family. He was looking for
closure and he didn't get it. That's a shame,'' Grades said.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream's father, John Montstream Sr., calmly discussed his
reaction with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a situation where these people could just could not
make a decision and they were having problems with it,'' he said.
''Yes, I was disappointed. I thought the facts pretty well spoke
for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror Joe DeMarco said one juror voted to acquit on the weapons
charge at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Environmental group says incinerators not safe, CRRA says they are  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Connecticut environmental group is
urging the state to stop burning its trash.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the agency that oversees four of the
state's six incinerators said the current waste incineration
process is safe.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Connecticut Coalition for
Environmental Justice called for a phase-out of waste incineration
- a method that they say emits cancer-causing dioxin into the air.
Dioxin is a by-product of the manufacturing and incineration of
chlorinated materials.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Fleming, a spokesman with the Environmental Protection
Agency in Boston, calls dioxin a ''a serious toxic substance.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dioxin from the incinerated trash falls to the ground, it
enters the food chain and appears at greatest levels in meat,
dairy, fish and poultry products, the environmentalists claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no safe level of dioxin exposure,'' said coalition
president Mark Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wright, president of the Connecticut Resource Recovery
Authority, said the state's six incinerators are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said CRRA's facilities emit a level of dioxins that is
far below the state's health-based safety limits and regulatory
requirements. Dioxin is caused by low-temperature combustion,
Wright added, while CRRA's facilities operate at very high
combustion.
</P>
<P>
   ''They picked the wrong plant,'' Wright said of agency members.
</P>
<P>
   Most states bury their trash in landfills, Mitchell said, but
Connecticut burns most of its waste because it is so densely
populated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of burning, Mitchell said, the state should consider new
waste-disposal technologies, but did not specify what those might
be.
</P>

   By the end of the year, Wright said, municipal waste combustors
will represent less than one percent of the known sources of dioxin
nationwide. Auto emissions are the largest source of dioxin, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Relatives of Satmar leader die in Williamsburg fire  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The granddaughter of an Orthodox Jewish sect's
spiritual leader, her dying 5-month-old daughter still clutched in
her arms, was killed early Friday in a fire ignited by candles
lighted for a religious holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Blima Halverstam and her daughter were visiting Brooklyn
to celebrate the Jewish holiday when the deadly blaze began around
3:45 a.m. in a four-story brick building in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn. Nine people - four women and five children -
were in the house at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   They had traveled from Montreal to celebrate Shavuot, a festival
commemorating God's presentation of the commandments to Moses on
Mount Sinai. Instead of the planned celebration, more than 2,000
members of Satmar Hasidic community held a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy beyond belief,'' said Isaac Abraham, a
community leader. ''It's devastated an entire community. There were
preparations made for the holiday a long time ago. Now, everybody
is walking with their head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Halverstam was the granddaughter of the sect's leader,
Grand Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum. Her infant daughter, Teitelbaum's
great-grandchild, was Chaya Esther Halverstam.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 hours after the blaze, a plain green van containing the
bodies of the two victims pulled up in front of Teitelbaum's house,
where it sat until hundreds of men in traditional black Hasidic
garb assembled behind the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A procession led by a police car with its lights on then
traveled about two blocks to the Congregation Yetev Lev synagogue.
Neighborhood residents watched from rooftops as the procession
moved by.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, who waited inside the synagogue for the bodies,
walked out once the van arrived. After he and several other rabbis
conducted a short prayer service in the street, the van headed to
Monroe, N.Y., for burial of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the holiday, the truncated service was held instead
of a funeral. The somber events took place as an eerie silence
filled the Brooklyn neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts. I feel like I can't bear it,'' said resident Rifka
Heimlich.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Blima Halverstam, her husband and their baby were staying
with his parents for the holiday, said a next-door neighbor, Anna
Weis. The grand rabbi lives around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which started in the third-floor kitchen, was ignited
by candles burning on stove below a kitchen cabinet, said Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen. Members of the community do not use
electricity on the holiday of Shavuot, said Fire Department Rabbi
Joseph Potasnik.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen described Sara Halversam as ''very heroic, worrying
about a child, rather than worrying about getting out. The child
was very, very close to her - she had probably rolled out of her
arms as she was dying.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, Weis took in several of the seven people who
were able to escape. There were only women and children inside when
the fire broke out; the men were attending a holiday prayer
service.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors who took refuge in Weis' home was Inda
Halverstam, Sarah Halverstam's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Weis, quoting Inda Halverstam's account of the blaze, said the
women were awakened by the squall of a smoke detector. Taking the
baby, the women - including Sarah Halverstam - hit heavy smoke as
they tried to go downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The women eventually found their way to a fire escape, where
they fled to safety. Sarah Halverstam and her baby never made it to
the fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow they just lost her,'' said Weis, who said she was able
to see ''tremendous flames'' from the street. Firefighters found
Sarah Halverstam was found on the fourth floor, still holding her
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Satmar, a major form of Hasidism, originated in the present-day
city of Satu Mare, Hungary. Many of its members emigrated after the
Holocaust, with about 45,000 still residing in the Williamsburg
neighborhood that is the worldwide hub of their religious
community.
</P>
<P>
   Its members primarily speak Yiddish, with its men wearing
traditional garb of broad-brimmed, fur-trimmed hats.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Black Market Money, Bjt,1000  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The money is nice and clean now, just blips
on computer screens at three New York banks that add up to more
than $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   It has came a long way from its dirty origins: $20, $50, and
$100 bills tendered on the street in exchange for cocaine, federal
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The drug cash was laundered along a trail from Kennedy
International Airport to Brazil and back again, according to court
papers asking a judge to let the government take the money.
</P>
<P>
   The money represents several years of investigation by the Drug
Enforcement Administration into a ''black market'' money exchange
it says was operated by Marcos Glikas, of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Even added to $757,410 seized in the New York hotel room of a
Glikas courier, the money amounts to but a few days' work for the
group, suggest figures in the forfeiture action, filed June 2 in
U.S. District Court here.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates the difficulty in stopping vast sums of
drug money from being laundered through an international web of
bank and checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities seize tens of millions of dollars along the
wash cycle each year, but believe untold billions escape on airline
passengers, hidden in cargo containers, or through bogus checking
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Glikas group was unexpectedly unmasked in 1998 by DEA agents
working with northern New Jersey police investigating an alleged
drug trafficker, Ernesto Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It very quickly evolved into a window on a money-laundering
scheme,'' said Anthony J. Senneca, the agent in charge of the
Newark DEA office.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, a fugitive from a 1992 New York state indictment, is
believed to run a drug operation in Colombia that sends more than
15,000 kilograms - 16.5 tons - of cocaine annually to the United
States, according to the forfeiture action.
</P>
<P>
   Glikas operated a jewelry business called Miratur, but also
served as a money exchanger for Ceballos and other traffickers,
court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Money exchanges are legitimate, but not when they disguise the
origin and destination of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Black market exchangers are needed since traffickers avoid cash
deposits of more than $10,000 in U.S.-based accounts because such
transactions leave records.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of cash produced by drug sales discourages breaking
it into deposits of less than $10,000. A kilogram of cocaine - 2.2
pounds - costs wholesale buyers $15,000. That amount of cash, in
small bills, weighs more than three kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Glikas began making regular trips between New York and Brazil in
the late 1980s, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter W. Gaeta, who is
representing the government in the forfeiture action.
</P>
<P>
   Miratur employed Tania Schahanof, Alberto Kern and Ricardo
Amaral. The DEA determined they gathered cash in the metropolitan
area from drug dealers and distributed it to ''smurfs'' -- couriers
who either smuggled it out of the country or put amounts under
$10,000 into many checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggled cash was taken to Glikas in Brazil, who would issue
bundles of checks with blank payee lines that Amaral would take to
the United States, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The payee lines were then filled with a variety of names for
deposit into numerous bank accounts in those names, to avoid the
suspicions raised by third-party checks, Gaeta said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money from those accounts was wired to a single
account of the drug group, creating layers of insulation and the
appearance of legitimate transactions, Gaeta said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanger, who keeps a portion of the dollars as a fee, now
has money in which to conduct legitimate business.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA's Newark office obtained a telephone wiretap on a member
of the Ceballos group, who was contacted at the Roosevelt Hotel in
New York on Feb. 10, 1998, by Glikas, who had just arrived in New
York from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Intercepted conversations showed that Glikas was to expect
deliveries of $300,000 and $200,000. Schahanof checked into the
hotel Feb. 12, 1998, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   She was back in the United States in early March, at the Doral
Hotel in New York, where she got $400,000 in drug money from an
employee of Kern's, $57,000 from Kern, and $290,000 from a drug
dealer in a Colombian operated by ''El Tio,'' court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were now monitoring Schahanof's cell phone, and
were able to seize 56 kilograms of El Tio cocaine and three
suspected dealers, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA agents also raided Schahanof's hotel room and seized
$757,410, but did not arrest Schahanof in an effort to determine
who she was working with.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bags in the room was lined with carbon paper, which
smugglers believe shields currency from X-ray detectors, court
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of agents, Schahanof stayed in the hotel room and
used the cell phone to discuss additional deliveries of cash.
Glikas, however, ordered her to return to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   When DEA agents interviewed her there, she said she made at
least eight trips to the United States in the past year to get drug
money, staying two days to two weeks, and typically getting
$600,000 a day, the forfeiture papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Schahanof probably stayed at home in Brazil, which does not have
an extradition treaty with the United States, Senneca said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral's role was to bring bundles of checks and money orders
into the United States: nearly $91 million declared on 76 entries
from January 1996 through April 1998, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Glikas and Amaral were arrested at Kennedy Airport in April
1998. Amaral later led investigators to accounts at New York banks
where he had made nearly $20 million in deposits that year, court
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral pleaded guilty Dec. 2, 1998, to not disclosing a felony
and served a seven-month term.
</P>
<P>
   When the accounts were seized Jan. 13, 1999, they contained $8.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Glikas and Kern were convicted of money laundering conspiracy on
March 19, 1999. They have appealed. Glikas, 46, is serving a
10-year term. Kern, 37, of New York, got 65 months.
</P>
<P>
   The $757,410 seized from Schahanof was forfeited to the
government in September.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 55; Nasdaq Is Up 49  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a quiet session Friday
after a tame inflation report failed to calm investors' fears that
the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates to force a
slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks eked out a modest advance, helping the Nasdaq
composite index close higher for a second consecutive week. But
investors in the broader market couldn't shake worries that higher
interest rates will cut into company profits, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though corporate earnings are good, if the Fed is raising
rates, there's no guarantee that they'll continue to be good,''
said Phil Foreman, senior portfolio manager at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.66 to close at
10,614.06, giving up an early advance. For the week, the Dow fell
180.70.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite rose
49.28 to close at 3,874.84, bringing its gain for the week to 61.46
points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.72 to 1,456.95.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially rose after the Labor Department reported the
Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach the consumer, held steady in May. Analysts had been
expecting an 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food
prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the ''core'' rate
of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2 percent,
slightly above analysts' forecasts. That troubled some investors
and derailed the market's early gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PPI was definitely a step in the right direction,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very
inflationary looking at the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer price report followed a series of indicators over
the last few weeks that have shown a moderating U.S. economic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been hoping for gradual economic slowdown,
which could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times in the last year in an
attempt to slow the economy down and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking closely at a number of important
economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures
on retail sales and the consumer prices. Those could provide
further signs of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and
the effect of those six rate hikes,'' Piskorowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher. Qualcomm rose $1.625 to
$79.063 and Sun Microsystems gained $2.438 to $89.938, both on the
Nasdaq. On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow component Hewlett
Packard rose $2.125 to $128, and its spinoff, Agilent Technologies,
rose $3.188 to $71.125.
</P>
<P>
   But some ''old economy'' stalwarts pulled the Dow lower.
McDonald's fell $2.063 to $33.375 after the company reported sales
growth slowed in May. Analysts said the company faced an extremely
tough comparison with May 1999 figures, because McDonald's was
running a wildly popular Beanie Babies giveaway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks were also lower as Wall Street analysts continued
to question the profit outlook for the industry. J.P. Morgan fell
$4.188 to $128.563.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies fell $3.125 to $59.75, hurting the S&AMP;P 500.
Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate for the company's fiscal 2000
revenues and profits, saying the company is suffering from a
decline in a leading product line of switches.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 967.03
million shares, compared with 1.03 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.52 to 523.06.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Papers Respond on Point Spreads  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A newspaper industry group says a proposal in
Congress to ban betting on college sports probably would not prompt
newspapers to stop publishing point spreads for coming games.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by the Newspaper Association of America counters a
central argument of those who want to outlaw betting on amateur
sports, a practice legal only in Nevada. Advocates say newspapers
would be less likely to run point spreads on college sports if
betting on those games were illegal throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Point spreads ''are generated for no other reason than to
facilitate betting on college sports,'' according to a report by
the Senate Commerce Committee, which approved legislation in April
to ban betting on high school, college and Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was contradicted by NAA president John F. Sturm,
who wrote in a letter this week:
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress prohibits gambling on college sports, NAA believes
newspapers will continue to have an interest in publishing point
spreads on college games, since point spreads appear to be useful,
if not valuable, to newspaper readers who have no intention of
betting on games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturm submitted his organization's view at the request of the
House Justice Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and the
ranking Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan. Their committee holds a
hearing on the banning bill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An April poll commissioned by the newspaper association found
that 70 percent of people who look at point spreads on college
sports do so to obtain information about a favorite team or a
future game. Only 11 percent of respondents said they look at point
spreads to place bets.
</P>
<P>
   Sturm also said newspapers are only one source of published
point spreads. Other sources include radio, television, toll-free
telephone numbers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Shelk, who lobbies for casinos as vice president of the
American Gaming Association, said the NAA statement is significant.
He said proponents of banning amateur sports betting launched the
effort last year with the argument that newspaper point spreads
connect legal betting in Nevada and illegal betting on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are eight months later, and the newspapers have
spoken,'' Shelk said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., said he continues to believe some
newspapers would stop printing college sports point spreads if
betting on the events were universally illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some newspapers decide now not to,'' Roemer said, ''and there
might be even less economic incentive to publish them in the future
should our bill pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Roemer has sponsored the proposed ban in the House along with
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved by the Senate Commerce Committee is
awaiting action by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing in the House Judiciary Committee will mark the
first action on the House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Former University of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith
and University of South Carolina football coach Lou Holtz are among
witnesses who will testify in support of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of legal sports betting in Nevada say the ban would
hurt that state without making a dent in college sports betting.
They say 99 percent of gambling on college sports occurs illegally
on college campuses, not legally in Nevada casinos.

<HEADLINE> Officer charged in misdemeanor in shooting  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Bronx grand jury declined to file felony
charges against a police officer who shot a 16-year-old boy last
year, instead charging him with one misdemeanor count of
third-degree assault, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Mark Conway's supporters and the family of Dante Johnson
both expressed outrage - Conway's advocates for him being charged
at all, and Johnson's family was upset that the officer was not
charged with a felony. Johnson was critically wounded in the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely disappointed with the criminal justice system
for blacks and Hispanics in the city,'' said the boy's mother
Sharon Johnson, who is black. The family has filed a civil lawsuit
against Conway, the police department and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart London, Conway's attorney, said his client testified
truthfully before the grand jury, and was disappointed that any
charges were filed. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, said the shooting was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is wrong,'' Lynch said of the charge. ''We're looking for
justice and he will be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, a 14-year veteran, pleaded innocent to the charge in a
brief court appearance, then was released on his own recognizance.
The 33-year-old was also suspended without pay Friday for a maximum
of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The charge alleges that Conway acted with criminal negligence in
causing physical injury to another person by means of a deadly
weapon or a dangerous instrument. If convicted, he would face a
maximum sentence of one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was shot on May 26, 1999, just several months after four
officers fatally shot Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets.
Johnson's shooting re-ignited bad feelings between some minority
residents toward the police. Like Diallo, Johnson is black. Conway
is white, as are the four officers acquitted earlier this year of
Diallo's murder.
</P>
<P>
   And like the four officers, Conway was a member of the Street
Crime Unit, a controversial plainclothes unit that patrols
high-crime areas. However, at the time of the shooting, Conway was
in full uniform.
</P>
<P>
   According to the district attorney's office, Johnson was shot
shortly after midnight after Conway and his partners approached
Johnson and a friend for questioning in a robbery pattern. The boys
began running - Johnson's friend was caught, and Conway continued
in his car after Johnson, drawing his weapon and driving on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conway pulled up alongside Johnson, reached outside his moving
vehicle and grabbed the sleeve of the boy's jacket,'' the district
attorney's office said. ''The gun discharged as the fleeing youth
struggled to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson expressed frustration with District Attorney Robert
T. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can a cop ... pull a gun with one hand, aim it at a
person, hold on to that person while driving a car, drive and pull
the trigger?'' she said. ''Mr. Johnson, I need an explanation, my
son needs an explanation, the city needs an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson said the grand jury looked at the facts, listened
to the witnesses and determined that the shooting was not
intentional.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To End Estate Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, joined by dozens of
Democrats at odds with President Clinton, won easy passage Friday
of a bill to repeal inheritance taxes by 2010. Supporters said they
were acting to prevent taxes from ruining family farms and small
businesses, but detractors decried it as a costly giveaway to the
wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised to veto the bill, citing revenue losses of $750
billion in the decade after repeal is fully in place and calling it
a ''windfall'' for the rich. ''If this bill were presented to me in
its current form, I would veto it without hesitation,'' he said in
a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would sign a less costly Democratic
alternative geared toward the handful of farms and small businesses
that are hurt most by the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of full repeal brushed aside that alternative and
ignored Clinton's veto threat, winning a 279-136 vote to send the
bill to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would cost $105 billion during the 10-year
phaseout, would cut the top 55 percent federal rate in 2001 and
gradually reduce all other rates over the next few years, with full
repeal coming in 2010. While the bill doesn't directly affect state
inheritance taxes, many that link collections to the federal tax
would have to rewrite their laws if they want to keep the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of families of people who die pay the
estate tax, which applies this year to estates above $675,000 for
an individual. In 1997, about 43,000 estates out of 2.3 million
adult deaths were taxable. Because of more generous exemptions,
only a tiny fraction of farm and small business heirs are affected.
</P>
<P>
   But sponsors said the threat of the tax forces people to do
costly estate planning, restrains expansion and investment and
jeopardizes jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death tax is a natural born killer of everything they have
worked for their entire lives,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''This isn't a rich
against the poor issue. This is a jobs issue and a fairness
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although repeal is a top GOP priority, co-sponsors included many
black and Hispanic Democrats and liberals not normally allied with
such tax cuts. They agreed the tax was causing headaches for
minorities and other middle-class entrepreneurs who are taking
advantage of the booming economy to build successful enterprises
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who hires the workers in America? Is it the guy on the street
corner or the people who achieve some success?'' said Rep. James
Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in
voting for the measure, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
and John Tanner, D-Tenn. The margin was just enough to override a
veto, but Democratic leaders said a combination of absentees and
members promising to switch would give them 10 more votes necessary
to sustain a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents said their alternative would better help
the family farms and small businesses by raising exemptions and
cutting all rates by 20 percent in 2001. At a cost of $22 billion
over 10 years, they argued their measure would leave more of the
projected future budget surplus for spending priority programs,
paying down public debt and ensuring Social Security and Medicare
don't go broke as baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also pointed to Internal Revenue Service figures
showing that almost half of all inheritance tax revenue comes from
estates over $5 million and contended that many of these wealthy
people could escape taxes entirely through shelters that protect
their incomes while alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take care of the problem, but we don't take care of the
multibillion dollar estate,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House leaders, Clinton expressed support for the
more modest approach and said full repeal could ''turn our backs on
fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you send me a bill to completely repeal the estate tax, I
will veto it rather than risk the fiscal progress that has
contributed to the longest economic expansion in history,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the Democratic alternative on a 222-196 vote,
but Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said it ultimately
has the best chance of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want the accomplishment, they're going to have to
compromise,'' Daschle said of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other tax bills moving in the House this year,
estate tax repeal was part of the $792 billion tax cut vetoed last
year by Clinton. Republicans have carved up that bill and are
pushing its individual pieces to the floor, forcing some Democrats
to take uncomfortable votes as both parties vie for control of the
House in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Congress has been on a mission to restore basic fairness
to the tax code,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   As the House-passed bills pile up in the Senate, Democrats are
trying to remind voters that they collectively amount to another
enormous GOP tax cut that would consume a big chunk of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like a big chocolate cake,'' said House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ''They keep trying to pass pieces, but when
you put all the pieces together, you got a big chocolate cake.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Feds Find No Conspiracy in King Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 18 months, a Justice Department
investigation rejected allegations that conspirators aided or
framed James Earl Ray in the 1968 assassination of civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. It recommended against further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigation found no credible evidence to support
allegations in recent years from former Memphis bar owner Loyd
Jowers and former FBI agent Donald Wilson, and earlier from Ray
himself, that a mysterious ''Raoul'' or others, including federal
agents, police or black ministers, participated in a plot to kill
King.
</P>
<P>
   As in four earlier investigations, the Justice investigators
''found no reliable evidence that Dr. King was killed by
conspirators who framed James Earl Ray,'' according to their
150-page report released Friday. ''We found nothing to disturb the
1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr.
King.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We found no credible evidence to support allegations of any
conspiracy to kill Dr. King involving Jowers, Raoul, the Mafia,
Memphis police officers, figures involved in the Kennedy
assassination, federal agents, U.S. military personnel or
African-American ministers close to Dr. King,'' said Barry
Kowalski, head of the investigation and one of the department's
leading civil rights prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are convinced of our conclusions beyond a reasonable
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation did not convince the King family and some
others close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are disappointed,'' said Martin Luther King III on behalf
of the family, ''but this is certainly not something we did not
expect.'' He recalled that the family had sought an investigation
conducted by a ''commission independent of the government, because
we do not believe that in such a politically sensitive matter the
government is capable of investigating itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger King told an Atlanta news conference his family
planned no further action but stands by a Memphis civil jury's
ruling that Jowers and ''others, including government agencies''
conspired to assassinate King.
</P>
<P>
   In Smartt, Tenn., James Earl Ray's brother Jerry said, ''The
American public and the King family believe James was innocent so
it doesn't matter to me what the politicians say.'' The Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who was with King when he was shot, told CNN he still
believes other people assisted Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to killing King, he claimed
three days later -- and until his 1998 death in prison -- that a
mysterious Raoul, later Raul, had framed him.
</P>
<P>
   But the weight of the evidence ''establishes that Raoul is
merely the creation of James Earl Ray,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the King family's embrace of some of these theories,
Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the new probe Aug. 26, 1998,
even though two Justice Department investigations, a U.S. House
committee and the Shelby County, Tenn., district attorney's office
previously studied the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a Memphis civil court jury ruled for the King
family in its wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and concluded
Jowers and ''others, including government agencies'' plotted to
kill King.
</P>
<P>
   The new Justice Department probe rejected those findings as
well, although King's son Dexter had said after the verdict: ''We
know what happened. This is the period at the end of the
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice team also ''found insufficient evidentiary leads
remaining after 30 years to justify further investigation'' of
suggestions by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979
and the Shelby County district attorney in 1998 that Ray's
surviving brothers may have helped him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Jowers, who owned a tavern across the street from the
motel where King was shot, said a produce dealer involved with the
Mafia gave him $100,000 to hire an assassin and assured him Memphis
police would not be around. Jowers, who died last month, claimed
someone named Raoul gave him a gun and the assassin fired from
behind Jowers' bar, not from a rooming house window above it where
Ray had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   In many retellings, Jowers ''has contradicted himself on
virtually every key point,'' the report said. No physical evidence
corroborates Jowers' story, and some contradicts key elements,
including the lack of footprints in the muddy ground behind the bar
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ex-FBI agent Wilson claimed to have found papers 30
years earlier in Ray's abandoned Mustang in Atlanta. Before
spurning immunity and ending his cooperation, Wilson turned over
part of a page from a 1963 Dallas telephone directory and a piece
of paper with handwritten words and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The name ''Raul'' was handwritten on both papers. The phone
directory scrap carried the handwritten 1963 phone number of the
Dallas bar owned by Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald, the
assassin of President Kennedy. But Kowalski said, ''We don't
believe the papers came from Ray's car.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's accounts were inconsistent, Justice investigators said.
He later claimed also to have found, but did not produce, three
other documents, including one with the FBI's Atlanta telephone
number. He gave contradictory stories about them being stolen, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found contradictory evidence. Photos showed
the Mustang door was closed and locked, not open as Wilson claimed.
Ray did not confirm the papers were his. No one saw Wilson when the
car was found; he is not in photos of the search.
</P>
<P>
   In the Memphis civil trial, Kowalski said, ''Everything about a
conspiracy involving federal agents was based on secondhand and
thirdhand hearsay without sufficient substantiation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No eyewitness testimony or tangible evidence directly
supported any of the conflicting allegations,'' the report said.
The Justice investigators reinterviewed some witnesses after the
trial and concluded: ''No evidence corroborated the various
allegations, and other information contradicted them,'' although
that was not introduced at trial.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents did not work on the investigation because the bureau
has been accused of conspiring against King.

<HEADLINE> Renovated lighthouse to shine again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANDY HOOK, N.J. (AP) - The 235-year-old lighthouse's beacon
will soon light the waters off Sandy Hook after an eight-month
hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Hook Lighthouse, decked out in red, white and blue
bunting, will be rededicated Saturday after undergoing its first
renovations since 1863.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks terrific, and the nicest time to come out here is
late in the afternoon when the sun is beginning to set,'' said
Louis J. Venuto, chief of interpretation and cultural resources at
Gateway National Recreation Area's Sandy Hook Unit.
</P>
<P>
   A full schedule of tours and military re-enactments will follow
the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, the lighthouse has been closed to visitors,
allowing a crew from Worchester-Eisenbrandt Inc., a Baltimore
company specializing in historic buildings, to repair loose plaster
and rusted iron, replace long-missing glass and restore the
battered lantern house.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs cost $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The beacon, the oldest operating lighthouse in the country, was
lighted for the first time on June 11, 1764. At the time, it was
fired by 48 whale-oil lamps.
</P>
<P>
   The 95-foot tower is 29 feet in diameter at its base, 15 feet at
the top, and its light, magnified by a beehive-shaped Fresnel lens,
can be seen 24 miles at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse's last renovation was done in 1863, when the
original wooden stairs were replaced with a cast-iron spiral
staircase and a brick lining was installed to reinforce the
rubblestone tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Hook Foundation and the New Jersey Lighthouse Society
will occupy the upstairs while a permanent display of New Jersey
lighthouses will be downstairs once the keeper's house is
renovated, said Venuto.

<HEADLINE> Talk to get Apple Tours back on the road go nowhere  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Talks aimed at getting some of New York Apple
Tours' sightseeing buses back on city streets apparently went
nowhere Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of closed-door, off-the record negotiations, lawyers
for the city, state and Apple Tours left the State Supreme Court
building Friday afternoon with the fate of the red, double-decker
buses still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers met to consider a proposal by Justice Phyllis
Gangel-Jacob that drivers who meet state standards drive those
buses that have passed inspection and are roadworthy. State and
city lawyers rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Registrations for the tour company's 63 buses were yanked last
week - without a hearing - by the state Department of Motor
Vehicles. Inspectors from the DMV reported they had found 625
violations among the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs,
after a brief hearing that the company's lawyers called unfair,
lifted Apple Tours license to conduct business in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Gangel-Jacob said in a hearing this week that she believed the
DMV's suspension of Apple Tour's bus registrations ''raises serious
due process issues.'' She pushed for a compromise pending next
Tuesday's DMV hearing on whether the registrations should be
revoked permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lasher, a City Hall spokeswoman, said: ''The city has not
changed its position with regard to Apple Tours. The city is still
pursuing revocation of the company's (Consumer Affairs) license.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasher noted that the city's attempt to get Apple Tours off the
road began in April, before one of the company's buses struck and
killed Randolph Walker, a 71-yeard-old actor, in mid-Manhattan on
May 22.

<HEADLINE> Listeria suspected in Rochester bologna recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A meat packer has voluntarily recalled
more than a ton of beef bologna that may be contaminated with
listeria, the USDA announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of food that contains listeria can cause
listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease, according
to the United States Department of Agriculture. Healthy people
rarely contract the disease that can cause high fever, severe
headache, neck stiffness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis also can cause miscarriages and stillbirths and
serious or fatal infections in people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Zweigle's Inc. of Rochester is recalling 2,200 pounds of its
beef bologna sold in 10-15 pound logs. Each carton bears the
sell-by date of 07-01-00 and a production date code of 0137. The
carton also bears EST.5333 inside the USDA seal of inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The meat was produced May 16 and distributed to grocery
delicatessens in Rochester and the Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported in connection with this product,
the USDA said.

<HEADLINE> Corzine says he'll cut back on spending for now  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - After doling out $33 million to
secure his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate, Democrat Jon
Corzine said he's closing his wallet for now.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine said Friday he could spend millions more in
advertising and campaigning for the race against Republican nominee
Bob Franks. Corzine said he would do so if Franks goes on the
attack - as the Republican strongly suggested this week that he
would do.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he spent so much on the primary campaign because he
needed to introduce himself to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not have to work on name recognition like we did
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton on Friday, Jim Florio met with reporters for the
first time since Tuesday's primary loss to Corzine. Florio was
indirect in discussing how much he would do to help Corzine in the
race for the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor said he probably won't run for office again.
He also expressed fears the political system has been damaged by
the primary campaign, though he avoided referring to Corzine or his
money.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine met with reporters at a hotel here after meeting with
union leaders and winning the endorsement of the state AFL-CIO
Council of Unions.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of Goldman Sachs said he had a smaller
budget for the primary campaign, but expanded it once former Florio
started airing ''distortions'' about his positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be a period of quiet with respect to the
airwaves,'' Corzine said. But more ads - and more money for them -
will be available if Corzine feels the need to respond to any
Republican challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what our opponents are going to do. I don't know
what the national Republican Party is going to do,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said with the Democratic nomination in hand it was only
natural to scale back his campaign office and ratchet down his
television blitz.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine did not accept notions that campaign spending should
be capped, a proposal most recently suggested by Gov. Christie
Whitman on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think unilateral disarmament is not a real good idea until
you can define all the rules,'' Corzine said. ''The one thing I
won't do is give up the flexibility to respond to distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a congressman from Union County, has already attacked
Corzine's campaign spending and his proposals for health care,
college education and preschool education.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said voters didn't care about his record spending, and
any effort by Franks to make it an issue will fail just as it did
for Florio.
</P>
<P>
   ''People measure the candidates about how they're going to be
advocating for their issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he will continue work to help other Democrats and
provide funding to county organizations to build up efforts on his
behalf. He also said he would help congressional candidates raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to be a party builder. I believe in the Democratic
Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he had yet to speak with Corzine in person and did
not know when a meeting would occur.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be happy to talk with him about what he would like me
to do and how I can be most effective in electing Democrats to all
of those positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his feelings about his defeat Tuesday, Florio was
upbeat and humorous.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been involved in elections that I have won and I have
lost. It is infinitely better to win, and one has to be prepared to
know that someone is going to emerge not the winner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio also made broad observations about the superficial
character of modern politics with veiled references to the conduct
of Corzine's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaigns, all campaigns, including this last one, don't
seem to be encouraging more depth of analysis, and that is
troubling because it is going in the wrong direction,'' Florio
said. ''The process is starting to be sufficiently flawed that it's
not doing what the process is supposed to be doing, which is
clarifying real policy differences so that people can make their
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Florio complained that Corzine would not
agree to enough debates, and none on network television. On Friday
he said political campaigns should involve televised town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked to have the whole state watch and see the
interaction with real people, see how you deal with friendly
questions and hostile questions. That can give you a much better
measure of individuals than can a 30-second commercial that praises
yourself,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole experience has reinforced my view that in order to
restore some sanity to the political process, we are going to have
to get back to talking about policy and engaging real people,'' he
said.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former prosecutor in Baku, Azerbaijan has been
sentenced to 11 months in prison for assisting the sale of about
200 prints and drawings, some of which were stolen during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Natavan Aleskerova, 45, was sentenced late Thursday by U.S.
District Judge Loretta A. Preska after she was convicted last year
by a jury of conspiracy and possession and concealment of stolen
property.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen property, valued at several million dollars, included
rare works by artists Albrecht Duerer and Jacob van Ruisdael, which
had been stolen from the Bremen Museum in Bremen, Germany and the
National Fine Arts Museum of Baku, Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the jury was told that some of the artwork
could be traced to 1943, when the Bremen Museum, a private art
institution, evacuated more than 1,000 precious drawings to the
Castle of Karnzow north of Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1945, an Engineering Brigade of the Soviet Army occupied
the castle and discovered and looted the artworks hidden in the
castle's cellar, evidence showed. The art was thought to have been
permanently lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, more than a dozen of the Bremen drawings resurfaced as
part of the collection of the Baku Museum and German authorities
asked that they be returned to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 12 of the Bremen drawings and about 200 prints and
drawings from the Baku Museum's own collection were stolen,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleged that Aleskerova conspired with her
husband, Aydyn Ali Ibragimov, a fugitive in the case, and two other
men to possess, conceal and sell a substantial portion of the
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The conspirators allegedly offered to sell some of the drawings
to the Bremen Museum for $6 million as Aleskerova and her husband
stashed them at an apartment in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In an undercover operation, the U.S. Customs Service arranged to
send a federal agent to pose as a buyer, allowing investigators to
seize the artwork and build a case against the conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   Aleskerova was arrested in October 1997 after Customs agents
watched her arrived from abroad at Kennedy International Airport.
Detecting the surveillance, Aleskerova and her son led police on a
high speed chase from the Brooklyn Bridge to Washington Square Park
in Manhattan, where she was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Royal Press Secretary Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A battle royal over the copyright of Prince
William's 18th birthday photos led to the resignation Friday of
Prince Charles' press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Charles announced in a statement that he accepted ''with deep
regret'' the resignation of Sandy Henney, who had been his press
adviser for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   With William's birthday approaching June 21, his father's office
at St. James' Palace had invited Daily Telegraph photographer Ian
Jones to take a set of pictures for release June 17 and 18 to all
national and regional newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of William and his 15-year-old brother Prince Harry are
valuable because so few are taken in the course of the year. The
boys' privacy is strictly protected and their father has made clear
he does not want them treated as commercial commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The usual palace procedure is to retain the copyright on such
arranged photos and to give the sales proceeds to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's statement from the palace said the office had failed to
ensure it held the copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share our part of the blame -- in that we should have taken
action to ensure that copyright was vested with us,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Henney resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The palace said Prince Charles hoped that ''no one should profit
from pictures, either of Prince William or Prince Harry, and that
those who do own the copyright will make clear that all proceeds
will go to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Jones announced he would transfer the
copyright of the photographs as Prince Charles wished.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Jones said he had been honored by the
invitation to take exclusive pictures of Prince William at Eton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law conferred the copyright on me and no suggestion has
been made until today that I should donate it to the Crown,'' he
said. ''Now that the suggestion has been made, I shall gladly
assign the copyright as the Prince of Wales may direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Editor Charles Moore said The Daily Telegraph had no financial
involvement with the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I am personally sorry that Sandy Henney has resigned, we
see this as an acceptance by the Prince of Wales's office that they
did behave unprofessionally toward the Telegraph,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Moore had accused the prince's office of
distributing the pictures inequitably and going back on a promise
to allow an early release of the photos so they could be processed
for a Daily Telegraph magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The palace replied that the photographs were being made
available fairly to all national and regional newspapers and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Henney was well-respected by many in the news media and was
known to have a good working relationship with Charles and his
sons.

<HEADLINE> Bitterness Over UN Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A U.N. Security Council extension of a
humanitarian program in Iraq, secured after acrimonious debate,
drew criticism Friday by some Iraqis who receive food from the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness after a decade under the strict sanctions -- imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait -- has made the
''oil-for-food'' program an unwelcome necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows Iraq to buy certain staples with oil
proceeds, and guarantees Iraqi citizens a monthly food basket of
rice, sugar, cooking oil and other staples.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.N. resolutions, the embargo cannot be lifted
until U.N. weapons inspectors report Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the shade of a tree to receive her June rations,
Fadhila Aboud recalled the 1998 visit by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. He had urged Iraq to allow U.N. weapons inspectors into
presidential palaces, and Iraq complied, Aboud said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan ''asked us to bow to the American and British pressure --
which he already had bowed to -- with promises that everything will
be over soon,'' the 58-year-old retired teacher said. ''We did not
expect his soon to be so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-month extensions of the oil-for-food program have been
routine since it began in 1996. But what should have been a
perfunctory vote Thursday erupted into acrimonious debate at U.N.
headquarters in New York, with Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov and
deputy Chinese Ambassador Shen Guofang blasting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov also criticized U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq. The
two allies set up no-fly zones in Iraq after the Gulf War to
protect minorities and anti-government forces from Baghdad's
military, and have bombed Iraq often for what they said were
violations of the zones.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials defended their policies, saying the
airstrikes have been too limited to impact Iraq's overall
humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Security Council agreed to extend the aid
program and to authorize a study on the humanitarian situation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is as if the Security Council is telling super powers 'the
turf is yours, and have no worry for those affected directly by
such resolutions,''' Raouf al-Waedeh, a 70-year-old Baghdad
University professor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Extra oil revenues this month meant that Iraqis found slightly
more in their food baskets this week. But that didn't ease
30-year-old Salah Adnan's annoyance with the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I am not happy about the increase,'' said Adnan, waiting
to collect his family's rations. ''What we want is to be left
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials claim that the sanctions deprive Iraq of the
money it would otherwise use to renew efforts to build weapons of
mass destruction. They say the Iraqi government's failure to comply
with U.N. resolutions is responsible for the sanctions continuing
in force.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials could not be reached Friday, the Muslim holy
day. But Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh was quoted in Cairo as
saying the program had ''failed to ease the suffering of the Iraqi
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Saleh as saying Iraq has
exported oil worth $29 billion since the program started, but has
been able to access only $7 billion. The remaining money, he said,
paid for U.N. expenses in Iraq and for compensating victims of the
1991 Gulf War -- part of the terms of the ''oil-for-food'' deal.

<HEADLINE> Lost Work in Los Alamos Fire  </HEADLINE>
By ANDRES YBARRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The fire that tore through town last
month might have caused $300 million in damage to the storied Los
Alamos National Laboratory and even may have sidetracked some
researchers' careers, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Six post-doctoral employees lost valuable information stored in
personal computers that were in mobile buildings at the edge of the
lab when the fire closed in. The lost research was part of a
three-year fellowship for the workers that determines their career
paths.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least a couple of them were near the end of their
fellowships,'' said the lab's program director, Jim Holt. ''That
really put them at a big disadvantage professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lab is trying to extend the fellowships to allow the
employees to complete their work.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the damage to the laboratory, the birthplace of the
atomic bomb, is expected to exceed $300 million, Holt said. A full
list of damage is expected by early next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 acres of the lab property were burned. Officials
said 39 temporary structures, including trailer and small storage
units, were destroyed but no major structures were significantly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which was intentionally set by the National Park
Service as a routine fire prevention effort, was pushed out of
control by wind that gusted over 50 mph. It burned thousands of
acres, destroyed more than 200 homes and forced the evacuation of
25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an underground dump used in the early days of the lab
remains ablaze. It's not clear how deep the fire is burning, said
Lee McAtee, the lab's deputy director for environmental and health
safety. There is no apparent public health threat, but the
lingering fire does threaten workers in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State environment officials and activists say the dump probably
has high explosives, depleted uranium, barium, beryllium and heavy
metals dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   A remote-controlled robot was sent in Wednesday to begin
excavating the dump and dig out some of the burning material so the
fire can be extinguished.

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Venezuela Chavez Case  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's high court ruled Friday
there were no grounds to bring a corruption case against the head
of the country's legislature, who is also President Hugo Chavez's
closest political confidante.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Tribunal of Justice, whose members were hand-picked
by the pro-Chavez constitutional assembly led by 80-year-old Luis
Miquilena, rejected a request to strip Miquilena of his
parliamentary immunity -- a move which would have opened the way for
a corruption trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice has been done,'' declared Omar Mezza, Miquilena's
defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who won Venezuela's highest
office seven years after staging a failed coup attempt, has said
the fact that Miquilena was investigated at all proves the
transparency of his ''social revolution'' in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say doubts about the ethics of Miquilena call into
question the president's declared commitment to fighting corruption
in the South American nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena faced charges stemming from a state contract awarded
to a printing company in which he holds shares. He was also accused
of giving a lucrative Justice Ministry contract to an insurance
company owned by a business partner.
</P>
<P>
   After he took office in February 1999, Chavez pushed through a
new constitution that eliminated the country's old supreme court,
as well as its congress, attorney general's office and most other
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Until new elections can be called to ''re-legitimize''
institutions including the presidency, Chavez's leftist Patriotic
Pole coalition appointed temporary public officeholders in
exercises that critics denounced as undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The new balloting was originally supposed to take place on May
28, but was suspended because of technical glitches in the computer
system used to tabulate votes. A new date has not yet been set.

<HEADLINE> State gets chance to argue against parole of man who killed 2 officers </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Attorney General's Office won a
second chance Friday to halt the planned parole of a man convicted
of killing two police officers just hours after an appeals court
said he should be released.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Trantino, who was convicted of killing two Lodi police
officers in 1963, has been denied parole at least nine times during
his 37 years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge panel said in a 66-page opinion published
Friday that Trantino's latest rejection by the state parole board
was ''not supported by any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Trantino immediately transferred to a halfway
house and gave state officials 30 days to prepare him for his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman immediately ordered Attorney General John
J. Farmer Jr. to appeal the decision, according to officials from
both offices.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's deputies were able to convince an appeals court judge
to grant the emergency stay Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''A full review of the matter will be considered on Monday,''
said Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether a full appellate panel would hold a
hearing Monday, or issue a decision based on written legal
arguments from both sides, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Farmer denounced the court ruling, saying the
parole board considered an inmate who had no clear plans, problems
handling stress and appeared prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lethal combination created an unacceptable risk of
recidivism, In view of these factors, the board's decision was
entitled to greater deference than the Appellate Division
afforded,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino's lawyer, Roger Lowenstein, did not immediately return
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino had been sentenced to die for killing the two officers
in a bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's death penalty was
overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was changed to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, state sentencing guidelines in effect at the time
made Trantino eligible for parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier appeal, Trantino earned another chance at
release and a hearing before the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 1999 session, the board rejected Trantino's plea for
parole. Board members relied on a number of points, including
claims by prison mental health examiners that he would likely
commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Trantino argued on appeal that parole board members ignored
several key points on his behalf. Trantino cited a prison record
that showed no infraction since 1970 and a private doctor and other
tests that said he appeared to be a good candidate for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trantino's primary contention is that the board's findings and
conclusions were not supported by substantial credible evidence in
the record. We agree,'' the appellate judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In crafting its decision, the appeals panel said it was
important that Trantino be treated just as equally as any other
person under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamental to the fairness of our court system is our
principle that the standards and laws by which we live are equally
and fairly applied to all,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The decision outraged those in the community where officers
Peter Voto and Gary Tedesco died.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber gathered
officers from the Lodi Police Department to discuss the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Many police and family members of the slain officers still
grieve, Schuber said, and they are hurt each time Trantino appears
to win a court victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tremendously outrageous. We just reacted with tremendous
amounts of anger, bitterness and sadness,'' Schuber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this crime was to be committed today, he would face either
the death penalty or life in prison. It diminishes the heinousness
of his crime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Route 7 oil spill may take a few days to clean up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIDGEFIELD, Conn. (AP) - A three-vehicle accident Friday
critically injured one man, shut down Route 7 for four hours during
rush hour and sent 2,800 gallons of home heating oil into the
Norwalk River, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Gause, 23, of New Rochelle, N.Y., was in critical but
stable condition at Danbury Hospital, police said. Gause was pinned
in his van, before being extracted by Ridgefield firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The other two drivers were treated at Danbury Hospital and
released, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the accident began just after 1 p.m. when a Gause
crossed from the northbound into the southbound lanes. His van
struck the delivery truck, driven by John Bonsignore, 39, of New
Milford, police said. The truck flipped spilling the oil onto the
highway and into the river.
</P>
<P>
   The van then struck a southbound car operated by Claire Sedwick,
18, of Fayetteville, N.Y., police said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil will probably take a few days to clean up, said Ben
Yorke, a regional supervisor with the state Department of
Environmental Protection. He said there was no evidence of a fish
kill.
</P>
<P>
   The highway reopened at about 5:15 p.m.

<HEADLINE> German 'Big Brother' Show Ends  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It ignited a heated debate over morality, created
instant celebrities and gave hundreds of thousands of loyal fans a
voyeuristic thrill week after week.
</P>
<P>
   When the German edition of the Orwellian TV reality show ''Big
Brother'' ended Friday after 100 days and with the last remaining
roommate collected his $120,000 prize, the real winner was the
television channel that scored its highest-ever ratings. The loser:
German culture and any semblance of respect for human dignity,
critics said.
</P>
<P>
   It started in March when 10 intrepid residents moved into the
Big Brother house outside Cologne -- the ''container'' as it's been
dubbed by German media -- pledging to spend every second of their
lives under the eyes of 28 cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Even infrared cameras used in their bedrooms at night insured
that not a moment would be missed, while the residents themselves
were kept out of touch with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The show has made an unemployed mechanic a star, kept tabloids
atwitter with a love affair, inspired a nationwide campaign against
one whiny resident, and became a police drama revealing one
resident's criminal past and unpaid fines.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules of the show imported from the
Netherlands, residents every other week nominated two candidates to
leave the house. Viewers then voted by phone to determine who
should go.
</P>
<P>
   With just three residents left on Sunday, viewers began voting
for their favorite to win the cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   For station RTL II, best known for its evening fare of soft
pornography, Big Brother has been its most successful program since
the channel started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The peak came May 18 when more than 7 million viewers tuned in
to see German sex symbol Verona Feldbusch -- who became famous
hosting a soft-porn magazine show on the same network -- spend a day
in the container. Producers even helicoptered in an outhouse just
for her, because of her desire to guard the most private elements
of her life. (Footage from the bathroom camera isn't shown on the
air, but just there for safety, producers say.)
</P>
<P>
   Its success caused the U.S. network CBS to pay a reported $20
million for the rights to the show, which is to air from July
6-Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Before it started in Germany, media regulators had threatened
the show with a ban saying it offended human dignity, which is
protected by Germany's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism erupted again as the show went into its final episode.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Rhineland-Palatinate state and chairman of the
state media commissions, Kurt Beck, told the Saarbrueker Zeitung in
its Friday issue that the program ''played a cynical game with
people's private sphere'' and called for a code of ethics for
electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bohrmann, a professor specializing in social ethics at
Munich University, is planning to write an academic paper with his
criticisms of the show. ''Not all things you can show on TV are
good for a society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The station rejects the criticism as ''overblown,'' and keeps
pointing to the success of ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the big show,'' said Matthias Trenkle, a spokesman for
RTL II. Young people ''don't want to see the Saturday evening show
we used to see for years and years where everything is fixed. ...
They want to see real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even debate over the winner has polarized the country.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise winner Friday night was John, a 26-year-old
carpenter from eastern Germany and former squatter, who had been
backed by the left-leaning Tageszeitung newspaper as representing a
vote for a ''more civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this party today never ends,'' John told thousands
of fans gathered outside the Big Brother house.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime favorite had been Juergen, a 36-year-old autoworker
from Cologne, who had said he was trying to win the prize for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But Juergen was condemned by the Tagesspiegel newspaper Friday
as a typical German afraid to show his emotions. ''It's exactly
like the uncle whose visit we always fear because all the fun is
immediately gone,'' the paper wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's four-hour extravaganza finale won't be the end of Big
Brother in Germany. RTL II is already seeking residents for Big
Brother II, set to return to the airwaves this September.

<HEADLINE> Attempts to settle land claim fail again  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Given another chance to reach a negotiated
settlement on the Oneida Indian land claim, all sides in the
dispute struck out again Friday as the case appeared destined for
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a daylong series of meetings in federal court that
focused only on taxes, no progress was made toward a settlement.
That left U.S. District Court Judge Neal P. McCurn with the very
real option of declaring an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that we are unable to bridge this gap,'' said
William Taylor, an attorney representing the Oneida Indian Nation
of New York. ''I still don't believe that we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he was hopeful that if McCurn does recommend
litigation, it might ''move the parties to explore a more
imaginative solution.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurn was conspicuously absent from the day's proceedings,
suffering from a severe case of bronchitis and unable to preside
over the talks. Ronald Riccio, the court-appointed settlement
master, substituted for McCurn.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had ordered the Oneida Indian nations of New York,
Wisconsin and Canada, the U.S. Department of Justice, Madison and
Oneida counties, and the state of New York to explain their
positions on the ''gut'' issues that have been holding up a
settlement on the largest and oldest Indian land dispute in the
eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have been trying since February 1999 to sort out how
much land the Oneidas can have for their reservation in the two
central New York counties and how much authority their sovereign
government can assert on that land. There also are legal questions
about a sales tax formula and gaming rights on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to this negotiation with every hope and effort to make
a settlement work,'' Oneida Nation representative Ray Halbritter
said. ''We increased our monetary offer to the counties and
decreased our land requirement substantially, and it was rejected
once again. We can't reach an agreement with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace said the Oneidas' offer on
Friday was simply unacceptable because it was too small. He said
one of the tribe's stipulations was to exempt as many as 40,000
acres in the land claim area from sales and property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so insufficient that within a decade, it would have
left us sweeping their streets,'' Eannace said. ''It would have
driven our businesses out, and the people would have followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas are seeking compensation for 250,000 acres of land
they claim the state purchased illegally in the late 18th and early
19th centuries. Yearlong negotiations broke off April 4.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement, the counties have insisted the
1,100-member Oneida Indian Nation of New York pay property taxes
and collect sales taxes from non-Indians who purchase goods on
reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have offered to pay the counties $20 million, in the
form of $1 million each year for 20 years, to offset sales taxes
they say sovereign Indian nations do not have to collect. They also
have offered to set aside $25 million of the settlement money for
the counties to offset unpaid property taxes and limit their
reservation to 40,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The state, meanwhile, has asked for 25 percent of the Oneidas'
Turning Stone casino earnings, and negotiators for the state and
federal governments have offered to contribute equally to a $500
million pot of settlement money. That plan, however, would have to
be approved by both the state Legislature and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of movement on Friday, all sides said they were
willing to keep talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''A settlement is in the best interests of all parties,'' said
John O'Meara, an attorney for New York state. ''This is not a case
that can be disposed of in a matter of months (at trial). It's much
more complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   If there had been ''substantial agreement'' on Friday, McCurn
had said he would allow mediation to continue for another 60 days.
But since the parties were unable to compromise, the judge is now
faced with declaring an impasse, discharging Riccio, and beginning
a trial. And he said that would be ''a disaster'' for all parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''That process will take, in my estimation, optimistically
speaking, at least two to four years to complete,'' McCurn said in
a statement read in court Friday. ''Now is the time to dispose of
this matter and to restore good will and mutual respect to the
community.''

<HEADLINE> Suharto's Freedom Plea Rejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An Indonesian court has rejected a bid
by former President Suharto to free him from house arrest and end a
prolonged investigation into his wealth, a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision by the South Jakarta district court was the
second ruling in three days to go against the ex-dictator, who
turned 79 Thursday. On Tuesday, another court threw out Suharto's
$27 billion defamation lawsuit against Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto has been under house arrest at his Jakarta home since
last month. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman confined him after he
repeatedly failed to show up at questioning sessions with
prosecutors investigating him for possible corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers filed the lawsuit last Friday demanding that
the house arrest order be overturned and that the corruption probe
be canceled. The lawyers and family members contend that Suharto,
who has suffered a series of strokes, is too ill to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto allegedly used charitable foundations under his control
to steal millions of dollars in state funds during his 32 years in
power. He has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has said he is willing to pardon
Suharto as long as the former dictator returns any ill-gotten gains
to the state.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Bush-Conn, 3rd Ld Writethru,430  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. (AP) - Using the high-tech computer industry as a
background, Texas Gov. George W. Bush made his pitch Friday for
some old-fashioned education goals.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential candidate said his vision is that ''every
child learn to read and write and add and subtract.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured a Silicon Valley Group plant during a swing through
the state. He also attended a GOP fund-raiser in Stamford Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to close the gap of hope is to educate
children,'' Bush told hundreds of workers at the plant, which
manufactures parts for microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, a division of the San Jose, Calif.-based Silicon
Valley Group, has about 900 workers in Wilton and 600 in a plant in
neighboring Ridgefield.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined by Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell and company President
John Shamaly during a tour of the plant. He examined equipment and
gingerly held a component from a $9 million machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm interested in people who employ people,'' Bush told
Shamaly. ''I appreciate what you do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamaly introduced Bush to workers, who packed the plant
cafeteria, as ''the man who I think will lead America into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government's aim should be to encourage
entrepreneurship and not control wealth. Bush also said, if
elected, he would return $1.3 trillion of the nation's $23 trillion
surplus back to the taxpayers and set aside $2.3 million for social
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running because I want to get things done,'' Bush said.
''I've laid out a framework for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his comments were met with hearty applause from
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like his issues, what I've head from him this far,'' said
Dana DeGennaro, who supported Bush's father, former President
George Bush, during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Stamford reception at the Westin Hotel was to benefit
Victory 2000, the state GOP's political action committee for
federal Republican candidates. Officials said they expected to
raise $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appeared at a special private reception for donors
giving $20,000 or more. That money, expected to total about $1.1
million, will go to the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who lost the Connecticut presidential primary to Arizona
Sen. John McCain, said things would change for him in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forget the primary; we'll carry Connecticut in the general
election,'' he said, to rousing applause.

<HEADLINE> Germany May Avert Strike  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Restive unions said Friday there was
an even chance of an agreement that could avert a major strike
planned for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are concerned that a widespread strike
among public sector workers could convulse Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's tight-budget economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last-ditch talks were scheduled with the government's negotiator
Interior Minister Otto Schily over the weekend, said Herbert Mai,
head of the largest public service union.
</P>
<P>
   Mai said that, though there was a 50-50 chance for agreement,
strike preparations were continuing ''at full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders decided Friday which workers, from meter maids to
museum cashiers, would begin the strike Wednesday. They warned that
the strike could drag on, spreading to include teachers and
transport workers, unless the government came up with a better wage
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Union members last week rejected the government's proposal
calling for 1.8 percent raises this year and 2.2 percent in 2001.
Workers had wanted 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything has to be tried to avoid a labor dispute,'' Mai
said on ARD television. ''But that only works if, at the end,
there's a different result as the last offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3.1 million workers could be mobilized in the strike, for
which the mostly blue-collar OeTV union and white-collar DAG union
signed on late Thursday. The 80,000-strong GEW teachers union and
the 26,000-member police union had already approved action.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Germany's first large public strike since 1992, when
garbage piled up in the streets and public transport was
interrupted for 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout could damage Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's image as
a business-friendly Social Democrat, as well as his attempts to
preserve Germany's consensus-led business climate in an
increasingly cutthroat, global economy.
</P>
<P>
   State employers have warned that higher wages would strain
public coffers and necessitate layoffs. ''We can't pay more than
what's actually in the till,'' complained Karlheinz Weimer, finance
minister from the state of Hesse.

<HEADLINE> Cabbies' suit charges that revoking license of ''biased cab drivers'' is illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- Three cab drivers filed a class action suit
against the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
and nine TLC officials Friday, charging that suspending driver's
licenses for allegedly refusing to pick up minority passengers has
no legal basis.
</P>
<P>
   The suit stems from a program called ''Operation Refusal,'' in
which undercover police and taxi commission inspectors posing as
passengers attempt to ferret out discriminatory drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Cab drivers caught bypassing minorities are issued citations and
have their licenses suspended and their cabs temporarily
confiscated, pending a later hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the drivers filing the suit, John Padberg, and Rashid
Ahmed have had their licenses suspended under ''Operation
Refusal.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit states that the three drivers are acting on behalf of
all drivers who have had their licenses suspended under the
program, and all licensed drivers who are subject to the tenets of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   The clampdown initially came when actor Danny Glover filed a
complaint with the TLC after he claimed several taxis drove past
him last November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to going after discrimination based on race or
gender, the program targets cabbies who refuse to go to certain
locations - usually poor, minority neighborhoods and areas outside
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that ''Operation Refusal,'' has no basis in law
and, in fact, violates the TLC's rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, the TLC's rules for drivers state that
refusal to pick up a passenger results in a $200-$350 fine for the
first offense, a $350-$500 fine and a possible 30-day suspension
for a second offense, and revocation of the driver's license if a
third offense occurs within 36-months.
</P>
<P>
   There are no provisions for the automatic suspension of driver's
hack licenses or for the confiscation of cabs, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accused the TLC of branding suspended drivers as
racists who are unwilling to serve blacks and Hispanics, noting
that most refusals are motivated by safety and economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Ritter, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said that
the city was not aware of the suit, and therefor could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at the TLC's offices were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Whitman nominates new commissioners for labor, banking and insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Whitman announced Friday that she will
nominate deputy labor commissioner Mark Boyd to head the state
Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The Westfield resident will replace Commissioner Mel Gelade, who
Whitman nominated Thursday to be a Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark Boyd's impressive background in the Labor Department and
his commitment to our state's work force make him an obvious choice
to replace Commissioner Gelade,'' Whitman said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''From his oversight of Workforce New Jersey and the
Rehabilitation and Disability programs, to his time as a
self-employed businessman, Mark possesses an understanding of the
diverse needs of the work force that will serve him well in the
role of labor commissioner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also nominated Karen L. Suter as commissioner of the
Department of Banking and Insurance. She succeeds Jaynee LaVecchia,
who Whitman nominated to serve as a state Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Karen Suter has played a key role in helping us to develop and
implement reforms and implement new regulations that are helping us
bring down the cost of insurance in New Jersey,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Suter, of Medford, was named acting commissioner in January, and
became a deputy commissioner and chief of the banking and insurance
operations' division in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Republicans worry state senator handpicking his son as successor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - Republican sources are worried a
longtime state senator is angling to have his son succeed him in
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in state Sen. Hugh T. Farley's designating petitions
prompted a few Republicans to question if the Niskayuna lawmaker
was maneuvering to hand over the senate seat to his son,
Schenectady County Legislature Chairman Robert T. Farley.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Farley, seeking his 13th two-year term, added several new
members to his committee to fill vacancies, which would name
another candidate should he pull out of the race. GOP sources told
The Daily Gazette of Schenectady they were ''concerned'' about the
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's basically what people have brought to my attention.
That's a concern,'' said interim Schenectady County Chairman G.
Jack Parisi.
</P>
<P>
   The senator insisted he is in the race for keeps and only added
the new names to balance the committee with women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan to keep running for as long as I am healthy, said the
68-year-old senator. ''I've never been healthier in my life. I
enjoy the Senate. I think this is paranoia on someone's part, or
jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman James Tedisco, R-Schenectady, who is seeking his
10th two-year term in the state Assembly, is considered a potential
successor to Senator Farley.
</P>
<P>
   ''My policy is, I'd like to have leaders of the party on my
committee to fill vacancies. That's the way it should be, because
they represent the party,'' Tedisco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought Jim Tedisco was a good assemblyman, but he's
a little goofy on this one,'' Robert Farley said. ''He's the one
stirring the pot on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider a Senate run, Robert Farley said,
''Not right now.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Minority Serbs Now Victims  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International officials censured
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on Friday for becoming the oppressors of
their former Serb tormentors and using the same ''disgusting
tactics'' that were once used against them.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of reports released Friday, the United Nations and
other international organizations involved in rebuilding Kosovo
condemned growing ant-Serb violence, saying Albanian revenge
attacks remain a worry a year after NATO drove Serb forces out of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued on the eve of the first anniversary of the
U.N. mission in Kosovo, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
that continued international involvement in Kosovo depended on the
cooperation of all sides to bring peace and security to the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ''An upsurge of vicious attacks on Kosovo Serbs in several areas
has undermined Serb confidence in the future,'' Annan said. ''The
international community did not intervene in Kosovo to make it a
haven for revenge and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner,
urged critics Friday not to judge the pace of reconciliation,
saying it would take years for Serbs and ethnic Albanians to live
together peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''The history of the Balkans involves centuries and centuries of
difficulties,'' he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.
''We will need ... 10 years of a United Nations presence there ...
to see change in people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner spoke after briefing the Security Council on the
accomplishments and shortcomings of the United Nations'
adminstration in Kosovo, which was launched on June 10, 1999 at the
end of NATO's bombing campaign on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-day NATO campaign brought a halt to a yearlong crackdown
on the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb-led Yugoslav
forces. NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. administrators moved in once
Serb troops left.
</P>
<P>
   Another report, jointly drawn up by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and released in Pristina, listed a total of 180 violent
crimes committed against Serbs -- now only around 5 percent of
Kosovo's population -- between February and May.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, ethnic Albanians -- who make up more than 90
percent of the province's population -- were targeted 215 times, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR also condemned the mounting violence from its Geneva
headquarters, calling it the ''glaring failure'' of a year of
attempts to build peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew when we went back that the hatred ran deep but we did
not believe that the refugees and victims that UNHCR had helped in
exile would soon become the oppressors,'' said spokesman Ron
Redmond. ''That means also employing many of the same disgusting
tactics that were used against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled Kosovo since NATO bombing
stopped June 9, 1999. They were victims of -- or feared -- violence
from ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for the estimated 10,000
ethnic Albanians killed by the Serb-led forces of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of abating, such violence has picked up in recent weeks,
leaving several Serbs dead and the rest of the minority enraged.
Serbs rioted in Gracanica on Tuesday hours after a grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''These attacks appear to be part of an orchestrated campaign,''
Annan wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the U.N.
mission of failing to prevent the ''upsurge in anti-Serb
terrorism,'' which he said was a ''planned, provocative campaign,''
by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina on Friday, more than 1,000 ethnic Albanians gathered
to demand the release of those still held in Serbian jails or
information about others who went missing in the Serb crackdown
that ended after the 78-day air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen ethnic Albanians were released from Serb prisons later
Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Asylum for Cuban Doctors  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has agreed to grant
refugee status to two Cuban doctors who defected in Zimbabwe, thus
allowing them to resettle in the United States, a U.S. official
said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The official, asking not to be identified, said the decision was
made after the two Cubans were interviewed by a U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service official who had flown to Zimbabwe from
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, an official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
confirmed that the doctors were entitled to refugee status under
international rules.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when the two Cubans -- Leonel Cordova Rodriguez
and Noris Pena Martinez -- will arrive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were part of a Cuban 152-member Cuban medical
mission in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Their case gained international attention when they were
kidnapped last week by Zimbabwe security officers after their
intention to defect became known.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe authorities attempted to have them flown back to Cuba
but the doctors foiled the plan with the help of a note alerting an
Air France crew member that they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has denounced the two Cubans but denied any involvement in
the kidnapping. It has said that Zimbabwe had a right to make such
decisions.

<HEADLINE> House Votes Down Disclosure Rule  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House rejected a Democratic bid to force a
new breed of campaign organization to disclose the names of donors,
but only after Republican leaders agreed Friday to bring a GOP
version to the floor later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the leadership has come to the realization that
this is a growing problem,'' said Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware, one
of a small group of moderate Republicans who met with Speaker
Dennis Hastert before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With Castle and several other supporters of disclosure holding
ranks, the Democratic effort led by Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas
failed on a vote of 216-202. A similar effort succeeded in the
Senate on Thursday as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Democrats
outmaneuvered Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said after the House vote that despite the pledge made
by Republicans, he would renew his attempt next week to force his
measure to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to raise disclosure requirements drew support from
Texas Gov. George Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee-in-waiting. ''I don't know all the particulars of the bill,
but the idea of letting everybody who was a contributor to these
groups that are advertising for or against candidates -- it would be
nice to know who they are,'' Bush said while campaigning in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over disclosure is all that remains in the current
Congress of the drive to enact fundamental changes in the nation's
campaign system. Legislation to curb the influence of money cleared
in the House despite opposition from the GOP leadership but has
been bottled up in the Senate by a filibuster backed by senior
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Principally at issue in the votes this week are organizations
operating outside of federal election laws that mandate disclosure
of donors and expenditures. Dubbed ''527s'' for the section of the
tax code that permits them to operate, these are nonprofit groups
that may run campaign-style commercials, as long as they don't
directly advocate the election or defeat of any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that limitation, they have gained increasing prominence
in recent months. One group aided Texas Gov. George W. Bush in his
battle for the Republican presidential nomination, for example. And
Democrats have filed suit against the House Republican Whip, Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas, alleging he illegally oversees a network of
527s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment in which Democrats and Republicans can come
together to pass an end to the secret organizations with
undisclosed money,'' said House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans sided with Democrats. ''A 'no' vote is going to
be mighty hard to explain in November,'' said Rep. Greg Ganske,
R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Amo Houghton, a New York Republican whom the leadership
chose to draft legislation, cautioned against hasty action. ''In a
political year, there are all sorts of pressures. I am a very
strong advocate of campaign finance reform,'' he said. ''I do think
there's another way of doing this and doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay later told reporters the Democrats were guilty of
hypocrisy because their legislation would let liberal-leaning
interest groups escape disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Castle told reporters at a news conference that Hastert,
Majority Leader Richard Armey and DeLay had agreed to bring the
issue to the floor before Congress adjourns at the end of the month
for a July 4 break.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to reporters, DeLay denied that an agreement was
made to allow a vote on legislation by Castle but said the leaders
will allow a vote on the measure that Houghton produces. DeLay also
made clear he personally opposes legislation to compel groups to
disclose their donors.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton told reporters he expects to draft legislation that
will apply to a larger class of organizations than those covered by
the Democratic measure.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the House floor marked the second time in less than
a month that Democrats have attempted to attach their proposal to
Republican tax cut measures.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in support were 195 Democrats, six Republicans and one
independent. Opposed were 210 Republicans, five Democrats and one
independent.

   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- A man who was listed as one of the
Justice Department's 15 Most Wanted after he was indicted on drug
charges in 1988 has been arrested.
</P>

   Steven Wolosky, 50, was arrested Thursday in Manchester by
police and U.S. Marshals as he got off a bus from Boston. The
Marshal's Service said it believes Wolosky lived in Manchester
under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshal's Service said Wolosky led a drug ring responsible
for importing 400,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish from Colombia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Charges filed in federal court in California alleged the drug
organization operated tug boats and barges that moved drugs to
ports on the West Coast, then transported them by truck nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Wolosky was indicted in March 1988 on charges of conspiracy to
import, process and distribute drugs -- and released on $500,000
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Wolosky was being held in New Hampshire pending his return to
California.

<HEADLINE> Maryland man arrested in $21,000 casino chip heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man who sprayed Mace at a casino
dealer and stole $21,000 in chips was arrested Friday, State Police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dausi M. Kamara, 24, of New Carrollton, Md., was captured after
investigators traced the license plate number of the getaway car
used in Thursday's theft at the Sands Hotel &AMP; Casino, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamara was identified as the 6-foot-1 man who walked up to a
poker table about 5:30 a.m. Thursday and began making small talk
with the dealer, asking her about the rules, State Police spokesman
John Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled out a can of the chemical agent and sprayed the
unidentified dealer in the face, temporarily blinding her, before
grabbing a bunch of high denomination chips and running outside,
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, who struggled with the thief briefly, suffered
bruises but was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard who chased him saw some of the numbers on the
license plate of a black Pontiac he rode off in and State Police
traced it to Enterprise Leasing Co. of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The person who leased the car was not charged, but State Police
investigators found their way to Kamara's home in Adelphi, Md.,
Hagerty said. There a search led to the discovery of two pounds of
marijuana, $10,000 in cash and drug paraphernalia, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamara's mother, Marie Kamara, 43, was arrested and charged with
possession of narcotics, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators caught up with Kamara at a girlfriend's house
and found him in possession of the stolen chips, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held without bail Friday in the Prince George
County jail, pending extradition to New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Submits Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines on Friday filed its response to
the Federal Aviation Administration's concerns over the company's
maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   A recent audit and inspection by the FAA turned up more than 150
cases of missing or incomplete maintenance records, the agency
announced last week. The inspection was launched after the Jan. 31
crash of an Alaska Airlines jet off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although further investigation found that the maintenance in
question had been adequately performed, the FAA is considering
stripping Alaska of the right to perform heavy maintenance -- work
that requires an aircraft be removed from service while major
components are repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's problems centered on the documentation needed to
ensure all the work was done properly so the plane could be put
back in service. At any one time, between four and six of the
airlines' 89 planes are undergoing the process.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of Friday's filing by the airline were not made
public. Alaska Airlines officials said the filing summarizes
improvements the airline has already implemented, along with plans
for further actions.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Les Dorr said a team of inspectors will begin next
week verifying Alaska's plan in a visit to the company's
maintenance facilities. The FAA will decide within 30 days whether
the plans are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   If the FAA judges it insufficient, the airline would have to
park planes that are due for maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Tries Ex Pro-Israelis  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A military court convicted a pro-Israeli
militiaman of killing a captured guerrilla and another of serving
in a prison camp in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, and
sentenced them to 15 years in prison Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences -- the toughest so far in the ongoing trial of
Lebanese who dealt with Israel -- were among 36 cases, including
those of eight women, decided by the court on Friday. One defendant
was acquitted and the remainder received prison terms ranging from
one month to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 72 members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
faced the court on charges of collaborating with the enemy, but the
court put off a decision in the remaining cases.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for the third group of South Lebanon Army
fighters to be tried called for acquittals or lenient sentences,
saying their clients had been coerced or forced into collaborating
with Israel, court officials said on condition they not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Other charges against the defendants included joining the
militia, entering Israel and marketing Israeli fish in Lebanon.
Still technically at war with Israel, Lebanon prohibits any
dealings with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, had already
sentenced 101 ex-militiamen to jail terms of up to five years.
Anti-Israeli guerrillas viewed the sentences as lenient, while
relatives of the accused and some politicians called them too
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group that led the fight to evict
Israel from Lebanon, has demanded tough sentences, warning that
ex-militiamen set free may not be safe in their villages.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, the SLA helped the Israeli army control
the southern Lebanese border and ward off guerrilla attacks on
northern Israeli settlements. The militiamen also controlled the
lives of the zone's 120,000 people, jailing and expelling those
deemed a security threat to them or the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA -- which was trained, armed and paid for by Israel --
collapsed amid the Israeli withdrawal last month, and about 1,500
former SLA members surrendered to Lebanese authorities. About 7,000
ex-militiamen and family members sought refuge across the border in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lebanese joined the SLA voluntarily, but others served to
earn a living in the economically depressed border zone or were
recruited under the threat of imprisonment or expulsion of their
families.

	   David Janis, a New York art dealer who was Segal's agent, said
Segal's works are in 150 museum collections and many more private
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Segal was the most influential American figurative sculptor of
the 20th Century, and certainly one of the most important of the
20th Century, period,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a very sophisticated and deep understanding of people
and expressed that through his sculpture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Segal was born in New York and grew up in the Bronx. He studied
art at Cooper Union, the Pratt Institute and New York University in
New York, and at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His family moved to South Brunswick in the 1940s, where his
father ran a chicken farm. Segal later bought a chicken farm across
the road from his parents and operated it for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He taught art and English classes for several years in local
high schools before he was able to survive solely on his art.
</P>
<P>
   Segal is survived by his wife, Helen Steinberg; a daughter, Rena
Segal, of Somerset; a son, Jeffrey, of Vineland; and his brother,
Morris, of North Brunswick.

<HEADLINE> College Fires Gay Dean, Is Censured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic college that fired a
gay dean was censured Friday by the American Association of
University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization accuses Albertus Magnus College of violating
the academic freedom of Michael Hartwig, a former priest who had
been an associate dean and religion professor.
</P>
<P>
   College spokesman Mike Serpe called the censure
''predetermined'' and ''biased,'' saying the school took proper
steps in not renewing Hartwig's employment for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig had publicly described himself as ''a priest on leave''
in a newspaper article, but college administrators said he had told
them when hired in 1991 that he had left the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy put them in an awkward position, Albertus Magnus
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig also was identified as a priest on leave, as well as
gay, in The Wanderer, a national Roman Catholic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig maintains he was fired because he was gay. A lawsuit
over his dismissal in 1997 is pending in Hartford federal court.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the professors association says Hartwig was
dismissed so the college could avoid negative publicity about his
sexuality and a book he plans to write countering the church's
teaching on sexual abstinence for homosexuals and other unmarried
people.

House Votes To End Estate Taxes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a bill passed by the House today to repeal
inheritance taxes by 2010 said they were acting to prevent taxes from ruining
family farms and small businesses. House Republicans, joined by dozens of
Democrats at odds with President Clinton, passed the bill 279-136. President
Clinton promised to veto the bill, and detractors decried it as a costly

Calif. Teachers Get Cheap Apartments

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- With housing prices climbing out of sight in booming
San Francisco, the school system plans to take the extraordinary step of
building a rent-subsidized apartment house for teachers only. And for the first
time anywhere in the nation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development is helping out by giving its backing to bank loans. San Francisco's
4,300 public school teachers average $40,000 a year in a city where the median
home price is $470,000 and a one-bedroom apartment rents for $1,900 a month.
Ground will be broken in September on the 43-unit apartment house, which will be
built in the city's middle-class Sunset District and will share a lot with a new

Pentagon Concedes Decoy Allegations

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon admitted today that it used simpler decoys in
recent flight tests of an anti-missile interceptor, but it denied allegations
that the switch amounted to dishonest manipulation to hide a fatal flaw. The
first two interceptor flight tests, in 1997 and 1998, used more complex and
challenging decoys because the Pentagon was testing competing designs of
interceptors built by Boeing Co. and Raytheon Corp., said Air Force Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization. He said the intent was to stress the interceptors' sensors as part
of choosing the superior design.

<HEADLINE> Morris County installs deer reflectors to cut down roadway collisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Officials believe light reflectors will
curb the growing problem of cars hitting deer along Route 24 in
Morris County.
</P>
<P>
   Deer reflectors are being installed along 12 1/2 miles of the
road in Chester, Washington and Mendham townships to combat the
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The project is an extension of a 1-mile test area along Mendham
Road in Morris Township, which yielded less reported deer kills
within the almost two-year monitoring period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they were extremely beneficial,'' said Morris County
administrator James Rosenberg. ''There was a dramatic difference of
deer kills prior and after the test period.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 2,000 reflectors have been installed along
Route 24 since March 20, said Ed Bennett, a Morris County engineer
and director of public works.
</P>
<P>
   The reflectors, which are placed about 50 feet apart, are
designed to freeze or frighten deer attempting to cross the road by
reflecting headlight beams in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said about 150 deer-car collisions were reported along
the stretch within the two-year period. A woman and a teen-age boy
died when their car struck a 145-pound doe on Route 24 in January,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County has plans to expand its deer reflector coverage in
Millburn Township.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have yet to see any hit animal in that area. These are not
just deer reflectors, they're keeping all animals off the road,''
Vincent Phillips, Essex County's director of the Division of Roads
and Bridges, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Friday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all county officials are convinced that deer
reflectors are effective.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jennings, a natural resource specialist with the Morris
County Park Commission, said the deer reflectors are a short-term
solution to the long-term problem of overpopulated white-tailed
deer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''You got to address the core issue, and they are not doing it
by doing this,'' said Jennings. ''It's a bandage solution to a
problem that requires a more sound, scientific solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Reducing the number of deer will reduce the chance of deer-car
collisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said there are 40 to 60 deer per square mile in the
area along Mendham Road compared to 15 to 20 deer per square mile
recommended by the New Jersey's Department of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Counties across the state are trying to devise ways to thin the
deer herd. Officials said the state deer population is estimated at
200,000, double what it was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and farmers have complained that deer are spreading
Lyme disease, ravaging plants and causing local farmers millions of
dollars in lost crops.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that would allow officials to bring in sharpshooters to
control the deer population is in limbo after the state Senate
deadlocked on a vote last month. The measure passed the Assembly in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also said problems exist with the reflectors.
</P>
<P>
   He reported seeing missing or damaged reflectors along the test
site on Mendham Road because of snow plows this winter.
</P>
<P>
   He also said deer will walk pass the reflectors and continue to
cross the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen deer go along a fenced area until they find an
opening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project was funded by a matching $20,000 grant from the
state's Department of Highway and Traffic Safety, and the state has
already agreed to fund next year's project, said Rosenberg.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- International aid workers on
Friday criticized U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone for failing to
protect civilians in the war-ravaged country. The United Nations
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops in the northern town of Kabala stayed in their
barracks when rebels attacked Tuesday night, sending more than
10,000 civilians fleeing into the bush, according to the French aid
group Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   The group's three staffers hid in the jungle with the rest of
the town's population as loud explosions continued through the
night, said Fasil Tezera, the head of mission. When they returned
to Kabala the next day, they found U.N. peacekeepers withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't see them reacting in any way to defend a large
population being displaced,'' Tezera said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said the withdrawal of Kenyan
peacekeepers from Kabala had been underway for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a military decision taken for very good reasons to
redeploy the Kenyans in Kabala, as we do not have sufficient men on
the ground to deploy everywhere as yet,'' Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The town about 100 miles northeast of the capital, Freetown, was
protected by pro-government forces and there had been no fighting
in the area for the past 24 hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Town residents, however, still felt threatened and were spending
their nights in the bush, Tezera said. Doctors Without Borders
evacuated to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians and systematically maimed many more during the West
African country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   They signed a July peace accord with the government, but
reignited the conflict in early May, seizing 500 U.N. hostages and
advancing toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag coalition of
pro-government forces has been pushing the RUF away from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, however, expressed concern Friday that the
rebels seemed unlikely to follow through with plans to release
another 21 peacekeepers subsequently detained in eastern Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peacekeepers were surrounded for about three weeks in
the town of Quiva, about 170 miles east of Freetown, but were moved
Monday to Pendembu, about 10 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials were told the move was in preparation to release
the troops in neighboring Liberia, as had been done with the 500
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it appears that the RUF decision to release them has been
overturned,'' U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said. ''We view this
with dismay.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with rebel field commanders in the area were
continuing, but U.N. officials had no explanation for the change of
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 224 armed U.N. peacekeepers and 10 unarmed
observers remained surrounded in the rebel stronghold of Kailahun,
about 200 miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday urged regional
leaders, in particular Liberian President Charles Taylor, to work
for their release. Taylor helped negotiate the release of the 500
peacekeepers held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely essential that the RUF immediately and
unconditionally restore the freedom of movement of the
peacekeepers,'' Annan said in a statement issued by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hostages, both the Pendembu and Kailahun groups have
been allowed to keep their weapons, Wimhurst said. The
11,850-strong peacekeeping mission is expected to be boosted to
13,000 troops by the end of June, and Annan has called for an
additional 3,500 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> McVeigh Appeal Oral Arguments Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A federal court will hear arguments Aug. 17 in
convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's bid for a new
trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch on Friday ordered the
hearing on issues raised in McVeigh's most recent appeal and the
government's efforts to dismiss his claims.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh appealed his conviction in March, claiming his lawyer
leaked inflammatory stories about him to the media, including a
purported confession. It was his second effort to have his
conviction and death sentence vacated.
</P>
<P>
   The government responded with a motion to dismiss the appeal,
saying McVeigh has no legitimate cause for complaint.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Denver convicted McVeigh on federal murder and
conspiracy charges and sentenced him to death for the 1995 bombing
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which
killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh lost his first appeal last year when the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to hear arguments that his trial was tainted by jury
misconduct and news reports that he confessed.

<HEADLINE> Arab-Americans Angry Over Policy  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arab-Americans booed and shouted at
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering on Friday as he tried to
give a luncheon speech in support of continued sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame, shame on you,'' an unidentified man shouted at
Pickering, the State Department's third highest official. ''How
dare you want to kill the kids of Iraq? What kind of human being
are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Many at the luncheon of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee yelled and clanked their water glasses with silverware,
preventing Pickering from continuing for two minutes. Several dozen
people walked out in protest. Others, however, urged the protesters
to be quiet and allow Pickering to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said sanctions are needed because Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein has not complied with U.N. resolutions passed after his
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions call on him to destroy
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, account for missing
prisoners of war and to end human rights abuses, Pickering noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nine years later, Iraq still has not complied with these
resolutions and Saddam refuses to ... destroy his weapons of mass
destruction,'' Pickering said. ''He has not returned stolen
property, accounted for the missing prisoners or stopped repressing
his own people.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why it is critical for sanctions to remain in place,''
Pickering said, prompting the clamor in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a dinner for the Arab-American group, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was greeted far more warmly with a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My fervent hope is that Iraq will soon decide to comply fully
with Security Council resolutions, and thus open a new chapter in
its relations with the international community,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have been blamed by critics for increasing
suffering in Iraq -- rising poverty, illness and death rates. They
initially barred all Iraqi oil exports but were eased in 1996 when
limited oil sales were allowed under U.N. supervision to use the
revenues to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
   Now Iraq is allowed virtually unlimited oil sales under
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said changing sanctions ''would not lead to a dramatic
improvement in humanitarian conditions in Iraq'' and would free
Saddam to use revenues for weapons to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned about conditions in Iraq,'' Pickering
said when he resumed talking, adding Saddam has stockpiled
medicines, failed to start feeding programs and a children's
immunization program urged by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam bears responsibility for conditions in the areas of
Iraq that he controls,'' Pickering said. ''The willingness of
well-meaning people to ignore that fact simply reinforces his
inclination to trade on the suffering of his own people by
withholding supplies while building palaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident came only hours after the U.N. Security Council
voted to extend the so-called oil-for food program for another six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The new resolution also allows Iraq to spend $600 million from
oil sales on spare parts for its oil industry and lets it buy water
and sanitation equipment without approval.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Iraq's trade minister said the program was doing
little to help the Iraqi people. Out of $29 billion earned since
1996, Iraq has access to only $7 billion, the rest set aside for
paying U.N. expenses in Iraq or compensation to Gulf War victims,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said.

<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Dirk Frankenberg, an internationally
known professor of marine sciences at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, died early Friday of a heart attack. He
was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenberg led both UNC-CH's Institute of Marine Sciences from
1980 to 1993 and its Marine Sciences Curriculum from 1974 to 1990.
He spent the last 10 years of his career writing books about North
Carolina's natural beauty and helping to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   His books included ''The Nature of the Outer Banks'' and ''The
Nature of North Carolina's Southern Coast,'' and he recently
finished editing the new UNC Press book, ''Exploring North
Carolina's Natural Areas.''
Joseph W. Hall Jr.:
</P>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Joseph W. Hall Jr., a reporter for The
Associated Press for 39 years who was legendary for his knowledge
and coverage of the Senate, died Friday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Hall retired from the AP in 1976, after covering the Senate for
more than 25 years. He was an authority on tax and budget issues
and spent five years on the staff of the House Ways and Means
Committee after his AP retirement. He also covered the campaigns of
four presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hall joined the AP in Kansas City and served in AP bureaus in
Jefferson City, Mo., and Topeka, Kan., before joining the Army in
World War II. He served four years and became a captain.
</P>
<P>
   He resumed his AP career in New York after the war and was
transferred to the Washington bureau in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia O'Connor Hall, two sons, a
daughter and six grandchildren.
Jacob Lawrence:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Painter Jacob Lawrence, whose stark images in
bold colors illuminated the black experience in such paintings as
the celebrated ''Migration'' series, died Friday in his sleep. He
was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was just 21 when he fulfilled his early promise as an
artist and a witness to history in 1939 with a series of works
depicting the 19th century slave rebellion in Haiti and a 63-work
series on the lives of American abolitionists Harriet Tubman and
Frederick Douglass.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 23, he applied his vivid narrative style to
''Migration,'' a 60-painting work depicting the movement of black
Americans north to jobs and hope.
</P>
<P>
   The work was an immediate success, featured in Fortune magazine
and shown at New York's Downtown Gallery by prestigious art dealer
Edith Halpert in late 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ''Migration'' was sold soon after completion. The even-numbered
panels went to the New York Museum of Modern Art and the
odd-numbered ones to the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C.,
but the series has been reunited several times for exhibit. The 18-
by 12-inch panels were seen around the nation in 1993-95.
</P>
<P>
   He did ''Migration'' all at once, exhausting a brilliant palette
of black, brown, white, red, blue, green, orange and yellow as he
moved from one panel to another.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after that explosive beginning, Lawrence traveled,
painted, published and taught.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he had a breakdown as abstract expressionism
transformed the art world while he continued in his
representational style. He painted throughout his 10-month stay at
a psychiatric hospital in New York.
Richard P. Scharchburg:
</P>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Automotive historian Richard P.
Scharchburg, who specialized in chronicling the early years of
General Motors Corp., died Wednesday. The cause of death was not
immediately available. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Scharchburg was the Thompson Professor of Industrial History at
Kettering University and director of the Kettering/GMI Alumni
Foundation's Collection of Industrial History.
</P>
<P>
   He joined General Motors Engineering and Management Institute in
1964. GMI is now called Kettering University, a professional
cooperative education training program for auto industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Scharchburg's books included ''W.C. Durant: The Boss,'' a
profile of GM's first chairman; ''America's Co-op College (GMI):
The First 75 Years''; and ''Carriages Without Horses: J. Frank
Duryea and the Birth of the American Automobile Industry.''
George Segal:
</P>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- George Segal, an American pop art icon of
the '60s known for his life-size plaster sculptures, died of cancer
Friday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Segal began his career as a painter but later turned to
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't divorce myself from the sensual things of life --
things I could touch,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   He received a National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's three-dimensional sculpture scenes include ''Cezanne's
Still Life,'' a breakfast table with ripe fruit, tea pot and milk
pitcher modeled after the famous painting, and ''Woman on Orange
Bed,'' a nude woman lounging on a rumpled, sun-streaked bed.
</P>
<P>
   He also created a life-size Depression-era bread line at the
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, which was dedicated in
Washington in 1997. One of the five figures in the line is a
self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to take sculpture off its pedestal,'' Segal told The
Associated Press in a 1985 interview at an exhibition of his works
in Paris. ''I wanted something solid, something I could walk into
and walk around and be a part of. But I also want this marriage
between the physical and the state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   To get his full-size, life-like figures, Segal wrapped the
bodies of real models in wet plaster limb by limb to make a mold
into which he recast plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's works are in 150 museum collections and many more
private collections.

<HEADLINE> Woman indicted for allegedly striking co-pilot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) - A federal grand jury has indicted a New York
City woman accused of entering an America West cockpit and striking
a co-pilot, U.S. Attorney Norman Bay announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Laverne Brown, 39, is charged with two counts of
interfering with a flight crew, and one count of assault by
striking, beating or wounding in the special aircraft jurisdiction
of the United States, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   She faces up to 20 years in prison and more than $250,000 in
fines if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was arrested on March 20 after the plane, with 128
passengers and a crew of five aboard, was diverted to Albuquerque.
The plane was en route to New York from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, the woman was drunk, refused to obey
orders from flight personnel, threatened a flight attendant and
assaulted the co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's stepfather, Tony Mullen, has said that a flight
attendant refused to allow Brown use one of the restrooms in
first-class when she was a coach passenger.

<HEADLINE> Pop Artist George Segal Dies At 75  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- George Segal, an American pop art icon of
the 1960s known for his life-size plaster sculptures, died of
cancer Friday at his New Jersey home. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Segal began his career as a painter but later turned to
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't divorce myself from the sensual things of life --
things I could touch,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Segal said he never felt trapped in the art form, even though it
was his plaster sculptures that put his name among the top pop
artists, including Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy
Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''When pop art first became noticed, I felt I was sitting on the
tail of a rocket. Amazingly, it still flies,'' Segal said in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he received a National Medal of the Arts from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's three-dimensional sculpture scenes include ''Cezanne's
Still Life,'' a breakfast table with ripe fruit, tea pot and milk
pitcher modeled after the famous painting, and ''Woman on Orange
Bed,'' a nude woman lounging on a rumpled, sun-streaked bed.
</P>
<P>
   He also created a life-size bread line and other sculptures
depicting the Great Depression at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Memorial in Washington. One of the five bronze figures in the bread
line, installed in 1997, is a self-portrait.
</P>

in Paris. ''I wanted something solid, something I could walk into
and walk around and be a part of. But I also want this marriage
between the physical and the state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   To get his full-size, life-like figures, Segal wrapped the
bodies of real models in wet plaster limb by limb to make a mold
into which he recast plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the freshness of the paint, the strokes, I like making
the marks,'' he said in the Paris interview. ''But I moved into
three dimensions because all these very intelligent abstract
conceptions and ideas about art blocked my painting on flat
canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   David Janis, a New York art dealer who was Segal's agent, said
Segal's works are in 150 museum collections and many more private
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Segal was the most influential American figurative sculptor of
the 20th Century, and certainly one of the most important of the
20th Century, period,'' Janis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a very sophisticated and deep understanding of people
and expressed that through his sculpture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janis said Segal died at his home Friday in South Brunswick,
about 15 miles northeast of Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Segal grew up in New York and studied art at Cooper Union, the
Pratt Institute and New York University in New York, and at Rutgers
University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His family moved to South Brunswick in the 1940s, where his
father ran a chicken farm. Segal later bought a chicken farm across
the road from his parents and operated it for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He taught art and English for several years in local high
schools before he was able to earn enough to live off his art.
</P>
<P>
   Segal is survived by his wife, Helen Steinberg; daughter, Rena
Segal; son, Jeffrey Segal; and brother, Morris.

<HEADLINE> Love Canal lawyer probing high school site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - An environmental lawyer who was instrumental
in the Love Canal investigation more than 20 years ago will review
a probe of possible cancer risks at a school.
</P>
<P>
   Craig A. Slater told city officials and parents he noticed a
number of red flags indicating potential environmental risks at the
Southside High School, built on 1977-78 on land formerly occupied
by factories and adjacent to a known polluted industrial site.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said based it is likely the contaminants found on the
former American LaFrance site, would be found on the school
property. Environmental investigations of the LaFrance site showed
high levels of almost every kind of pollutant except radioactive
substances, Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   The LaFrance site was recently cleaned up after the owner
discovered hazardous waste on the property.
</P>
<P>
   The state departments of health and environmental conservation
have been investigating the site since April, following at least
two dozen confirmed cancer cases among former students.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said it took 10 years to convince the government there
were extensive chemical wastes beneath a large neighborhood called
Love Canal in Niagara Falls in 1978. In August 1978, President
Carter declared the neighborhood's situation a federal emergency
and the state health commissioner ordered closure of the school
there.	   
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that this is on the same level as Love Canal,''
Slater said. ''But it's certainly worth looking into.''

Rwandan, Ugandan Forces Face Off

   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Angry Congo residents waited in vain for the Rwandan
and Ugandan forces to cease their relentless firing as mortar and artillery
shells rained down on the deserted streets of Kisangani on Friday. The Red Cross
said more than 150 civilians have been killed and 700 wounded since the shelling
and shooting began Monday. Rwanda and Uganda use Kisangani as a logistics base
to support rival rebel groups, and despite an agreement to demilitarize the
city, they have begun fighting for control of it.

Calif. Teachers Get Cheap Apartments
</SUBHEAD>

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco school system plans to take the
extraordinary step of building a rent-subsidized apartment house for teachers
only. And for the first time anywhere in the nation, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development is helping out by giving its backing to bank
loans. San Francisco's 4,300 public school teachers average $40,000 a year in a
city where the median home price is $470,000 and a one-bedroom apartment rents
for $1,900 a month. Ground will be broken in September on the 43-unit apartment
house, which will be built in the city's middle-class Sunset District and will

Pentagon Concedes Decoy Allegations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon admitted today that it used simpler decoys in
recent flight tests of an anti-missile interceptor, but it denied allegations
that the switch amounted to dishonest manipulation to hide a fatal flaw. The
first two interceptor flight tests, in 1997 and 1998, used more complex and
challenging decoys because the Pentagon was testing competing designs of
interceptors built by Boeing Co. and Raytheon Corp., said Air Force Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization. He said the intent was to stress the interceptors' sensors as part
of choosing the superior design.

Arab-Americans Angry Over Policy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arab-Americans booed and shouted at Undersecretary of
State Thomas Pickering on Friday as he tried to give a luncheon speech in
support of continued sanctions against Iraq. ''Shame, shame on you,'' an
unidentified man shouted at Pickering, the State Department's third highest
official. Several dozen people walked out in protest. Pickering said sanctions
are needed because Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not complied with U.N.
resolutions passed after his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions have been
blamed by critics for increasing suffering in Iraq -- rising poverty, illness
and death rates.

Acquittal in Prison Gladiator Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Eight California prison guards were acquitted today of
federal charges that they entertained themselves by staging gladiator-style
fights among inmates, including a brawl in which a prisoner was shot to death.
After a nine-week trial, the jury reached its verdict after about six hours of
deliberations. It cleared the guards of charges that they conspired to deny the
prisoners' right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Four guards could
have faced possible life sentences; the others up to 10 years behind bars.

<HEADLINE> State says bird found in Bergen carried West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State health officials Friday said a dead
crow found in River Edge, Bergen County tested positive for the
West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was one of 120 crows so far tested by state officials.
Results were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New Jersey test shows that the surveillance system we have
established to monitor West Nile virus is working as planned,''
Christine Grant, state commissioner of Health and Human Services,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every
county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant. The
virus has not been found in tests of mosquito pools in eight
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, health workers found traces of the virus in 74 crows
and two mosquito pools.
</P>
<P>
   No New Jersey resident was found to carry the virus, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St. Louis
encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in
Westchester and sickened more than 60. It was also blamed for
hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms. In the most
serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain. Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune
systems, are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Birds harbor the disease and many are susceptible to it, but
they cannot transmit it to humans.

<HEADLINE> Walker Returns to Rockies  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Larry Walker returned to the lineup looking like a
man who had lost his compass.
</P>
<P>
   The six-time Gold Glove right fielder, sidelined with an elbow
injury since May 11, made his first career start in left field
Friday night against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Over Walker's protests, manager Buddy Bell put him in left field
in hopes of taking some pressure off his healing right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have very rarely been out there,'' said Walker, who played
left field twice as a reserve with the Montreal Expos in 1989.
''Buddy wanted me to play out there and I absolutely said no. Then
I thought about it, and if it is for the better, we'll give it a
shot and see how it goes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of position, Colorado was just glad to see the
two-time defending NL batting champion back on the field. Though
they were 16-7 without Walker, the Rockies had little depth on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have easily been out of this whatever little
(playoff) race that you want to call it right now,'' center fielder
Tom Goodwin said. ''It's good that we held on. We're going to get
our guy back and hopefully we can just continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a bulky brace to hit, Walker received an All-Star's
welcome from the fans when he entered the batter's box in the first
inning. He promptly grounded to second on the first pitch he saw
from Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be a little period where his timing will be
affected, so we have to realize that and understand it,'' Bell
said. ''I also think that Walk's the kind of athlete where it
doesn't take much to get him going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies just hope Walker can stay healthy. He has played
more than 140 games just twice in 11 seasons and said he still has
pain in the elbow, which was bothered by stress irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Walker walked into the Colorado training room after
the team's return from Seattle and said he wanted back in the
lineup. Asked if he will speak up if the pain increases, Walkers
said, ''I probably won't shut it down. I will go up there and play
all (messed) up all year.
</P>
<P>
   Playing through the pain earlier in the season, Walker managed
to hit .347 but seemed to lose some of his power, hitting three
homers and driving in 17 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Walker admitted he remains less than 100 percent and plans to
continue using a bone stimulator to accelerate the healing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is definitely better,'' he said. ''I am much better. I
don't know how long it is going to hold for it. I am not going to
sit here and tell you, 'I am 100 percent. I feel good. Let's go get
them.' ... I know what it is like and how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's biggest fear before Walker's stint on the disabled
list was that his injury would develop into a stress fracture. That
fear has diminished only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime a guy comes back from injury, there's some concern,''
Bell said. ''If there was real concern, he wouldn't be out there.
That's why he's starting tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Walker on the 25-man roster, the Rockies
optioned Bubba Carpenter to Triple-A Colorado Springs.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 6, Marlins 4  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- John Flaherty homered and Vinny
Castilla and Felix Martinez each drove in two runs Friday night to
help the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Florida Marlins 6-4 for
their fourth victory in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel (4-6) broke a personal four-game losing streak,
limiting the Marlins to one hit before giving up four runs in the
sixth inning. He allowed five hits, struck out two and walked three
in 5 2-3 innings to win for the first time since May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty, who went 3-for-4, hit his fourth homer off Ryan
Dempster (6-4) to give the Devil Rays a 5-0 lead in the fifth.
Castilla had a two-run triple in the first, Martinez delivered a
two-run double in the fourth and Gerald Williams added a RBI double
off reliever Ron Mahay for a 6-4 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar hit a bases-loaded triple off Trachsel and Derrek
Lee added an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was just the third for the Devil Rays in 11 games
against Florida, whose 34-22 record since interleague play was
introduced in 1997 is the best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which has the worst interleague mark, is 4-3 against
NL opponents this year but 12-29 overall in three seasons. The
crowd of 16,035 at Tropicana Field was a little more than 2,000
less than the Devil Rays' season average at home.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel had dropped four straight since winning back-to-back
1-0 decisions on the road over Pedro Martinez at Fenway Park and
Orlando Hernandez at Yankee Stadium. In four home starts before
Friday night, he was 0-3 with an 11.81 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander looked like he might be headed for another
tough outing when Mike Lowell doubled with one out in the second,
Millar was hit by a pitch and Alex Gonzalez drew a two-out walk to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Castilla, the Devil Rays' third baseman, made a diving catch
on Mike Redmond line drive to keep the Marlins off the scoreboard,
and Trachsel settled down to retire 11 straight hitters before
Kotsay singled with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd's infield single off Trachsel's leg and a walk
loaded the bases again. This time, the Marlins wouldn't let the
Tampa Bay starter off the hook, breaking through on Millar's
bases-clearing triple and knocking Trachsel out of the game when
Lee's RBI double trimmed Florida's deficit to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jim Mecir walked the first batter he faced before
hitting Redmond with an 0-2 pitch to reload the bases. But the
Devil Rays escaped further damage when Luis Castillo bounced out to
third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez pitch the ninth for Tampa Bay to earn his
seventh save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dick Vitale spoke during a pregame tribute to cancer
survivors. Former Senators pitchers Casey Cox, a cancer survivor,
threw out the first pitch ... The Marlins were 5-1 at Tropicana
Field the past two seasons with the lone loss coming on June 23,
1998, when Dempster also was the losing pitcher ... Trachsel won
for just the second time in 11 interleague starts. He was 1-5 with
the Chicago Cubs and is now 1-1 with the Devil Rays ... Martinez
received a standing ovation in the fourth after being caught in a
rundown between third and home and eluding being tagged until
Williams was able to race from the plate all the way to third base.
The out was scored 1-2-5-1-6.

<HEADLINE> Ryan Vetoes Abortion Legislation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Gov. George Ryan vetoed legislation
Friday that would have barred state-funded abortions for poor women
who want the procedure solely for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The law would have limited public funding of abortion to cases
in which the mother's life was in danger or the pregnancy was a
result of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is one of 16 states that provide abortions for health
reasons. Critics argue tax money should not pay for abortions
except under the most dire circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a Republican with a record of opposing abortion, has
questioned the fairness of refusing abortions for women with
serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a pharmacist by profession, I have been involved in health
care my entire life and I find it impossible to separate health
from life,'' Ryan said in a statement. ''We live in a very
health-conscious society, with a special concern for women's
health. Why, then, would we not be concerned about the health of a
pregnant woman -- rich or poor?''

<HEADLINE> Lazio taps former top aide to Forbes as campaign manager  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio has named Bill Dal Col, who
ran publisher Steve Forbes' two unsuccessful presidential races,
manager of his U.S. Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the candidate's camp confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Republican sources had indicated Lazio would
add Dal Col to a campaign team that already includes members of
former Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters following an event in Ulster County late
Friday, Lazio said Dal Col brings ''the depth of experience,
unrivaled frankly,'' to his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has national perspective. He knows New York. He's got the
ideal combination of political skills, communication skills,
organizational skills to help pull the operation of this campaign
effectively,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes failed in his two efforts to win the White House in
1992 and 1996, Dal Col earned generally high marks from those who
dealt with him during those presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great choice,'' said Nelson Warfield, who served as Bob
Dole's presidential campaign spokesman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Number one, Dal Col is the consummate organization man. He'll
bring structure to a fast-growing campaign,'' Warfield said.
''Number two, he actually knows the candidate. They go back to the
Suffolk County Republican vineyards and it is vitally important to
a campaign to have people on board who have a relationship to the
candidate beyond the next paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is from Suffolk County which is where Dal Col cut his
political teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lazio campaign on Friday unveiled its first
television advertisement, a 60-second spot stressing his background
as a New Yorker and his work as a congressman. The ad, in addition
to boosting Lazio's name recognition, is meant to underscore the
fact that Clinton only moved into the state in January and has no
record as an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pro-Lazio TV ads have already begun airing, one
financed by the state Conservative Party and the other paid for by
the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington-based political
action committee that espouses moderate Republican ideas. The
council's advisory board includes New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York State Sons of Italy dinner in Ulster County,
Lazio again stressed his New York roots and was warmly received
when he reminisced about his own Italian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come a long way, my friends ... from where it was
unthinkable to have an Italian-American lead a business, or a
school or even run for Senate. We've come a long way,'' he said,
drawing applause from about 750 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign took the wraps off a new 30-second TV spot
of its own on Friday in which the first lady talks directly into
the camera and is shown mingling with New Yorkers as she tells
viewers that she has ''traveled to all 62 counties of New York''
and would work to improve health care, save Social Security, reduce
the national debt, create jobs and make college tuition tax
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Dal Col to the Lazio campaign team gives the
operation an even more distinctly presidential flair. Already
working for Lazio's Senate effort are several key players from Sen.
John McCain's presidential run, including media guru Michael
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also reached into the ranks of Pataki's political team
to staff a campaign that only got started on May 19 after Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani quit the Senate race to deal with his prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're putting together a dream team here,'' Lazio
said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Pres Warns Andean leaders  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Venezuela's president warned that Andean
leaders who opened a two-day summit here Friday could wind up
telling the world to stay out of their affairs.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez said he would push his fellow presidents
to draft a declaration for the ''recovery of the sovereignty of our
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit comes amid international protest over the legitimacy
of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's re-election two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez refused to comment on the Peruvian election, and he made
a point of saying that other nations should follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not come here to endorse or legitimize anything
because it does not concern us,'' Chavez told reporters after
wrapping up a first day of meetings. ''It does not concern any
world power, it only concerns the Peruvian people and Peru's
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidents didn't discuss the substance of their first day
of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is threatening economic and political
sanctions after Fujimori won an unprecedented third five-year term
in a May 28 runoff vote. International monitors declared that
voting riddled with irregularities and refused to participate.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent Alejandro Toledo boycotted the election, saying the
outcome had been rigged in Fujimori's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States is sending a high-level
mission to Peru to work on strengthening democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's election process has also had problems. The
country's May 28, balloting was postponed because of computer
problems. Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup
attempt in Venezuela before he was elected president two years ago,
is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of the Andean nations -- Peru, Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador and Bolivia -- meet annually to discuss trade and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said as he arrived Thursday night that Andean countries
should reject ''the whip'' of a world community that seeks to
impose its version of democracy and economic policy on South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia President Andres Pastrana steered clear of Chavez's
statements during the summit's opening address. He praised
Fujimori's post election pledge to improve Peru's democratic
institutions and congratulated him for welcoming another OAS
delegation to help with that process.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lead Pacers 52-49 At Half  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant was lost for the game with a
sprained left ankle, but the Los Angeles Lakers rallied in his
absence to take a 52-49 lead over the Indiana Pacers into halftime
of Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant rolled his ankle when he shot a jumper and then landed on
the foot of Indiana's Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the team's second-leading scorer, went to the locker
room to have X-rays. They were negative, but a team spokesman said
he would be held out of the rest of the game as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   His status for Sunday night's Game 3 was uncertain. Los Angeles
was trying to take a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal started slowly but finished the first half with
15 points and 10 rebounds in the first half. The Pacers fulfilled
their promise to foul O'Neal more frequently, and the notoriously
bad free-throw shooter went just 5-for-17 from the line to keep the
game close.
</P>
<P>
   Rose enjoyed an outstanding first half for the Pacers, scoring
18 points on 6-of-14 shooting. Dale Davis had nine points and six
rebounds for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles guard Glen Rice, nearly invisible in Game 1, hit his
third 3-pointer with less than a minute left in the half to stake
Los Angeles to its 52-49 lead. Rice had 13 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 28 at the end of the first period, with
Rose scoring 10 points and Reggie Miller eight for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who shot 1-for-16 in the Finals opener, made three of
his first four shots in the second game. He was hampered by foul
trouble and had 10 points in 12 minutes of play by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper made all five of his shots to lead the Lakers with 11
points in the first, but was scoreless in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who won the opener 104-87, led 22-20 when Bryant
left the game. They made another basket before timeout was called
with 3:05 left in the period.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Rebel Talks Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Warring rebels in the Solomon
Islands said they would stop shooting long enough to let foreign
diplomats visit, but that was all they agreed on before peace talks
collapsed Friday, New Zealand officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation including Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer and New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff arrived Saturday
morning in Honiara, the capital, where they planned to meet with
government leaders and rebels from both sides, said Brad
Tattersfield, a spokesman for New Zealand's Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to achieve a 14-day truce between the Malaita Eagle
Force and the Isatabu Freedom Movement crumbled when the Malaita
rebels declined to sign on, New Zealand High Commissioner Nick
Hurley said from the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   However, radio reports said the islands' prime minister was
apparently no longer under house arrest. There were no reports of
fresh fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel groups signed a joint statement Friday calling a
two-day truce so that the foreign ministers could land and take off
safely from the capital's airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that we will be able to help them resolve their
problems,'' and get the peace process ''back on track,'' Downer
said prior to his arrival in the Solomons.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels indigenous to the main island, Guadalcanal, have been
fighting for 18 months to evict migrants from the nearby island of
Malaita. More than 50 people have been killed or disappeared, and
about 20,000 have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fighting has been concentrated around Honiara's
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Malaita militants teamed up with paramilitary units this week
and raided the Solomon Islands armory. They then seized Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu at gunpoint Monday and demanded he
resign. The prime minister is a Malaitan, but some Malaitans accuse
him of being a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu was reportedly freed from house arrest Thursday, and
was to face a vote of no confidence in the parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita rebels dropped their demand that he resign. However,
using machine guns and a stolen police gunboat, they began
attacking rebels from the Isatabu Freedom Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed to have inflicted casualties this week, but
the claims could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Australia moved in a navy ship, which by Friday was loaded with
about 470 foreigners wanting to flee. The ship was to stay moored
off Honiara until a New Zealand frigate arrived Saturday to take
over evacuation duties, Australian Defense Minister John Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands are 2,230 miles northwest of Wellington, and
1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalcanal was the scene of a bloody World War II battle, when
U.S. Marines began their island-hopping Pacific assault on Japanese
forces after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: Fiji Coup Leader Is Terrorist  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The U.S. ambassador to Fiji branded coup
leader George Speight a terrorist, saying Friday that he should be
prosecuted for taking the island nation's government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   It appears unlikely Speight will face trial for seizing Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 30 other officials on May 19. The
country's new military leaders have removed Chaudhry from office
and promised Speight and his supporters amnesty if they release the
captives.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Osman Siddique called that a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he should get immunity. He is a common criminal,
a terrorist and justice should be served to him,'' Siddique told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Influential tribal chiefs, meanwhile, huddled with Speight on
Saturday, seeking for a second day to find a solution to the
monthlong hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs, from Fiji's wealthy western provinces, had no
comment as they entered the parliamentary compound where Speight
and his rebels are holding the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Two tribal chiefs and a delegation of Methodists -- the largest
church in Fiji -- asked Speight on Friday to free the hostages. He
refused.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodists came to ''bring us food but they were not here to
say we are in this camp or that camp,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal chiefs, all dressed in traditional ''sulu'' skirts,
spent about two hours at Speight's camp in the parliamentary
complex on Friday, praying and drinking the mild sedative kava
before talks got underway, but no progress in ending the standoff
was reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good meeting, a great meeting,'' Speight said later
without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Speight, the chiefs went to visit Fiji's military
rulers, who seized power after Speight had thrown Fiji into crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the meeting, the military said the
chiefs had presented a proposed solution to the crisis and the army
had noted it. ''No decision was reached, nor was one expected,''
the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his rebels launched their coup to win more power for
Fiji's indigenous majority.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry was the first person to hold that post from the 44
percent of Fiji's population who are ethnic Indian. The rebels want
Fijians of Indian descent barred from leadership of this nation
2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Fijian nationalists have been angered by Chaudhry's attempts to
persuade Fijian landowners to renew expiring leases on farmland
held by thousands of ethnic Indian tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Speight and the army broke down a week ago after
military leader Commodore Frank Bainimarama said he would entertain
no more of Speight's demands. Bainimarama had already agreed to
scrap the 1997 constitution -- blamed by Fijians for giving too much
power to Indians -- and to oust Fiji's president.
</P>
<P>
   The political crisis has already begun to take a devastating
toll on Fiji's economy. Government economists believe $100 million
in government revenue will be lost as a result of the coup and
unemployment could rise by up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, workers and others affected by the turmoil
announced they will march through Suva on Monday to protest Speight
''holding our country to ransom.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Mario Bates Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals running back Mario
Bates could face an NFL suspension after pleading guilty Friday to
misdemeanor charges of slapping his girlfriend in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The league's new anti-violence policy states that suspension
without pay is mandatory for a conviction or guilty plea for
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was sentenced in Scottsdale Municipal Court to two years'
unsupervised probation, fined $364 and ordered to participate in a
domestic non-violence program. He also was ordered to have no
''uninvited contact'' with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Bates spent a night in jail after hitting her during a March 14
argument at his Scottsdale home.
</P>
<P>
   Bates' girlfriend told police she tried to call for help after
being hit but Bates yanked out the phone connections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Buss Enjoying Lakers' Finals Run  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Buss was wearing a checkered sports
jacket that was almost as bright as his smile when he arrived at
Staples Center on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers owner has been a joyous spectator during
the Lakers' return to pre-eminence this season in the NBA and in
the hearts of their fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just been tremendous to see the enthusiasm the city has
for the team,'' Buss said. ''We couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   With the team's move to a new arena and its charge deep into the
playoffs, the Lakers have recaptured some of the mystique that
surrounded them while winning five championships in the
Magic-and-Kareem era. Those were the best of times for Buss, the
former chemical engineer who bought the Lakers in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' return to prominence started with Buss, who in the
last several years has opened his wallet for top-line talent on the
court and on the bench. He isn't taking credit for the team's
transformation, but he's enjoying it as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after signing Shaquille O'Neal to a huge free-agent
contract and drafting Kobe Bryant, the 1998-99 Lakers were no
closer to a championship than the Lakers teams that floundered
through the 1990s. Los Angeles was trounced in the playoffs' second
round by eventual champion San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, Buss put his money where his heart was,
agreeing to spend $30 million to sign coach Phil Jackson to a
five-year contract. In doing so, he reassigned coach and friend
Kurt Rambis, who clashed with O'Neal and never earned the star's
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' high-priced strategy paid off, as Jackson got the
most out of both O'Neal and Bryant. The Lakers earned the league's
best record for the first time since 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Buss visited the
team locker room to offer encouragement. As usual these days, he
was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it has been great to see where we've gone in the last
four years,'' Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GET LUCKY, STAY HEALTHY: In the NBA, good health is never
taken for granted. In the playoffs, staying injury-free becomes
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Both Indiana and Los Angeles are playing with full rosters of
healthy players, and both are grateful. But Jackson can't name any
one reason why his team has avoided the injury bug when it matters
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of it has to be good fortune,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune didn't smile on the Lakers in Game 2, however. Kobe
Bryant sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and was lost
for the game. It was the first significant injury in months for the
Lakers, who were far from the injury-riddled team that failed to
reach the Finals the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rambis last season, the Lakers were slowed by O'Neal's
problems with his abdominal muscles. Los Angeles suffered injury
problems early this season when Bryant missed the first 15 games
with a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Lakers have had nearly perfect health. A.C.
Green, the NBA's reigning ironman, and Rick Fox played in all 82
games this year, while key contributors O'Neal, Glen Rice, Ron
Harper and Robert Horry missed just 12 combined games because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of it is due to our conditioning and our weight
trainers,'' Jackson said. ''Some of it is our style of basketball,
(but) you can't belittle the fact that fortune plays a role. That's
why you get to the finals in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers also have kept their key performers injury-free.
While Travis Best was the only player not to miss a game, Dale
Davis was the only player among Indiana's top eight scorers to miss
more than three games.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TAKING HIS SHOT: A 32-year-old network administrator from
Wisconsin made just one of the four big-money shots in the
1-800-CALL-ATT Million Dollar Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Christensen, of Marshfield, Wis., was coached by 12-time
All-Star George Gervin in the four shots that could be worth
$1,000,000. Christensen shot during halftime of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first shot, a layup worth $25,000, but missed the
next three as the Staples Center crowd groaned.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a jumper from 12 feet, worth $75,000; a free throw
worth $150,000; and a straightaway 3-pointer worth $750,000.
</P>
<P>

   LOOSE BALLS: Davis arrived at Staples Center on Friday night
carrying his personal belongings in an NBA Finals souvenir
backpack. ... Rose, winner of the NBA's Most Improved Player award,
is the first recipient of the honor to play in the finals the same
year. The award has been given out since 1986. ... Jackson, the
seventh coach in NBA history to take more than one franchise to the
finals, is trying to win his fourth consecutive championship
series. Jackson took last season off after leading the Bulls to
three straight titles. Only Red Auerbach, who took the Celtics to
eight straight titles, has more. ... The biggest name at courtside
for Game 2 was Pamela Anderson. Raptors free agent Tracy McGrady,
who said earlier this week he is unlikely to return to Toronto, sat
one row behind Anderson. One Lakers fan shouted, ''Tracy! Come to
LA! We need you!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Shannon Stewart had four extra-base hits and tied
a career high with four RBIs, and Carlos Delgado hit his AL leading
23rd home run Friday night to lead the Toronto Blue Jays over the
Montreal Expos 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart went 4-for-5 with a two-run homer and three doubles,
tying the team record set by Roy Howell in 1977 and matched by
Damaso Garcia in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who also doubled, has 11 home runs in his last 22 games
and 33 hits in his last 79 at bats (.418).
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (5-5) allowed three runs, six hits and five
walks in seven innings as Toronto improved to 10-4 against its
Canadian rival.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Tucker (0-1) gave up five runs and five hits in three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens' RBI single put the Expos ahead in the fifth, but
Delgado hit a two-run homer in the bottom half and Stewart's
two-run drive made it 4-1 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi scored on a wild pitch in the third, but home runs
by Stevens and Chris Widger cut the lead to 5-3 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush had an RBI single off Felipe Lira in the bottom half
and Stewart's RBI double in the sixth made it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto added six runs with two outs in the seventh on Delgado's
RBI double, Matt Skrmetta's run-scoring wild pitch, Alex Gonzalez's
two-run single, Stewart's RBI double and Bush's run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Attendance of 26,122 was about 7,000 over Toronto's home
average. ... Montreal 3B Mike Mordecai left in the fifth inning
with a left shoulder sprain. ... Toronto 3B Tony Batista returned
to the lineup after missing eight games with a strained left rib
cage. ... Montreal activated Widger from the 15-day disabled list.
Widger missed 13 games with a bruised left hand. ... The Blue Jays'
World Championship banners haven't been seen at SkyDome since May
17. The Blue Jays didn't expect it would take that long to get them
repaired. ... The American national anthem was not played before
the game. ... Two fans ran onto the field in the fifth, one sliding
head first into second base before being taken off the field by
security.

<HEADLINE> Stanford 6, Louisiana-Lafayette 4  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Jason Young gave Stanford the norm: a good
outing and another strong start in the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The junior right-hander gave up six hits and four runs in 7 1-3
innings as Stanford beat Louisiana-Lafayette 6-4 Friday night,
winning its opening game at Rosenblatt Stadium for the sixth time
in its last seven trips.
</P>
<P>
   Young (9-1), who picked up two wins for the Cardinal in last
year's CWS, sprinted off the field and into the dugout after
handing reliever Jeff Bruksch the ball and giving him a pat for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Young received the same from his teammates, despite giving up
three home runs to Louisiana-Lafayette. Bruksch pitched 1 2-3
scoreless innings, striking out three, for his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (48-15) advanced to play Clemson in the winners'
bracket on Sunday. Louisiana-Lafayette (47-19) and San Jose State
will meet in an elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana-Lafayette, which entered the CWS with a 3.20 ERA --
third best in the nation behind Texas (3.13) and Nebraska (3.14) --
still hasn't given up double-digits in runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ragin' Cajuns just didn't score enough against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Young struck out the side in the first inning and retired the
Ragin' Cajuns in order in the third and the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   He looked like he might be in trouble in the seventh, after
giving up the second home run, but he retired the next four
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Nelson then hit a solo shot, his sixth of the season, to
bring Bruksch out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford scored two runs in the third inning and added another
pair in the fourth off starter Justin Gabriel (9-4). Gabriel walked
three of the first four batters and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up four hits, seven walks and four runs in 3 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Damien Alvarado led off the third with a single, advanced to
second on a sacrifice and moved to third on Eric Bruntlett's
infield hit. He scored on Edmund Muth's RBI fielder's choice.
Bruntlett scored on Rick Haydel's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson gave the Cardinal two more runs in the fourth
with a double, bringing home Alvarado and Arik VanZandt. Alvarado
led Louisiana-Lafayette with three hits and two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ragin' Cajuns cut the lead in half with a two-run homer in
the fifth. Haydel, the No. 9 hitter, hit his seventh home run,
scoring Jarvis Larry from first.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford got one of the runs back in the bottom of the fifth
when Joe Borchard hit a solo shot, his 19th of the season, to make
it 5-2. Muth led off the seventh with his 19th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Larry hit a solo shot, his third, in the seventh for
Louisiana-Lafayette.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Damage Cars in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By LEFTERIS PITARAKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. efforts to lay down borders
between Lebanon and Israel hit bumpy terrain Friday, with
protesters stoning U.N. inspection teams, officials raising
objections and villagers threatening to evict peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops on the
border. Several protesters cut the fence and walked through,
drawing warning shots from Israeli guards.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old Palestinian boy was slightly injured in the right
hand Friday evening by Israeli gunfire at the border post across
from Kfar Kila village. He was treated at a hospital, witnesses
said, then taken home to Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp outside Sidon.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians waved national flags at the border point Friday,
and at least four men cut through the border fence and walked
across into Israeli territory. Israeli soldiers aimed their
automatic rifles at the crowd, then into the air and fired at least
10 shots. The men retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The day's troubles highlighted the continuing turbulence along
the border, where there has been no real authority since last
month's Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate task of establishing borders is key to the United
Nations' process of verifying the withdrawal. U.N. peacekeepers
will deploy along the border frontier only after the withdrawal has
been verified. The Lebanese army has yet to move into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, Lebanese and Palestinian civilians and
Lebanese guerrillas have been converging on Kfar Kila to throw
stones at an Israeli border post or take a picture and a peek at
the Jewish state, with which Lebanon technically remains at war.
</P>
<P>
   When a team from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,
known as UNIFIL, reached the area in Israel across from Kfar Kila
on a border verification mission, about 200 people on the Lebanese
side began hurling stones over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Windows of two vehicles, including that of the deputy force
commander, were shattered, according to a U.N. official at UNIFIL
headquarters in the coastal border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came a few hours after Lebanon raised objections to a
new U.N. map of the border. The Lebanese objections resulted in a
one-day postponement of verification efforts on the Lebanese side
of the border, but the work was expected to resume Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFIL officers, joined by Lebanese and Israeli teams on their
respective sides of the frontier, covered part of the border
Thursday, the first day of their verification mission.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has instructed peacekeepers to
complete their verification of Israel's withdrawal as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Friday night at a dinner of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, Annan said: ''I hope
in the next day or so to be able to confirm the total withdrawal of
Israel from Lebanese territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had been told that it was ''amazingly calm'' at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is quiet on the border because people have shown leadership
and have shown restraint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, officials who declined to be
named told The Associated Press that Annan was planning a trip to
the Middle East starting June 15. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard,
however, said the secretary-general won't decide on any visit until
after the Israeli withdrawal is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Another trouble spot for peacekeepers has been the Arab village
of Ghajar, east of Kfar Kila and divided between Lebanon and Israel
by the U.N.-drawn border. Its 1,700 residents, who have Israeli
citizenship, have been rioting and burning tires to protest the
division.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel has said the United Nations placed
one border marker in Ghajar but that Israel had not yet agreed to
divide the village.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lebanese border area of Tabrikha southwest of Kfar Kila,
5,000 Lebanese demonstrated to demand that Israel return seven
villages which, they say, were captured by the Jewish state in 1949
during the first Arab-Israeli war.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 9, Orioles 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Scott Rolen homered in a seven-run second
inning and the Philadelphia Phillies overcame four Baltimore homers
in extending the Orioles' interleague woes with a 9-5 victory
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville homered and drove in three runs for the Phillies,
who improved to 5-2 against the AL. Philadelphia sent 11 men to the
plate in the second inning, scoring all seven runs with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson hit two solo homers and Jeff Conine and Albert
Belle each hit one for the Orioles, who have lost eight of nine to
fall a season-high 10 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's 1-6 interleague record is the worst in the AL. The
Orioles made two errors that led to six unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (6-3) won his third straight start despite giving up
three homers. The left-hander, who allowed four runs and seven hits
in 6 2-3 innings, has already matched his win total from his rookie
season last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, in his first game since coming off the disabled list with
a sprained ankle, homered with two on in the pivotal second inning.
But the key play was an error by Baltimore second baseman Delino
DeShields that led to five unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Two walks and a single loaded the bases for Glanville, who hit a
two-run single off Pat Rapp (4-4). With runners on first and third,
Glanville escaped a rundown when DeShields decided to throw to
third base -- too late to get the runner. DeShields then botched a
grounder, allowing a run to score, and Bobby Abreu singled in a run
before Rolen hit his team-leading 13th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Conine homered in the Orioles' half and Johnson led off the
third with a drive to center. Glanville homered in the fourth to
make it 8-2, but Belle connected and Rich Amaral added an RBI
single in the Orioles' half.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Conine at first base led to an unearned run and a
9-4 lead in the seventh. Johnson hit his 11th of the season, the
fifth in 10 games, in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Baltimore is 13-29 since April 22. ... Glanville is
79-for-230 (.343) in interleague play. ... DeShields' error was his
team-high sixth. ... Belle extended his hitting streak to 11 games.
... Ron Gant got an infield single off Rapp in the sixth, his first
hit against him in 15 career at-bats. ... Wolf has allowed at least
one homer in all but one of his 12 starts.

<HEADLINE> Review: Race A Key In Capital Cases  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN A. LOZANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- At least nine men were sent to death row in Texas
after a psychologist recommended the death penalty partly because
of the defendant's race, a review has found.
</P>
<P>
   The death sentence that prompted the review was thrown out
Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Walter Quijano had testified that Argentine laborer
Victor Hugo Saldano, a convicted murderer, was a future danger to
society because of his Hispanic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn began investigating in April
after his office found problems with the Saldano case.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight other cases, only six may result in further legal
action. In one, the defendant was not a member of a racial group
identified by the psychologist. In another, the prosecution did not
introduce race as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is improper, especially in assessing the death penalty, the
ultimate penalty, to consider someone's race,'' Cornyn said. ''What
we ought to be focusing on is the behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saldano's trial, Quijano listed 24 factors that he said made
Saldano a future threat to society. Among them was ethnicity.
Quijano testified that blacks and Hispanics are over-represented in
prison, and the fact that Saldano is Hispanic ''was a factor
weighing in favor of future dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   To impose a death sentence in Texas, a jury must decide if a
convicted murderer is a future threat.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office reviewed the case files of all
executions in Texas since 1982 and has not found any cases in which
a defendant was executed on the basis of Quijano's testimony about
race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano, the former chief psychologist for the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice, defended his testimony earlier this week,
saying that as a professional scientist, he is duty-bound to report
what he knows to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't make these things up. They ask me questions on the
stand and ask me what the factors (of future dangerousness) are,''
Quijano said. He has testified as an expert witness in more than
100 capital cases, most often as a witness for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have said his comments about race and
criminality can prejudice a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the review did not find a problem with how the death
penalty is administered in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what it says is the system works,'' Cornyn said. ''The
attorney general is one of the checks in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's office sent letters to the local prosecutors and
defense attorneys involved in the six cases that could have been
affected. Three of the inmates are Hispanic, and three are black.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we're in the stages of reviewing these cases and
seeing what further action is needed,'' said Heather Brown, a
spokeswoman for the attorney general's office. ''It's premature for
us to speculate what might happen in these defendants' cases.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Pirates-Royals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Friday night's game pitted two pitchers with similar
stats. The Pirates' Jason Schmidt entered the game with a 2-5
record and a 5.71 ERA. Kansas City hurler Jeff Suppan was 2-5 with
a 5.12 ERA. ... The Pirates split their first six interleague
games, including going 1-2 against Kansas City last weekend in
Pittsburgh. The Pirates were 7-8 last year in interleague play, and
stood 5-6 versus Kansas City entering play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Kansas City recalled RHPs Dan Murray and Brett
Laxton from Triple-A Omaha. Neither pitcher had appeared for Kansas
City this season, but Murray appeared in four games for Kansas City
last season and Laxton appeared in three games for Oakland in 1999.
They replaced RHPs Chris Fussell (15-day DL) and Jason Rakers
(optioned to Omaha). ... Kansas City manager Tony Muser made a
switch in his rotation, replacing Fussell with Jay Witasik (1-4,
6.75 ERA). ... The Royals returned from a 5-4 road trip, their
first winning road trip of the season. They currently stand 13-21
on the road. They were 33-47 on the road in 1999 and a
franchise-worst 29-51 in 1998.
Mets-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK METS: The Mets took early batting practice at Shea
Stadium, then rode two buses to Yankee Stadium. ... Lenny Harris,
playing his first game ever at Yankee Stadium, brought a camera to
the ballpark and planned to visit Monument Park before the first
pitch. He was in the lineup as the DH. 1B Todd Zeile, who had
played at Yankee Stadium, carried a camcorder. ... Rookie leadoff
man Jason Tyner was the school's career leader in hits when he left
Texas A&AMP;M. Third on the list was Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch. ...
Mets starter Al Leiter beat Roger Clemens in a pair of interleague
games last year.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK YANKEES: Derek Jeter batted leadoff for the first time
since May 5, 1999. ... Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' usual leadoff
man, has not played since last Sunday because of a sore left
forearm. ... Knoblauch, who lives in Manhattan, took the subway to
the ballpark. ... Roger Clemens, who started Friday night for the
Yankees, was originally drafted by the Mets in June 1981. ... The
Yankees began the night with a 7-5 edge over the Mets in three
previous years of interleague play.
Red Sox-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Trot Nixon was 0-for-6 lifetime against Greg Maddux
before singling in the first. He entered in a 3-for-26 slump
(.115). ... 1B Brian Daubach got the start thanks to entering
3-for-7 against Maddux. ... Jeff Fassero went 3-6 with a 3.63 ERA
against Atlanta during his six years with the Expos. He last faced
the Braves on Sept. 27, 1996, when he lost 6-4 and gave up seven
hits and three runs in 3 2-3 innings. ... Since interleague play
began three years ago, Boston was 4-8 against the Braves. ... Carl
Everett entered with seven homers and 15 RBI in his previous 10
games. ... SS Nomar Garciaparra had about 30 friends from Atlanta
watching the game as his guests. He played at Georgia Tech in
1992-94.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: RHP Adam Wainwright, chosen by the Braves in the first
round of the amateur draft, was signed to a contract Friday.
Wainwright had previously signed a scholarship to play at Georgia
Tech. ... LHP Steve Avery dropped to 1-2 with Myrtle Beach of the
Class A Carolina League in an 8-1 loss Wednesday night. In the
first game of a doubleheader, Avery gave up two runs on eight hits
in six innings. He struck out five and walked three. Before
reporting to Myrtle Beach and debuting May 27, Avery went 0-5 with
an 8.69 ERA at Double-A Greenville. He has not pitched in the
majors since going on the DL with Cincinnati on July 26. He is
recovering from shoulder surgery.
Phillies-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies 3B Scott Rolen made his first start after
being activated Thursday from the 15-day DL. Rolen was put on the
DL after he severely twisted an ankle while rounding first in
Houston on May 24. His 12 homers leads the team. ... Bench coach
Chuck Cottier missed Friday's game to attend his daughter Cody's
high school graduation. ... The three-day trip to Baltimore is the
Phillies shortest road trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles optioned LHP B.J. Ryan to Triple-A
Rochester and recalled RHP Gabe Molina. Ryan was 1-3 with a 7.91
ERA. ... Baltimore started a three-game series against Philadelphia
looking to build on its 8-4 record versus the Phillies over three
years of interleague play. ... With 15 blown saves through
Thursday, the Orioles are on pace to break the record of 31 set by
the 1998 St. Louis Cardinals.
Brewers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Milwaukee entered Friday's game 0-3 in interleague
play, being swept by Cleveland. ... Pitcher Allen Levrault, who
replaced Jeff D'Amico on the roster, is the youngest Brewers player
at age 22 and the 11th youngest player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The first 5,000 fans in attendance Friday night
received a Harmon Killebrew bobble-head doll, the first of four
such promotions by the Twins this season. ... Opponents entered
Friday's game hitting .365 against Twins starter Sean Bergman.
Cubs-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS: The All-Star Game is still a month away, but Cubs
manager Don Baylor is already touting his players if Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox is listening. ''To me, Jon Lieber has pitched
well enough to be on the All-Star team,'' Baylor said. ''I think
Eric Young has earned a spot on the All-Star team. And, of course,
Sammy. That's automatic.'' ... Despite a blister on the middle
finger of his right hand, Ismael Valdes still plans to pitch
Sunday. ''Last time I talked to him,'' Baylor said. ''That was on
Wednesday. I didn't talk to him today because I didn't want him to
change his mind.'' ... The Cubs acquired OF Brant Brown before the
game in a three-way deal with Texas and Florida. The Marlins sent
Brown to the Rangers for RHP Chuck Smith, and then Texas dealt
Brown to the Cubs for OF Dave Martinez. ''I knew if I didn't play
that much here, there'd be a team out there I could play for on a
regular basis,'' said Martinez, who just came to the Cubs on May
12.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO WHITE SOX: If the White Sox are a little more low-keyed
about the Crosstown Series this year, there's good reason. Their
next 14 games are against the Cleveland Indians and the New York
Yankees. Cleveland is in second place behind the White Sox in the
AL Central, and the Yankees lead the AL East. ... While his team is
playing for more than city pride this season, manager Jerry Manuel
knows how big the Crosstown Series is to Chicagoans. ''The fans
really want this,'' he said. ''The more series of this magnitude
that you can put yourself in early, the better yardstick you have
of evaluating your club.'' ... At 35-23, the White Sox may have the
AL's best record, but Manuel still wonders how his young team will
fare as the season wears on. ''I would hope they believe in
themselves,'' he said. ''We have to be careful in the sense it's a
long season. We have to stay at a level so if adversity hits, we
can overcome and not get fragmented or fractured. ... I know there
has to be some testing.'' ... The White Sox have agreed to terms
with 10 players from this year's draft: OF Bo Ivy (sixth round); OF
Eddie Young (seventh round); 2B Mike Spidale (12th round), OF Derek
Wigginton (13th round); LHP James Sweeney (14th round); RHP Brian
Graham (16th round); RHP Curtis Young (18th round); LHP Brad Murray
(27th round); RHP Kyle Bohannan (28th round); and OF Anthony
Monegan (29th round).
Reds-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Jack McKeon managed his 1,400th game Friday night.
He entered 716-683 including 237-209 with the Reds. McKeon has also
managed Kansas City, Oakland and San Diego. The 69-year-old McKeon
began his major league career with the Royals in 1973. ... Ken
Griffey Jr. entered Friday's game in a 9-for-60 (.150) slump since
May 17 when his averaged peaked at .243. A career .299 hitter,
Griffey is hitting just .215 and .204 with runners in scoring
position. ... Sean Casey, who hit .332 last season, entered
Friday's game with a .219 average and had just 7 hits in his last
45 at-bats. Casey, traded by the Indians for Dave Burba in 1998,
batted .208 with no RBIs against Cleveland in '99.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: 2B Roberto Alomar was back in the lineup after being
hit in the helmet with a throw Thursday in Boston. He was forced to
leave with dizziness and nausea. Alomar wasn't sure when he would
be able to watch his fiancee, Mary Pierce, play in the French Open
final. Because of the time difference, the match will be shown on
tape delay in the U.S. ''I'll probably be sleeping or here when
she's playing,'' Alomar said. ... RHP Jaret Wright, placed on the
DL with inflammation in his right shoulder, will fly to California
on Monday to get a second opinion from Angels orthopedist Dr. Lewis
Yocum. An MRI revealed a small tear in the labrum in Wright's
shoulder. The Indians are hoping rest can cure Wright and that he
won't need surgery. ... RHPs Paul Shuey and Charles Nagy are both
recovering faster than expected following surgeries. Shuey, who had
hip surgery, is throwing pain free on flat ground and said he
should be able to try it off a mound soon. Nagy had bone chips
removed from his right elbow last month and said he would throw off
a mound on Monday.
Expos-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos activated C Chris Widger from the 15-day DL.
Widger missed 13 games with a bruised left hand. The Expos placed C
Lenny Webster on the 15-day DL on Thursday. Webster has tendinitis
in the left shoulder. ... The Expos have nine players, including
seven pitchers, on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: 3B Tony Batista returned to lineup after missing eight
games with a strained left rib cage. ... 2B Homer Bush, who was
activated from the DL on June 6, returned to the lineup. Bush had a
strained right hip. ... Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said RHP Joey
Hamilton would return to the club in about a month. Hamilton
continues to rehab from offseason shoulder surgery.
Cardinals-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire, who has homered in two of the three new
ballparks which opened this season, is attempting to add Comerica
Park to his list. McGwire and Fred McGriff are tied for the
all-time lead in number of parks homered in, each with 36. McGriff
went homerless during a three-game series in Detroit in April.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Deivi Cruz went into the weekend as the AL's toughest
batter to strike out. Cruz is averaging a strikeout every 15.3
plate appearances.
Marlins-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Acquired RHP pitcher Chuck Smith from Texas as part of
a three-way trade that sent OF Brant Brown to the Chicago Cubs, who
sent OF Dave Martinez to the Rangers. The Marlins also traded OF
Danny Bautista to the Arizona Diamondbacks for INF Andy Fox. ...
Florida has dominated its series against Tampa Bay, going 8-2 the
past two seasons while compiling a 110-204 mark against the rest of
baseball. ... SS Alex Gonzalez returned to the lineup after missing
two games to work on his hitting. He's batting .163 this season
after being an All-Star last year.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Injured DH Jose Canseco took batting practice, but
still isn't able to run on a strained left foot that's sidelined
him since May 27. ''It's getting better. ... But until he can get
on it and run, he's not going to be able to play,'' manager Larry
Rothschild said. ... Greg Vaughn, slowed the past two weeks by a
sore right hamstring, was in the lineup as the DH. It was just his
third start in the past 13 games. The Devil Rays were 5-5 without
him. ... RHP Juan Guzman, on the DL since April 8 with right
shoulder tendinitis, made a rehab start for Triple-A Durham.
Rangers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: OF Gabe Kapler was activated from the DL and started in
center field. Kapler went on DL May 2 with a partially torn right
quadriceps. He was hitting .200 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 24
games. ... The Rangers traded RHP Chuck Smith to the Florida
Marlins in a three-way deal that sent OF Dave Martinez from the
Chicago Cubs to Texas. The Cubs received OF Brant Brown from
Florida. Martinez was expected to arrive in Denver on Saturday.
Smith was not on Texas' 40-man roster, so the Rangers will have to
remove someone to make room for Martinez. ... Friday's starter LHP
Kenny Rogers had pitched into the seventh inning in all 11 starts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: OF Larry Walker came off the DL and was in the
starting lineup for the first time since May 10. Walker, a six-time
Gold Glove award winner in right field, played left field to reduce
the pressure on his right elbow. Walker went on the DL because of
stress irritation in the elbow. ... Optioned Bubba Carpenter to
Triple-A Colorado Springs to make room for Walker. ... The Rockies
play 18 of their next 24 games at home, where they were 19-6
entering Friday's play. ... OF Tom Goodwin, who played for Texas
from 1997-99, faced his former team for the first time. ''It'll be
a little different. I got my first taste of the playoffs over there
in Texas. You're going to have a little extra emotion because your
first postseason experience is always special. It's not a hate or
anything like that.''
Angels-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Twelve of Anaheim's last 18 victories were
come-from-behind wins. Ten of the Angels' wins this season have
come in their final at bat. ... Anaheim leads the AL in hitting
(.294) and hits (610) and is second in home runs. ... Darin Erstad
entered Friday's game on an eight-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Arizona traded utility man Andy Fox to Florida for
outfielder Danny Bautista. Fox had been with Diamondbacks
throughout the franchise's 2{-year history and played every
position except pitcher and catcher. ... Arizona activated Travis
Lee and he was in the starting lineup at first base. Lee had been
out with a groin strain. ... The Diamondbacks' five-game losing
streak going into Friday night's game was the longest since early
in the team's inaugural 1998 season.
Athletics-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Grand slams in consecutive games gave the A's seven in
59 games this season, already within one of the franchise record
set in 1932 and matched last year. ... Entering his start Friday
night, Tim Hudson had lost only four of his 33 career starts. ...
Oakland has spent six days in sole possession of first place since
May 12, the first time the A's have been atop the A.L. West
post-April since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: LHP Carlos Perez was pitching for his roster spot
Friday. The very real threat to his job is veteran Orel Hershiser,
whose routine at Single-A San Bernardino was adjusted to put him on
the same schedule as Perez. Hershiser also started Friday night.
... 3B Adrian Beltre (strained right hamstring) is eligible to come
off the DL Monday for the opener of a key series against Arizona,
but is still only running at half-speed and is not likely to be
activated. ... Dave Hansen's pinch-hit homer Thursday night was his
eighth with the Dodgers, tying Lee Lacy for the Los Angeles record.
John Frederick owns the franchise mark of nine.
Mariners-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners played their first game at Pacific Bell
Park, the Giants' new bayfront stadium. Heading in the contest, the
Mariners are 7-21 overall in their first games in a stadium.
Seattle has lost its last three ''first'' games, losing to Detroit
at Comerica Park, their own Safeco Field as well as to Arizona at
Bank One Ballpark. The last time the Mariners won a first game in a
stadium was in Tampa Bay on May 28, 1998. ... The AL Mariners are
no strangers to the NL. Fourteen players on their team have seen
time in the other league: David Bell, Mike Cameron, John Halama,
Rickey Henderson, Stan Javier, Tom Lampkin, John Mabry, Mark
McLemore, Jose Mesa, Jamie Moyer, John Olerud, Jose Paniagua, Brett
Tomko, and Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Entering Friday night's game, the Giants' Barry
Bonds (25 homers, 47 RBIs) and Jeff Kent (17 homers, 55 RBIs) are
the leading home run and RBI tandem in the NL with a combined total
of 42 home runs and 102 RBIs. ... San Francisco's Felipe Crespo
leads the NL with nine pinch-hits (in 19 at-bats). Overall, the
team's pinch-hitters rank second in the league, batting .279
(17-for-61) with a homer and 16 RBIs.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: RHP Scott Elarton, scheduled to start Saturday night,
has no decisions and a 5.27 ERA in four career appearances against
San Diego. He will make his second start against San Diego this
season and the third in his career.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres signed 17-year-old right-hander Wilmer
Villatoro of La Union, El Salvador. Bill Clark, the Padres'
international scouting supervisor, says it's the first time a
player from El Salvador has signed a pro contract. Villatoro will
be assigned either to Peoria of the Arizona Rookie League or the
Dominican summer league. ... Dave Winfield, who's been elected to
the Padres' Hall of Fame, will be in town Saturday for a news
conference and to take batting practice. He'll be inducted in a
pregame ceremony on Aug. 19. Winfield made the jump straight from
the University of Minnesota to the Padres in 1973 and played in San
Diego for eight years before signing as a free agent with the New
York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Va. Man Convicted In Fatal Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- A man was convicted of arson and six counts
of murder Friday for his role in a boardinghouse fire that was set
to avenge the death of his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The jury later recommended that Brian E. Jackson serve 20 years
for each of the first-degree murder convictions, and five years for
the arson conviction. Jackson will be formally sentenced July 24,
and the judge could increase the sentence to the maximum of seven
life terms in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Chris Kowalczuk said he was disappointed with
the verdict but did not say if he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Jackson and another man, Michael ''Jay''
Clements, set the May 18, 1998, fire because one of the residents
of the house, Willie Caldwell, had been charged hours earlier with
killing Jackson's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Clements pleaded guilty to arson last year. Caldwell, who was
aquitted of murder, was not home when the fire was set.

<HEADLINE> KR Mitchell Signs With Eagles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Brian Mitchell, the NFL's career leader in
combined kickoff and punt return yardage, agreed to a two-year
contract with the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   He was cut by Washington last week after 10 seasons with the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have something to prove,'' Mitchell said Friday. ''I feel
like I'm in the best shape of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of his new deal were not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is expected to be the primary punt return and kick
return man for the Eagles, and the team's third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   He is the fourth unrestricted free agent the Eagles have signed
since February, following offensive tackle Jon Runyan, linebacker
Carlos Emmons and fullback Stanley Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell averaged 8.3 yards per punt return and 20.8 yards per
kickoff return last season, subpar numbers for him. He also caught
31 passes.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the premier return men in the NFL in the 1990s,
becoming just the third played to lead the league in combined net
yards in three straight seasons, 1994-96 -- Jim Brown (1958-61) and
Gale Sayers (1965-67) are the others.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was named to the Pro Bowl after the 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Royals 6, Pirates 5, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Reboulet drove in four runs,
including a game-winning RBI single in the 10th inning, to lead the
Kansas City Royals to a 6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reboulet hit a three-run double in the fourth, and Mike Sweeney
added four hits, including his 13th homer, as Kansas City returned
home from a nine-game road trip with a win.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who have an AL-beat 18-7 record at home, just
completed their first winning road trip of the season, going 5-4 in
Boston, Pittsburgh and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   They kept it up at home, despite blowing a 5-4 lead in the
ninth. Brian Giles' second homer tied the game off Jerry Spradlin
(2-0), who blew his third save in nine chances. The Royals have
allowed a major league-leading 103 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez doubled off Jason Christiansen (1-5) to lead off the
10th inning, and went to third on Johnny Damon's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Reboulet followed with an opposite field line-drive single to
give the Royals their 14th win in their last at-bat, including nine
''walk-off'' wins.
</P>
<P>
   Giles hit a leadoff homer in the seventh off Jeff Suppan to cut
Kansas City's lead to 5-3. It was the 19th home run allowed by
Suppan, most in the AL. Suppan allowed three runs and six hits in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney hit a solo homer in the first inning off Jason Schmidt
to give Kansas City a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pirates tied it in the third on Warren Morris' RBI
double, the Royals scored four unearned runs in the fourth, with
help from an error by first baseman Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   Reboulet drove in three with a bases-loaded double and Sweeney
followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a native of Kansas City, Kan., hit his 100th career homer
leading off the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sweeney has five four-hit games this season. ... Kansas
City's Dave McCarty extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a
single in the fifth. Joe Randa had his 10-game hitting streak
snapped. ... The Pirates have at least one extra-base hit in all 58
games this season. ... The Pirates turned a double play in the
third inning, extending their league lead to 67, including 14 in
the last 11 games. ... The Royals began a stretch of 18 of their
next 24 games at home. They just finished a stretch of 21 out of 27
games on the road. They were 14-13 over that stretch. ... Kansas
City GM Herk Robinson said no decision has been made regarding
surgery for LHP Jose Rosado, who has been on the DL since May 1
with tendinitis in his left shoulder. ... Kansas City is 12-6 in
one-run games.

<HEADLINE> Charges Recommended in Frat Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Campus police recommended criminal
charges Friday against two University of Florida roommates in the
death of a fraternity brother who took a narcotic painkiller stolen
from a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men told police he gave an Oxycodone tablet to Mathew
A. Kaminer, 19, of Boca Raton, who died at their Alpha Epsilon Pi
house April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the drug came from the man's roommate, who police
said stole a prescription while he worked at a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report indicated Kaminer had taken a high dose of
the powerful painkiller, which is often used after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A therapeutic range for a standard medical dosage is 10 to 100,
and 200 is a toxic level; Kaminer's reading was 374, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney's office will decide whether to file charges.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant was lost for the game with a
sprained left ankle, but Shaquille O'Neal helped pick up the slack
Friday night with 23 points and 18 rebounds as the Los Angeles
Lakers led Indiana 73-69 at the end of the third period of Game 2
of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant rolled his ankle when he shot a jumper and then landed on
the foot of Indiana's Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the team's second-leading scorer, went to the locker
room to have X-rays. They were negative, but a team spokesman said
he would be held out of the rest of the game as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   His status for Sunday night's Game 3 was uncertain. Los Angeles
was trying to take a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started slowly but finished the first half with 15 points
and 10 rebounds, then had eight points and eight rebounds in the
third quarter as the Lakers, up 52-49 at halftime, held the lead
heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles guard Glen Rice, nearly invisible in Game 1, had 18
points, going 4-of-5 from 3-point range, through three quarters as
he and Ron Harper, who had 15 points, made up for Bryant's absence.
</P>
<P>
   The game was close almost all the way, with never more than five
points separating the teams, and the lead changed hands 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had 22 points and Reggie Miller 19 through three quarters
to keep the Pacers in the thick of it. Miller 1-of-16 from the
floor in Game 1, was 7-of-14 through the first three periods of
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers fulfilled their promise to foul O'Neal more
frequently, and the notoriously bad free-throw shooter was 9-for-23
from the line heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Rose enjoyed an outstanding first half for the Pacers, scoring
18 points of his points. Dale Davis had nine first-half points and
six rebounds for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 28 at the end of the first period, with
Rose scoring 10 and Miller eight for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made three of his first four shots in the second game. He
was hampered by foul trouble and had 10 points in 12 minutes of
play by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper made all five of his shots to lead the Lakers with 11
points in the first, but was scoreless in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who won the opener 104-87, led 22-20 when Bryant
left the game. They made another basket before timeout was called
with 3:05 left in the period.

<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks signed free-agent
wide receivers Isaiah Mustafa and Rickey Garrett, and rookie
linebacker Isaiah Kacyvenski on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also re-signed offensive lineman Frank Beede, who
played in 40 games with the team since signing as an undrafted
rookie free agent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa played on the practice squads of the Oakland Raiders and
Cleveland Browns in 1999, and led the Barcelona Dragons of the NFL
Europe League with 31 receptions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett was an undrafted rookie free agent from Illinois State,
where as a three-year starter he had 162 receptions for 2,558 yards
and 22 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Kacyvenski, the first of two fourth-round draft choices this
year, was a four-year starter at Harvard, where he finished with a
school-record 395 tackles.

<HEADLINE> UN Women's Meeting Nears Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. delegates meeting in a special
session were deadlocked late Friday over abortion and other key
issues contained in a plan to accelerate progress toward women's
equality.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly negotiators working into the night did
agree on several other issues. If a final agreement is reached, the
plan would provide tougher measures to combat AIDS, trafficking of
women and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But with a midnight Friday deadline looming, representatives
from more than 180 nations were still meeting behind closed doors,
trying to reach consensus on many of the same issues that dominated
the landmark 1995 U.N. women's conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.N. officials said they were not expecting the final
document to go much beyond the Beijing platform for action on
sexual and reproductive matters. And it was unclear whether there
would be consensus on a final document.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy fight in Beijing, references to sexual
orientation -- which the Vatican and conservative Islamic and
Catholic countries vehemently oppose -- were dropped. The term
''sexual rights'' was never included though the platform does state
that women have the right to ''decide freely and responsibly on
matters related to their sexuality ... free of coercion,
discrimination and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States also remained at odds with Cuba over a plank
on the detrimental effects of sanctions on women, which delegates
said Iraq also supports. Washington maintains embargoes against
both Cuba and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said the language the Cuban delegation wants in
the document is not relevant to the issues facing women.
''Furthermore, it is language Washington can't live with, and is an
attempt by Cuba to dictate policies on another country,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Cuban delegation, Vilma Espin, said the United
States was preventing the conference from telling the truth about
the deaths of women and children caused by its economic embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western nations have been at odds with the Vatican and a
handful of Islamic and Catholic countries -- including Libya,
Algeria, Iran, Sudan and Nicaragua -- over parts of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and a number of conservative countries object to the
Beijing platform's reference to nontraditional families, which they
view as an implied blessing of homosexual unions, single parents
and couples living together out of wedlock. And a coalition of
anti-abortion and religious activists have blamed rich Western
nations for pushing ''radical language'' on abortion, sexual rights
and homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright voiced concern Thursday that the final document
might retreat from the ambitious 150-page platform adopted in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the final text was complete, U.N. officials and
delegates were saying there would be no rollback of the Beijing
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence in the text that seems likely to be
adopted that there is any backward movement on any of the Beijing
language, and in certain areas we are very heartened to see a
strengthening of the Beijing language,'' said U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General Angela King, a special adviser on the advancement
of women.
</P>
<P>
   She cited tougher action to address the trafficking of women and
girls, the impact of AIDS on women including AIDS education
programs for women, calls on governments to set target dates to
eradicate illiteracy and ensure education for all girls and
education programs to enable men to engage in safe, responsible
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have also agreed on strong planks calling for
prosecution of all forms of domestic violence, now including
marital rape, and for the first time in an international consensus
document, the traditional practices of forced marriage and
so-called honor killings are addressed. The draft text calls for
laws to eradicate these human rights violations.
