<HEADLINE> Chinese, Luxembourg Premiers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in their
talks Friday to further promote friendly ties of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In their two-hour talks, they exchanged views in a friendly and
in-depth manner, on bilateral relations, and on international and
regional issues of common interest. They noted they were satisfied
with the growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed belief that his visit would serve to deepen mutual
understanding and further enhance the China-Luxembourg friendly
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
The premier stated that 25 years had passed since the
establishment of Sino-Luxembourg diplomatic ties in 1972, and that
bilateral friendly cooperative ties had brought about great
progress in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of high-level visits had been increasing, while
cooperation in economy, trade, science, technology and culture had
been fruitful, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the long-term, stable development of
bilateral friendly cooperative relations, on the basis of the
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, not
only complied with the fundamental interests of the two nations,
but was also conducive to the establishment of a new Asia-Europe
partnership.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its ties with Luxembourg, Li
said. Although the social systems, historical and cultural
background of the two nations were different, both sides cherished
a common aspiration to safeguard world peace and to promote the
economic advancement.
</P>
<P>
"I hold the belief that under the joint effort of both sides,
the China-Luxembourg relationship will surely continue to achieve
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade ties, Li elaborated that in
recent years, this relationship cherished a trend for good
development. Bilateral trade was growing in a smooth way, and
Luxembourg's investment in China was still maintaining a rising
momentum, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He said the traditional cooperation in metallurgy, finance and
health care was continuing to expand, and the animal husbandry
cooperation which the two countries initiated last year was also
advancing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg government has provided loans to China often and
this was conducive to enhancing bilateral cooperation and
strengthening Luxembourg's competitiveness in the China market,
the premier added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Luxembourg economy as of special features, and
in some fields leading the world, Li expressed hope that the local
enterprises would take full advantage of China's broad markets and
great economic potential, and work to push the Sino-Luxembourg
economic and trade cooperation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Juncker agreed with Li's viewpoint on
Luxembourg-China ties. He said the present rapid political and
economic progress in China had drawn world attention.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China still had a lot of difficulties to
overcome, but Luxembourg believed the road China was taking was
bright and had provided a sound base for the
Luxembourg-China cooperation.

<P>
Luxembourg-China economic and trade cooperation has bright
prospects, Juncker said.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers also compared notes on the recent financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier expressed belief that it will take some
time to recover from the losses caused by the financial turmoil in
east Asia, but the turmoil was only a temporary block in the
development process of the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that east Asia will further display its economic
vitality and enjoy an optimistic future after summing up
experiences and making necessary readjustments," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China closely followed the financial turmoil in the area and
showed deep concern over countries affected economically.
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual benefit
and joint development and its persistent stand of forging
good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries, the Chinese
government had taken part in the financial aid package inaugurated
by the International Monetary Fund, Li said. China had offered
what it could to help.
</P>
<P>
China cherishes a positive approach towards strengthening
regional cooperation and has actively studied the cooperation
mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to join hands with other Asian countries in
maintaining the security of the regional economy and contributing
to the development of local economies, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg prime minister said his country holds the belief
that China should join the World Trade Organization (WTO) because
China holds an important position and plays a significant role in
the world trade system.
</P>
<P>
During the Asian financial crisis, Juncker said, the measures
the Chinese government had taken and the speeches the Chinese
leaders had made proved that China, rather than just watching with
its hands folded, took a responsible attitude and played a unique
role for stability.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy for China to make this contribution at a time
when it itself is facing difficulty in a modernization drive, he
said. Luxembourg appreciated China's effort and contribution.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stated that China's approach toward joining the WTO is
clear and persistent, and it had made unremitting efforts to this
end.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) countries, including Luxembourg, had time
and again expressed support for China's accession to the WTO. "We
appreciate this support," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier hoped the EU would materialize its
support in solving some concrete problems and help conclude the
accession negotiations at an early date, with a flexible,
down-to-earth and constructive approach.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO would further the trade relations
between China and EU countries, including Luxembourg, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a briefing on the prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong after its return to its motherland in July 1997, a result of
the policies of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", he said.

<HEADLINE> Estate Strike in Sri Lanka Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day estate strike in
Sri Lanka was called off by trade unions Friday following a
lengthy discussion between the concerned parties here.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga presided over the talks between
the trade unions and the Employers' Federation and the 23
management companies Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed to pay the workers in the tea industry a daily
wage of 95 rupees (1.53 U.S. dollars) and a price share supplement
of six rupees, bringing the total daily wage to 101 rupees (1.63
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trade unions appealed to all the strikers to return to work
from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strike by some 600,000 strong estate workers in tea and
rubber plantations started Thursday last week, the day after the
country ceremonially celebrated its 50th anniversary of
independence.
</P>
<P>
Strikers were asking a wage hike from current 83 rupees (1.34
dollars) per day to 105 rupees (1.69 dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga intervened and convened a meeting Tuesday
in an effort to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
Earlier discussions between the interested parties and Labor
Minister John Seneviratne failed to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
The strike had brought tea plucking and rubber tapping in Sri
Lanka to a virtual halt.
</P>
<P>
The last strike by estate workers in April 1996, which lasted
one week, was estimated to have cost the government 500 million
rupees (8.1 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Slams Arafat's Warning About Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- In a counter-warning to the
Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Friday it would bring disaster on themselves if they resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued the warning here when he spoke to a visiting
delegation of Jewish community in the United States. He was
commenting on the warning given by Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat that the Palestinian people would
renew intifada (uprising) against Israel if the peace process
collapses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday at the ceremony held in Ramallah to mark the
50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his
pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999
at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final
peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would struggle to establish an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Netanyahu launched a scathing attack on the PNA
for violating the Oslo peace accords. He condemned the PNA for
failing to prevent pro-Iraqi demonstrations, refusing to revise
the Covenant and glorifying terrorists. He also warned that
Israel will scuttle the Oslo accords if Arafat declares
independence.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of war of words came at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over
Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed last
January, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the
three-phased redeployment by September last year. But Israel has
delayed the move due to a dispute over the scope of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators concluded their
talks in Washington Friday, without achieving any breakthrough in
breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides only agreed to continue to talks next week in the
region under the supervision of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward
Walker.

<P>
Juncker said that during the first Asia-Europe Summit Meeting
(ASEM) in Bangkok in 1996, people still had doubts about whether
China would be able to recover the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong smoothly, and guarantee a smooth transfer.
</P>
<P>
But facts have proved that China had kept its promise and its
policies had proved to be correct. Juncker said that Hong
Kong has smoothly returned to the fold of China and that the
post-return development proved to be good.
</P>
<P>
Li and Juncker also changed views on the forthcoming second
ASEM Meeting, scheduled to be held in London in early April.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that various post-ASEM activities have
been unfolding and have basically upheld the momentum of
cooperation forged during the Bangkok ASEM.
</P>
<P>
The next ASEM will exert an important influence on forging
Asian-European ties oriented towards the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the London ASEM will start from the consensus
reached during the Bangkok ASEM and keep the cooperative momentum
in the sector of trade and economy so as to promote Asia-Europe
cooperation," said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Juncker agreed with Li's views, adding that Europe and China
should further their cooperation on the basis of their current
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Upon request, Li Peng briefed the Luxembourg leaders on the
economic circumstances in China and the related policies.
</P>
<P>
Juncker also briefed Li on Luxembourg's view of the development
of the 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Li and Juncker attended the signing ceremony
of the Annex to the Scheduled All Cargo Services Agreement between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting and the signing ceremony were Director
of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council Liu Huaqiu,
Governor of Guangdong Province Lu Ruihua, Chinese Ambassador to
Luxembourg Shi Yanhua, Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan,
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the
State Council Lu Congmin, Vice-Minister of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China Wang Li'an and Special Assistant Wan
Jingchang.
</P>

Economy Minister Robert Goebbels, Transport Minister Mady
Delvaux-Stehres and Pierre-Louis Torenz, Luxembourg Ambassador to

<HEADLINE> 153 Canadian Children Go Missing Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 56,000 children were
reported missing in Canada in 1996, an average of 153 a day,
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number is being described as an alarming sign of the
increasing disintegration of the Canadian family.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missing children were young teen-ageers who ran
away from home, often fleeing physical or sexual violence at the
hands of family members.
</P>
<P>
"Family are just not what they used to be," said a clergyman
who was involved in efforts to help the lost children.
</P>
<P>
A Statistics Canada report said that 56,122 reports of missing
children under the age of 18 were made to the police in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And the figure does not include the estimated thousands of
children who ran away or are thrown out and are not reported
missing, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the children reported missing had run away, and
most of these were found within a few days.
</P>
<P>
But a majority of them ran away again, and ended up on the
street.
</P>
<P>
Though there is no official figure of young Canadians living on
the streets, some charity groups believe that the number could be
as high as 100,000.

<HEADLINE> FAO Calls for Aid to Combat Livestock Diseases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has appealed to international donor community
to provide assistance in combating livestock diseases in
northeastern Kenya and southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A press release reaching here Friday said that the combined
effects of flooding and livestock diseases had killed tens of
thousands of animals in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The livestock are at risk from a number of the most serious
transboundary infectious diseases," the release said, adding that
there was concern that the epidemic diseases may spread to
southern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The most serious diseases are Rift Valley fever, rinderpest
and peste des petits ruminants which could develop into epidemic
proportions in the region if unchecked, it added.
</P>
<P>
The combined effect of livestock diseases will impact severely
on food security and human welfare which have been seriously
affected by loss of crop production caused by unseasonal heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
The release said that Rift Valley fever had caused widespread
abortions among goats and camels and this was expected to result
in shortages of milk in coming months in the affected areas where
crops had been already destroyed by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of these epidemic diseases followed the recent
prolonged heavy rains during the past three months which has
provided ideal conditions for mosquitoes, midges and other
disease-transmitting flies.
</P>
<P>
FAO appealed for 2.5 million U.S. Dollars for coordinating the
systematic treatment of affected animals and control of
potentially epidemic diseases.

HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Organization
of African Unity Robert Mugabe Friday praised the Nigerian-led
ECOMOG forces for capturing Freetown, the capital city of Sierra
Leone from junta leader Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
About 25 Sierra Leonean junta members were captured on Friday
by the forces of the Economic Community Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG will remain in Sierra Leone until they are certain
that all resistance is gone," said Mugabe, adding "it may take
time, but all the same we want to say well done to them."
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe National News Agency after officially
opening the Zimbabwe International Travel Expo here that the
OAU would ensure that the toppled government of President Tejan
Kabbah, currently exiled in Guinea, be returned to power.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Nigeria had a moral obligation or right to oust
the junta from power taking into consideration that President
Sani Abacha went into power through undemocratic means, Mugabe
said Nigeria must draw a lesson from this mission.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also commended the efforts of OAU through the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG to restore
democracy in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Russia's Opposition Won't Stop U.S. Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that Russia's objections to military strikes on Iraq
are a concern to the United States but it will not stop its forces
going ahead with military action.
</P>
<P>
"'Nyet' is not 'No' for the United States," Clinton said at a
White House ceremony to swear in a new surgeon general, referring
to the opposition of Russia to any military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Nyet means "no" in Russian. Joined by France, China and other
countries, Moscow has been opposing the use of force against Iraq
since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he understands Russia's concerns and said the
United States is exhausting every possible diplomatic route. But
"we don't believe it is acceptable, if diplomacy fails, to walk
away," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev
scolded visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen for the U.S.
"uncompromising" position in the stand-off with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Stage Pro-Iraq Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) - Over one thousand Jordanians
Friday took to the streets in downtown Amman, shouting pro-Iraq
and anti-U.S. slogans, despite a recent government ban on
rallies.
</P>
<P>
Officials from several pro-Iraq organizations organized prayers
around the Al-Hussein Mosque to stage the demonstration at around
14:00 o'clock local time (12:00 GMT), local policemen at the scene
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Riot police armed with clubs quickly sealed off the roads and
managed to prevent the demonstration from extending to other
areas.
</P>
<P>
There were frictions between the demonstrators and the
police. Injuries were seen, but no death has been reported
yet.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 people were arrested, including some women,
police said.
</P>
<P>
At least four opposition organization leaders were arrested,
including Hamza Mansour, spokesman for the Islamic Action Front,
one of the major opposition parties in the country, according to
police sources.
</P>
<P>
Among the detainees was a reporter for the French news agency
AFP. Police confiscated videotapes from some cameramen.
</P>
<P>
"We were afraid that some people might take advantage of the
rally to make trouble for the city, so we decided to stop it," a
policeman told Chinese reporters.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters hovered over the area during the demonstrations
which lasted for almost one hour.
</P>
<P>
Popular support for Iraq remains strong in Jordan, despite
strained Jordanian-Iraqi ties and Amman's closer links with
Washington since it signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Jordanians backed Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein for his anti-Israeli stand, semi-official Jordan Times
said on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States threatened to use force to force Iraq
to comply with all the demands of the United Nations Special
Commission's (UNSCOM) arms inspectors, pro-Iraq sentiment has
become ever stronger in this country.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent social disorder, the Jordanian government
on February 10 declared a ban on mass rallies or movement in the
kingdom. Most of the opposition parties, who occupy 23 seats in
the 80-member Lower House of Parliament, support Iraq and oppose
ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Fights to Remain in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel
McLaughlin vowed on Friday his party would fight to remain in the
peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"There are absolutely no grounds for the expulsion of Sinn Fein
from the talks. Sinn Fein is not involved in the killing of
anyone," local reports quoted McLaughlin as saying in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, is
facing the threat of expulsion from the peace process after
Northern Ireland police found evidence of IRA's involvement in the
killings of two Protestant men early this week.
</P>
<P>
IRA declared a ceasefire last July to enable Sinn Fein to gain
a seat in the multi-party peace talks which started last September
and planned to end in May.
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin underlined the talks could not succeed without the
participation of Sinn Fein and could be irreparably damaged if the
party was expelled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said
the question of Sinn Fein's future in the talks would be discussed
when they reopened next week.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the talks process is crucial and we want to do all
we can to keep the peace talks going," Mowlam told reporters after
a meeting with local councillors in the Northern Ireland town of
Enniskillen.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of peace talks, which involve the British and
Irish governments and eight Protestant and Catholic parties, any
party which has a guerrilla wing actively engaged in violence can
be expelled. A pro-British paramilitary group has been expelled
from the peace talks recently for its involvement in the revengeful
murders in Northern Ireland.

over what to do if Iraq refuses to bow to diplomatic pressure.
</P>
<P>

be Saddam Hussein's decision, not mine," Clinton insisted, adding
that he had "bent over backwards for months" to find a diplomatic
solution.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Give Replies to Turkish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece expressed its
willingness Friday to give replies to the five-point proposal made
by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to resolve the disputes
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that although the Turkish proposal
contained "nothing new," Greece would examine it and give replies
to Ankara next week.
</P>
<P>
Remarks by Kranidiotis show that Greece has slightly changed
its stance towards Cem's proposal Thursday, which includes a
high-level meeting to define problems areas in the Aegean Sea,
formalize principles of good-neighborly relations and promote
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas flatly
rejected the Turkish proposal, saying that Athens could not accept
it just because it included issues which were already being dealt
with and reiterated the standing Turkish position for dialogue on
all issues.
</P>
<P>
As for the high-level meeting between Foreign Ministries of
Greece and Turkey by the end of March, Kranidiotis said that no
one rejected such contacts on issues of cooperation within the
framework of international organizations, economic cooperation,
transport, illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was "a capacity for dealing with such
issues through the embassies of the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis reaffirmed that Greece was ready to settle its
differences with Turkey on the basis of the international
principles of law.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said here Friday that China is playing more and more
important role in defending international peace and stability as it
owns a very important position in world politics.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Chinese correspondents at
his residence prior to his visit to China starting from Sunday,
Cem said that China is a long-standing and civilized country and
is one of the most important countries in the world, adding that
the relations between Turkey and China are very important.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the development of bilateral ties will make
contributions to the world peace, hoping that Turkey will
establish closer relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has planned to open up an air line from Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey, to Shanghai, the largest city of China,
via Beijing, capital of China, in a bid to develop the tourist
industry and trade ties between the two countries, said Cem.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries reached about 600
million U.S. dollars last year and Turkey has been importing more
Chinese goods.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Welcomes Foreign Investment in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is set to encourage
foreign investment in its mining industry and will ensure the
safety of such investment, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government has put in place a solid minerals
policy and reviewed the mining laws as part of incentives,
said Alhaji Kaloma Ali, Minister of Solid Minerals
Development.
</P>
<P>
The incentives, which include tax relief and profit
repatriation, are aimed at providing a conducive investment
climate, the minister said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
Friday.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Australian ambassador to Nigeria Mathew Neuhaus
in the capital Abuja on Thursday, the minister said that mining
in Nigeria was generally referred to tin in the past and the
comprehensive development of solid minerals is new at present.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that foreign companies, including those
from Australia, will get involved in mineral development,
especially in gold prospecting and exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 450 mineral occurrences have been
identified in Nigeria, with gold deposits found in about 15 of
the 36 states across the country.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also expressed the interest of some Australian firms
in Nigeria's minerals sector, especially gold, an area he said
his country has the required expertise and technology.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been encouraging the development of solid minerals
over the past few years in a bid to reduce its overdependence on
oil, which accounts for some two-thirds of the government's
foreign exchange income and revenue.

<HEADLINE> Swedish FM Urges Iraq to Comply With UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swedish Foreign
Minister Lena Hjelm Wallen Friday called on Iraq to fully comply
with the U.N. resolutions, saying that it is the only way-out to
the current crisis with U.N. over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at a joint news conference with her
Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Wallen expressed the hope that a diplomatic solution can be
found to end the crisis, saying it will be beneficial to all the
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she stressed that the solution is now in Iraq's
hands, adding that it must completely implement the
U.N. resolutions and allow the U.N. arms inspectors to freely
enter all sites where weapons of mass destruction are suspected to
be hidden.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that she felt pessimistic about
the stalled Middle East peace process which is going in wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
All the concerned parties, especially Israel and the
Palestinians, should work in a serious and constructive way to seek
the conclusion of a peace accord, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called on Israel to unconditionally implement the
U.N. resolution 425 to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer
area in south Lebanon with the claimed aim of preventing Lebanese
guerrillas from attacking its northern border areas.
</P>
<P>
Wallen, who arrived here Friday morning for a two-day visit,
has held talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on bilateral ties and
the regional situation.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia opposes the use of force
against Iraq, but will not create any coalition opposing the
United States, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov stated
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Primakov had
an-hour-and-a-half talks with visiting US Defense Secretary
William Cohen on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Primakov said that Russia is guided by "the
necessity to find a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi problem", but
he did not try to convince the U.S. side that a strike on Iraq was
inexpedient.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters that he had a telephone conversation
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the night from
Thursday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, on the same day Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev on his arrival in Yekaterinburg, the Urals,
said that he believes that Washington will refrain from strikes at
targets on Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pentagon is increasing its military presence in
the Persian Gulf region, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that implementation by Iraq of all U.N. resolutions
can be obtained by merely political and diplomatic measures.
Baghdad has already agreed to give the U.N. special commission
access to eight so-called presidential facilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also said he and Cohen had agreed that a START III
treaty would be prepared by experts despite the fact that the
START II had not been ratified by the Russian parliament yet.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Minister had talks with Cohen on Thursday,
who arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and left home on Friday.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Although Britain is not at the
center of Europe geographically, its language English is taking
over as the European Continent's most common language, local press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures released by Brussels, press reports said that
English has taken the place of French as almost 90 percent of
Continental Europe's youngsters are being taught English as a
second language while only fewer than a third of non-French
speaking children are now learning French as their second
language.
</P>
<P>
Then follows German, with just 18 percent are being taught as a
second language, and Spanish, with only eight percent learning it.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a quarter of European youngsters are being
taught English even in primary schools, with French being taught
to only four percent of non-French speaking children.
</P>
<P>
The French government is greatly concerned by the fact and is
making strenuous efforts to sponsor language teaching both in
Eastern Europe and in the Far East.

<HEADLINE> Children Who Eat Too Much Are More Likely to Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Children who eat high energy
diets with large amount of fat are more likely to suffer from some
cancers in adult life, British researchers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in the British Medical Journal, used
the recorded data from a study of almost 4,000 children aged 16
years and under, who were born in Britain between 1937 and 1939.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, Professor Stephen Frankel and colleagues from
the University of Bristol, examined the children's dietary intake
and traced these individuals through to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
Overall, five percent of the population studied died of cancer
and the risk was the highest among those who ate most as children.
</P>
<P>
It showed that children with the highest calorie diets
increased their chances of dying from cancer by 20 percent. The
lower the daily calorie intake in childhood, the lower the risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The latest findings support early research which showed
restricting the energy intake of rats extended their life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The authors concluded that their results confirm the importance
of optimal nutrition during childhood, particularly in the context
of current concerns about excess childhood food intake in relation
to exercise.

plans to take on almost 2500 new flight crew.
</P>
<P>
The news is part of a campaign by the company to take on 15000
staff over the next years.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the boom in charter airline traffic helped
passenger numbers at airports operator BAA to soar above 7 million
in January for the first time.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Falling Oil Prices May Restrict Shell Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) - Shell, the world's largest oil
company, may cut back on its massive exploration and production
budget as oil prices touched 46-month low.
</P>
<P>
Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of the company, was quoted as
saying the rate of return on capital the current year "will be
tough with oil prices as they are".
</P>
<P>
On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, where
March-dated Brent crude oil hit 14.50 US dollars a barrel in
mid-afternoon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The last time Brent traded below 14.50 US dollars was on April
15, 1994, when it touched 14.35 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shell said that although it had achieved lower operating costs
and increased oil production, it had been badly affected by
falling crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Its fourth-quarter net profits fell almost a third, and the
rate of return on capital had slipped from 11.9 percent to 11.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Moody-Stuart said that the company would not give up
on its goal of a 15 percent return on capital by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Shell's target rate is based on the assumption of an 18 US
dollars oil price, compared with today's price of about 15 US
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated 1 US dollar fall in the oil price costs Shell
400 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Businessmen Urged to Improve Sheep Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Animal
Health Center of Ethiopia Friday called on businessman to improve
sheep and goat skin quality in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here, Kassa Bayou, national project
coordinator of the center, noted that the tanneries in the
country lost nearly seven million Dollars in the 1995/96 fiscal
year due to defects caused by a parasitic skin disease known
locally as "ekek".
</P>
<P>
Kassa said 30 percent of the nine million sheep and goat skin
purchased annually by tanneries in Ethiopia are affected by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Defects in hides and skins can occur in pre-slaughter, peri-
slaughter or post-slaughter phases, he said, adding that in
Ethiopia about 65 percent of the defects found on skins are
pre-slaughter defects developing in live animals.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, Getachew Tekle-Medhine, vice-
minister of agriculture said that despite the importance of
livestock to the large section of the Ethiopian population and to
the economy at large, the sub-sector has remained untapped.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ethiopian government is formulating
livestock development strategies, programs and extension packages
in addition to preparing livestock development policy with a view
to tackling productivity constraints and realizing benefits from
the sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia stands first in Africa and tenth in the world in its
livestock resource. Hides and skins export is the second largest
export item in the country next to coffee.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Urges People not to Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government Friday
night called the Jordanians not to allow "a number of people to
hurt the country" following a government banned pro-Iraq
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to Jordan's official news agency, a
government official, who declined to be named, said that
Jordanians should not to allow "a number of people to hurt the
country" at this critical moment the country was passing through.
</P>
<P>
The official made this statement after the anti-riot police
broke up a pro-Iraq demonstration in downtown Amman organized by
opposition parties in defiance of a government ban.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the rally attended by almost one thousand
people was the direct result of the failure of Thursday's dialogue
between the government and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's close-door meeting, Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali insisted that all the problems should be solved
through dialogue and tried to convince the leaders to cancel
their plan to organize the rally.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who gathered around the Al-Hussein Mosque
after the prayer, shouting pro-Iraq and anti-U.S. slogans, clashed
with anti-riot police, resulting in wounding a number of
demonstrators and arrest of about 80.
</P>
<P>
The police managed to break up the rally and succeeded in
preventing it from expending to other areas surrounding the
oldest mosque in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least four opposition organization leaders were arrested,
including Hamza Mansour, spokesman for the Islamic Action Front,
one of the major opposition parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Popular support for Iraq remains strong in Jordan, despite
strained Jordanian-Iraqi ties and Amman's closer links with
Washington since it signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Jordanians back Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein for his anti-Israeli stand, semi-official Jordan Times
said on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States threatened to use force to force Iraq
to comply with all the demands of the United Nations Special
Commission's (UNSCOM) arms inspectors, pro-Iraq sentiment has
become ever stronger in this country.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent social disorder, the Jordanian government
on February 10 declared a ban on mass rallies or movement in the
kingdom. Most of the opposition parties support Iraq and oppose
ties with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Ten people died when
their plane crashed in bad weather in the Ngong hills near the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi Friday, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The 10 people on board include four journalists, the owner of
the plane, two of his relatives, the owner of two well-known
safari camps in South Africa and an experienced pilot. Most of
them are South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Wiess, a spokesman for the plane's owner, Swiss AZ, said
the South African registered PC-12 Pilatus was one of two on a
delivery flight to South Africa from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The second aircraft went out to search for the plane when it
did not arrive at Wilson Airport, Nairobi. The pilot of the
second aircraft found the wreckage on the side of a hill.
</P>
<P>
South African national TV, the SABC, reported that all the 10
people aboard were obviously killed.
</P>
<P>
It said the plane was smashed into pieces and the bodies
scattered at the scene. No cause has been established so far.
</P>
<P>
Wiess said the company was trying to contact the next-of-kin
of the 10 people on board, and would release their names later
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The four journalists were doing a feature story on flying in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said the
journalists were on their way back to South Africa from a
three-day filming expedition at a safari camp, 20 minutes' flying
time north of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
They were on their way to Nairobi to clear customs and refuel,
he said.
</P>

The South African High Commission in Nairobi was making the
necessary arrangements for the return of their bodies to South
Africa in consultation with the next-of-kin, SAPA said.

LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of five members of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will meet in
Nigerian capital Abuja Tuesday on establishing a single monetary
zone in the sub-region by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The five countries are Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and
Togo, all members of a special committee set up last year by
ECOWAS to promote the idea.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS spokeswoman Adriene Diop said here Friday the leaders
will discuss the issue of a sub-regional traveller's check, the
launch of which was cancelled at the last minute last year, due
to reservations raised by the central banks of French speaking
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be preceded by a meeting of the finance
ministers and governors of central banks of the five countries,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also announced that the petroleum and energy
ministers of four ECOWAS countries, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and
Togo, are expected to meet today in Abuja to discuss the
multi-million-Dollar west African gas pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
The project will send Nigeria's rich natural gas to the three
other countries, and to more ECOWAS countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will work out details for private sector
participation and quick take-off of the project, Diop said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Union Urges Reduction of Fuel Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers'
Union (ZNFU) Friday urged the government to reduce taxes and
excise duty on fuel to allow Zambian fishermen fair competition
with the Zimbabweans whose prices of kapenta fish are low.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU said in a statement that it is extremely disturbed by the
current imports of the small fish from neighboring Zimbabwe at
prices which Zambian fishermen cannot match as it is one third
cheaper than that of Zambia's.
</P>
<P>
The statement said traders are crossing the border to export
kapenta from Zimbabwe, thus killing the local fishermen's
business.
</P>
<P>
It said that Zambian fishermen absorb costs that are up to 30
percent higher than their Zimbabwean counterparts as fuel costs
60 percent more in Zambia than in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry is a classic example of a Zambian
industry that is being rapidly taxed out of existence, causing
unemployment all along the shores of Lake Kariba, the second
biggest man-made lake in the world.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks EU-Mediterranean Partnership With Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Commission President Jacques Santer Friday expressed confidence
that Lebanon will sign the EU-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement
in the near future despite reservations of the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference here with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Fares Boueiz, Santer said the EU is seeking to boost ties
with Lebanon in the framework of the EU-Mediterranean Partnership
with the aim of enhancing ties between 12 Mediterranean basin
economies and 15 European countries.
</P>
<P>
As long as the willingness exists, a solution to eliminate
differences between Lebanon and the EU will be eventually found an
agreement on the partnership will be reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, the EU set up a partnership in Barcelona of
Spain, grouping the 15 EU members with 12 Mediterranean countries
to discuss creating a free-trade zone before the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon, together with Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the
Palestinian National Authority, has expressed reservations about
Euro-partnership as they can not remove all customs duties in a
short period of time, which are considered as main revenues of
these states.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been trying to win the ratification of the
partnership agreement of these countries by granting them
financial and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Santer also talked about
Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection. He said EU's stance
differs from that of the United States. But the EU has asked Iraq
to completely comply with the U.N. resolutions while supporting
international efforts to seek a peaceful solution in order to end
the crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who arrived here Thursday on the last leg of his
regional trip, had visited Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
area, Egypt, Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he had held talks with President Elias
Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.

KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) Friday
granted 155 million U.S. Dollars to fund Uganda's Universal
Primary Education (UPE) program started in 1997, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
The money is provided under the Highly Indebted Poor Country
(HIPC) initiative project to improve management, infrastructure
and quality of the UPE. It will be used up to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Ugandan Education Minister Amanya
Mushega and WB representative in Uganda, Randolph Harris.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, 75 million Dollars is a grant while 80 million
is a loan on International Development Association (IDA) terms
for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The funds "will now have a dramatic change and significant
improvement" in primary schools, and the children who were left
out of the school system will now be the target beneficiaries for
UPE, the education minister said.
</P>
<P>
About 5.2 million Ugandan children are enrolled into the UPE
program which provides free primary education to four children
for every family.
</P>
<P>
The number of the enrolled children doubles the enrollment
number of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda ranks 158 out of 174 countries in the development index
of United Nations development program index for 1997. The country
was chosen by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to be the first to benefit under the HIPC initiative on
debt relief to the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
WB and IMF agreed in 1996 to extend to Uganda 386 million U.S.
Dollars in debt relief. The east African country has a total of
over 3.5 billion U.S. Dollars in debt.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has expressed the
hope that the Group of Seven (G-7) economically advanced nations
will help Southeast Asian nations overcome the current monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made by Indonesia's central bank (Bank
Indonesia) Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono Friday in Denpasar,
Bali, about 1,000 kilometers southeast of Jakarta after the
opening of the two-day 33rd Conference of the Governors of the
Southeast Asian Central Banks Association (SEACEN) there, Antara
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad said that as regional currencies were hit by fresh
weaknesses, all Southeast Asian countries want the G-7 to
contribute and find a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, all of us in the region are making every effort to
deal with the issues. We are still fighting," Soedradjad said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be helpful if the G-7 could do something to
create a better economic environment because the contagion
phenomenon is a cross border problem.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor also said that one of the topics to be

<HEADLINE> Kulik Wins Men's Singles Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ilia Kulik of Russia
defeated three time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada to win the
men's singles figure skating at the 18th Olympic Winter Games here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who led into the free skating after short programme,
gave a clean performance, gaining three 5.9s and five 5.8s from a
panel of nine judges for technical merits. He was given seven 5.9s
and two 5.8s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
Stojko, who has yet to win an Olympic gold, was the last to appear
in the ice rink. Before him, he must beat Kulik and win the nine
judges.
</P>
<P>
The athletic Canadian, who was second in Lillehammer and seventh in
Albertville, landed four quadruples and had a quad-triple combination
in the free skating. His clean and smooth performance, from crowds,
defeated Kulik, who skated first in the last group, but did not win
the panel, who took quite a long time to arrange the placings.
</P>
<P>
He was given eight 5.9s for technical merits, but had six 5.7s for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
Stojko, sitting in the corner for the scores, could not believe his
eyes and buried his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
However, a banner from the crowds also gave the score: Elvis is the
King.
</P>
<P>
After the award-presentation ceremony, Stojko left the White Ring
for hospital, having aggravated an old injury from the Canadian
National Championships four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Canadian skating delegation said that he had
injured his right abductor around the groin area.
</P>
<P>
This is the second victory for Kulik over Stojko, who lost to the
Russian rival in the Champions Series final.
</P>
<P>
"It was my best skating this season. On the grand prix final, it
was close, but my quad wasn't good in Germany, here I did everything,"
Kulik said after finishing free skating, adding that "I'm satisfied,
right now I'm going to relax."
</P>
<P>
French skater Philippe Candeloro, who skated as a knight, got the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Candeloro was the only skater who got one 6.0 for presentation in
free skating.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 14 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian was
wounded Saturday in Israeli shelling in south Lebanon, the
official Lebanese Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops bombarded the village of Habush, about 73
kilometers southeast of Beirut, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy shelling also destroyed a number of houses at the
nearby village of Kaferamen, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Israeli offensive, the Iranian-backed
Lebanese Hezbollah attacked an Israeli outpost in Turra in an area
occupied by Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An Israel radio was quoted as saying that no casualties were
made by the guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
But the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA) said that the
attack caused heavy casualties of the SLA.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Muslim resistance forces have been fighting since then
to drive the Israeli troops out of Lebanon.

<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, Chinese President
and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), paid a
visit today to an exhibition of the latest achievements of the
country's digital industry,
</P>
<P>
The ongoing exhibition is sponsored by the Ministry of
Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister Hu Qili and Executive Vice-Minister Liu
Jianfeng briefed Jiang on the developments in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry has witnessed an accelerated
development as the world approaches the turn of the century, said
Jiang, adding that priority must be placed on developing the
industry in order to meet new challenges in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He urged leading officials at all levels to seriously study all
aspects of the information industry so as to meet requirements
of the new situation in the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the importance of technological creativity. He

technological developments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president exhibited great interest in new
domestic products, including mobile telephones, audio-video
products and information technology.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Preparations Going Well for 2002 Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the 2002
Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, the United States,
are going well on schedule, said Deedee Corradini, the city's
mayor, here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Corradini, 53, also a member of the Executive Committee of the
Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee (SLOC), is on a
six-day visit to Hong Kong and Shanghai of China. It is part of
her current Asian tour aimed at promoting the 2002 Winter
Olympics, the host city as well as providing new business
opportunities between Far East and Utah companies.
</P>
<P>
The two-week tour also includes earlier stops at Nagano, the
Japanese host city of the ongoing 18th Winter Olympic Games, and
Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the mayor said she had in her
party representatives from the city's police department, fire
department, emergency management and public services, to collect
first-hand information in Nagano. "We even look into things such
as how you deal with lots of garbage, and recycling and
environment issues and communications," she said.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City had competed against Nagano when bidding for the
1998 Winter Olympics and lost by three votes.
</P>
<P>
Corradini and her entourage are leaving here for Shanghai next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Born in Rhode Island, she grew up and lived in Lebanon for 11
years, when Beirut was "the Paris of the Middle East".
</P>
<P>
Corradini will become the first woman in history to receive the
Winter Olympic Games flag at the closing ceremony of the Nagano
Games. Big celebrations are planned when the flag is brought back
to Salt Lake City, she said.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that her city, which had just celebrated its 150th
birthday, is a booming city, and its major issue is how to keep
the growth on right track while maintaining the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
With a population of just under one million, there are more
foreign languages spoken per capita in the city than anywhere in
the United States, she said, adding that she could find someone to
speak any foreign language required within just 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City enjoys convenient transportation facilities,
including a new airport, a railway network and an inter-state
freeway system, she said.
</P>
<P>
As of competition venues for the Olympics, Corradini said that
the SLOC has been focusing on refurbishing and expanding existing
facilities. The stadium of the University of Utah is being
expanded to double its seating capacity to 50,000, for the Winter
Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. And the athletes'
village will also be on the university campus.
</P>
<P>
"We will not build new buildings that we don't need after the
Olympics," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Budget has always been the problem as the SLOC does not get
federal support for the 1 billion U.S. dollars Olympic budget,
Corradini admitted.
</P>
<P>
With 50 percent of the money needed from the television rights
revenues, the SLOC is anyway getting well with financial issues as
corporate sponsors keep coming up.
</P>
<P>
"And maybe we will sell a lot of T-shirts," she jokes. "I'm
optimistic," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said that convenient recommendations are to be
available for an expected army of journalists. "I know a bit
about the press as I had worked as the press secretary for a state
senator," she added.

JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Druze people on
the Golan Heights Saturday held a protest against Israeli
occupation and clashed with the police, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were injured, one of whom was in a serious
condition and rushed to a hospital for treatment, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The local Druze people in Mas Ada, a town in the northwest of
the Golan Heights, took to the street and shouted pro-Syria
slogans, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters voiced their strong opposition to the Israeli
occupation of the area, a Syrian territory taken by Israel in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the protesters expressed support for the Iraqi
people in their struggle against the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. says it will attack Iraq if it does not allow the arms
inspectors of the United Nations to search all sites freely for
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Clashes occurred when the Israeli police tried to disperse the
protesters.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up)Norwegians Prove Strength on Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Norway proved its strength
in winter sports with two gold medals on snow at the 18th Olympic
Winter Games on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After Thomas Alsgaard won the men's cross country skiing 15km free
pursuit, Bjarte Engen Vik continued to add the second title for the
Nordic country with an comfortable victory in the Nordic combined
individual event.
</P>
<P>
Alsgaard, gold medalist in Lillehammer, Norway four years ago,
clocked one hour, seven minutes and 01.7 seconds for the title. His
victory smashed his teammate Bjoern Daehlie's hope to win a record
seventh Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie, who put his name in the history book by winning his sixth
Olympic title with a victory in the 10km classsical race, was second
at 1:07:02.8.
</P>
<P>
However, the silver medal is enough to write his name again in
Olympic history with a total of ten Olympic medals. Only Raisa
Smetanina, who represented former Soviet Union and the Unified Team,
collected 10 Olympic medals in the past.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Smirnov finished third at 1:07:31.5 in the event.
</P>
<P>
Bjarte Engen Vik, also from Norway, had an easy victory in the
Nordic combined individual event when he finished the 15km cross
country skiing section in 41 minutes and 21.1 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Vik, who did not taste a gold in his previous two Olympic
appearance, led into the skiing section with 36 seconds lead after
finishing the 90m normal hill with 241 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Samppa Lajunen of Finland was second and Valerij Stoljarov finished
third after two-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 500m speed skating, world record holder Catriona
Lemay-Doan of Canada realized her dream of winning an Olympic gold
with a record-breaking sprint in M-Wave Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the second run today, the Canadian skater crossed the finishing
line at 38.21 seconds, smashing her day-long Olympic record of 38.39
which was set in the first run on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lemay-Doan, who gained her fame after changing to flap skates last
year, won the gold with a total of one minute and 16.60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian sprinter has never finished in top ten at the last two
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the 500m event in Lillehammer, she crashed and finished 31st out
of 32 skaters.
</P>
<P>
It was Canada's third Olympic gold medal, men's or women's, in the
history of the sport. Gaetan Boucher won the men's 1,000 and
1,500-meter races at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Another Canadian Susan Auch, who finished second to American legend
Bonnie Blair four years ago, repeated her performance and came second
with a total of one minute and 16.93 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Tomomi Okazaki of Japan was third at 1:17.10.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Olympics, two races were held for both
the men's and women's 500 meters to provide fair racing.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles figure skating, Russian Ilia Kulik defeated
three time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada to win the gold.
Stojko was second for the silver and Philippe Candeloro of France came
in third.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, one of the Nordic countries, guaranteed its first ever
Olympic medal when it defeated Sweden for a place in the final of the
women's curling tournament.
</P>
<P>
It will meet Canada in the final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the men's curling end, Switzerland will take on Canada
for the first ever Olympic crown. Switzerland clinched the berth
after beating Norway 8-7 and Canada trounced the United States 7-1 for
the final spot.
</P>
<P>
Steady rain and snow once again washed out Alpine skiing
competitions on Saturday when the men's Super-G and women's downhill
events were cancelled due to bad weather. It is the fourth complete
day that organizers and athletes lost to weather, which recalled the
world championships in Morioka in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The women's ice hockey preliminary round came to an end Saturday
with Canada fighting for gold with the United States and China taking
on Finland for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
After two runs of the two-man bobsleigh Saturday, Italy's Guenther
Huber held a narrow 0.04 seconds lead over four-time World Cup
champion Pierre Lueders of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Huber and brakeman Antonio Tartaglia clocked an aggregate time of
one minute and 48.80 seconds.
</P>
<P>
After eight day competitions, Norway, despite a slow start in the
games, jumped to the leading place of the medal table with five golds,
six silvers and three bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Germany was second at five golds, four silvers and four bronzes.
Russia was third at four.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and his top aides began
preparing the nation for war in Iraq, and for the prospect of
civilian casualties on the ground and American pilots lost in the

Baghdad had withheld information about its past production of a
potent nerve gas and missile warheads that can carry chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
-- Nigerian peacekeeping forces captured Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone. The whereabouts of Lieut. Col. Johnny Paul

his forces set the stage for the return to office of Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, the country's first democratically elected President.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the International Monetary Fund wrote a private
letter to Indonesia's President Suharto threatening to cut off
bailout money because of a dispute over economic policy, raising
the prospect that the international effort to stem Asia's
financial crisis could come unglued.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in another bid to
avert U.S. military action against Iraq, appealed to United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to visit Baghdad "to see
things for himself."

<P>
NICOSIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot police, in
cooperation with Interpol, have managed to smash an international
drug cartel, that pushed marijuana in Cyprus and other countries
through Bulgaria, local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police announced that 32-year-old Greek Cypriot Dimitris
Frangou, believed to be the mastermind of the operation, has been
arrested by police in Athens and procedures for his extradition
are underway.
</P>
<P>
Three other Greek Cypriots were arrested in Cyprus Friday
while arrest warrants have been issued against two Cypriots
living in Bulgaria in connection with the same case.
</P>
<P>
They are suspected of importing large quantities of cannabis
from Bulgaria between January and October last year, according to
a press release by police.
</P>
<P>
The compressed drugs were transferred to Cyprus and other
countries from Bulgaria in containers.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Frangou left Cyprus in 1993 and has been
living in Bulgaria for the past three years. He had been wanted by
the Cypriot police in connection with the circulation of fake
documents.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot police authority is continuing investigation in the
case in cooperation with Interpol in Bulgaria, Greece and
Britain.

<HEADLINE> French Hunters Demonstrate in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Accompanied by their hounds,
tens of thousands of French hunters demonstrated Saturday in Paris
in a show of muscle against any attempt to restrict the hunting of
animals and birds in France.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, organized by the national union of hunters,
also focused their attack on Dominique Voynet, the minister of the
environment and also president of the Green Party. Voynet, hunters
say, is an ``anti-hunting militant.''
</P>
<P>
What was bizarre about the demonstration was that though it was
the largest protest in Paris since the one against former prime
minister Alain Juppe in the winter of 1995, it was not aimed at
any government policy but was simply a show of force.
</P>
<P>
But the demonstration coincided with the decision by some
French courts ordering a shortening of the hunting season for
migratory birds in some provinces.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is pressuring France to close some hunting
seasons for migratory birds, in accordance with a European
directive aimed at protesting the birds.

<HEADLINE> Top UK Shares To Trade in Euro From 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) - The London Stock Exchange wants
to trade its top British shares in the euro from the start of the
monetary union in January 1999, the Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's proposal is contained in a consultative document
about the European Monetary Union (EMU), resulting from responses
to a report by London School of Economics last June.
</P>
<P>
It said that from January 4, 1999, when the exchange reopens
after the new year break across Europe, a parallel euro order book
would be opened in 120 British stocks.
</P>
<P>
All of those stocks, already traded electronically, are or have
been constituents of the FTSE 100 share index.
</P>
<P>
Outside these top 120 stocks, all other UK stocks will be still
traded only in sterling.
</P>
<P>
By doing this, the London Stock Exchange wants to cater for new
markets that are expected to develop even when sterling remains
separate from the eruo.
</P>
<P>
United Kingdom shares now make up 106 of Europe's top 300
companies in market value.
</P>
<P>
Emphasising London's role as a financial center, David
Clementi, Deputy Governor of Bank of England, said earlier this
week that London will act as "a link between New York and the
euro".
</P>
<P>
It will also offer "the full range of euro services in
wholesale financial markets, efficiently and competitively", he
added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Celebrities Move to Help Revive Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- As Egypt struggles to revive its
tourism industry after the Luxor massacre, football players, movie
stars and pop singers have pooled their talents to improve the
country's image as a safe tourist haven.
</P>
<P>
On the "Luxor Day of Love" Tuesday, which was sponsored by
Luxor Governor Salmy Salim, the celebrities gave a shot to a
fund-raising initiative for Luxor, a city about 700 kilometers
south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to say our country is safe, our people is simple,
hospitable and generous, especially with foreigners. Whoever that
committed the heinous attack are the enemies of Egypt," said Fatma
Mazher, a beloved Egyptian actress.
</P>
<P>
In the bloodiest terrorist attack in Luxor on November 17, 58
foreign tourists were killed by Islamic militants in front of
Queen Hatshepsut's Temple on the West Bank of Nile, dealing a
devastating blow to Egypt's 3-billion-dollar tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Later that night, Samah Yousari, a national heartthrob, managed
to collect 12,000 Egyptian pounds (3,529.4 U.S. dollars) at his
solo pop concert by selling tickets at 10-100 pounds (2.9-29.4
dollars) to his local fans.
</P>
<P>
All the money raised on the "Luxor Day of Love" will go through
the Luxor City Council to help the 1,300 or so families employed
in tourist industry in Luxor city, according to Aymen Unis, a
co-financer of Tuesday's event.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 Egyptian pounds (58,823.5 dollars) have been
injected to the Luxor Victims Fund after a series of charity
events, among the latest is a match Unis brokered between
national football heroes and local players.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Etribi, an 18-year-old horse cart driver, apparently
trying to sidestep the Luxor fallout, said his business has picked
up since the end of January when Egyptian families took a break at
the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan on January 28.
</P>
<P>
For a half-hour ride, Etribi now asks for one U.S. dollar
instead of two, and would settle for two pounds. "I'm ready to
make compromise," he said, "It is better work than idle."
</P>
<P>
Governor Salmy Salim told Xinhua Tuesday that Luxor is "100
percent secure."
</P>
<P>
"We want the world to know that tourists are more than welcome
in Luxor, a 7,000-year-old city with peace, love and security that
provides nothing but pure enjoyment," said the governor who came
to power in a major reshuffle after the Luxor massacre.
</P>
<P>
As horse carts and taxis combed the streets for customers and
feluccas floated down the Nile with a handful of tourists, the
Egypt's winter resort takes on a semblance of old glory after
sunset.
</P>
<P>
Laurence and Jacques Plana, a middle-aged French couple on a
week-long vacation, said they were "impressed by the beauty of the
place and gentility of the people."
</P>
<P>
"Luxor is fantastic at this time of the year. We feel very
safe, very comfortable," said Jacques, adding that he felt sorry
for his friends who had scrapped the trip in the wake of the Luxor
incident.
</P>
<P>
To counteract hundreds of cancellations all over the world,
Egypt's Ministry of Tourism launched a worldwide selling pitch and
boosted domestic tourism by organizing special packages on halved
air fare.

<HEADLINE> UN Workshop Covers Advanced Earthquake Prediction Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of scientists from
around around the world are attending a Beijing workshop to
acquaint themselves with advanced earthquake prediction technology
developed by Chinese seismologists.
</P>
<P>
The participants from 15 quake-prone countries, including
Brazil, India, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Russia and the United
States, are discussing the use of geomagnetic methods which
provide advanced warning for disasters such as major earthquakes
and heavy rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
"The workshop represents a new approach to disaster
preparedness and will strengthen the capabilities of existing
institutions in participating countries," according to Arthur
Holcombe, resident Beijing representative of the United Nation's
Development Program (UNDP). The workshop is being held under the
joint sponsorship of the UNDP, the United Nations Global Program
for the Integration of Public Administration and the Disaster
Sciences Office of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Holcombe predicted that the workshop will have a global impact,
and expressed the hope that it will result in the timely creation
of a worldwide network to monitor warning signs indicating the
possibility of destructive natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yunfang, mastermind of the method, and the research team
under the State Seismological Bureau of China have used
geomagnetic methods to successfully predict 14 earthquakes in
China since 1990, including a magnitude 5.5 quake which hit
Changshu, an east China city in Jiangsu Province neighboring
Shanghai, the nation's largest metropolitan area, in 1990, and a
7.3 magnitude quake on the China-Myanmar border in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day workshop, scheduled to end on February 20, will
feature lectures on theoretical aspects of the method, case
studies, the use of computer data for advanced warning and
informal discussions.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to facilitate promote further research
into using geomagnetic methods to predict natural disasters, the
UNDP will donate 30 digital instruments to China's nationwide
network of geomagnetic observation stations.

<HEADLINE> "Do It Right for Thailand" Campaign Starts in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A national campaign named "Do
it right for Thailand" was launched Saturday at the Queen Sirikit
National Convention Center as part of the government's "Thais help
Thais" project.
</P>
<P>
Posters with a tri-color ribbon in the shape of a heart
decorated the hall, which could be easily mistaken as the sign of
the Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is the logo of the campaign, which aims at
promoting the patriotic sentiment among ordinary Thai people.
</P>
<P>
As Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Khunying Supatra
Masdit put it, the Campaign Committee wanted to remind people of
love for the country by choosing the very day and the logo.
</P>
<P>
The minister, attending the press conference on behalf of Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, said that patriotism is another way to
help the country survive the economic crisis besides money
donations.
</P>
<P>
The government has received some 60 million baht (1.3 million
U.S. dollars) since the "Thais help Thais" project was launched
last December, according to government spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart.
</P>
<P>
Different from the "Thais help Thais" project, the "Do it right
for Thailand" campaign encourages the sense of responsibility and
cooperation among Thai people, Akapol said.
</P>
<P>
He called for changing people's attitudes and behavior by which
he meant local residents' excess love for expensive luxury
imports.
</P>
<P>
Later, Khunying, Akapol and representatives from the business
sector and the media gave a pledge to stick to local products.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 leading corporations operating in Thailand
sponsored the campaign by pouring in almost 40 million baht
(900,000 dollars).

BAGHDAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Liberal Democratic
Party leader Vlademir Zhirinovsky has said he would launch an
initiative to solve the current Iraq-U.N. crisis through a summit
among the U.S., Russia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local official daily Al-Gomhuria Saturday quoted Zhirinovsky as
saying that the proposed summit will be held in Baghdad, Moscow
or Washington if U.S. President Bill Clinton accepts it.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia's influence on the crisis would be
positive, adding that the presence of U.S. troops in the Persian
Gulf poses a real threat to regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Russian reaction to any potential military strike against Iraq
may take the shape of military strike against the U.S. troops, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky said that he would urge the Russian government to
revive the friendship agreement between Russia and Iraq signed in
1972, to send naval forces to the Gulf region and to open air
routes to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would take some of Iraqi patients
suffering from the shortage of medicines due to the U.N. embargo
to Russia for treatment there.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky noted that he has invited Saadoun Hammadi, Speaker
of the Iraqi National Assembly, to visit Moscow to brief the
Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) on the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader arrived here on

12 tonnes of medical and humanitarian assistance as a sign of
solidarity and support to the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE>   Hybrid Electric Bus Under Test in the US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An environmentally-
friendly hybrid electric bus -- one of the first in the United
States -- begins testing Friday in northern California.
</P>
<P>
Two electric motors, producing the equivalent of approximately
180 horsepower, drive the bus's wheels under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
A nickel-cadmium battery pack provides power for the electric
motors, and can be charged on demand by a rotary-engine generator
that runs on propane instead of diesel.
</P>
<P>
The generator continuously recharges the battery pack on the
bus, enabling the vehicle to travel about 200 miles at a
time. Running full-time, the generator consumes only 2.8 gallons
of propane per hour.
</P>
<P>
A proof-of-concept prototype, the vehicle could become the
first of a new generation of city buses.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid electric bus is believed to greatly reduce
pollution, vibration and noise.
</P>
<P>
It puts out at least 50 percent less emissions than a
conventional diesel bus. When operating on batteries alone, the
bus produces no emissions and can travel up to 45 miles.
</P>
<P>
The 30-seat bus would probably cost 350,000 - 400,000
U.S. dollars when it is in full production. A standard diesel bus
costs around 250,000 dollars, but the new bus is expected to be
cheaper to maintain and operate, engineers say.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bus is equipped with a satellite communications
system that enables dispatchers to pinpoint its precise location
at any time. The technology, known as the global positioning
system, is currently being used by transit agencies across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In two months, another hybrid electric bus with a generator
that runs on natural gas will be put to test in northern
California.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian court in
Jericho sentenced Saturday Hamas activists Amjad Hinawi to 10
years with hard labor for taking part in the murder of a Jew in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Hinawi, a 26-year-old college student from Nablus, pleaded
innocent in the murder of 17-year-old Jewish religious student
David Boim from the West Bank settlement Beit El.
</P>
<P>
Boim was shot dead by another Hamas activist Tawfid Sharif who
fired a machine gun at the bus on which Boim was travelling near
Jerusalem. Hinawi surrendered to Palestinian police three days
after the shooting, while Sharif fled and blew up himself in the
last September 4 suicide bombing of Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda
pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
Boim, holding dual Israeli and American citizenship, immigrated
from New York to Israel with his parents when he was a
child. Due to his American citizenship, the United States
Consulate in Jerusalem sent an official to attend the trial.
</P>
<P>
Hinawi is on the list of 34 terror suspects Israel handed over
to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) demanding for their
extradition, but the PNA has turned down the Israeli
request.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Satisfied with ECOMOG in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Ministry has said
that the Nigerian government is satisfied that the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) has achieved the feats in Freetown, Sierra Leone, with
minimum loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
It confirmed in a press release Friday that the capital Freetown
and most parts of Sierra Leone are now firmly under the control of the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigeria is still waiting for detailed reports from the
ECOMOG high command in Monrovia, Liberia, according to the release,
which was issued in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forced into Freetown Thursday afternoon after a week's
intense fighting with the military junta.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG force commander Timothy Shelpidi, his
troops have controlled 90 percent of Freetown and are mopping up the
rebel Revolutionary United Front fighters in some places in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said the force entered Freetown with little resistance but
casualty figures have not been released.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian Defense Headquarters, most of the junta
senior officers have been arrested in Monrovia when they fled there
in a helicopter, and the majority of the junta soldiers have
surrendered to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
However, junta spokesman Aliu Kamara reportedly said Friday that
the war with ECOMOG was far from ended.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning of the battle. If Nigerians think they
can come here to dominate us, they are missing the point," Kamara said
in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone, quoted by a report
reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian Foreign Ministry, the bloody engagement
with the junta in Freetown as the direct result of unprovoked attacks
launched by elements of the illegal administration against the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG was claimed by Nigeria to be the major force to
guarantee the peace plan signed last October in Conakry, Guinea,
the deadline for the restoration of Kabbah's government is set on
April 22 this year.

<HEADLINE> Herbal Medicine Sector Urged to Increase Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China's export volume for
herbal medicines is expected to triple the current figure and
reach two billion US dollars annually by the year 2008, according
to the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling the goal will require the industry to enhance the
research and development of new TCM products and gain a greater
share of the international market for herbal medicines, according
to Administration Director Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
Final figures are expected to show that China's 1997 export
volume for herbal medicines approached 600 million dollars, a
level accounting for only a small share of the world market, said
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China is far from a strong competitor in the international TCM
market, despite its long history of using herbal medicines,
Experts noted that different standards for appraising product
quality represent a major obstacle blocking Chinese products from
entering other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We face fierce overseas competition," said Zhang, adding that
"the most important thing is to improve product quality." Zhang
made the remarks during today's annual meeting of local directors
of TCM administrations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China will engage in painstaking efforts
to set up a general appraisal system in line with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged local departments to implement the Good Medicine
Production (GMP) qualification system in the TCM manufacturing
sector. The international system ensures drug quality during
production.
</P>
<P>
China is home to more than 1,000 TCM manufacturers. Medicinal
raw materials make up 70 percent and patented products 30 percent
of products exported to over 100 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 TCM producers have been granted GMP certifications from
drug administration departments in Australia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, domestic TCM products have entered the drug market in
the United States with the approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

NANNING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 books accounting for
the Japanese aggression of China have recently been found in a
library in Liuzhou city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
south China.
</P>
<P>
The books are among the 300 books written in Japanese found

in northeast China in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tiesheng, vice-director of the library, said titles of the
books are all related to war. Some of them preach militarism and
some others record the battles between Japanese aggressors and
Chinese soldiers in the city of Shanghai and the provinces of
Yunnan and Henan.
</P>
<P>
Some of the books also have phopos, depicting the Japanese

LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has recalled its Ambassador
to Nigeria, George Nene, in protest over what it said was an
infringement of its territorial sovereignty, the Daily Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But nobody in the Liberian Embassy here can be reached to confirm
it.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Liberia also protested to the United
Nations over what it described as Nigeria's unilateral action in
arresting 25 fleeing officials of the Sierra Leone military junta in
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian defense spokesman Godwin Ugbo told Xinhua Friday
the junta officers, who fled to Monrovia by a helicopter, were held in
the headquarters of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG),
being questioned and interrogated.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Liberian Foreign Minister had said his
government was demanding that the officials and helicopter be handed
over to the Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not disclose what the Liberian regime intended to
do with the arrested officials.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian President Charles Taylor has reportedly had
friction with ECOMOG for some time.
</P>
<P>
Liberia earlier opposed to ECOMOG's use of its territory to launch
attack on the military junta in neighboring Sierra Leone and asked the
peacekeeping force to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
It is also against the planned ECOMOG involvement in the
restructuring and training of the country's post-war army.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda has been formally charged with misprison of treason, Zambia
Daily mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have known between October 26 and 28 last year
that certain Zambian army officers intended to commit treason but did
not give such information to the president nor other senior leaders of
the country nor use other reasonable endeavor to prevent the
commission of the offence.
</P>
<P>
His security aide Moyse Kaulung'ombe has been jointly charged with
the same offence.
</P>
<P>
The new charge was brought on February 11, the government newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda and Kaulung'ombe will appear in court next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On January 10 last year Kaunda was charged with conspiring with
some army officers and two top leaders of another two opposition
parties to topple the government. Kaunda has already strongly denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
Since the abortive October 28 coup a total 95 people have been
arrested. Kaunda was arrested on December 25 of 1997 but transferred
to house arrest six days later following an international cry for his

<HEADLINE> 4th China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANCHAGARH, Bangladesh, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The fourth
China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge in the northwestern part of the
South Asian nation was inaugurated here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said that the construction of the bridge had long
been a dream of the local people, and its completion would surely
facilitate the economic and social development of the area.
</P>
<P>
She expressed thanks to the Chinese government for its
assistance in Bangaldesh's economic and social development, saying
"We'll remember it with respect."
</P>
<P>
The new bridge is another crystallization of the friendship and
wisdom of the people of China and Bangladesh, said Wang Chungui,
head of the Chinese government delegation of ambassador to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the economic development of the
area would benefit from the bridge, hoping that the friendship
bridges would play a big role in Bangladesh's national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The 7.65 million U.S. dollar bridge, which was completed in a
short span of 11 months, is 1,052 meters long and 10 meters wide,
and spans the Karatoya River in the Panchagarh district, 362
kilometers northwest of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
China has so far helped Bangladesh build four friendship
bridges.

<HEADLINE> HK Spokesman on Projected Medium-term GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong government
spokesman Saturday described as "reasonable" the projected
medium-term trend GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the spending part of the 1998-1999 budget revealed
by the government Friday, total public expenditure, at 288.8
billion HK dollars (37 billion U.S. dollars), represents 19.2
percent of the estimated GDP of 1,507 billion HK dollars (193
billion U.S. dollars), which is calculated on the basis that the
economy would grow at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Responding to media inquiries, the spokesman explained that the
medium-term trend GDP growth rate reflects the government's view
on Hong Kong's outlook for economic growth "extending from the
current year over the next three years", but "abstracting from any
shorter-term fluctuations in growth due to cyclical changes in
economic conditions or temporary factors."
</P>
<P>
The trend GDP growth rate for Hong Kong in 1998-2001, forecast
to average at 5 percent per annum, "has taken into consideration
the domestic economy as well as the external sector," including
Hong Kong's major trading partners, in particular China's inland
areas and the United States both of which maintain solid economic
growth, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is considered that, notwithstanding the setback caused by
the current regional financial turmoil, the prospects beyond the
near term remain good for the Hong Kong economy, and the economy
should be able to rebound quickly once the regional situation
settles," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's GDP growth averaged at 5.1 percent per annum both
over the past five years (1993-1997) as well as over the past ten
years (1988-1997). The projected rate of 5 percent for 1998-2001
is "therefore considered reasonable", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the planning of government
expenditure, especially recurrent expenditure, should be based on
the medium-term GDP growth rate rather than the short-term one
which tends to fluctuate from year to year. This will ensure
stability in government expenditure in line with community needs,
while keeping it within what the economy can afford.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on HK Housing Strategy Into 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government Saturday published a white
paper on its long-term housing strategy, reaffirming its
determination to build adequate and affordable homes for the six
million population in early next century.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, entitled "Homes for Hong Kong people into the
21st Century", listed detailed steps to attain three major targets
set by SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in his first Policy
Address in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tung pledged to build not less than 85,000 flats a year in the
public and private sectors, starting from 1999, to meet the
housing need of the community, achieve a home ownership rate of 70
percent by 2007 and reduce the average waiting time for public
rental housing from six and a half years to three years by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"These objectives and initiatives have been brought together in
the White Paper, which also takes into account public comments on
a consultative document on housing policy," the Secretary for
Housing Dominic Wong told a press conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper says the government will announce annually a
Five-Year Land Disposal Program, which specifies sites for sale in
 the first two years.
</P>
<P>
"This move is to secure a steady and sufficient supply of land
and put supporting infrastructure in place in good time," said
Wong. The first such program will provide 690 hectares of land
both for public and private sectors during the period between 1998
and 2002.
</P>
<P>
A 13-year flat production program will be published starting
from 1998, and be updated annually, according to the White Paper.
</P>
<P>
Wong added that the government will create the conditions to
enable private developers to make the biggest possible
contribution to meeting the housing need of the society.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, the SAR government has planned to implement
 a series of subsidized housing schemes to help different income
groups to buy their own homes. For those who cannot afford their
own houses, the government will provide public housing at
reasonable rents.
</P>
<P>
Wong expressed his confidence that the housing targets will be
fulfilled despite the current economic downturn. "The government's
land supply and housing production targets are long term
initiatives. We must not be overly concerned about a very short
span of time and the temporary economic situation," said Wong.

<HEADLINE> S. African Doctors Attempt to Clone Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A South African doctor and
his team are ready to clone humans, the Saturday Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Cassim is preparing an application to ethics committee
of the Johannesburg-based University of the Witwatersrand for
permission to go ahead with the cloning, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Expertise and equipment to replicate genetic material and create
human clones is available at a Johannesburg fertility clinic, it said.
</P>
<P>
Four women from the Gauteng Province, who are desperate to have
their own genetic children, will allow Cassim and his technicians to
attempt to create replicas of themselves or their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Cloning a human entails removing the nucleus of a human egg cell --
the part which contains half of the genetic material required for a
human -- and replacing it with the nucleus of a cell from another part
of the body.
</P>
<P>
Cloning means that sperm may no longer be required for
reproduction. If a couple want a daughter, the entire genetic make-up
of the wife is reproduced. Genetic material is taken from the husband
if a son is desired.
</P>
<P>
This controversial step to spearhead groundbreaking research
could put South Africa back on the map of medical technology and
knowledge for the first time since Chris Barnard pioneered the
first heart transplant in the world more than 30 years ago, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Cassim is in partnership with a Danish fertility clinic and has
received financial assistance for his work into in-vitro reproduction
-- but not cloning.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has already banned cloning of human beings.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in Scotland cloned a sheep, Dolly, from a cell taken
from the udder of a six-year-old ewe. They published their research
last year.

<HEADLINE> Interview: US Mayor Optimistic of Sino-US Trade Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- "I'm very much optimistic of
the prospects of the trade relations between the United States and
China," Deedee Corradini, Mayor of Salt Lake City of the United
States, said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm anxious to see China and Shanghai. To discover what's
happening there will be a wonderful part of my trip to Asia," she
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Corradini is on a two-week tour of Asia, which includes stops
at Nagano in Japan, Seoul in the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong
and Shanghai of China. Her mission aims at providing business
opportunities and promoting Salt Lake City and the Winter Olympic
Games it hosts in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old mayor arrived in Nagano for the ongoing Winter
Olympics. She temporarily left Japan to continue her Asian tour,
and after visiting Seoul, arrived in Hong Kong Friday.
</P>
<P>
Corradini, a member of the Executive Committee of the Salt Lake
City Olympics Organizing Committee (SLOC), will go back to Nagano
later to receive, at the Nagano Olympic Games closing ceremony,
the Olympic Games flag from the mayor of the Japanese city.
</P>
<P>
She said he had learned a long on her third trip to Asia but
the first visit to other parts of the region outside Japan. "I had
a wonderful meeting with (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Chief Executive) Mr. Tung Chee Hwa and (Administrative Secretary)
Madame Anson Chan Friday. I'm very much impressed with both of
them," she said.
</P>
<P>
The American mayor also met people in the financial sector here
to further business and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is playing an increasing role in the world. I'm here to
listen and learn. It's a fantastic trip for me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely impressed and I'm going back with good news,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is talking about China. We all know that the
emerging potential of market there is just fantastic," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The visit to Hong Kong opened up my eyes and mind and I've
come to know that this is not only a wonderful part of the world
and the energy of the city is fantastic. Although it had some
economic difficulties, it is still energized," she said.
</P>
<P>
Corradini is considering setting a tour to Hong Kong for mayors
 of other major American cities so that they can come to see
what's happening here.
</P>
<P>
"You can hear it, you can read it. But until you come here,
it's totally different," she said.
</P>
<P>
Corradini also wished to increase mutual understanding as she
becomes the president of the American Mayors Conference, an
organization representing some 2,000 U.S. cities. She is now its
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The conference wishes to share with Asian mayors experience on
such common problems and issues as crime, which is the biggest
issue for U.S. cities, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to build up our relationship and I'm just beginning. I
will come back and wish to visit Beijing next time," she added.
</P>
<P>
She and her party are leaving Hong Kong next Monday for
Shanghai to continue her six-day China trip.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aid Body Meddled in S. African Affairs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Saturday
Star newspaper said it had obtained a U.S. Congress report which
accuses the United States Agency of International Development
(USAID) of interfering in South African internal affairs and
squandering resources needed to fund basic development.
</P>
<P>
Lester Munster, a professional staff member of the U.S.
Congress's International Relations Committee majority group, said
USAID interfered in South African domestic policy to the point of
making the Mandela government's job more difficult, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said in the report that the present USAID program
concentrated on sponsoring of conferences and other
policy-formulating activities and not hard-core delivery needed
by the poor.
</P>
<P>
Saturday Star quoted the report as saying that USAID uses its
fund for the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) activists to
play a major role in key South African political issues,
including race and affirmative action policies, unresolved border
disputes between provinces, land restitution, violence in
Kwazulu-Natal, overhaul of national education policies, civil
service reform, labor policy, and national health care policies.
</P>
<P>
Munster said USAID had decided it should continue its
political role because it believed that black parties lacked
leadership, management and technical skills, and analytical
skills were not well developed.
</P>
<P>
He also wrote that many of the USAID officials setting policy
requirements were not qualified to do so. "The staff do not
appear to have the genuine expertise to make judgments on the
broad range of national policy issues they have taken on to
themselves."
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, reportedly referring
to the report at the 50th African National Congress's national
conference last December, warned that there was a possibility
that some NGOs were acting as "instruments of foreign governments
and institutions."
</P>
<P>
Munster said USAID also made direct demands on the new South
African government for policy changes. An agreement signed with
the Justice Ministry included USAID stipulations for appointing
judicial officials, he added.
</P>
<P>
The report was handed to the U.S. House of Representatives'
International Relations Committee in November 1996, after an
inspection of USAID operations during April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The South African government will announce next week what it
intends to do about USAID's controversial operations in the
country.

"The plan that has been presented to the leader encompasses

The SEC was founded in 1987 under a decree of late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini with the aim of
arbitrating possible disputes between the Majlis (parliament) and
the Constitutional Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The SEC's functions were expanded last year and turned into an
advisory body for Khamenei after he re-appointed former Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani as the SEC chairman.
</P>
<P>
The constitution empowered the supreme leader to determine the
country's general policies and Khamenei instructed the SEC to
prepare a draft of general policies after the body was enlarged
and restructured.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister
Ian McLachlan Saturday described his Chinese counterpart Chi
Haotian's Australia visit as "an important new stage in
Sino-Australian defense relationship".
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said Chi's visit, which began Saturday and will last
through February 19, is the first by a Chinese defense minister to
Australia and "marks an important new stage in the Australia-China
defense relationship".
</P>
<P>
General Chi's visit would be an important opportunity to
strengthen the developing defense dialogue between Australia and
China, McLachlan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese defense minister arrived in Sydney Saturday on a
six-day official visit to Australia at the invitation of
McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
Chi is scheduled to call on Australian Prime Minister John
Howard and hold talks with McLachlan, Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer, Defense Force Chief John Baker and other senior Australian
officers.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said he and Chi would discuss regional security and
bilateral defense arrangements in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian defense minister said he would emphasize
"Australia's security interests in the Asia-Pacific region and
support China playing an active and constructive part in the
developing regional security dialogue process".
</P>
<P>
"This visit will also enhance our knowledge of China's security
outlook and defense policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will also review defense activities between
Australia and China. The past year saw visits by senior defense
officials, the establishment of an annual strategic dialogue and
the resumption of naval ship visits.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech after his arrival in Sydney Saturday, the
Chinese defense minister said Australia and China, as Asia-Pacific
countries, share extensive common interests and responsibility in
safeguarding peace, promoting economic prosperity and development
in the region.

<P>
-- Three weeks away from the regional elections, the National
Union of Federation of Hunters of France calls on its 1.6 million
members to demonstrate Saturday in Paris, to protest the policy of
the minister of environment, Green Party leader Dominique Voynet.
About 100,000 people are expected to join the protest.
</P>
<P>
-- The Iraqi crisis is at a turning point. Either the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan goes to Baghdad to seek a
diplomatic solution, or the United States moves ahead to strike
Iraq. Russia, France and China have called on Annan to go to Iraq
to obtain necessary concessions for avoiding a military strike.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France and Russia continues to pressure the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan to take initiatives for avoiding a
resort to force against Iraq. U.N. has sent a technical team to
Baghdad to make an account about the presidential sites suspected
to be hiding chemical and biological weapons. President Jacques
Chirac will receive Iraqi foreign minister Tuesday next week in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
-- Jobs increased by one percent in 1997 over the previous
year, as 129,500 jobs were created last year. The French Minister
of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that "the cycle
of growth and employment is from now on solidly interlocked in
France."
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- The French auto group Peugeot-Citroen SA lost 2.5 billion
francs (420 million U.S. dollars) in 1997. The group will continue
to lay off employees by 3,000 to 4,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
-- The mayor of Orleans Jean-Pierre Sueur has submitted a
report to the government on the social renovation of French
cities. According to the report, the government has to spend 35
billion francs (5.9 billion U.S. dollars) each year to launch
social programs in the cities.

<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government insisted
Saturday that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan be tough in his
meetings with Iraqi leaders during his planned trip to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said that the only purpose of Annan's Baghdad visit
should be securing an agreement for U.N. arms inspectors to
continue their work without obstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Time will be made for Kofi Annan to go on such a visit and see
if an agreement can be reached," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is in favor of launching military attacks
against Iraq, stressed that Annan's trip to Iraq should not be
regarded a "cap-in-hand" mission.
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine the secretary general of the U.N. wanting to
go and seek anything less than that (the objective mentioned
above) from Saddam Hussein. It is not a cap-in-hand job," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
The British government has sent one of its aircraft carriers
and 14 war planes to the Gulf region.

<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 14 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Catriona
Lemay-Doan won the first women's Olympic speed skating gold medal for
Canada as she clocked the fastest time in the two-run race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The queen of the sprints, who set the world record of 37.55 seconds
in Calgary on December 28 in 1997, improved her Friday's time to set
another Olympic record of 38.21 seconds for total time of one minute
and 16.60 seconds, taking away the gold medal in Nagano's "M-Wave".
</P>
<P>
The second and final result was a repeat of Friday's first run.

seconds in both races for a total of 1:17.10, took the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Friday Doan was leading Auch by only 0.03 second but Saturday she
proved too much and beat Auch by 0.30 second.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great race for me. I am so happy to win the first women's
Olympic speed skating gold medal for my country," said the overjoyed
Canadian skater, who was skating with Auch in the last pair of 19.
</P>
<P>
"Susan skated a very good start and I followed her very close. I
thought I could catch up with her after last curve and I did. I won."
</P>
<P>
Franziska Schenk of Germany, bronze medalist at the Lillehammer
Games, jumped to fourth from Friday's fifth with an aggregate time of
1:17.45. She was timed of 38.57 in her second run race, better than

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nanchang, the capital of east
China's Jiangxi Province, has recorded a daytime temperature of 25
degrees Centigrade in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest temperature in spring in the past 10 years,
according to the Meteorological Bureau of the city.
</P>
<P>
Now, many residents are seen in summer clothing, out
enjoying the warm air.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that the abnormal wheather results from a
warm front which started to come to the area 10 days ago, and the
temperatures are expected to return to normal (about 15 degrees C.)
in a couple of days when a cold front from the north hits this
part of China.

Qian said China and the United States, as permanent members of
the UN Security Council, are held responsible for making
unremitting efforts in resolving the weapon inspection crisis in
Iraq so as to prevent possible bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is very much concerned with the daily
increasing escalation of the crisis, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The work of the UN Special Commission over the past seven years
has proved that great progresses have been scored through peaceful
means in the aspect of inspecting and destroying weapons of mass
destruction, the Chinese foreign minister acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"Since the method (peaceful means) is effective," he said,
"(we) should continue to proceed along this way."
</P>
<P>
If the use of force is resorted to, that would only result in
grave casualties of large numbers of innocent people and serious
consequences, but will not help resolve the weapon inspection
crisis, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, as a special envoy of the US president, flew in
Beijing this morning from Japan for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Richardson is scheduled to meet the press later today.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects to Attract 7.9 Billion Dollars of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran is expected to attract a
total of 7.9 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment in the
coming fiscal year starting on March 21.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tehran Times published Saturday, Iranian
Majlis (parliament) member Morteza Nabavi has said that the new
year budget allowed up to 5.4 billion dollars foreign investment
in buyback and 2.5 billion dollars in foreign financing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foreign investment in buyback form would be
injected into gas, oil, petrochemical, mines and railways
projects. But he did not mention where the foreign financing would
be used.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's second five-year development plan (1995-2000), the
government is allowed to obtain some 10 billion dollars from
abroad, 6.5 billion dollars in the buyback form and 3.5 billion
dollars in foreign financing.
</P>
<P>
Many Majlis members believed that a big amount of foreign
borrowing would cause the country to face new financial problems
as what happened in early 1990s, forcing the country to reschedule
its arrears of some 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
There was no official report about Iran's present foreign
debts. Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohsen
Nourbakhsh has said that the country has paid off 75 percent of
its arrears and only 3.6 billion dollars of its rescheduled debts
should be paid next year.
</P>
<P>
As prices for Iranian crude oil are fluctuating around 13
dollars per barrel at present, experts said that Iran's oil
incomes would fall by 3-4 billion dollars next year and the
government would face a budget deficit of about 11.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran fetched a total oil revenue of some 18.5 billion dollars
in 1996 fiscal year when oil price stood at above 19 dollars per
barrel. But during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year,
the country earned an oil income of 13.5 billion dollars, 5
percent less than the budget forecast.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Rebel Groups' Clashes in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed while
two others wounded in clashes between two main Muslim rebel groups
in the southern city of Cotabato, the Philippine News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) forces Friday forced
some 1,000 residents to flee their homes and seek refuge in nearby
villages to avoid being caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The report said the MILF, now the country's biggest
anti-government Muslim rebel group, initiated the attack on
Sangganong, an MNLF village, which eventually led to a fierce
encounter that lasted for five hours.
</P>
<P>
The report failed to identify those killed but said they
belonged to the MNLF, and the wounded include one government
soldier.
</P>
<P>
Rosque Garingalao, spokesman for the Sixth Infantry Division of
the Philippine Armed Forces, said the government forces were also
attacked by MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
But he added that government troops in the area maintained a
"defensive stance."
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio station, Al Haj Murad, MILF deputy
chief for military affair, said the incident stemmed from a
"long-time grudge" among MNLF and MILF members in the area. He
vehemently denied that their combatants attacked Sangganong.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the matter would be settled immediately by a joint
MNLF-MILF task force created recently to look into such problems.
</P>
<P>
Last week, MNLF and MILF forces also clashed in Nuangan,
another remote village in Cotabato. Four MNLF members were killed
while five others were wounded in the encounter.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction from the MNLF but more radical,
refused to be part of a peace accord signed in 1996 between the
MNLF and the government. It wants its own peace accord with
Manila.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Presidential Guards Deny Linkage With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Security Group Saturday denied the allegation that the crash of
Cebu Pacific Flight 387 on February 2 might have been indirectly
caused by some security personnel.
</P>
<P>
An opposition senatorial contender alleged on Friday that the
ill-fated plane made an "unscheduled" stopover in Tacloban City on
its way to Cagayan de Oro City to drop off staffers or security
personnel of the Office of the President.
</P>
<P>
Former Senator Aquilino Pimentel said he had information that
office staffers were ferried by the DC-9 plane to Tacloban on
February 2, the day the plane crashed, to join the advance team to
prepare for a regional cabinet meeting there the next day.
</P>
<P>
In his report to President Fidel Ramos, Jose Calimlim, the
Presidential Security Group commanding general, said no member of
the group boarded the Cebu Pacific Flight to Tacloban City.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to inform his Excellency that the Presidential Security
Group does not use civilian passenger aircraft to transport its
advance or security personnel," Calimlim said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre branded
Pimentel's allegation as "false and mischievous."
</P>
<P>
The flight from Tacloban City to Cagayan de Oro City on an
unfamiliar route and over a perilously cloud-covered mountain
range has largely been blamed for the plane crash, in which all
104 passengers and crewmen aboard were killed.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Listed Best for Progress Against Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A national report has
listed the city of Seattle as the best in the United States for
progress in fighting against air pollution over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The city went from an average 14 bad pollution days in 1989 to
zero between 1994 and 1996, said the report, which was issued
recently by a Washington D.C. industry group, The Road Information
Project (TRIP).
</P>
<P>
The report attributed most of the improvement to cleaner cars
and cleaner fuel.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than half a million, the port city of
Seattle is the commercial and transportation hub and the centre of
manufacturing, trade and finance of the U.S. Northwest.
</P>
<P>
Its diversified industries include aircraft, high technology,
machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing and forest
products, with Boeing and Microsoft as the best known corporations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington State Department of Ecology has attributed some
of Seattle's air quality to the region's climate.
</P>
<P>
The weather comes off the ocean, so Seattle dose not inherit
other cities' pollution.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cool temperatures minimize ozone build-up, and
rain flushes particles out of the air.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Calls for Speeding Up Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise has called for speeding up the transformation
of the national armed forces to make them full representative.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Modise expressed
his concern at the low pace of the transformation in the armed
forces towards reflecting the diversity of races. Only 22.5
percent of defense force officers were black and only 11 out of
more than 50 generals were black, he said.
</P>
<P>
There had to be progress in transforming the force because
unless it became fully representative, people would not accept
it, Modise said.
</P>
<P>
On troops change, Modise said that the number of general
officers would be cut as the force downsized. Downsizing would be
achieved through natural attribution, intergovernmental
transfers, non-renewal of short-term contracts, voluntary
severance packages, and retrenchment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Draft plans for downsizing of the defense force from current
94,000 members to 70,000 over three years and the merging of
units were reportedly to be presented to the defense ministry
next month.
</P>
<P>
Rationalization was set to begin at th end of the year, but
the process would be spread over several years, the ministry's
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the mergers could allow the defense force to
concentrate resources to help the police and to acquire capital
equipment.

aircraft crashed in bad weather in the Ngong hills, near the Kenyan
capital, Nairobi, Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sixth U.S. Marine Under Probe for Cable Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A sixth U.S. Marine was under
investigation into the February 3 disaster at an Italian ski resort
when a low-flying U.S. warplane severed ski-lift cables, plunging
20 people to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed leaks at the Aviano U.S. Air Force base in northern
Italy claimed Friday that the Marine commander of the squadron
whose plane and crew were involved in the disaster, failed to see
to it that his pilots follow the rules issued last year by the
Italian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The rules ban military planes from flying below 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were circulated to all NATO military commands
in Italy and therefore the commander of the squadron must have
known about the ban, the Italian sources said.
</P>
<P>
Initially under investigation were Captain R.J.Ashby, 30, the
pilot of the EA-6B Prowler at the time of the accident, and the
three men in his crew, all Marine Corps captains.
</P>
<P>
The men have been notified that they may be charged with
multiple manslaughter and endangering public transport.
</P>
<P>
A fifth Marine stationed at the Aviano U.S. Air Force base was
later brought into the probe, suspected of providing false
information on the condition of the aircraft's flight
instruments.

<HEADLINE> China Observes Largest Number of Bright Supernovas in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Astronomical
Observatory (BAO) has observed 23 bright supernovas, and as a
result China has become a country which observed the largest
number of bright supernovas in the world, BAO of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences said today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Xinglong Station of BAO observed two bright
supernovas which are within 10 billion light-years away from the
earth, in January with a 60cm robotic telescope, said Hu Jingyao,
a researcher in charge of the station.
</P>
<P>
The telescope found 15 bright supernovas in 1997 and observed
six in 1996, the first year it began to be used especially for the
sky-survey of bright supernovas, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Supernova is most violent, he explained. It releases more than
10(53)erg of energy during explosion, which is about 100 times the
amount of the sun can give during its whole life.
</P>
<P>
Supernova observation is an important study project for
astrophysics and is also an important tool in the research of
cosmology.
</P>
<P>
Since supernova appears in a galaxy almost every 100 years, the
more galaxies, a telescope can survey at one night, the bigger,
the chance to find a supernova, Prof. Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The 60cm telescope of the Xinglong Station, with a CCD camera
attached at the prime focus and a software system for facility
control, can do sky-survey of more than 500 galaxies a night, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers enjoy better weather for observation in Beijing,
where it is usually clear at night in winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the 60cm telescope of Xinglong will keep
the record of observing 10 to 15 bright supernovas a year.

<HEADLINE> Nine South Africans Killed in Plane Crash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine South Africans, most of
them journalists, died when their luxury aircraft crashed in the
Ngong Hills nearby Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the one-engined plane was flying from
Kenya's world-famous Maasai Mala Game Reserve to South Africa via
Nairobi's Wilson Airport when it hit the mountain at 2:30 p.m.
possibly due to poor visibility at the time.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Governors Camp said Friday evening that
the South African Pilatus PC 12 plane failed to check in as
scheduled at 10:40 a.m. at the Wilson Airport or notify the
control tower.
</P>
<P>
A search plane was dispatched one and a half hours later and
located the wreckage of the aircraft on the western
side of the Ngong Hills about 30 meters below the peak, 15
kilometers west of the Wilson Airport.
</P>
<P>
"People who saw the aircraft burning rushed to the scene but
the passengers were all dead. The charred remains were still
trapped in the smouldering wreckage of twisted metal when the
fire brigade and policemen arrived," said a police officer.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is owned by a firm in South Africa called Heading
South, whose owner, Chris Kruger, was on board with two close
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The other dead were journalist Derek Rodney from the
Independent newspaper in Johannesburg, Patrick Wagner, who writes
for Gataway Magazine, Anton Schecpers, a cameraman working for
M-Net, Herman Potgieter, a South African aviation photographer,
and Roland Geiger, the owner of two famous safari camps in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The pilot was identified as Heran Smit, an ex-South Africa Air
Force instructor with over 5,000 hours of experience.
</P>
<P>
The group was on a promotional journey through Africa,
starting in Luxor in Egypt. They arrived in Kenya last Monday
evening at Kisumu Airport and were proceeding to Wilson Airport
in order to fly to South Africa via Zimbabwe and Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Aims to Produce Sufficient Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China has been nearly successful to produce
sufficient grain for its 46 million people, according to Ding
Tingmo, the region's Deputy Party Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi yielded 16.61 million tons of grain in 1997, 360 kg for
each person. This has almost made it possible for the region to
end the decade-long practice of buying grain from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The region has been always troubled with grain shortage due to
reasons like population growth and irrational planting structure.
</P>
<P>
It began in recent years to take steps to guarantee a gradual
increase of grain acreage and investment, and improve low-yield
farmland and introduce in winter farming. As a result, Guangxi had
good grain harvests in the past three years despite of natural
adversities.
</P>
<P>
It also started five major agricultural projects -- dry rice,
late rice, output increases for dry crops, seeding
industrialization, and disaster-resistant agriculture -- to make
better use of agronomics.
</P>
<P>
Cangwu County in eastern Guangxi is one example. It has a large
amount of low-yield paddy fields, where early rice had never
collected good harvests because of monsoon rain. Agronomists
improved seeds and sowing methods and they have shortened the rice
growing period so that it can mature before the rainy season. This
has brought about a much higher early rice output.

JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma called on the people of the whole country
to start a campaign against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The expanding epidemic was "silently gnawing away at our
population", with 1,500 people now infected every day, local
daily the Citizen quoted Zuma as reporting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not succeeded in dealing with the AIDS epidemic or in
making a difference in the AIDS epidemic."
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 1,500 people were being infected with HIV
every day, it was estimated that more than two million South
Africans were already infected, but ignorant of the infection and
therefore did not even know they needed treatment.
</P>
<P>
An awareness of the scope of the epidemic might require
"something every day" on radio and in the print and electronic
media, so that people would begin to change their behavor and
avoid infection, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of being a project of the Health
Ministry, combating the epidemic would become a program

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China has become one of the
world's few countries capable of developing heavy-duty railway
freight cars.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Zhuzhou Rolling Stock Plant of the
Railways Ministry said a D26 sunken platform wagon with a
weight-carrying capacity of 260 tons developed by the plant was
used to move a stator with a weight of 217 tons from the Shanghai
Electrical Machinery Plant recently.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, transportation of heavy and big equipment made
by power, chemical and metallurgical industrial enterprises has
remained a problem.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has included development of
D26 sunken platform wagons capable of carrying 260 tons of weight
into its key scientific and technological tasks during the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000) and entrusted the Zhuzhou
Rolling Stock Plant, which is based in central China's Hunan
Province, with the task.
</P>
<P>
The plant spent eight months in developing its first group of
sunken platform wagons. Tests show that such wagons can have a
speed of 80 km per hour when loaded and of 100 km per hour when
unloaded, the highest of its kind in China.

<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The senile population is
growing rapidly due to the decline of the birth rate and death
rate in Beijing, capital of China.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that Beijing citizens aged more than
60 have exceeded 1.5 million, accounting for 12 percent of the
total population of the city.
</P>
<P>
With the aging population, the family structure also changed.
More than 50 percent of the seniles do not live with their sons
and daughters, and grand children. The percentage of the senile
people who live separate with their children and grand children is
the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many of the senile people live alone or stay at homes for the
aged people.
</P>
<P>
But a survey showed that more than 50 percent of the people
aged 75 or above are living with their sons and daughters.

<HEADLINE> China Produces Cow "Gallstones" in Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese bio-chemical
pharmaceutical factory in Wuhan City of central China's Hubei
Province has begun the cultivation of bow-bezoar or cow-gallstone,
a very precious medicinal material for traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Fazu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said it is the first time in China that cow-gallstones are
cultivated in a factory and the effectiveness and contents of the
factory-cultivated gallstones are the same as those taken from
real cows.
</P>
<P>
The technique of external cultivation of cow gallstones is
developed by Cai Hongjiao, an academician of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences and professor at the Wuhan-based Tongji Medical
University.
</P>
<P>
She said it took her a dozen years to develop the state
patented technique. She explained that after taking out bile from
the gallbladder of a cow, she applied biological and chemical
methods in cultivating gallstones.
</P>
<P>
As the incidence of gallstone for cow only stands at one or two
per thousand, the price of cow gallstone reached 10,000 yuan
(1,200 U.S. dollars) for one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Cow gallstone pharmaceuticals are used in China for treatment
of sore throat, toothache, constipation, wind-stroke-syndrome and
Type B encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 clinical cases of external cultivated cow
gallstone pharmaceutics in treatment of wind-stroke-syndrome and
Type B encephalitis in five hospitals since 1994 proved to be very
successful.

researchers used advanced monitoring instruments to gather special
information needed to change weather by artificial means.
</P>
<P>
A controlling technological system on artificial weather change
has been set up with a coordinating telecommunication network
coming into operation.
</P>
<P>
The province have organized aircraft on 257 sorties on weather
change mission, which have resulted in an accumulated
precipitation of 5.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The province has also conducted operation to expel impending
hailstorms. With a yearly consumption of 20,000 shells, the
operations have saved the province tens of millions of economic
losses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Brokerage Makes Bold Move into Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. brokerage Merrill
Lynch has announced an aggressive move to exploit Japan, the
world's largest personal savings market.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch unveiled plans to hire about 2,000 employees from
recently bankrupted Yamaichi Securities and open 31 local offices
across the country, in a bid to capture some of the 10 trillion
held by Japan's individual investors.
</P>
<P>
"Merrill Lynch's move puts it far in the lead among foreign
brokerage houses seeking to manage a share of the multi-trillion
dollar cache held by Japan's legendary savers," Los Angeles Times
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The financial deregulation of Japan has long been seen as a big
opportunity for foreign companies. The massive holdings of
Japanese stocks, bonds and bank deposits by individual citizens
have generally performed poorly during the 1990s. But the
traditionally cautious Japanese investors are not likely to send a
large portion of their savings abroad, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday, Merrill Lynch said that
following the initial establishment of 30 offices, it expects to
steadily expand its private client business in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch became the first foreign securities firm to open
a representative office in Japan in 1964. It said that with its
new business, Japanese investors will be able to choose from a
broad range of financial products including investment trusts,
domestic and foreign equities, convertible bonds, warrants and
fixed income securities.

<HEADLINE> East China's Qingdao City to Improve Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao, a port city and also
a popular seaside resort of east China's Shandong Province, will
further improve its investment environment and intensify
investment promotion this year.
</P>
<P>
More money will be spent on the expansion of the existing
airport and on improving service on existing air routes and adding
new international air routes, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
While striving to provide key development zones with adequate
water and power supplies and improve service to overseas-backed
enterprises, the city will also construct China's largest
container berth at Qianwan Port.
</P>
<P>
The city will prepare a database containing 30 projects
involving sale of property rights, transfer of stocks and
operation rights, 20 projects involving comprehensive agricultural
development, 20 rural projects, ten infrastructure projects, ten
high-tech projects and ten service trade projects for overseas
investors to select.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao will also try more ways to introduce overseas
investment, and will establish close relations with business
associations of key capital exporting countries and international
intermediary service organizations.
</P>
<P>
It will work out an investment promotion plan and a package of
preferential policies concerning state-owned enterprises in
selling property rights to overseas investors in a bid to cater to
growing demand of transnational companies hoping to purchase
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The city chalked up 5.1 billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade,
and made an actual use of about one billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment in 1997, a rise of eight percent over the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng, Juncker: Li's Luxembourg Tour a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker Friday agreed that
Li's current Luxembourg visit has turned out to be a success.
</P>
<P>
They said this in a 30-minute meeting with the Chinese and
local press here on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said Li's visit has scored fruitful results, and its
success has brought about fine prospects for the Luxembourg-China
ties.
</P>
<P>
This visit indicates that China attaches great importance to
its ties with the European Union (EU) countries, including
Luxembourg which is likely to further play its positive role in
enhancing the relations between China and the EU nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Juncker added this visit serves to strengthen mutual contacts
and bring both sides closer in viewpoints on many issues.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Li earlier Friday covered areas of bilateral
relations and regional and international issues of common
interest, in which extensive consensus had been achieved. Both
sides are glad to see bilateral economic cooperation items are
proceeding in a normal way, Juncker added.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid development has created great interest among the
Luxembourg people, Juncker said, adding his country greatly
appreciates the achievements China has scored in developing its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's responsible attitude and positive role in the
Southeast Asian financial crisis, he noted that Luxembourg
supports China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), as China has played an important role in the world trade.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing to Juncker's viewpoints, Li said his visit has served
to increase mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China appreciates Luxembourg's efforts to improve
the China-EU ties when it was the EU rotating chairman, and that
China stands ready to further ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Describing the EU as an important polar, he elaborated that the
world should be varied and the multi-polarization trend is
accelerating, as this is conducive to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
All countries, big or small, have their own merits and
advantages, and may make contributions to world progress and
Luxembourg's history has proved this, the Chinese premier said,
adding "We appreciate what the Luxembourg people have
achieved."

<P>
The fundamental experiences China has drawn in its development
course is the proper handling of the relationship among reform,
development and stability, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
On the questions of world multi-polarization and human rights,
Juncker criticized a handful of people in the world for seeking
hegemonism in the past dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, all countries should be dialogue partners on equal
footing and a new world behavior norm should be forged on the
basis of this principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the world multi-polarization and for peace, the
state-to-state equality is important, the prime minister said.
The EU nations, including Luxembourg, may play positive roles in
this process, and the EU and China may join hands on the shared
challenges with which mankind is now faced.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that during his talks with Li, both sides
dwelled on the human rights issue. Luxembourg, just like China,
hopes to solve their differences on this issue through dialogue,
rather than through confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions relating to the Iraqi weapons inspection
crisis and whether the Chinese renminbi would devalue, Li noted
that the U.N. Security Council resolutions on the weapons
inspection should be implemented in a comprehensive and
down-to-earth manner, and that Iraq should undertake full
cooperation with the U.N. to fulfill its obligations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Li noted that Iraq's sovereignty, national
dignity and its reasonable concern for national defense and
security should be respected.
</P>
<P>
"We support the diplomatic efforts and oppose the use of force,
as once the armed conflict occurs, it will do no good to Iraq and
the Middle East as a whole. It could only be a disaster," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China urges all parties concerned to take a wise
attitude and work to solve this problem through dialogue and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li also explained that the Chinese leaders have time and again
made it clear that the renminbi will by no means devalue, as China
is sincere in keeping promise.
</P>
<P>
"We mean what we say, for we are able to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
A stable value of the renminbi will help stabilize the
financial situation in Asia and comply with China's own benefit,
the premier added.

BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China's rich marine resources
are expected to provide the country with 500 billion yuan-worth of
products by the year 2000, Beijing-based "International Business
Daily" reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the output value will be gained from aquatic

percent of the crude salt consumed in the country will be
extracted from its seas and oceans.
</P>
<P>
China's marine industry grew at an average annual rate of 25
percent in recent years. The output value yielded from ocean rose
to 280 billion yuan in 1996, becoming a new field for economic
growth, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China leads the world in aquatic and sea salt
production. It ranks third in shipbuilding and fourth in container
transport.
</P>
<P>
Its output of offshore crude oil increased to 16 million tons
in 1997 and that of offshore gas was 4 billion cubic meters.

NAGANO, Japan, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Alsgaard of Norway
outraced his countryman Bjoern Daehlie in the final 200 meters to take
the gold medal in the men's 15km cross-country freetyle pursuit race
on Saturday at the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, who came into Nagano as top lead of World Cup
points, denied Daehlie a record-setting seventh gold to had a two-race
combined time of one hour seven minutes and 01.7 seconds at the hilly
Snow Harp course in Hakuba in frequent rain.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie, who won his sixth Winter Olympic gold in the men's 10km
classical on Thursday, took the silver medal by 1.1 seconds behind
Alsgaard in 1:07:02.8.
</P>
<P>
Kazakstan's veteran Vladimir Smirnov won the bronze in 1:07:31.5.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's freestyle race was the second leg of the two-day pursuit
event combined with 10km calssical race.
</P>
<P>
Alsgaard, gold medalist of the 30km classical in the 1994
Lillehammer Olympics, started fifth place 24 seconds adrift of Daehlie
based on the results of Thursday's 10km calssical, but he caught up
with the leader before the 8-km point and overhauled him in the final
200 meters after a breathtaking two-man race.
</P>
<P>
"I decided that I would lay behind, wait, wait, and rest for the
finish," Alsgaard said. "I used a lot of strength catching Bjoern,
and I felt I couldn't make a big move in the heavy uphills. I just
wanted to rest as much as possible and focus on the sprint."
</P>
<P>
Although he thought his 24 seconds deficit might be too much to
catch Caehlie, he said he felt strong. "i thought it would be too
much, but today was my day."
</P>
<P>
Alsgaard was moved by his victory, especially after dropping out of
the 30km sereval days ago. "The gold in Lillehammer was a big
surprise. Now after this goal I am very happy."
</P>
<P>
He also said failing to finish the 30km may have helped him
conserve energy for Saturday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Satisfied with Bulgaria's Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Friday expressed satisfaction with Bulgaria's control of
its inflation and budget deficit and promised more loans to the
East European country.
</P>
<P>
IMF Mission Leader to Bulgaria Anne McGuirk said that two
loans, some 80 million U.S. dollars each, are expected to be
released in March and April after Sofia meets all its commitments
to IMF.
</P>
<P>
The loans are the last part of a 14-month stand-by arrangement
agreed between the IMF and Bulgaria in March last year to help
bail Bulgaria out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing Bulgaria's economic performance, McGuirk gave a
positive assessment to Bulgaria's compliance with the conditions of
the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate and the budget deficit were below the
projected limits, and the economy was recovering faster than
expected, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, some of the commitments assumed under the
arrangement have yet to be met, such as passage of legislation
making the State Savings Bank (SSB) a commercial bank, and a
Deposit Guaranty Act.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Prime Minister Hosts Banquet for Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of
Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker said today that the visit by
Chinese Premier Li Peng to his country marked further development
of the relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in honor of Li Peng, Juncker said a good momentum
of development has emerged in the relations between Luxembourg and
China since his visit to China two years ago. And the visit by
the Chinese premier further accelerated the development of the
co-operation between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Friendship "encourages us to explore ways to solve differences
between us," he said, adding that "only dialogue can bring
countries closer in their viewpoints."
</P>
<P>
He said that while Luxembourg was chairman of the European
Union (EU) it had worked to improve and develop relations between
China and the EU, and now relations between EU and China embrace
good prospects.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries will join efforts in safeguarding world
peace and stability," Juncker said.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Li Peng said he was very pleased to have
returned a visit to the one made by Juncker to China in February
1996, and expressed thanks for the hospitality he had received.
</P>
<P>
Li said he and Juncker exchanged views at a meeting earlier
Friday on bilateral ties and regional and international issues of
common interest and reached broad consensus, which has helped
increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have always maintained that countries, big or
small, can make contribution to world civilization and the
progress of the human kind.
</P>
<P>
"China is now engaged in its modernization drive and thus needs
a long-term peaceful international environment. We also need to
learn from all advanced experiences from other countries," Li
said. "We are willing to develop co-operation of long-term
stability with EU countries including Luxembourg."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said he agreed with Juncker on the polarization of the
world while meeting the press this afternoon. He said, the world
should not be dominated by one or two countries but should be
jointly run by all countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the friendship and co-operation
between China and Luxembourg will gain further development in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Carrard: IOC Needs Unified Medical Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 14 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Director General Francois Carrard said at a press
briefing on Saturday that the IOC needed a unified medical code to
fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch decided on Friday that IOC
will set up a working group to review the use of marijuana. The
decision was made after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS)
overturned IOC's decision to disqualify Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati from the games and strip him of the gold medal he won in
the men's giant slalom event.
</P>
<P>
"The working group has been appointed to look at the issue of the
use of marijuana among athletes at the Olympics -- it is a matter of
the utmost serious concern.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of doping. It is a matter of social and ethical
concern and fundamental values are at stake," Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
"The court (CAS) itself stated they don't suggest for a moment the
use of marijuana should be condoned," added the Director General.
</P>
<P>
"The working group will have a broader mission beyond the doping
agenda. It is a question of ethics and the example athletes who
participate in the games should set to the youth of the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed at the briefing that seven athletes had tested
positive for marijuana in three previous games.
</P>
<P>
In order to find a best solution of the case, Carrard said the
unification of the medical code might be one. "The Rebagliati case is
a perfect illustration of the need within the Olympic movement for a
simple unified code dealing with all the issues, and we are going to
intensify our efforts in that direction.
</P>
<P>
"We want this to be in place (unified medical code) so a new policy
is in place by the Sydney Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Samaranch appointed a working group comprising the four
IOC vice presidents Pal Schmitt, Richard W. Pound, Anita Defrantz and
Juge Keba Mbaye as well as Prince Alexandre de Merode, Chairman of the
IOC Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
Carrard will serve as its secretary.
</P>
<P>
The working group will have to submit recommendations to the IOC as
to future policy and the procedure to be followed so that the IOC may
review its rules as soon as possible, taking into account all elements
of concern.

<HEADLINE> 600 Deserters Return to Sri Lankan Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 600 deserters have
returned to their original posts since the Sri Lankan Defense
Ministry issued a directive Tuesday appealing to them to meet the
February 20 deadline for an amnesty, military sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said these deserters had reported for duty at
various security establishments in the three services and the
police forces since the directive was issued.
</P>
<P>
The directive said the amnesty declared by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga had already come into force and would continue till
midnight on February 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the amnesty granted on the occasion of the country's 50th
anniversary of independence on February 4, those who report to
their former ranks would receive no inquiries or penalties.
</P>
<P>
The military has repeatedly said that those who fail to return
before the deadline would be arrested, as the deserters' names and
addresses would be provided to relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Those who employ the deserters would be prosecuted under the
army act.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 24,000 have deserted the army in the past 20 years,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered amnesty to army deserters on six
occasions since 1995 and more than 10,000 deserters have
reportedly returned. The last amnesty announced by the government
was in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1995 statistics, Sri Lanka's armed forces had
about 125,300 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Military service is voluntary in the country, where a brutal
ethnic war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and
government troops has been going on for more than 14 years.

<HEADLINE> Italy Prefers Diplomatic Efforts in Ending Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini will continue diplomatic efforts to end the Iraqi crisis
during his visit to the United States, an Italian cabinet
statement said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Italy hopes to "maintain the exchange of information and views
with principal partners and allies that have been in effect since
the beginning of the Iraqi crisis," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to launch a military strike
against Iraq if it does not allow the U.N. weapons inspectors to
carry out unlimited checks for weapons of mass destruction. Dini
is to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
Washington Monday to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among several "urgent initiatives", the Italian foreign
minister is expected to suggest that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan go to Baghdad to mediate an end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Italy, along with the rest of the international community,
wants to see the "elimination of weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq, which requires inspection activities over the entire Iraqi
territory," Dini told the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the Iraqi leaders to take constructive
action to avoid military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's full co-operation with the U.N. weapons inspectors is
the only way to the lift of the U.N. embargo, the statement said.

ROME, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government on Friday
expressed concerns over the growing danger of a military conflict
over the U.N. weapons inspections issue in Iraq, saying that Iraq
should comply with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
According to a government communique issued Friday, Foreign
Affairs Minister Lamberto Dini told a cabinet meeting that Iraq
should permit the necessary nuclear inspections across its
territory because both Italy and the international community want
to see the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the efforts made by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to find a peaceful solution are still of great
significance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Friday
at a rally in Florence that "the possibility of a war still
exists" and "we have the right to know everything."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Has No Right to Strike Against Iraq: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has not been
authorized to stage military strikes against Iraq, Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Gulf war in 1991, no U.N. Security Council
resolutions on the Iraqi issue have given rights to any country to
use force against Iraq, Tarasov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov's remarks were in response to U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen who told a press conference Thursday that the
U.S. has the right to take military action against Iraq and there
is no need to get the U.N. permission for the move.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit, held
talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergevev and Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primokov mainly on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sergevev accused the U.S. of being uncompromising in dealing
with Iraq and rushing to make military preparations against
Baghdad before diplomatic avenues are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that a U.S. military strike against Iraq would
harm the two countries' post-Cold War military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cohen replied that U.S. President Bill Clinton has exercised
great caution in handling the long-running Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Primokov said that Russia will not establish an international
alliance for opposing military strikes against Iraq. He said that
he had "fruitful" talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on telephone Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for home on Friday, Cohen visited a base on the
Moscow suburb for storing and reusing nuclear wastes.

MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov on Friday denied claims that
Russia was involved in the assassination attempt on the Georgian

In an interview with Russian television reporters, Kulikov said

Those behind the terrorist attack may hide in Moscow or
elsewhere in Russia, he admitted. But Russian leaders have

attempt.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 laid-off
women workers have received vocational training at week-end
schools catered specially to their needs in this east China
metropolis over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 of them have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 250 such schools across the city, the
first of which established at the beginning of 1996 by the
Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Women account for a larger part of China's rising
unemployment. The week-end schools have become an ideal base to
provide re-employment training for laid-off women workers, which
provide a large amount of re-employment information and a variety
of training courses at low costs.
</P>
<P>
Some of the schools have even granted free training or training
at reduced fees for those with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Three-hundred more week-end schools are planned to open in
Shanghai this year, aiming to train some 10,000 more women, and
1,000 of them will enjoy free training.

<HEADLINE> Age of China's Ape-man Found Younger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Australian
professors have jointly conducted research and found that the
Yuanmou Man, the oldest ape-man fossils ever found in China, is
100,000 to 200,000 years younger than it used to be believed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists unearthed fossils of homo erectus in
Yuanmou County, southwest China's Yunnan Province in 1965 and
determined they dated back 1.7 million years. The fossils, named
after where they were found as of Yuanmou Man, were the oldest
homo erectus fossils ever discovered in China.
</P>
<P>
Huang Peihua, a professor with the Chinese University of
Science and Technology in east China's Hefei city, got samples of
the fossils at the Yuanmou ruins.
</P>
<P>
Huang and his Australian partners have worker for three years
on the fossils and determined a new conclusion with the most
advanced age-determining measures.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that China's Yuanmou Man's living time was
every much close to that of Turkana, another branch of homo
erectus found in Africa. They all belong to early homo erectus.
</P>

JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's State Police have
issued a ban on the holding of congresses, conferences and
gatherings or parties during the week prior to and after the
general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
scheduled for early next month.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be in force from February 22 to March 18, said
national police spokesman Brig. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar here Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
"Any congress or conference should be organized before or after
the period covered by the ban," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the police would deploy 16,000 officers in all parts of
the capital to make the session a success.
</P>
<P>
The general session, to be held from March 1 to 11, will elect
a president and a vice president for the 1998-2003 term.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the police can take firm measures against
those involved in riots that have disrupted peace and order," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bachtiar said recent riots in several towns in Java, including
Rembang, Tuban, Bojonegoro, Jember and Banyuwangi, caused material
losses totaling 3.5 billion rupiah (466,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Does not Have Nuclear Capability: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has neither the
technological capability nor the intention of making nuclear
weapons, said Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Nikitovich
Mikhailov on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov was responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's recent remarks indicating that Iran is making atomic
weapons, the Interfax Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), Mikhailov said, adding that the IAEA has inspected the
nuclear facilities in Iran many times but discovered no problems.
</P>
<P>
And the minister stressed that the nuclear power station to be
built by Iran with Russian assistance is purely for peaceful use.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want
to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian
nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly asked Moscow to abandon its plan to
help Tehran build a nuclear power station under an agreement
between the two countries signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Russia has so far refused to yield to U.S. pressure even though
the U.S. has threatened to suspend economic assistance to Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has carved out a per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 5,000 U.S. dollars to be
met by 2000, according to a municipal urban planning official.
</P>
<P>
The official told the ongoing first session of the 11th
Municipal People's Congress that by the end of the century the
service industry should account for 48 percent of the city's GDP,
and the urbanization rate should be 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the first phase of a number of
infrastructural projects should be completed by then to ease
traffic problems. They include the Pudong International Airport, a
railway terminal and a deep-water container port.
</P>
<P>
The official also said the per capita green coverage in the
downtown area of the metropolis will exceed 3.5 square meters by
2000, while an area of 3.6 million square meters of old housing
will be demolished or renovated.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, he said, Shanghai is expected to have a comprehensive
economic power equivalent to an international metropolis with its
per capita GDP approaching 10,000 U.S. dollars. The service
industry will make up 50 percent of the total GDP and its
urbanization rate will go up to 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
By then, Shanghai will have a more complete urban traffic
condition and 20 modern residential parks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Sierra Leone's President to Restore Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
urged Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, elected president of Sierra Leone, to
quickly return to Freetown to restore function of his government,
a State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the democratically elected government of President
Kabbah will quickly return to Freetown and that calm will soon be
restored," said spokesman James Rubin at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said that the United States will be working with the
Kabbah government and the international community to address the
pressing needs of the civilian population in the country.
</P>
<P>
The legitimate government of President Kabbah was ousted in a
coup last May by the Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council-Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
But the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) has driven out
the military junta and has taken control of almost the whole
Freetown, capital of the African country, after a fighting in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told news reporters Friday that the leadership of the
junta has fled the country. He said the United States urged all
forces to "exercise restraint, avoid civilian casualties and
respect the human rights of all parties."

<HEADLINE> Multilateral Investment Treaty is Not Good Enough, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is not
ready to conclude protracted negotiations on a global investment
agreement by a scheduled April deadline.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce
Secretary William Daley stated on Friday that there are too many
flaws in the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment to
allow the United States to sign onto the deal in its present form.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement at this stage is simply not good enough,"
Barshefsky said. "It is going to require very substantial work to
make this agreement one the United States would be comfortable in
signing."
</P>
<P>
The proposed investment agreement, being discussed by 29 member
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), is designed to provide new protections for the
trillions of dollars in investments that flow across borders
annually.
</P>
<P>
The deal is strongly supported by multinational corporations
but is equally opposed by environmentalists, consumer groups and
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations started in Paris in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky refused to state U.S. objections. However, the draft
proposal would outlaw use of the Helms-Burton law, passed by
Congress in 1996 to tighten the U.S. embargo on Cuba. It penalizes
foreign companies that invest in or use properties in Cuba that
were confiscated without compensation since the Cuban revolution
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be moving forward to change any of our laws to
comply with what is now on the table," Daley claimed.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the 29 nations are scheduled to hold
discussions in Paris next Monday and Tuesday to determine what to do
next.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today expressed its serious concern over the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed by the UN secretary-general's special envoy
to the country on its latest developments, the Security Council
expressed its concern over the very unstable situation in part of
the country and over the continuing losses of civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council emphasized that the international
humanitarian law must be observed. It called for the humanitarian
assistance to be activated, including the cross-border operations,
and full and unfetered access to the people in need.
</P>
<P>
The council called for safety and security for all the
humanitarian personnel in Sierra Leone to be guaranteed. It called
for national reconciliation and comprehensive mobilization in
accordance with the agreement reached last October.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the Economic Community of the West
African States (ECOWAS) to cooperate fully with the UN
secretary-general's special envoy.
</P>
<P>
An army coup took place in Sierra on May 25, 1997, which
toppled the elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The 16-nation
ECOWAS formed a military arm to help Sierra Leone restore the
oustered president. The force and the Junta soldiers have
exchanged fierce fires these days around the city Freetown which
has forced half a million civilians to flee and led to loss of
civilian lives.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: US Follows Its Own Objective in Striking Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister
Riyadh al-Qaysi said here Friday that the United states was
following its own objective to launch a strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Al-Qaysi said that the
U.S. military threat was not aimed at reinforcing the UNSCOM
(U.N. Special Commission on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction), but "is to use military force per se".
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the U.S. threat to attack Iraq if it
does not grant full access to U.N. inspectors to all the sites
where weapons of mass destruction are suspected to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he told reporters the location of the eight
presidential sites, which Iraq has agreed to give access to
U.N. inspectors appointed by U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaysi also refuted U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy
Berger's words in a news conference earlier on Friday in
Washington, that Iraq is always in breach of U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq challenged Berger and his administration to produce
one U.N. Security Council resolution that will authorize the use
of force against Iraq when commenting on what Berger said that
the U.S. has U.N. authorization to use force.
</P>
<P>
Now three permanent members of the Security Council, namely,
Russia, China and France, do not want war with Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Berger was launching a campaign against Iraq that was
"being conducted on the basis of lies and deception and should not
be taken by anyone in the world as being a justifiable basis for
war."
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Berger also alleged that the objective
of a military campaign is to eliminate the threat of the use of
weapons of mass destruction by Iraq against its neighbors and the
world, saying he considered UNSCOM to be the body responsible for
making such determination.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these words, Al-Qaysi said that "UNSCOM has not
made any reference to any existing threat as of now by Iraq
against its neighbors or account of the existence of threat of
weapons of mass destruction".
</P>
<P>
He also accused British Foreign Minister Robin Cook of making
the same false allegation.

<HEADLINE> Berger Outlines Purpose of Military Action against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger said on Friday that the purpose of a military
action is to diminish Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and
reduce its ability to threaten its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's weapons of mass destruction threat and its capacity
to lash out at its neighbors will be significantly diminished,"
Berger said at the national Press Club in Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
The United States has assembled a mighty force in the Gulf in
preparation for a "substantial" air strike on Iraq with more
attack and support aircraft flying to the region.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, 19 warplanes, including six F-16
fighter jets, sic F-117A fighters, six B-52 bombers and one B-1
bomber, have taken off from their domestic bases on their way to
the Gulf. The arrival of these warplanes put the total of U.S.
aircraft in the region to about 350. There are more than 20
warships, including two aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
And over 2,000 Marines from the Mediterranean and 3,000
soldiers from the mainland are expected to arrive soon in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
But Berger admitted that even with such formidable force
gathered in the Gulf, the United States could not "destroy
everything." What Washington could do, he said, was to "have a
real impact" as a warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Berger warned Iraq that the United States would be "prepared to
act again if we have evidence he is trying to rebuild his
weapons of mass destruction capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Berger dismissed any diplomatic approaches recently initiated
by the international community because he said they did not
"best serve America's national interests."
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the possibility of removing Saddam Hussein
from power as it needs U.S. ground forces for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
"The costs and risks associated with such a venture are high
and not essential to achieving our strategic interests," he
said. "It would require a major land campaign and risk large
losses of our soldiers."
</P>
<P>
Berger declined to tell any specific date for the U.S. air
and naval force in the region to stage an attack on Iraq, saying
only that a buildup in the region continues, but not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried, up till now, not to impose artificial
deadlines because the president (Bill Clinton) genuinely would
like this to be resolved both on a principled basis and on a
peaceful basis," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Police Blamed for Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The shooting at
Lesotho's largest industrial estate in Maseru Friday in which a
woman was killed was the result of carelessness on the part of
the police, Radio Lesotho reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The radio announced on Friday night that police commissioner
Bolulu Makoaba said the shooting was done by a junior officer who
was not ordered to do so.
</P>
<P>
"In a situation such as existed at the Thetsane industrial
estate today, tear-gas should have been used," he said.
</P>
<P>
A woman was shot dead by the police during a riot which broke
out at the estate early Friday after about 2,800 workers went on
strike Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The workers and their management have been involved in a wage
dispute since last week, and workers held management hostage on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The workers spent the night at their factory until they were
evicted by court order on Friday morning, which resulted in riot
and the subsequent shooting by police.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which is one of the largest clothing
manufacturers in Lesotho, is owned by a Taiwanese company.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese closed their business and fled to the nearby
Free State province of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lesotho police were late on Friday night patrolling
Maseru streets to ensure that trouble did not erupt overnight,
the radio said.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Dr. David Satcher, an
African-American, was sworn in Friday as surgeon general of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, acknowledging it was a difficult fight
to get Satcher confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, called
Satcher "the right advocate for America's public health."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Satcher will provide "plain talk and sound
advice" on a number of public health issues.
</P>
<P>
Satcher, a 56-year-old doctor from Tennessee, promised to "make
the greatest difference for those with the greatest needs."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Senate confirmed Satcher with a 63-35
vote, overcoming objections from mostly conservative senators who
opposed his support for some late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
Satcher said he will emphasize early childhood health,
opposition to teen smoking and drugs and the need for exercise and
good nutrition.

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders Call on Iraq to Observe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian and
Turkish top leaders Friday called on Iraq to comply with the
U.N. resolutions so as to avert a possible U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached after exchanging views via telephone
by King Hussein of Jordan with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders made the call at a time when the international
diplomatic efforts to help solve the Iraqi-U.N. crisis are almost
exhausted, due to Iraq's insistence on opening suspected sites to
international arms inspectors under certain conditions while the
U.S. threatens to use military force imminently to compel Iraq to
open all the sites without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
During the phone discussions, the king emphasized to the other
leaders the necessity of Iraqi observance to the U.N. resolutions
as the only way to put an end to the crisis, official Radio
Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Only if Iraq complied fully with the resolutions, could any
escalation of the crisis or military action be avoided, he
said.
</P>
<P>
If any war happened, it might bring catastrophe not only to
Iraq but also to the whole region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four leaders also discussed the possibility of
brokering a diplomatic solution to the crisis at the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
Iraq offered Wednesday to open eight presidential sites to
international arms inspectors appointed by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and gave a time limit of two months for the
inspectors to carry out their mission of dismantling its
mass-destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. immediately rejected such a proposal and threatened
to carry out military action against Iraq in a week or so.

"I am traveling to Asia to reaffirm President Clinton's
commitment to help nations willing to undertake serious economic
reforms," said Daley. "We must act together to guarantee global
economic security," he stressed.

He also noted that the U.S. will continue to work with Asian
countries to contain the wide-spread crisis. The Secretary also
said the crisis will have an impact on trade, and nations must
work together to prevent backsliding from economic reforms and to
keep markets open.

During his trip to Japan, Daley will discuss with business and
government officials the need for further reforms to revive the
Japanese economy. He will also urge the Japanese government to
take a leadership role in promoting trade liberalization
throughout south east Asia.

Daley is another major figure of the U.S. government to tour
Asia for a fact-finding mission following the similar visits by
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Deputy Secretary of
Treasury Lawrence H. Summers last month.
