Indian-made nuclear reactors not open to safeguards : official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ India's home-made nuclear reactors will not
be open to international inspection, according to a top scientist
who was among the key planners of New Delhi's recent nuclear tests.
	   ``There is no question of the (nuclear) reactors we build on our
own being'' monitored by the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency, R. Chidambaram, head of India's Atomic Energy
Commission, told The Associated Press on Friday at the end of an
international conference on nuclear power organized jointly by the
IAEA and AEC.
	   The Indian scientist was responding to a statement from Victor
Mourogov, deputy director general of the IAEA, who said public
acceptance of nuclear energy would grow when all countries allowed
their nuclear ennergy facilities to be monitored by the IAEA.
	   Earlier this week, India began work on two indigenous 500
megawatt nuclear reactors at Tarapore near Bombay, while the latest
overseas contract was signed with Russia in June for a dlrs 2.6
billion sale of two 1,000-megawatt light water reactors that will
be built in southern India.
	   Chidambaram said India had not signed any international treaty,
which would make it mandatory for New Delhi to allow international
regulation of domestically built reactors.
	   Each nuclear facility has its own norms to adhere to,
Chidambaram said.
	   India has other nuclear power reactors bought earlier from
Canada, the United States and Russia that are being monitored by
the IAEA. Of its 10 nuclear power reactors, India had sought
foreign technology for three, including the Kota plant in the
western Rajasthan state. Canadian and American technical
partnership in two of these reactors was suspended in recent years.
	   ``Safeguards are important to the IAEA. We look forward to all
countries being part of that program,'' Mourogov told reporters
earlier.
	   ``Some countries are worried about proliferation,'' he said.
``There is concern that byproducts from commercial nuclear power
should not get diverted to weapons usage ... India, Pakistan and
Israel are three countries that are not part of the safeguards.''
	   Chidambaram said even the five declared nuclear weapon states
did not come under the safeguards, but could voluntarily opt for
them.
	   About 65 scientists from 31 countries at the conference pressed
for the need for nuclear power to meet the increasing demands for
energy in developing countries. The scientists urged the IAEA to
reach out to policy-makers to stress the need for nuclear energy.
	   Mourogov said regional cooperation in designing reactors and
fuel cycle facilities could help reduce concern about weapons
proliferation.
	   IAEA scientist Morris Rosen said the public needed to be
convinced that nuclear energy was safe.
	   ``The problem with the nuclear industry is it speaks to itself
... we speak to believers. We need to go to the media, ministers,
we have to branch away from a nuclear audience,'' Rosen said.
	   Scientists from France, China, Russia, Korea, Ghana and Iran
said practising better economy in managing nuclear plants, as well
as public acceptance, were the key to promoting nuclear energy in
developing countries.

Taiwan takes what it gets in talks with China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Throughout China's long freeze on talks,
Taiwan's cabinet meticulously recorded its every appeal to Beijing
to restore dialogue _ 114 in all between July 1995 and February
1998.
	   Although China finally answered Thursday with an agreement to
pursue future contacts with Taiwan, the number of refusals
underlines a crucial characteristic of their relationship: Taipei
proposes and Beijing disposes.
	   Four agreements reached by the sides over tea in Shanghai boil
down to a decision to talk about talking, still far from Taipei's
hope of restoring the formal dialogue that an angry Beijing froze
in June 1995.
	   Movement may have been accomplished only because Beijing
unilaterally declared that the sides had entered into political
dialogue, a loaded term that Taiwan would have preferred to avoid.
	   But as an isolated democracy considered by China to be a
renegade province facing inevitable reunification, Taiwan can't
easily call the shots.
	   China pours scorn on Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's proposal
for the sides to respect each other's sovereignty.
	   The Beijing government considers the island unworthy of
recognition as an equal. Having diplomatic relations with only 27
countries, Taiwan faces an international community the largely
shares China's views on reunification.
	   The sides first met for landmark talks in Singapore in 1993. Two
years of consultations on practical issues such as fishing rights
followed, until China took umbrage at the U.S. visit of Taiwan's
Lee, called off talks and launched military exercises aimed at
intimidating his supporters.
	   The current trip to China by top Taiwanese negotiator Koo
Chen-fu marks the highest-level contact since Singapore, and the
most positive sign yet that formal dialogue might be restored. The
sides agreed to hold more contacts and Koo's counterpart, Wang
Daohan, agreed to visit Taiwan, maybe next spring.
	   ``Slowly, step-by-step, everything can discussed,'' Koo said. He
called the agreement a ``renewed beginning of relations.''
	   But response to the Shanghai agreement has been muted in Taipei.
The news was all but washed out by coverage of the typhoon that
rampaged across the island Thursday and Friday.
	   The idea of such talks is generally popular, but Taiwanese seems
unsure of what to make of the results of the Shanghai meeting.
	   ``It's difficult to tell what Taiwan's strategic goals are here.
It's under a lot of pressure from the United States and China to
accept whatever it can get,'' asserted Yang Kai-huang, an academic
who heads the Mainland China Studies Association.
	   Although China is adamant that the Taiwan question is an
internal matter, President Bill Clinton's statements in China this
summer weighed in heavily on China's side. Clinton not only made
clear that the United States would not support Taiwan's
independence or entry into the United Nations, but he also urged
reunification _ a departure from past U.S. insistence on peaceful
resolution of their conflict.
	   Faced with these realities, Taiwan treasures the bargaining
chips it has. It parades its vibrant democracy and powerful market
economy before the world, hoping to draw a flattering contrast with
China's authoritarianism.
	   Taiwanese officials frequently fall back on survey data showing
overwhelming support for maintaining the status quo of de facto
independence and rejection of near-term reunification with China.
They ask whether, having applauded Taiwan's peaceful transition to
democracy, the world really wants to see Taiwan's leaders turn
their back on the popular will.
	   Taiwan holds out the prospect of lifting restrictions on
investment in China and a ban on direct trade, transportation and
communication with the mainland _ if only Beijing offers sufficient
gain in return.
	   And it defiantly rejects China's denial of its legitimacy. In
Shanghai, Koo reportedly shocked Chinese officials by referring to
the post-World War II Potsdam conference accord, which turned
Japanese-ruled Taiwan over to the Republic of China, the official
name of the Nationalist regime that ruled mainland China before
fleeing to Taiwan in 1949.

Thai paper criticizes filming of Hollywood movie in national park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A newspaper urged authorities in
Thailand on Saturday not to allow a Hollywood motion picture
featuring ``Titanic'' star Leonardo DiCaprio to be filmed on a
tropical island which has been designated a national park.
	   Local authorities have begun negotiations with 20th Century Fox,
which hope to film ``The Beach'' on Phi Phi Island, a picturesque
resort destination off the southern Thailand coast.
	   The discussions reportedly include talks on removing some local
plants on a popular Phi Phi beach and the planting of about 100 new
coconut trees.
	   But the English-language The Nation daily said in an editorial
that the film project would violate laws designed to protect the
island from certain kinds of activities and development.
	   ``The island needs quiet preservation and not Hollywood fame and
mass market tourism,'' the newspaper said.
	   Known for breathtaking limestone cliffs which jut out of the
Andaman Sea, Phi Phi island has lost some of its charm as a
secluded outpost recently due to its increasing popularity with
tourists and resort property developers.

 &UR; Franchitti takes pole position &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ Scotland's Dario Franchitti
took his fifth pole position of the season Saturday and continued
his strong run in recent weeks to go in as favorite for Sunday's
Australian IndyCarnival race.
	   Franchitti, who has won three of the past four races on the CART
FedEx circuit, including the Grand Prix of Houston on Oct. 4,
powered his Target Chip Ganassi Reynard-Honda around the
4.5-kilometer (2.795-mile) temporary street circuit in 1 minute,
32.288 seconds for an average speed of 175.464 kilometers per hour
(109.028 mph).
	   That broke the track record of 1:32.310 set Friday by Italian
Alex Zanardi, who has won six races this season and has already
clinched the season points title. Zanardi was forced to sit out the
last 12 minutes of qualifying Saturday when he appeared to blow an
engine.
	   Zanardi qualified second with that time while Christian
Fittipaldi, who was injured in last year's race here, is third and
Canada's Paul Tracy, Franchitti's Kool Green teammate, fourth.
Americans Bryan Herta and Michael Andretti were fifth and sixth.
	   Eighteen of the 28 starters were able to improve on their Friday
time under perfect weather conditions.
	   ``It's very special to win it,'' Franchitti said. ``I didn't
think I could do it. I just bashed a few curbs and took a wild
lap.''
	   Saturday's session was delayed by 15 minutes when officials had
to repair damaged asphalt around a manhole cover on the track with
quick-dry cement.
	   Franchitti, whose other wins this year were at Road America at
Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, and Vancouver, had said Friday that he
liked his chances for pole position.
	   ``There's a lot more left in the car and I'm still getting up to
my limit,'' said Franchitti.
	   Zanardi, who will drive on the Formula One circuit next year for
Williams, was the pole winner here last year but finished fourth.
Scott Pruett, the 1997 Australian winner, qualified 12th fastest
Saturday.
	   Sunday's race will be 65 laps, a total distance of 292.38
kilometers (181.675 miles). (djp)

Report: Malaysian Police arrest three for demonstrating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police arrested three
people for demonstrating at a rally organized by an opposition
coalition that has campaigned for the release of jailed dissident
Anwar Ibrahim, the national news agency Bernama said Saturday.
	   The arrests occurred during a protest by about 3,000 people in
the southern town of Malacca late Friday night.
	   ``They ignored repeated police orders to disperse and the
organizers proceeded with the speeches,'' said the city's police
chief, Osman Mohd. Yusuf.
	   The rally in the port town was part of the protest campaign by a
new coalition of opposition groups that was formed after Anwar, the
Southeast Asian nation's former former deputy prime minister, was
taken into custody on Sept. 20.
	   The groups have routinely defied police threats by organizing
unsanctioned gatherings to call for Anwar's release and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the ousted leader was
subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up to
eliminate the political challenge he had posed to Mahathir. The
former No. 2 leader's trial begins Nov. 2.
	   A pro-Anwar protest was planned in the capital, Kuala Lumpur,
for Saturday but it was not immediately clear if it would take
place as scheduled.
	   Meanwhile, a government minister has blamed foreign media
coverage of opposition street rallies in Malaysia for scaring away
tourists.
	   The hotel occupancy rate had dwindled to 54 per cent from 67 per
cent in the same period last year, Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Friday.
	   ``CNN has been successful in portraying the so-called havoc in
Malaysia in a manner that will keep away tourists from coming
here,'' he told reporters.
	   The minister also criticized the CNBC news network for what he
called distorted news coverage. CNBC has denied previous
accusations of biased coverage by Malaysian officials.

Cambodian government claims opposition provoked violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's government issued a
report Saturday which blamed the political opposition for the
outbreak of violence after national elections in July, a move seen
as the latest salvo in a public relations war with opposition
forces.
	   The report, entitled ``The defense of young democracy in
Cambodia,'' noted that the July election results were judged
credible by international polling monitors and said the opposition
and journalists exaggerated reports of irregularities, intimidation
and violence.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority
in the election, claiming 64 of 122 Parliament seats up for grabs,
but not the two-thirds majority needed to form the next government
alone.
	   The two-party opposition, winners of the remaining 58 seats,
claimed Hun Sen used fraud and intimidation to win at the polls.
	   When its allegations were mostly ignored by election officials
and the nation's highest court _ both seen as loyal to Hun Sen _
the opposition rallied its supporters and led massive
antigovernment demonstration's through Phnom Penh's streets.
	   The 60-some-page ``white paper'' claims the demonstrations were
part of a confrontational strategy by the opposition designed to
deliberately provoke the authorities to resort to violence.
	   Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations Sept. 7
after grenades were thrown at his Phnom Penh home. The opposition
claimed the attack was staged as an excuse to begin the crackdown.
	   ``The opposition forces finally got the violence that they had
been trying to provoke for weeks,'' the report said. ``The police
had no choice but to defend themselves against the rock-throwing
mobs by all means, including batons, water cannons, and even
gunfire.''
	   At least four demonstrators were killed by police and dozens
more were arrested or wounded in the violence.
	   In the aftermath of the crackdown, U.N. human rights
investigators discovered more than 20 bodies, many bearing signs
torture, prompting speculation that the death tally could be much
higher.
	   A series of negotiations mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk led
to an end to the violence and the ceremonial opening of parliament
on Sept. 24.
	   But the two opposition party leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, left Cambodia the next day and have not returned
because they say they are not safe inside the country.
	   Sam Rainsy traveled to the United States and Europe to lobby the
international community to support the opposition's position.
During his trip the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
resolution calling for Hun Sen to face an international tribunal
for alleged violations of international humanitarian law.
	   Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said Friday that the white
paper was drafted to counter what he described as a confused
international perception of the political situation in Cambodia.
	   ``There is a lot of confusion about what is happening in
Cambodia,'' he said, adding that misconceptions were particularly
strong in the United States.

Taylor, back from the dead, reaches the summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket greats from Dennis
Lillee to the Chappell brothers were telling Mark Taylor that his
career was over and it was time to tuck the bat under his arm and
walk.
	   Just 16 months ago only Taylor didn't think he was a dead man.
He went 20 straight innings without a half century and was in the
worst slump of any Australian captain in history.
	   ``His bat consisted entirely of edges and there was glue upon
the soles of his boots _ he didn't look capable of scoring 34, let
alone 334,'' wrote cricket columnist Peter Roebuck after Taylor
joined Sir Donald Bradman as the highest scoring Australian on
Friday in the second test against Pakistan.
	   On Saturday, Taylor decided against batting on to pass Bradman,
his declaration at 599 for four coming as an anti-climax at home
where news bulletins all day tipped he would chase runs for another
40 minutes. His decision also cost him a chance to beat Brian
Lara's world record 375 and left Taylor and Bradman as equal
seventh on the all-time highest test score list.
	   ``The record doesn't mean anything,'' Taylor said Friday. ``I'd
prefer to win this game, that's what I'm here for.''
	   The Australian team held a vote Friday night and decided that
Taylor should bat on. He ignored it.
	   The innings itself, and a declaration which put the team cause
ahead of his own record hopes, was inspiring stuff from a man who
brings little artistry but an extraordinary work ethic and
self-belief to the game.
	   ``I give him absolutely full marks for this innings,'' said Bill
Brown, an Australia opener during Bradman's era. ``I've always
liked his style of play and liked the man himself, I think he's a
delightful fellow.''
	   Of course a good character has never been enough in sport where
results are paramount. Taylor's 18-month personal crisis, through
1996 and into 1997, was enough to have him sacked had he been a
mere player instead of the captain of the world's best side.
	   But while Greg and Ian Chappell, the loudest of many detractors,
were demanding he stand aside, Taylor infuriated them with his
determination to stay.
	   Despite the slump, he was leading a winning team. That gave him
the support of his predecessor Allan Border.
	   There was strong speculation that Taylor might be dropped ahead
of the last year's Ashes tour of England.
	   It seemed everyone was taking sides, even the Prime Minister,
John Howard.
	   ``A lot of Australian captains in the past went through the sort
of valleys and troughs of despair and not getting many runs and I
devoutly hope that the Australian selectors stick with Mark,'' said
Howard.
	   The selectors agreed, while the English taunted Taylor.
Representatives from the London Mirror presented a ruffled Taylor
with a three-meter wide bat on his arrival for the Ashes, and after
a run of failures in the warm-up games there was increased talk
that he would be dumped.
	   In a reversal of fortunes, Taylor thrived, scoring 129 in the
Edgbaston first test, but the team lost. Fortune shifted again:
Taylor slipped back into the doldrums and Australia won the series.
While Taylor found it hard to score a run he won all five coin
tosses.
	   ``My future is going to be based around how I play,'' Taylor
admitted on his return from the Ashes tour. ``My captaincy
certainly hasn't fallen away in the last year. It's going to be up
to me to make some runs.''
	   Taylor scored another fine century earlier this year against
India but lost the series.
	   Now, after two years of failing as the team soared and soaring
on the rare occasions the team failed, Taylor has a chance to lead
the team to the summit with his bat rather than his captaincy
brain.
	   He led the team to its first victory in Pakistan for 39 years
during the first test and this innings has placed the team on the
verge of a series win on the subcontinent, Taylor's last major
goal.
	   His old fans were still with him Saturday.
	   ``Congratulations on a fantastic innings,'' Howard said Saturday
in his message to the cricket captain. ``Your tenacity and
durability as a batsman and Australian captain is admirable. All
Australians are excited by your achievement.''
	   The issue dominated sports talkback radio Saturday.
	   ``I've been a cricket fan for 20 years and I've never heard a
300 before,'' said one fan on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
``I couldn't believe it, I was jumping up and down and my guide dog
had never heard me make a noise like that before.''
	   Taylor wasn't the only one with blind faith after all.

Salman Rushdie free to visit India, says interior minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Author Salman Rushdie is welcome to
visit India, but the government is not ready to lift the ban on his
book, The Satanic Verses, India's minister for internal security
said in an interview published Saturday.
	   ``He is an outstanding writer and is welcome to return home,''
The Times of India quoted Lal Krishna Advani as saying.
	   Advani's statement came nearly two weeks after Rushdie
complained in an interview that he was banned from entering India.
He was born in Bombay.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Iran's late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989, claiming
``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
	   Last month, the Iranian government distanced itself from offers
by Iranian groups to pay money to execute the edict. But a
foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who
kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
	   India was the first country in the world to ban ``The Satanic
Verses'' after it provoked angry protests from the Muslim community
in 1988.
	   In 1996, Rushdie's book ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' was withdrawn
from bookshelves within weeks of its release in India after
directions from Indian customs.

Australia declares denying Mark Taylor world record

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) - Australian captain Mark Taylor
forfeited his chance at a world record Saturday when his team
declared its first innings at 599 for four.
	   Taylor, who was 334 not out when he declared, set aside his
attempt to beat the 375-run record of West Indies' Brian Lara when
his team declared on the third day of the second Test in Peshawar
against Pakistan.
	   ``Brian Lara's world record 375 is not important for me, I want
to win the series on the sub-continent,'' Taylor said.
	   Taylor leveled Australia's Sir Don Bradman's 334 record and
said:
	   ``It's nice to be bracketed with Don instead of going for the
world record.''
	   Taylor hammered 32 fours in his 334-run effort and faced 564
balls during his 720 minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Following is the list of triple century makers:
	   B.C. Lara 375 West Indies v England St John's 1993-94
	   G. S. Sobers 365 West Indies v Pakistan Kingston 1957-58

Analysts: buying bubble triggered by U.S. rate cut will burst
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The buying bubble that gave a merry froth to
Asian markets after a surprise U.S. interest rate cut was fun while
it lasted on Friday, but analysts expect the rally in many regional
bourses to fizzle.
	   Underlying problems which have acted as a drag on local markets
_ such as the prolonged economic slump in Japan _ show few signs of
going away anytime soon.
	   ``We remain extremely pessimistic about Asian markets in the
medium to longer term,'' said Desmond Supple, director of emerging
market economic research at Barclays Capital Asia.
	   But Asian stocks may hold onto their gains in the very
short-term, particularly as European and American fund managers
bargain hunt with all that cash they have accumulated after pulling
out of the Pacific rim in recent months.
	   ``We expect this liquidity-driven rally to last at least for the
next few days,'' said Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage
and Associates. ``I want to emphasize the fundamentals may not
change materially.''
	   Optimism that the U.S. interest rate cut would ease a global
credit crunch and aid prospects for a regional recovery fueled the
sharp gains across the Pacific rim on Friday.
	   Hope was king for at least a day in Asia.
	   Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted its
first gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or 2.19
percent, to close at 13,280.54.
	   Fund managers, discounting doubts about whether new laws will
actually buttress Japan's shaky banking system, poured in money to
catch the bullish wave.
	   ``If they're buying in Asia, it's a short-term buy,'' Supple
said. ``The problem is, this rally could create seeds for a far
deeper downturn, down the line,'' when the cash tide ebbs.
	   Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index soared 806.59 points, or
8.9 percent, closing at 9,777.01, its highest level since May 11.
	   The Hong Kong Association of Banks announced a quarter percent
cut in its key deposit rate, and several commercial banks followed
suit.
	   Those snips ``will be reflected on the Hang Seng into the next
few trading sessions'' in the coming week, said analyst Christy
Tan, of Singapore's IDEA financial house.
	   The Straits Times Index in Singapore leaped 94.85 points, or 9.3
percent to close at 1119.60, the biggest gains since February as
blue chip stocks were gobbled up at penny prices.
	   News reports in Singapore referred to ``a sea change in global
sentiment toward the region,'' and defined the U.S. move as ``a
strong sign of confidence in Asian markets.''
	   Andrew Fernow, research director for Vickers Ballas Hong Kong
Ltd. was one of many analysts who pooh-poohed the region-wide rally
on Friday.
	   ``Asia is mired in a crisis with massive debts overhanging and
enormous deflation pressure,'' he said.
	   ``To suggest that the problem can be dealt with overnight or
with a few rate cuts in the U.S. is just absurd.''

Report: interest rates in Singapore set to plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Interest rates charged by Singapore banks will
likely plummet over the coming year to levels not seen since before
the outbreak of the regional economic crisis last year, the
city-state's leading newspaper reported.
	   The Straits Times cited economists as saying that local banks'
prime rate _ the interest they charge their best customers, and the
basis for most other loans _ could fall below 5 percent, well
below's the current 7 percent level.
	   Singapore's three-month interbank rate, which sets the tone for
the prime rate, fell to an 18-month low of 3.375 percent on Friday
after news of the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut, the
report noted.
	   Singapore's largest four banks slashed their prime rates by a
quarter of a percentage point recently, the second such cut in a
month.
	   It was good news for borrowers ranging from large corporations
to individual home owners, all of whom had felt the pinch of higher
repayments and painful financing due to high interest rates.

overtime to give the Los Angeles Kings a victory in their final
home opener at the Forum.
	   Next season the Kings will move from the 31-year-old Forum to

	   Robitaille skated up the left side, took a pass from Rob Blake
and sent a slap shot through the legs of Boston goalie Byron Dafoe.
Robitaille, a longtime fan favorite who returned to the Kings last

	   The Bruins had a power-play goal disallowed early in the second
period that could have been the difference. A video review showed
Chris Taylor's left skate was in the crease.

Gems, jade and pearls featured at annual Myanmar auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Dealers from 13 countries are expected
to bid for 1,386 lots of jade, gems and pearls at the annual
Myanmar Gems Emporium, the Myanmar government said Saturday.
	   The reserve price of dlrs 11.4 million for the lots is lower
than in past sales due to currency devaluations and world economic
instability, but the quality of gems is higher due to improved
efforts to crackdown on smugglers, according to a government-issued
statement received in Thailand.
	   The week-long auction, which ends Thursday, has attracted more
than 300 dealers from 51 companies, including 50 merchants from
China who had not attended previous emporiums.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, produces some of the finest
quality jade, rubies, sapphires and pearls in the world.

Russia introduces civilian plane converted from warplane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia rolled out a new amphibious civilian plane
Saturday based on a warplane design and converted by aircraft
companies from five countries, a news report said.
	   The Be-200 can be used as a 70-seat passenger plane, a cargo
craft or a firefighting plane, said Vladimir Kovalkov, director of
the Irkutsk Aircraft Building Association.
	   It was based on the amphibious warplane Be-40, the ITAR-Tass
news agency quoted Kovalkov as saying. Russian, American, British,
Swiss and Ukrainian companies helped design the new version.
	   The plane was introduced in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, about
4,200 kilometers (2,600 miles) east of Moscow.

EU and Thai researchers criticize official AIDS count in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The number of AIDS cases documented by
the Thai government is far below the actual number of cases and the
inaccuracy of official statistics has greatly impeded the work of
medical workers, according to a press statement from the European
Union received Saturday.
	   The recently completed study by the EU and the Institute of
Population Studies of Chulalongkorn University in Thailand
recommended that alternative ways be found for calculating the real
number of AIDS cases in the Southeast Asian country.
	   The research will be presented at a seminar in Bangkok next
Tuesday.
	   Researchers questioned official claims that the incidence of
HIV/AIDS is on the decline. They cited mortality statistics from
both the northern region in Thailand where AIDS incidence is
highest and the southern provinces where the the number of cases is
is lower.

Baby-faced bullfighter mesmerizes Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 6 Toros 6 is cq &QL;

 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain _ In the bullring, ``El Juli'' has all the moves:
His thick red cape flows like liquid. He curls his lip in an icy
sneer, right in the snorting face of 1,100 pounds (500 kilos) of
pure animal rage. After a razor-close pass, he turns his back and
walks off with a slow, toe-dragging strut.
	   Outside the ring, Julian Lopez is just another tongue-tied
16-year-old. The only clue to his status as Spanish bullfighting's
latest sensation is the crescent-shaped scar on his baby face.
	   Julian only graduated from ``novillero,'' a novice who fights
younger bulls, at the end of the summer. And although he's the
country's youngest full-fledged matador, he's not the first to
achieve that at his age.
	   But his youth and his skill have made a substantial impression
in the serious and dangerous world of bullfighting _ so much so
that El Juli has caught the attention of a national press that
usually doesn't pay much attention to new matadors.
	   Aficionados, meanwhile, are drooling. El Juli's a natural, and
the world is his to conquer, they say. And he still isn't old
enough to drive.
	   ``He's phenomenal. He's been a child prodigy from the very
beginning,'' said Ana Fernandez, who writes for 6 Toros 6, a
leading bullfighting magazine.
	   Bill Lyon, an American who has lived in Spain since 1962 and
worked as a bullfight critic for several Spanish newspapers,
agrees.
	   ``He is definitely the most interesting novillero in decades,''
Lyon said. ``He's gotten off to a brilliant start.''
	   El Juli was carried out of the ring more than 30 times in a row
during the season ending this month _ not because he'd been gored,
but because he made good kills.
	   Bullfighters are also honored by being awarded one or both of
the bull's ears or, for a truly exceptional performance, the tail.
El Juli has earned 160 ears and nine tails as a novillero and
matador.
	   Julian lives, eats and breathes bullfighting. And he has done it
from the tenderest of ages, stabbing his first calf at 10 and
quitting school in eighth grade to do nothing but train.
	   Now, after a stint in Latin America to skirt Spain's minimum age
of 16 for bullfighters, he is a matador in a world of men twice his
age.
	   At 5-foot-8 (1.7 meters), a bull's horns can reach as high as
his neck. The bull can weigh nine times his 132 pounds (60 kilos).
Is he afraid?
	   ``During a bullfight you feel a lot of things, not just fear,''
he said. ``A lot of the time they're nice. You feel jitters and
responsibility.''
	   But he was at a loss when asked about the bull itself, the smell
of its blood on his face, hands and clothes. ``I wouldn't know how
to describe it. It doesn't smell bad, though.''
	   What about the sound of the animal dying? He doesn't know. ``It
snorts. It breathes,'' he said when pressed, answering much like a
child fending off parents who ask what he learned in school that
day.
	   Despite the excitement over his start, experts say it's too soon
to say if El Juli has the stuff of history.
	   Once the next season begins in March, he will be scrutinized
more closely than when he was as a novillero. He'll face bulls that
are bigger, older and smarter. He'll have to fight in the Plaza de
las Ventas in Madrid, where the crowd is famously demanding.
	   There or anywhere else, if he gets gored badly it could spook
him and hamper his style for the rest of his career. ``A lot can go
wrong,'' Lyon said.
	   But for the time being, El Juli is hot. His only problem is
getting used to fame, which makes him a lot more nervous than bulls
do.
	   ``If I had to stand in the arena with a microphone and say
something, I'd be scared to death,'' he said.

	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the damp, cold night
descending outside, Florin Garoj sat on the blanketed floor of a
refugee hut and recalled the moment more than nine years ago when
life changed, perhaps forever.
	   Then he was an engineering student in his final year, preparing
to make his own way in Kisna Reka, his family's village along the
tree-covered mountains about 18 miles (29 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province.
	   But President Slobodan Milosevic revoked the autonomy of Kosovo
and its ethnic Albanian majority in February 1989. Many here say
that launched an era of repression and inevitable rebellion. Today,
the province is on the verge of NATO airstrikes.
	   ``With the loss of autonomy, every single Albanian person could
see they were losing their rights,'' Garoj said Thursday night, his
chin resting in his right hand. ``From that day, normal life for
Albanians ended.''
	   As if on cue, two dull thuds of tank fire sounded outside, far
away from the woods where Garoj and hundreds of other refugees
survive off international aid, resolve and a deep-rooted sense of
community and order.
	   Despite assertions by Milosevic that the Kosovo crackdown his
forces launched in February was against Kosovo Liberation Army
rebels, most refugees camped on a hillside seemed to be villagers
hoping for peace and the restoration of their political rights _
not hardcore revolutionaries.
	   In this makeshift refugee camp, people have little faith in the
political agreement Milosevic signed with NATO, nor with the 2,000
international verifiers who will be brought in to make sure the
Yugoslav president keeps his word. The refugees keep abreast of the
news on battery-powered radios.
	   Despite reports that Serbian forces are withdrawing as required
by NATO, things around Kisna Reka look the same to them.
	   ``The situation is as it was a week ago,'' said Ramadam Nuhaj,
25. ``Nothing has changed.''
	   Their homes are just a few miles (kilometers) away, but all the
refugees except for a few older folks _ including Garoj's parents _
sleep in the ragged camp, fearing further attack from the Serbian
security forces who drove them off earlier this year.
	   ``My parents are very old and they are attached to the place and
the house,'' Garoj explained. ``They've decided that if they have
to die, it will be there.''
	   For the most part, life in the camp is far better than for tens
of thousands of other refugees scattered throughout Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   There are four faucets that pipe in spring water, courtesy of a
British aid agency, and well-made cylindrical huts of tree branches
covered by plastic sheeting, blankets and carpeting. Some people
have wood stoves for heating and cooking, and food and clothing
supplies from aid agencies arrive every few weeks.
	   Camp life is communal, with the clan-based families sharing
supplies and taking in others from overcrowded huts. When new
relief goods arrived Thursday, the residents waited patiently for
their names to be called to collect their allotment.
	   ``We have nothing, but we still have an ordered life with
everyone having their role,'' said a man who only would give a
nickname, Malesory, which is Albanian for ``man of the forest.''
	   But children still tramp through cold, muddy patches in
mismatched, ill-fitting shoes, many without socks. While daytime
movement is relatively free, the scattered shooting and shelling
still heard at night shows the danger continues.
	   With temperatures already dropping below freezing at night, the
oncoming winter threatens to bring widespread sickness, starvation
and death.
	   ``We've always said that if they don't go back to their homes,
there will be a catastrophe,'' warned Fernando del Mundo of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Going home will require the complete withdrawal of Serb forces
from the area and international guarantees of safety, said Nuhaj,
who lives with his wife in the camp.
	   ``We need the international community, because in 24 hours, the
Serbian forces can come back,'' he said.
	   After sunset, with most families asleep in their huts, Garoj and
other men gathered in Nuhaj's hut to share tea served from a pot
and drank from glasses salvaged from a village house.
	   ``Now we have turned into being forest people,'' Garoj sighed.
``I'm an engineer. One day I hope to return to my profession and
continue the normal life.''

A weakened Yeltsin lacks energy for new reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MOSB103 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Since winning re-election in 1996, Boris Yeltsin
has been on a two-year losing streak.
	   His shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him
away from the Kremlin for days, and sometimes weeks, at a time.
	   The economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the
post-Soviet era, but he rarely raises the subject and hasn't even
hinted at a recovery plan.
	   Even if he did, a growing band of critics argues, he's too weak
physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before
his term ends in 2000.
	   Always eager to show he's still in charge, Yeltsin has fired the
entire government twice this year. But to what end? The new
government, led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, is a mishmash
of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put
together a coherent economic program
	   Yeltsin, 67, brushes aside worries about his health and says
there is no chance he will quit before his term ends. The Russian
constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option, yet the clamor
for Yeltsin's resignation is louder than it's ever been.
	   ``Every one of his public events is painful to watch,'' said
Andrei Piontkowsky, a political analyst and harsh critic of the
president. ``He's out of touch. The state of his health and the
state of mind are deplorable.''
	   Several leading Russian newspapers have urged Yeltsin to step
down. They freely speculate about whether he has Alzheimer's
disease, or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple
bypass surgery two years ago.
	   Yeltsin's public approval rating is in the single digits, but
the president's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this
disenchantment into mass support.
	   Protests around the country on Oct. 7 drew about 1 million
marchers, but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have
not resulted in any sustained labor unrest.
	   Still, the president is losing support from traditionally
friendly camps.
	   ``Temporary incapacity is one thing, but if a person cannot work
and permanently perform his functions, he should muster the will
and courage to say that,'' Moscow Mayor Luzhkov said Friday.
``Everything now depends on the president himself.''
	   Luzhkov, a likely presidential contender in 2000, has been an
ally of Yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the
president's health or his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at
times of confrontation.
	   Yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile
so low it borders on reclusive. He spends most days at a country
residence to the west of Moscow, venturing into the Kremlin perhaps
two or three times a week, and then only for a few hours.
	   Most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his
Kremlin office, where he chitchats with government officials
briefly for the benefit of the camera.
	   Last week's trip to Central Asia was his first foreign journey
in five months, and it proved a public relations disaster. Yeltsin
almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in Uzbekistan. He canceled
meetings, cut short a news conference and headed home a day early
with a respiratory infection.
	   He has called off a trip to a summit in Malaysia next month, and
government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of
the long flight on his health.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _
then Primakov would take over as president temporarily and a
presidential election would be held within three months.
	   The leading contenders would be Luzhkov, former security chief
Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. To
some, the signs of a campaign are already visible.
	   ``It seems to me we are already in the middle of a new
presidential race,'' said Piontkowsky, the analyst.

Monument to royal outsider unveiled after eight years of repair

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ He was an outsider who married into British
royalty, whose work for his adopted nation was undervalued in his
lifetime.
	   Yet after Prince Albert died in 1861, Britons were overtaken by
contrition at their failure to acknowledge his contributions and
raised money to perpetuate his name.
	   The result was Victorian Britain's most remarkable memorial, the
Gothic splendor of the Albert Memorial, built 500 yards (457
meters) from Kensington Palace, a later age's focal point for those
mourning Princess Diana.
	   On Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth II will unveil a newly gleaming
Albert Memorial, rescued from decrepitude by a four-year, dlrs 17
million facelift.
	   The intricate and ornate shrine _ described by Prince Charles,
Albert's great-great-great-grandson, as ``one of Europe's greatest
public monuments'' _ is dedicated to the consort of Queen Victoria,
who spent almost 40 years in mourning after his death from typhoid
at age 42.
	   More than 100 gilders, blacksmiths and stonemasons restored the
memorial, which has been hidden by scaffolding and tarpaulins since
1990. It had been in a state of disrepair for decades and was
declared unsafe in 1983.
	   ``Unbelievably, there was even a plan at one stage to pull it
down,'' said Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, the
agency responsible for the upkeep of many historic monuments and
which footed the bill for most of the repairs.
	   Albert's 200-foot-high (61-meter-high) memorial _ opposite
Albert Hall, also named for him _ was the public statement to a
love that dominated Victoria's life and helped reform the 19th
century British monarchy.
	   The memorial is a cross between a statue, a shrine and a church
spire. To construct it, architect George Gilbert Scott drew
inspiration from the mourning pillars built by Edward I at 12
points in England in memory of his queen, Eleanor, who died in
1290.
	   In 1915, during World War I, Albert's statue was stripped of its
gold to prevent it glistening at night and attracting the attention
of German zeppelins. Gilders have recovered it with 16,875 sheets
of 23 1/2-carat gold leaf.
	   Nearly 6,000 pieces of the canopy and spire _ colored glass
baubles, 200 tons of lead roofing, four mosaics, eight-foot-high
gilded angels _ have been cleaned and repaired.
	   A 210-foot-long (64-meter-long) marble frieze running around the
memorial's base and containing 169 statues of poets, artists,
musicians and architects has been cleaned. Missing pieces were
remade with Campanella marble from Italy, as used in the original.
	   To cap it off, a golden orb and cross accidentally shot off by
British anti-aircraft gunners during World War II have been
restored to the monument's top.
	   ``The memorial now looks closer to its original appearance than
at any time since 1915,'' said Alasdair Glass, the senior project
director.
	   Although Albert was never popular with the British _ he was
thought too dowdy, too earnest and, well, too German _ he began the
tradition of royal males devoting their energies to the public
good. His greatest legacy is a cluster of museums and scientific
colleges in the South Kensington area.
	   But in their 20 years of marriage, Victoria and Albert also
pioneered the transition of the monarchy from a political into a
moral force. Their image of domestic bliss _ they had nine children
_ was the ideal that Britain's kings and queens have since tried,
with mixed success, to emulate.
	   Albert's memorial ``is the embodiment of a most extraordinary
phase in our history,'' historian Robert Thorne said. ``It was
remembering an era through one person _ the virtues he embodied and
the morals he wished to promote.''

Gunmen kill former governor, his secretary and guard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot and killed an
elderly former governor of Pakistan's violent southern Sindh
province on Saturday, police said.
	   Another two people also died in the shooting of 78-year-old
Hakim Mohammed Said. Said was stepping out of his vehicle when
gunmen opened fire with automatic rifles, killing the former
governor, his secretary and a guard, police said.
	   Seven other people were injured.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the killing in the Sindh
provincial capital, wracked by relentless violence, much of it
between rival members of a minority ethnic group.
	   Said served as governor in 1993. He also was chancellor of
Hamdard University, which he founded.
	   Police said the assailants seemed to be professional. They
escaped and so far police say they have no clues to who may have
been behind the killings.
	   Said apparently had received death threats, although he did not
know the identity of the callers, police said.
	   Relentless bloodletting in Karachi, a teeming city of 14 million
people, has left more than 700 people dead so far this year.
	   Most of the dead were victims of the fierce battle for control
of the city by rival factions of the ethnic-based Muttahed Qami
Movement.

Russia disinfects first piece of international space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian specialists started disinfecting the first
component of the international space station on Saturday, a power
and propulsion module scheduled for launch next month, a news
report said.
	   The 20-ton Zarya module, built by Russia's Khrunichev company
under contract with the U.S.-based Boeing, must be sterilized
before it goes up Nov. 20. The disinfection is expected to last
until Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Khrunichev
specialists as saying.
	   NASA will follow in December with the launch of the second part,
an American-built passageway. The third part _ Russia's still
unfinished service module _ is to be launched from Kazakstan in
April 1999.
	   The station's first crew cannot go up until after that, more
than a year later than originally planned. The 16 countries
involved in the station have had to delay construction for two
years in a row because of Russia's inability to pay its share.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Antigovernment protesters will greet
the English and Zimbabwean cricketers when they arrive in the
Bangladeshi capital on Sunday for a nine-nation cricket tournament.
	   The players are likely to be stranded at Dhaka International
Airport for a few hours because cars may not be available to drive
them to hotels.The teams from England and Zimbabwe will be the
first ones to reach Dhaka.
	   Seven opposition parties have called a general strike Sunday to
protest what they call government harassment and neglect of
millions of people who lost homes and crops during unprecedented
floods in July-August.
	   Sunday is a working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh,
which observes sabbath day on Friday.
	   ``It will not be good for the image of the country,'' Saber
Hossain Chowdhury, head of Bangladesh Cricket Control Board, told
reporters on Saturday. But it was too late to change the travel
plans.
	   One-day world champions Sri Lanka, India, Australia, the West
Indies, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa will also
participate in the nine-day competition beginning Oct.24.
	   The opposition had earlier planned a hunger strike outside the
Dhaka's national stadium, the tournament venue.
	   But it called for a general strike after the government refused
permission to sit outside the stadium, saying the protest would
disrupt preparations. In Bangladesh, such protests are routinely
held to settle political scores.

One killed in plane crash in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILIGAN, Philippines (AP) _ One passenger was killed when a small
plane carrying four people crashed near a schoolhouse in a remote
village in the southern Philippines early Saturday, police said.
	   The three others on the plane, including the pilot of the
single-engine Beechcraft, were injured, said Iligan police chief
Isnaji Bantala.
	   The airplane crashed close to the schoolhouse in the village of
Lilangan northeast of Iligan City around 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Friday).
Local authorities said it was cloud-covered, raining and windy at
the time time.
	   The pilot of the plane, owned by an agricultural firm, had
attempted to contact the control tower at nearby Cagayan de Oro
airport but was unable to do so, said Antonio Babijes, chief of the
Manila Rescue Coordinating Center.
	   A passing Philippine Airlines plane received the radio message
and informed airport authorities in Cagayan de Oro that the pilot
reported his plane was going down, Babijes said.
	   Melquiades Loyola, one of the injured passengers, said in a
television interview that the engine suddenly quit and the pilot
had looked for a place to land that was close to a community ``for
the possibility of recovering our bodies.''
	   ``We had no alternative but to crashland,'' Loyola said as he
was being treated at a hospital in Cagayan de Oro.
	   Babijes said the plane took off from a small airport in the town
of Malabang south of Iligan, about 700 kilometers (440 miles) south
of Manila.
	   It was not immediately known where the plane was headed, Babijes
said.

Japan's foreign minister talks with Russia on World War II treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura was
focusing on a World War II peace treaty with Russia during talks in
Moscow on Saturday, a document the two countries never signed
because of a territorial dispute.
	   Komura was to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Saturday morning, then hold talks throughout the day with Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov and
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a likely candidate in Russia's next
presidential elections.
	   The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril
Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast. President Boris Yeltsin has promised a
treaty will be signed by 2000.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in relations.
	   In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese
relations have warmed because of summits between Yeltsin and
Japan's former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura arrived in Russia on Friday night, and leaves late
Saturday. His talks also were expected to address investment and
economic cooperation.
	   Komura's spokesman, Masaki Okada, said Saturday he was surprised
that Russia's parliament voted Thursday to reinstate a holiday
marking the defeat of Japan in World War II, the Interfax news
agency said. The holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The measure requires Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   Also Saturday, Japan delivered more than dlrs 500,000 in medical
aid to Russia's Sakhalin island, and said it would supply small
generators, flashlights and candles for a town on one of the Kuril
Islands without electricity because of fires, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is to come to Moscow next
month, the first visit by a Japanese premier to the Russian capital
in 25 years, Interfax said.

Police deployed in downtown Kuala Lumpur to ward off protesters

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities deployed
riot police in downtown Kuala Lumpur Saturday to head off
anti-government protests as thousands of shoppers thronged the
malls ahead of a Hindu festival of lights.
	   Police trucks were lined along the streets in the capital city
near the major shopping and Independence Square areas. Policemen
were posted on the sidewalks to prevent protesters from gathering
to show solidarity for jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But there was no sign of demonstrators, despite reported calls
for a march to the city's National Mosque and Independence Square.
	   Many of the shoppers Saturday were out buying new clothes and
gifts for Monday's Deepavali festival during which Hindus light
lamps in their homes and distribute sweets. About 10 percent of
Malaysia's 22 million people are Hindus. The majority are Malay
Muslims.
	   More than 5,000 people had responded to a similar protest call
to gather in the area last Saturday.
	   Late Friday night, police arrested three people for
demonstrating at a rally organized by an opposition coalition that
has campaigned for the release of Anwar, the national news agency
Bernama said.
	   The arrests occurred during a protest by about 3,000 people in
the southern town of Malacca. Police have declared all such rallies
illegal.
	   The rally in the port town was part of the protest campaign by a
new coalition of opposition groups that was formed after Anwar, the
Southeast Asian nation's former deputy prime minister, was taken
into custody on Sept. 20.
	   The groups have routinely defied police threats by organizing
unsanctioned gatherings to call for Anwar's release and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the ousted leader was
subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up to
eliminate the political challenge he had posed to Mahathir. The
former No. 2 leader's trial begins Nov. 2.
	   Meanwhile, a government minister has blamed foreign media
coverage of opposition street rallies in Malaysia for scaring away
tourists.
	   The hotel occupancy rate had dwindled to 54 percent from 67
percent in the same period last year, Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Friday.
	   ``CNN has been successful in portraying the so-called havoc in
Malaysia in a manner that will keep away tourists from coming
here,'' he told reporters.
	   The minister also criticized the CNBC news network for what he
called distorted news coverage. CNBC has denied previous
accusations of biased coverage by Malaysian officials.

U.S. officials stress need to woo capital back to Asian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. ambassador to Singapore Steven Green said
the recent flight of capital from the Asian region was a key
concern at a gathering of American officials in Singapore, a local
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``It is obvious that in order to see the region prosper, we will
have to find ways to attract private capital back to the region,''
Green was quoted as saying by The Straits Times.
	   Green was among several senior U.S. officials who met this week
to review the rapid changes sweeping through the Pacific rim. Those
attending included Stanley Roth, the State Department's highest
official for East Asian affairs, and Admiral Joseph Prueher,
Commander in Chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific.
	   The officials met Thursday and Friday ``to exchange views on
economic, political and security developments in the region,''
according to a U.S. Embassy statement.
	   Green said the desire of U.S. businesses and investors to put
money back into Southeast Asia was ``tremendous,'' but that they
would remain cautious until the region's financial systems were
properly reformed.
	   These countries' ``many blemishes, previously hidden by
double-digit growth, are now exposed,'' he was quoted as saying.
``Only if governments corrected these blemishes would we see
capital flowing back.''
	   He added that it was likely ``that the region will have to go
through a period of political discomfort as well. For example, it
is difficult to bring back capital to Indonesia until there is
stability.''
	   Green also noted that the region has been looking increasingly
to the United States to help it out of the crisis, and that the
U.S. is ``committed to providing this leadership.''

Yeltsin spending weekend at country house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, fighting off bronchitis
and a cold, is spending the weekend resting at his country home
outside Moscow, his press service said Saturday.
	   Aides have said Yeltsin's health is ``satisfactory,'' and he
dismissed doctors orders and worked in the Kremlin two days last
week. The president has a respiratory infection that forced him to
cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday.
	   On Friday, he canceled an upcoming trip to an Asian summit.
Government officials said it was because of his health.
	   Yeltsin had no plans for meetings this weekend, the press
service said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He is expected to return to the Kremlin on Monday for meetings
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the minister responsible
for relations with other former Soviet republics.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a long history of health problems, including
1996 heart bypass surgery. The president and his doctors insist he
has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two
years of his term.

Australia qualifies for women's soccer World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Australia scored a 3-1 win over
host New Zealand on Saturday to qualify for next year's women's
soccer World Cup in the United States.
	   Julie Murray, playing her 50th international, got Australia off
to a flying start in the Oceania zone final with a goal in the 2nd
minute. Bridgette Starr added one on 13 minutes and Lisa Casagrande
put the team 3-0 ahead before a consolation goal from Nicky Smith.
	   ``This is a great result for the Australian women as part of our
plans for the next two years,'' said Australian coach Greg Brown.
	   ``We needed to qualify for the World Cup to give us
international competition, otherwise our medal chances at the
Sydney Olympics would have been severely diminished. Today
completes the first part of a three stage plan _ to qualify, to do
well and finish in the top eight at the World Cup and to finish in
the top three at the Sydney Olympics.''

Taylor gives up record putting Pakistan in to bat

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with play until lunch. CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) - Australia's Mark Taylor put national
interest ahead of a personal landmark when his team declared and
Pakistan was put in to bat on to bat on Saturday, the second day of
the second cricket Test.
	   Pakistan was 123 for one at lunch.
	   Taylor declared Australia's first innings at the overnight total
of 599 for four and remained undefeated on 334 -- equaling Sir Don
Bradman's record.
	   ``For me victory in the series is more important on the
sub-continent,'' said Taylor, who left 41 short of West Indian
Brian Lara's world record Lara made 375 against England at St.
John's Antigua in 1994.
	   ``Lara's world record of 375 is not important for me. It's nice
to be bracketed with Sir Don Bradman,'' Taylor said.
	   Pakistan, needing 400 runs to make Australia bat again, was 123
for the loss of its captain Aamir Sohail.
	   Saeed Anwar, who hit Damien Fleming for three boundaries, was
unbeaten on 56. The left-hander greeted Stuart MacGill with 10 runs
in the leg-spinner's opening over, hitting a six over long on and a
four to square leg.
	   Ijaz Ahmed survived a close leg before decision off medium fast
Collin Miller.
	   Pakistan lost skipper Sohail in the ninth over when he hooked
paceman Glenn McGrath to Damien Fleming at long leg after making a
rapid 31 off 24 balls.

North Korean worker flees to South
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A stowaway claiming to be a defector
from North Korea has arrived in the South and surrendered to
authorities, Seoul's main intelligence agency said Saturday.
	   The man, identifying himself as Chang Chun Kwang, 27, arrived in
the port of Pusan on South Korea's southern coast Friday aboard a
ship from a third country the agency refused to identify.
	   The Agency for National Security Planning said Chang, a
gold-plating worker, fled his communist homeland in February last
year. He lived in hiding in the third country, where he sneaked
aboard a ship sailing to South Korea, it said.
	   Chang left his widowed father and three brothers in North Korea.
	   Other details, such as the defector's motive, were not
immediately available.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s.
	   So far this year, 52 North Koreans have defected to South Korea,
mostly through China. All cited severe food and fuel shortages in
the communist nation.

Japan's foreign minister talks with Russia on World War II treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2 and 4 with meeting with Primakov, Primakov
comment; Edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura was
focusing on a World War II peace treaty with Russia during talks in
Moscow on Saturday, a document the two countries never signed
because of a territorial dispute.
	   Komura met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday
morning, then was to hold talks throughout the day with Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov and
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a likely candidate in Russia's next
presidential elections.
	   The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril
Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast. President Boris Yeltsin has promised a
treaty will be signed by 2000.
	   At the start of his meeting with Komura, Primakov said Russia
``will stand firm by the positions laid out by Yeltsin and
ex-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the
disagreement, however, despite an overall improvement in relations.
	   In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese
relations have warmed because of summits between Yeltsin and
Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura arrived in Russia on Friday night, and leaves late
Saturday. His talks also were expected to address investment and
economic cooperation.
	   Komura's spokesman, Masaki Okada, said Saturday he was surprised
that Russia's parliament voted Thursday to reinstate a holiday
marking the defeat of Japan in World War II, Interfax said. The
holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse. The
measure requires Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   Also Saturday, Japan delivered more than dlrs 500,000 in medical
aid to Russia's Sakhalin island, and said it would supply small
generators, flashlights and candles for a town on one of the Kuril
Islands without electricity because of fires, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is to come to Moscow next
month, the first visit by a Japanese premier to the Russian capital
in 25 years, Interfax said.

South Asian rivals discuss thorny Kashmir dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Negotiators from Pakistan and India,
the world's newest nuclear powers, continued discussing the 51-year
old dispute over Kashmir Saturday, but there's little hope among
Kashmiri leaders of a major breakthrough.
	   ``The Indian attitude is still very much inflexible,'' Sardar
Abdul Qayyum, ex-prime minister of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The past experience shows that such talks have not made any
headway in resolving the Kashmir problem ... though we wish they
yield some positive results,'' he said.
	   Pakistan and India's foreign ministers are holding three days of
talks in Islamabad aimed at easing tensions between these two
uneasy neighbors, who have fought three wars since independence
from the British empire in 1947.
	   The talks, which began Friday, were the first meeting of the
ministers in more than a year and follows months of tension and
bloody exchanges of artillery fire which has killed more than 100
civilians on both sides of the border. Each country holds part of
the disputed valley and claims the rest.
	   Most analysts believe the stalled talks resumed because of
international concern following underground nuclear tests the two
countries conducted last May.
	   ``This has been made possible only because of the United States'
pressure ... and these talks could help in addressing some
dimensions of the problem, like highlighting the plight and
repercussion of the Kashmiri people and bringing down the number of
Indian troops. But actual problem solving will come much later,''
said Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's former ambassador to the United
States.
	   India, which has amassed around 600,000 troops on the border,
accuses Pakistan of providing assistance to Kashmiri secessionists.
Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only diplomatic and
political support.

Mahathir says Anwar is being treated well
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday that
his former deputy was being treated well in jail and even had a
mattress to sleep on, according to a press report.
	   ``He's given special food, his accommodation is different from
ordinary prisoners,'' Mahathir reportedly told reporters on the
second day of his five-day visit to Japan.
	   A Malaysian embassy official accompanying Mahathir in Tokyo
refused to comment on the report from Malaysia's official Bernama
news agency.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, 51, was sacked on Sept. 2 and subsequently
arrested after organizing huge anti-Mahathir rallies.
	   The former deputy was shifted to a regular jail on Wednesday
after 24 days inside a cell in Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.
There were concerns about his treatment when he appeared in court
with bruises and a black eye.
	   For many days his family was not allowed to see him. His lawyers
were barred access and even interrogated.
	   ``I have been made to understand that he's being treated like a
VIP,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Tokyo.
	   ``Normally, of course, they put several people in one cell. I'm
told that he has a special room to himself, he has mattress, he's
treated very special.''
	   Mahathir also reportedly said that he hoped that next month's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Kuala Lumpur will not
be turned into a political forum by some Asian leaders threatening
to boycott it.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesia's B.J. Habibie
have indicated they may not attend because of the treatment meted
out to Anwar.
	   ``APEC is about economic matters and not about politics,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying by Bernama.
	   Mahathir arrived in Japan on Friday for five days of talks with
business leaders and bankers, on his first trip out of Malaysia
since his firing of Anwar sparked political turmoil.
	   Mahathir was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Monday and also to attend a reception given by Emperor Akihito for
those attending an African development conference.
	   Mahathir was taking Saturday and Sunday off and had no official
meetings planned, said the embassy official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

Kyrgyzstan holds referendum on constitutional changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Voters in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan
chose Saturday whether to amend their constitution to allow private
land ownership.
	   Even if the amendment passes, no sales of agricultural land will
be allowed for five years, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The amendment would also grant Kyrgyzstan's rural residents
ownership of the small land plots they live on. Non-Kyrgyz citizens
and companies with foreign participation would be barred from
owning land in this former Soviet republic.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev proposed a national referendum on
the amendment last month.
	   ``It would be excellent'' if two-thirds of voters backed it,
Akayev said after voting Saturday, Interfax said.

Ex-Communist starts talks to see if he can form Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who now leads
Italy's largest leftist party, began talks Saturday aimed at
sounding out potential allies who might enable him to form a new
government.
	   Italy's political situation these days is so volatile that
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Friday stopped short of actually
formally asking D'Alema to try to form of government. Instead, the
head of state said he was giving D'Alema the ``pre-task'' of
testing the waters to see if there was enough consensus to actually
try to put together a coalition.
	   Earlier in the week, caretaker Premier Romano Prodi told
Scalfaro he had failed in his bid to forge a consensus for a fresh
start. Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old center-left coalition lost a
confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies on Oct. 9, precipitating
the crisis.
	   D'Alema consulted early Saturday with lawmakers from the
Democratic Leftists, which was formed from the bulk of Italy's
Communist Party earlier this decade.
	   He was due to meet later in the day with hard-line Communists
who recently split with fellow Communists who had voted against
Prodi in the confidence test.
	   Also lining up to meet with D'Alema were followers of group of
former Democrats headed by former President Francesco Cossiga.
Those lawmakers originally were loyal to opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi, media mogul and ex-premier, but Cossiga has indicated
he might throw support to a center-left government.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost the support of
hard-line Communists, who complained his budget for next year
didn't do enough to create jobs.

Bradman leads tributes to Taylor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Mark Taylor joined Sir Donald Bradman
at the summit of Australian cricket run-getters and received a rare
pat on the back from his famous predecessor Saturday.
	   Taylor's 334 not out against Pakistan in Peshawar equaled
Bradman's best innings, set in England in 1930.
	   Now 90, Bradman makes few public comments but released a
statement through a spokesman saying, ``I want to congratulate Mark
Taylor on his achievement. I wish him the very best of luck.''
	   Taylor indicated that his wish to remain linked in the record
books with Bradman, who retired from cricket with a peerless record
of 99.94, played a role in his decision to declare Saturday. He
cost himself a chance to chase Brian Lara's world record 375.
	   Bradman's spokesman said The Don had not been able to watch the
match because he had been ill.
	   Australian newspapers, television and radio were dominated by
Taylor's innings, and the public was consumed with speculation on
whether he would bat on or declare.
	   Former test captain Greg Chappell, who last year called Taylor
unfit for the job after he had a long slump, said, ``I'm sorry he
didn't bat on but I think he was always going to do what was best
for the team.''
	   ``It's a fantastic performance, a great credit to him and great
for Australian cricket,'' Chappell said. ``Mark has proven
throughout his career he is very resilient and to do this through
all the turmoil of his own situation and the bribes inquiry is
fantastic.''
	   Chappell's older brother Ian, speaking before play resumed, was
equally impressed and thought Taylor should have kept batting.
	   ``It's been an amazing turnaround,'' he told Australian
television. ``Even at the start of this tour he appeared to be
struggling a bit.''
	   Former opening bat Bill Brown, 86, played alongside Bradman when
he made 304 at Leeds in 1934.
	   ``I give (Taylor) absolutely full marks for this innings,''
Brown said. ``I've always liked his style of play and liked the man
himself, I think he's a delightful fellow.''
	   World record test aggregate run scorer Allan Border, Taylor's
predecessor, praised the unselfish decision to declare.
	   ``It's been a genuine great decision,'' said Border, test
cricket's longest-serving captain. ``There's two great things about
this _ he will be forever linked with Bradman and if he can make
that sort of score and win the game it will be the icing on a very
big cake.
	   ``It just shows the type of bloke he is and the way we play our
cricket generally. That's a great attitude. He deserves all the
accolades.''

Official: Chinese military exercises not threatening to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan does not see present military
exercises in China as intimidating and they are not linked to the
high-level talks that are underway between the two rivals, a
military official said Saturday.
	   The exercises are part of routine maneuvers China holds every
autumn and are not specially targeted at Taiwan, said the Defense
Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Two elder statesmen from Taiwan and China held talks in Shanghai
this week to seek ways of resuming contacts that were suspended
three years ago after Beijing accused Taiwan of campaigning to
raise its international recognition.
	   The Taiwanese negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, is scheduled to meet
Chinese President Jiang Zemin Sunday.
	   Citing Western intelligence, Taiwan's Liberty Times newspaper
reported Saturday that 40 Chinese naval vessels are participating
in an exercise around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea,
while warplanes are practicing air strikes in northern China.
	   It said China held the exercises to help bolster its position
against Taiwan during the negotiations.
	   Military exercises are a sensitive subject between the rivals
which split politically in 1949 following a civil war.
	   China held missile tests around Taiwan in 1995-96 to frighten
the island's leaders into reversing a perceived drift towards
independence.
	   To sweeten the present talks with China, Taiwan cancelled a
large-scale public showing of its troops and weapons early this
month.

Report: Government being sued over police shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two sisters whose parents were
shot and killed by police over a suspected kidnapping have sued the
government and Malaysia's top police officials, a news report said
Saturday.
	   In the suit filed in High Court Friday through their
grandmother, Alameloo Mangai Gunasekaran, 8, and Keerthana, 5, said
police stormed their house and killed their mother, who was eight
months pregnant, the New Straits Times daily reported.
	   They accused police of acting in a ``lethal'' manner on Oct. 2
by also killing their father and three others without properly
identifying the occupants in the house or giving them a chance to
surrender by firing warning shots.
	   The children are claiming 80,500 ringgit (dlrs 21,200) as
compensation for burial expenses and 500 ringgit (dlrs 130) each
month over the next 13 years.
	   Malaysia's police chief, Rahim Noor, named as one of the
respondents in the suit acknowledged Saturday the sisters' right to
sue.
	   ``We, the police, cannot deny them their right,'' he said.
	   Rahim explained that the authorities raided the house on the
outskirts of Kuala Lumpur to apprehend a group of people suspected
of kidnapping the son of a prominent former politician. The
shooting occured after the kidnap victim was rescued and the ransom
money recovered.
	   Firearms and an unspecified amount of money were found at the
house, police said.
	   After their 31-year old mother was shot, police left her
unattended and didn't try to save the unborn child, the court
appeal said.
	   No hearing date has been fixed.

Yugoslav ambassador: Serb forces will pull back before NATO
</HEADLINE>
deadline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Yugoslavia's ambassador to London said Saturday
that Serb forces will pull out of Kosovo province ahead of a new
NATO deadline and in time to avoid threatened air strikes.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader (Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic) has been pulling his troops out of Kosovo,'' Milos
Radulovic said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to go home.
	   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Friday gave Milosevic
another 10 days, until Oct. 27, to comply with international
demands and pull his troops out of Kosovo or face air attacks.
	   Milosevic has met another demand by allowing 2,000 foreign
monitors into the province.
	   Radulovic dismissed reports that Serbian forces were remaining
in large numbers. ``If you ask separatists, then you can be sure
that they will say no forces were pulled out,'' said the envoy
said.
	   Radulovic said the Yugoslav authorities have also llowed more
than 400 journalists into Kosovo, as well as humanitarian
organizations. ''There are so many people. So the situation is
quite transparent there,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush the rebel Kosova
Liberation Army. Its soldiers have killed more than 200 Serb
policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial
self-rule.

A weakened Yeltsin lacks energy for new reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS analyst's name in grafs 7, last to Piontkovsky sted

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Since winning re-election in 1996, Boris Yeltsin
has been on a two-year losing streak.
	   His shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him
away from the Kremlin for days, and sometimes weeks, at a time.
	   The economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the
post-Soviet era, but he rarely raises the subject and hasn't even
hinted at a recovery plan.
	   Even if he did, a growing band of critics argues, he's too weak
physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before
his term ends in 2000.
	   Always eager to show he's still in charge, Yeltsin has fired the
entire government twice this year. But to what end? The new
government, led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, is a mishmash
of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put
together a coherent economic program
	   Yeltsin, 67, brushes aside worries about his health and says
there is no chance he will quit before his term ends. The Russian
constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option, yet the clamor
for Yeltsin's resignation is louder than it's ever been.
	   ``Every one of his public events is painful to watch,'' said
Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst and harsh critic of the
president. ``He's out of touch. The state of his health and the
state of mind are deplorable.''
	   Several leading Russian newspapers have urged Yeltsin to step
down. They freely speculate about whether he has Alzheimer's
disease, or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple
bypass surgery two years ago.
	   Yeltsin's public approval rating is in the single digits, but
the president's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this
disenchantment into mass support.
	   Protests around the country on Oct. 7 drew about 1 million
marchers, but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have
not resulted in any sustained labor unrest.
	   Still, the president is losing support from traditionally
friendly camps.
	   ``Temporary incapacity is one thing, but if a person cannot work
and permanently perform his functions, he should muster the will
and courage to say that,'' Moscow Mayor Luzhkov said Friday.
``Everything now depends on the president himself.''
	   Luzhkov, a likely presidential contender in 2000, has been an
ally of Yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the
president's health or his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at
times of confrontation.
	   Yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile
so low it borders on reclusive. He spends most days at a country
residence to the west of Moscow, venturing into the Kremlin perhaps
two or three times a week, and then only for a few hours.
	   Most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his
Kremlin office, where he chitchats with government officials
briefly for the benefit of the camera.
	   Last week's trip to Central Asia was his first foreign journey
in five months, and it proved a public relations disaster. Yeltsin
almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in Uzbekistan. He canceled
meetings, cut short a news conference and headed home a day early
with a respiratory infection.
	   He has called off a trip to a summit in Malaysia next month, and
government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of
the long flight on his health.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _
then Primakov would take over as president temporarily and a
presidential election would be held within three months.
	   The leading contenders would be Luzhkov, former security chief
Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. To
some, the signs of a campaign are already visible.
	   ``It seems to me we are already in the middle of a new
presidential race,'' said Piontkovsky, the analyst.

Anti-government protest erupts in downtown Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protests. Trims. No pick up
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Protesters crammed the sidewalks
of a busy downtown Kuala Lumpur street Saturday holding up posters
demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Shoppers scurried off with their carry bags fearing violence.
	   Riot police deployed to prevent the show of solidarity for
jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim, however, did not immediately
try to disperse the demonstrators who mingled with shoppers
crowding malls ahead of a Hindu festival.
	   The protesters shouted slogans against the government, in the
latest of the street demonstrations that have erupted regularly
since Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest. The former deputy prime minister was
detained after organizing huge anti-government protests.
	   Police trucks were lined along the streets in the capital city
near the major shopping and Independence Square areas. Policemen
were posted on the sidewalks.
	   Many of the shoppers Saturday were out buying new clothes and
gifts for Monday's Deepavali festival during which Hindus light
lamps in their homes and distribute sweets. About 10 percent of
Malaysia's 22 million people are Hindus. The majority are Malay
Muslims.
	   More than 5,000 people had responded to a similar protest call
to gather in the area last Saturday.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the former deputy was
subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up to
eliminate the political challenge he had posed to Mahathir. Anwar's
trial begins Nov. 2.
	   Late Friday night, police arrested three people for
demonstrating at a rally organized by an opposition coalition that
has campaigned for the release of Anwar, the national news agency
Bernama said.
	   The arrests occurred during a protest by about 3,000 people in
the southern town of Malacca. Police have declared all such rallies
illegal.
	   Opposition groups have routinely defied police threats by
organizing unsanctioned gatherings to call for Anwar's release and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Meanwhile, a government minister has blamed foreign media
coverage of opposition street rallies in Malaysia for scaring away
tourists.
	   The hotel occupancy rate had dwindled to 54 percent from 67
percent in the same period last year, Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Friday.
	   ``CNN has been successful in portraying the so-called havoc in
Malaysia in a manner that will keep away tourists from coming
here,'' he told reporters.
	   The minister also criticized the CNBC news network for what he
called distorted news coverage. CNBC has denied previous
accusations of biased coverage by Malaysian officials.

Russian consumer prices up 45 percent since August
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Consumer prices have soared 45 percent since
Russia devalued the ruble and put off its foreign debts two months
ago, according to Central Bank and government statistics, a news
report said Saturday.
	   A key architect of the Aug. 17 devaluation and default plan,
former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, said in an interview
published Saturday that he was not to blame for the ensuing
economic meltdown and predicted things would only get worse.
	   Economic analysts with the Interfax news agency said they
calculated the consumer price estimate based on figures from the
Central Bank and the State Statistics Committee. It gave no other
details.
	   Prices jumped immediately after the crisis hit and imports _
which Russia had come to rely upon for half its consumer goods _
plunged. Basic foods have remained available and the government
insists it doesn't expect shortages, though the lowest grain
harvest in decades has aggravated concerns about feeding the
world's largest country.
	   Kiriyenko said it wasn't supposed to turn out so badly. He told
the daily Kommersant that the government that replaced him, widely
seen as a compromise to appease President Boris Yeltsin's hard-line
foes, is not prepared ``to take unpopular, harsh measures _ and
those are exactly what needs to be taken.''
	   He said the 90-day moratorium on debt repayments declared Aug.
17 was supposed to be followed up with an agreement on repayment
terms within 60 days _ a period that ended Saturday with no such
plan.
	   With the debts to come due in a month, the government has yet to
announce how it will tackle Russia's worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse. Russian negotiators held talks on
restructuring the debts with Western bank creditors in London this
week but failed to reach an agreement.
	   ``It has become clear. ... There will be no strict anti-crisis
program, instead there will be populist measures, there will be
more spending than revenues, and as a result, we won't be able to
pay off our debt,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko blamed the Communist-dominated parliament for
resisting a tough anti-crisis program.
	   ``I was told, `We all understand that yes, there's a crisis,
yes, there's threat of collapse, but you have to understand _ we
have elections in a year,''' Kommersant quoted him as saying.
	   In the two months since the crisis hit, the ruble has nosedived
from 6.29 against the dollar to 17.1.
	   Russia's Deputy Prime Minister for social issues suggested price
controls on medicines during a visit to Greece on Saturday. Russia
depends heavily on imported medicine, and rising prices are feeding
the black market, Valentina Matvienko told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The European Union may revise its aid to Russia in light of the
crisis, European Commission President Jacques Santer told Interfax.
About 140 million ECU (dlrs 115 million) in EU aid is spent on
Russia annually.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Santer for
food and medicine aid earlier this month.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Pichit Chor Siriwat retained
his World Boxing Association junior flyweight title against
seventh-ranked contender Lee Tae Gil of South Korea when the
ringside doctor stopped the fight at the end of seventh round.
	   Lee, 25, was cut above his left eye in the third round. By the
end of the seventh, his other eye was almost closed shut.
	   Pichit, 23, dominated the fight and delighted the home crowd
with stiff jabs and left hooks that found their targets with little
resistance. The Thai came into the fight with a record of 18 wins,
eight by knockouts, and 1 loss.
	   Pichit put Lee off balance on several occasions but was unable
to knock down the challenger, who put up a brave fight.
	   Lee came into the bout with a record of 16 wins, two losses and
one draw.
	   Both fighters weighed in at 108 pounds ( 49 kilograms).

Lawmaker: Britain must question Gen. Pinochet about killings,
</HEADLINE>
torture &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An influential lawmaker from the governing Labor
Party on Saturday backed Spanish requests to question former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in London for back surgery,
on allegations of genocide and terrorism.
	   ''There've been something like a total of 3,197 cases'' of
murder and torture during Pinochet's 1973-90 regime, Ann Clywd said
in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``In the course of a long search by their relatives, the remains
of some of the disappeared have been discovered in unmarked
graves,'' said Ms. Clywd, who chairs an all-party committee of
lawmakers on human rights. ``And hundreds of former detainees have
made statements confirming that the disappeared were held in
detention centers.''
	   ``Clearly, the Spanish authorities have every right to try and
investigate these matters further.''
	   Pinochet, 82, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc a week
ago, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlier
Wednesday. British authorities have declined to comment on his
whereabouts or the Spanish requests.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday. Another judge, Manuel
Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question Pinochet a day
earlier.
	   In 1996, Castellon opened his probe into murder, torture and
disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's regime. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

Muslim leader shot dead generating street protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Scores of policemen cordoned off a
commercial district in the Pakistani capital Saturday after gunmen
shot and killed a leader of a Sunni Muslim militant organization,
police said.
	   Maulana Mohammad Abdullah was shot four times by gunmen in a car
outside a mosque in Islamabad.
	   Abdullah, a leader of militant Sunni group, Sipah-e-Sahaba or
the Guardians of the Friends of Prophet, died in hospital and
police say they fear retaliatory attacks. Dozens of supporters
vowing revenge protested the killing. The group clashes regularly
with militant Shiite Muslims.
	   Traffic in the Apara neighborhood was diverted by police in riot
gear, said eyewitnesses.
	   Last month, four leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba were shot and killed
in another hit-and-run attack in Islamabad. Since those killings
the clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims has intensified.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in bloody
conflict between Sunni and Shiite groups. Shiite Muslims comprise
barely 15 percent of Sunni-dominated Pakistan.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia more time to fulfill a peace pledge and avoid
airstrikes, a convoy of tanks and trucks appeared to be heading out
of war-wracked Kosovo province.
	   The convoy Friday night and the expected arrival Saturday of a
15-member advance team to prepare for the mission of 2,000 unarmed
observers signified more Yugoslav compliance with Western demands
to end the conflict in Kosovo.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend the deadline to reduce Yugoslav
forces in Kosovo by 10 days, until Oct. 27. About 400 NATO
warplanes will be kept ready for possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia
fails to meet its promises.
	   Late Friday night, 144 army tanks, artillery trucks and other
vehicles were seen driving in the direction of the provincial
border with Serbia.
	   While journalists were unable to follow the convoy due to unsafe
conditions at night, it was considered virtually certain the
vehicles continued on to bases in Serbia.
	   A Yugoslav official said Saturday that President Slobodan
Milosevic will withdraw forces in time to meet the new, pushed-back
deadline.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb troops and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement intended to avert NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav
military targets called for its army forces in Kosovo to be reduced
to the levels they were at before the crackdown began Feb. 28
against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed by Serb forces, while Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels also have killed more than 200 Serb
policemen, civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not yet enough to head off the possibility of
airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   The advance team from the OSCE, Europe's main problem-solving
alliance, headed from Austria to Kosovo on Saturday to begin
planning for the arrival of the 2,000 observers who will monitor
compliance, OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in Vienna.
	   The government on Friday signed a deal with the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to let the OSCE
``verifiers'' monitor Milosevic's pledge to withdraw his troops and
allow the return of up to 300,000 refugees.
	   NATO U-2 surveillance planes were expected to begin flying over
Kosovo on Saturday under an agreement signed with Yugoslavia, a
U.S. official said Friday in Washington on condition of anonymity.
There was no immediate confirmation Saturday that the
reconnaissance flights had begun.
	   Jet fighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy
planes are threatened, NATO sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said
Friday that the Yugoslav government had guaranteed the safety of
the unarmed ground force and that he would ask NATO to do the same.
	   Teams of diplomatic observers who pulled out of Kosovo last week
under the threat of possible NATO airstrikes were operating
Saturday, said a U.S. official in Pristina, on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official said four teams of two Americans each were in the
field, and more members would arrive in nearby Skopje, Macedonia,
over the weekend for training before coming to Kosovo next week.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, Geremek said in Pristina: ``I have received assurances from
Mr. Rugova about his participation in the peace process.''
	   But the rebel KLA issued a statement later saying it rejects the
U.S.-brokered deal for the strife-torn province.
	   The KLA has been fighting for independence for Kosovo, where the
vast majority of the population is ethnic Albanian. Serbia and the
much-smaller Montenegro make up Yugoslavia.
	   Meanwhile, at the United Nations, Security Council members held
preliminary talks on a resolution to endorse this week's accord and
lend U.N. backing for organizations that will verify its
compliance, diplomats in New York said.

Typhoon Zeb hits southern Japan as the Philippines, Taiwan recover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with storm making landfall, two missing
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two people were missing after a deadly typhoon hit
Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu Saturday, drenching the
area with heavy rains and interrupting travel in much of the
country.
	   Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines
and 18 in Taiwan, made landfall near the city of Makurazaki in
Kagoshima Prefecture, 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, at around 4:30 p.m. (0730 GMT), Japan's Meteorological
Agency said.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per
hour, the typhoon was moving northeast at a speed of 35 kilometers
per hour. Zeb was expected to cross western Japan and enter the Sea
of Japan early Sunday, before heading toward northern Japan, the
agency said.
	   Two men, aged 19 and 22, were missing on the southern island of
Okinawa after they went to the beach to watch the roaring waves
brought on by the typhoon, said an Okinawa prefecture (state)
police spokesman. The men were believed drowned after being swept
away by waves, said the spokesman who declined to be named.
	   One man was injured in Okinawa when he lost control of his
motorbike in strong winds and a woman in Kagoshima suffered a head
injury after being blown over while trying to shutter the windows
of her home.
	   More than 140 domestic flights to and from southern Japan were
canceled and inter-island ferry service was suspended, national
broadcaster NHK said. Local train service on the main southern
island of Kyushu was also interrupted, it said.
	   Parts of southern Japan will be soaked by up to 400 millimeters
(16 inches) of rain through Sunday morning, with some areas getting
as much as 80 millimeters (3.2 inches) of rainfall in a one-hour
period, the meteorological agency said.
	   In the Philippines and Taiwan, disaster officials were searching
for those still missing and cleaning up from the damage wrought by
Zeb on Thursday and Friday.
	   Most of the 74 people dead in the Philippines drowned or were
buried in landslides. Ten people were still missing and the
casualty figure was expected to rise as reports come in from
isolated villages.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   In Taiwan, 18 people were dead and up to 19 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Torrential rains prompted mudslides that covered two houses in
the Taipei suburb of Neihu. The bodies of two elderly men were
recovered from the debris Saturday, and rescuers were still
searching for three others believed trapped.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295 kphs)
184 mph.

Bomb blast damages ferry cabin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A bomb exploded on a ferry shortly
after it arrived in the southern port city of Zamboanga early
Saturday, police said. No one was injured.
	   The blast damaged an empty upper deck cabin of the Sampaguita
Ferry 1, which arrived around 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Friday) from
Pagadian City, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of
Zamboanga, said police chief Karib Muammil.
	   The explosion sent disembarking passengers scurrying off the
ferry in panic.
	   Muammil said the bomb may have been set off by a timer and
police were still trying to determine who had used the cabin.
Passengers are free to choose their cabins and tickets do not
indicate cabin numbers.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the blast, which police
investigators suspect was the handiwork of extortion gangs like
those responsible for several bombings of passenger buses in the
city earlier this year.
	   An officer of the ferry, however, said his company has not
received any threats.
	   Muslim extremist rebels, who have been blamed for some bombings
in the city, also operate in Zamboanga, about 880 kilometers (550
miles) south of Manila.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura focused
on a World War II peace treaty with Russia during talks in Moscow
on Saturday, a document the two countries never signed because of a
territorial dispute.
	   Komura met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and later
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Talks were also scheduled with First
Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov, in charge of economic ties with
Japan, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a likely candidate in
Russia's next presidential elections.
	   The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril
Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast. President Boris Yeltsin has promised a
treaty will be signed by 2000.
	   At the start of his meeting with Komura, Primakov said Russia
``will stand firm by the positions laid out by Yeltsin and
ex-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Diplomatic efforts in preparation for Komura's visit ``will
allow us to come closer to a peace treaty,'' Primakov said.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in relations.
	   Moscow insists a decision on the Kurils must not threaten its
national interests. Japan has been cautious about investment and
economic cooperation with Russia _ key areas that Komura's talks
Saturday were expected to discuss _ because of lack of movement in
the dispute.
	   Still, in an interview published Friday, Komura said
Russian-Japanese relations have warmed because of summits between
Yeltsin and Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura arrived in Russia on Friday night, and leaves Saturday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Four people died as snow, gales and heavy rain
swept parts of Britain early Saturday.
	   Three men, aged 70, 18 and one in his 20s, died when two cars
collided in heavy winds of up to 90 miles and hour (145 kms an
hour) in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. In the province's second
largest city, Londonderry, high winds tore down trees.
	   At Southend in the Scottish county of Kintyre, farmer John
Hobbs, 54, was found dead in a stream as driving rain flooded roads
and delayed traffic.
	   In southwest Wales, the Environment Agency warned that the
rivers Loughor, Tawe and Neath could flood as more than 80
millimeters (3 inches) of rain fell in 15 hours. Sand bags were
distributed in Swansea and Neath, but no homes were evacuated.
	   The Meteorological Office said snow that fell in the Scottish
Highlands could spread to the low country, unusual for this time of
year.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of jailed dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim joined protesters who crammed the sidewalks of
a busy downtown Kuala Lumpur street Saturday to demand the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Riot police deployed to prevent the show of solidarity for
Anwar, however, did not immediately try to disperse the
demonstrators who mingled with shoppers crowding malls ahead of a
Hindu festival.
	   Many of the shoppers scurried off with their carry bags fearing
violence.
	   As Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, drove to the crowded street,
hundreds of people rushed to her. She shook hands with some from
inside her car. It was the first time since her husband's arrest
last month that she has joined a street protest.
	   The protesters held up posters and shouted slogans against the
government, in the latest of the street demonstrations that have
erupted regularly since Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest. The former deputy
prime minister was detained after organizing huge anti-government
protests.

Jordan executes juggler for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A juggler who was convicted of robbing and
killing a woman in 1996 has been hanged in the kingdom's third
execution this year, prison officials said Saturday.
	   Mustafa Abdul Mustafa, 47, was hanged Thursday at the Swaqa
prison, 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Amman, prison supervisor
Col. Sa'ad Ajram told The Associated Press.
	   Mustafa, a self-proclaimed healer, was sentenced to death in
March for killing Heigar Ali in his home on Feb. 8, 1996. He had
lured her with a promise to cure her stomach pain with herbal
medicine.
	   According to police, Mustafa gave Ali, 44, a poison-laced drink
that killed her in four minutes. He then took the dead woman's gold
bracelets and burned her body in the desert to conceal the crime.
	   The case had caused a stir in Jordan where crime is rare and
murders even more so. Muslims, who bury their dead, consider
burning bodies a sacrilege.
	   Before being hanged, Mustafa requested his relatives to take
care of his two wives and 14 children, Col. Ajram said.

Hirao surges ahead in Fujitsu Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIBA, Japan (AP) _ Nahoko Hirao shot a 2-under-par 70 in the
occasional rain Saturday and surged ahead for a three-stroke lead
going into the final round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 506,000)
Fujitsu Ladies.
	   Hirao, who has yet to win in two years as a pro, sank three
birdies against a bogey in negotiating the wet and windswept
6,483-yard (5,900-meter), par-72 Tokyu 700 Club course.
	   The round left Hirao at a 7-under 137 total, three shots ahead
of Miyuki Shimabukuro, who turned in a 71 for 140.
	   ``I was hitting approach shots close today,'' said the
24-year-old Hirao. ``I'm more satisfied with today's under-par
round than yesterday's 5-under.''
	   ``I'm not that excited about tomorrow, and I don't feel much
pressure, either,'' Hirao added. ``I'll just take it one shot at a
time.''
	   Hirao, however, will have to overcome half a dozen heavy hitters
in striking distance.
	   South Korean Kim Man-soo and Taiwan's Cheng Mei-chi fired 68s,
the day's lowest, and shared third place at 141 with Kaori Higo,
Yuri Fudo and Kumiko Hiyoshi. Higo went around in 72, and Fudo and
Hiyoshi in 73 each.
	   Aki Takamura shot a 72 for a share of eighth at 142 with Chieko
Nishida, who carded a 74.
	   Overnight leader Toshimi Kimura struggled to a 78 for a share of
15th at 144.

Presidential meeting to cap Taiwan negotiator's visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Taiwan's top negotiator soaked up Beijing's
sights Saturday ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin that was to cap a visit hailed as a fresh start in relations.
	   Koo Chen-fu was scheduled to spend an hour Sunday with Jiang, in
a meeting expected to highlight the thaw in ties evidenced by Koo's
trip after a three-year hiatus in contacts.
	   A breakthrough at the meeting was unlikely. Taiwan and China
have a rivalry that dates back five decades to the Chinese civil
war, and as recently as 1996 China was seeking to intimidate the
island by testing missiles off its waters.
	   But the atmosphere at Sunday's meeting in the luxurious confines
of Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house should be brightened by an
agreement Koo secured earlier during his visit this week for China
and Taiwan to work toward resuming formal negotiations.
	   Beijing suspended those talks in 1995, in anger over a trip by
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to the United States. China viewed
the visit as an affront to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan
and as a sign that Lee was leading the island toward independence.
Beijing responded by test-firing missiles and holding war games
near Taiwan, and by suspending negotiations.
	   As China's top leader, Jiang oversaw that crisis, which pushed
the two sides closer to war than they had been in decades. So by
agreeing to meet Koo during this visit, Jiang appeared to be
signaling a desire for some degree of rapprochement.
	   Jiang is under pressure from the powerful Chinese military and
communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to reunification with
the Chinese mainland. The island has been separated politically
from the mainland since Taiwan's Nationalist government fled there
after losing the Chinese civil war to China's Communists in 1949.
	   Koo declined at a news conference Friday to give details about
what he expected to discuss with Jiang.
	   Koo went sightseeing Saturday, visiting a memorial to Chinese
nationalist Sun Yat-sen, the prestigious Beijing University, and
the Forbidden City, the former residence of China's emperors.
	   On Sunday, before his sit-down with Jiang, Koo was also due to
meet Vice Premier Qian Qichen, a former foreign minister.
	   In a sign of the lingering distrust between Taiwan and China,
Taiwan's vice foreign minister, David Lee, claimed Saturday that
Qian had recently ordered Chinese diplomats to step up efforts to
isolate Taiwan diplomatically.
	   Lee quoted Qian as having called for a ``face-to-face struggle''
with Taiwan to lure away its dwindling number of diplomatic
partners. Just 27 countries now recognize Taiwan, with most having
switched recognition to Beijing.
	   Lee called on China to clarify Qian's remarks. ``We hope the
mainland authorities will respond to our goodwill and sincerity
with the same goodwill and sincerity,'' he said at a news
conference.

	   ILIGAN, Philippines (AP) _ A woman who had hitched a ride on a
small plane was killed when it crashed near a schoolhouse in a
remote village in the southern Philippines early Saturday, police
said.
	   The three others on the plane, including the pilot of the
single-engine Beechcraft, were injured, said Iligan police chief
Isnaji Bantala.
	   The airplane crashed close to the schoolhouse in the village of
Lilangan northeast of Iligan City around 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Friday).
Local authorities said it was cloud-covered, raining and windy.
	   The pilot of the plane, owned by Matling Industrial and
Commercial Corp., had attempted to contact the control tower at
nearby Cagayan de Oro airport but was unable to do so, said Antonio
Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating Center.
	   A passing Philippine Airlines plane received the radio message
and informed airport authorities in Cagayan de Oro that the pilot
reported his plane was going down, Babijes said.
	   Melquiades Loyola, one of the injured passengers and an
administrative assistant of the company, said in a television
interview that the engine suddenly quit.
	   He said the pilot then looked for a place to land that was close
to a community ``for the possibility of recovering our bodies.''
	   ``We had no alternative but to crashland,'' Loyola said as he
was being treated at a hospital in Cagayan de Oro.
	   An officer of the company said the woman who died, Tessie
Prospero, was the wife of Matling's cashier.
	   Prospero and her daughter, Daisy May, who was injured, had
hitched a ride on the plane from Cagayan de Oro to visit her
husband in Malabang, where the company is based.
	   Malabang, a town in Lanao del Sur province, is south of Iligan,
about 700 kilometers (440 miles) south of Manila.

Radio: Government preparing amnesty bill for rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Seeking new ways to end 12 years of
insurgency in northern and western Uganda, the government plans to
introduce a bill in parliament that would offer amnesty to all
rebel groups, Radio Uganda said Saturday.
	   The state-run radio said the government had appointed five
ministers to consult with district and regional officials to win
support for the proposed Amnesty Bill 1998.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   If true, it would mark a departure from President Yoweri
Museveni's refusal to negotiate with rebels he has labelled
traitors and terrorists.
	   ``In accordance with a policy of reconciliation as one of the
avenues of establishing peace in all parts of the country, an
amnesty will be extended to all persons engaged in activities of
war,'' said a statement broadcast over Radio Uganda and issued by
Ruhakana Rugunda, the minister in charge of the president's office.
	   Two major rebel groups and several smaller ones are operating in
Uganda: the Lord's Resistance Army which has terrorized the north
of the county from bases in war-torn southern Sudan, and the Allied
Democratic Forces which is based along Uganda's western border with
Congo.
	   Both groups regularly raid Ugandan towns and villages, killing
and slashing civilians and abducting children and teenagers they
force to fight or become slaves.
	   The ideologies of both groups are not clear.
	   A government official said this week that 12,000 students had
been abducted in northern Uganda since the LRA began operating in
1986 when Museveni took power after a five-yer bush war.
	   About half of them have since been rescued by the army.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan of backing the LRA and the ADF. Khartoum,
in turn, accuses Uganda of backing rebels in southern Sudan.
	   Radio Uganda said the five ministers would begin their
nationwide campaign in support of the bill next week.
	   The radio did not say when the bill would be presented in
parliament.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A determined Mark Woodforde of Australia fought
back from one set down in his semifinal match at the dlrs 700,000
Singapore Open indoor tennis tournament on Saturday to advance into
his first singles finals in four years.
	   Woodforde, better known for his doubles play on the world's
second-ranked team, defeated Dutchman Sjeng Schalken 0-6, 6-4, 6-2.
He will meet top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile in the final of the
ATP tour event on Sunday.
	   The Australian overcame a drubbing in the first set, succumbing
to what he described as ``impatient'' play, as Schalken broke his
serve three times to take six games consecutively.
	   But Woodforde regained his confidence in the next two sets,
using an inspired variety of slices, drop-shots and lobs to dictate
the pace of play.
	   He broke his Dutch opponent in the tenth and final game of the
second set to pull even. Moving smoothly around the court,
Woodforde put together an impressive array of passing and drop
shots in the deciding set.
	   Schalken misjudged a lunging lob from the Australian in the
critical fourth game of the final set that broke the Dutchman's
serve, and Woodforde quickly finished his opponent off with another
break to take the set and match.
	   Singles world number three Marcelo Rios manhandled American Jim
Courier in the other semifinal. The top seed took a mere 55 minutes
of nearly flawless play to win 6-2, 6-1.
	   The two former world number one players entered the tournament
in very different standings, with Courier a wild card and Rios the
clear favorite.
	   ``I felt really good, and I didn't give him any chance,'' said a
matter-of-fact Rios, who predicts victory on Sunday.
	   The Chilean saved all five break points Courier was able to
manage against his serve, and converted five of his eight break
points against the hapless American.

Kyrgyzstan holds vote on constitutional changes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with other amendments on freedom of press,
lawmakers' immunity, vote declared valid, new Akayev quote. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Voters in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan
chose Saturday whether to amend their constitution to allow private
land ownership and ban parliament from restricting freedom of
press.
	   Other amendments on the referendum would deprive lawmakers of
immunity from prosecution and increase the number of legislators in
parliament, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev proposed the national referendum
last month. The vote was declared valid after more than 50 percent
of the former Soviet republic's 2.4 million voters took part.
	   Even if the land amendment passes, no sales of agricultural land
will be allowed for five years, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   That amendment would also grant Kyrgyzstan's rural residents
ownership of the small land plots they live on. Non-Kyrgyz citizens
and companies with foreign participation would be barred from
owning land in this former Soviet republic.
	   ``Private ownership of land will spur on the whole progress of
reform in the country, and it is not ruled out that other (former
Soviet republics) will follow this example,'' Akayev said after
casting his ballot, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Thirty international monitors were observing the election.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Negotiators from Pakistan and India,
the world's newest nuclear powers, discussed the 51-year old
dispute over Kashmir Saturday, and agreed to keep talking _ which
was the most anyone expected.
	   ``It will be unrealistic on anybody's part (to expect) that we
will come out with any concrete outcome about ... one of the
world's most complex issue,'' Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed said at the end of Saturday's talks.
	   The two foreign secretaries are expected to issue a joint
communique on Sunday when the talks conclude.
	   ``Our positions are known, ... we want to move toward the
solution of our problems in the interest of two countries,'' said
India's foreign secretary K. Raghunath.
	   Before Saturday's talks began, Kashmiri leaders said they had
little hope of a major breakthrough during the current round of
talks, saying a solution was years away.
	   ``The past experience shows that such talks have not made any
headway in resolving the Kashmir problem ... though we wish they
yield some positive results,'' Sardar Abdul Qayyum, ex-prime
minister of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir told The Associated Press.

Marriage of Imran Khan, Jemima Goldsmith is in trouble _ reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The three-year marriage of former Pakistan cricket
captain Imran Khan and billionaire's daughter Jemima Goldsmith is
in trouble, Britain's tabloid newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Cultural difference, a large age gap and Khan's determination to
forge a political career have driven the couple apart, reports
said.
	   Jemima, 24, reportedly four months' pregnant with the couple's
second child, remained in London this weekend while her 45-year-old
husband flew to the United States to raise money for the cancer
hospital he founded in Lahore.
	   Neither was available for comment Saturday, although reporters
who caught up with Khan in the United States quoted him as saying
that ''as far as I am concerned we are getting on fine, thankyou,
unless something has happened since I got on the flight that I do
not know of.''
	   The tabloid Daily Mail quoted an unidentified friend as saying
that ''there has been no row and there is certainly no one else
involved.''
	   ``But there inevitably have been difficulties with this culture
clash. The news that they were expecting a second child has brought
things to a head.''
	   The couple live with Khan's family in Lahore, but Jemima,
daughter of the late Anglo-French entrepreneur Jimmy Goldsmith,
regularly makes extended visits to her family in London.
	   Newspapers said Khan was upset that his wife, who has converted
to Islam, was attending too many frivolous parties in London, not
seemly behavior for a Muslim woman. She reportedly feels restricted
by the Muslim way of life and neglected as her husband becomes
increasingly involved in his Movement for Justice Party.
	   The couple, who married in Paris in May 1995, have a 2-year-old
son, Sulaiman.

Anwar's wife joins protest in downtown Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police arresting people, other details. Raises
context. No pick up
 &UR; AP Photos KL101-105
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of jailed dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim joined several thousand protesters who crammed
the sidewalks of downtown Kuala Lumpur streets Saturday to demand
the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Riot police deployed to prevent the show of support for Anwar,
however, did not immediately try to disperse the demonstrators who
mingled with shoppers crowding malls ahead of a Hindu festival.
	   Many of the shoppers scurried off with their carry bags fearing
violence. Some malls shut their front doors.
	   As Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, drove to the crowded street,
hundreds of people rushed to her shouting ``Reforms! Reforms!'' and
``Mahathir Resign.'' She shook hands with some from inside her car.
	   It was the first time since her husband's arrest last month that
Azizah has joined a street protest. Police have warned her against
participating in the campaign her husband began.
	   Cars honked incessantly in solidarity as protesters held up
posters and shouted slogans against the government, in the latest
of the street demonstrations that have erupted regularly since
Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest. The former deputy prime minister was
arrested after organizing huge anti-government protests.
	   Eyewitnesses said they saw police making several arrests from
among the protesters who had been warned repeatedly in recent weeks
that such gatherings were illegal.
	   Many of the shoppers Saturday were out buying new clothes and
gifts for Monday's Deepavali festival during which Hindus light
lamps in their homes and distribute sweets. About 10 percent of
Malaysia's 22 million people are Hindus of Indian ethnicity. The
majority are Malay Muslims.
	   Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the former deputy was
subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He faces trial beginning Nov. 2.
	   He has dismissed international concern over Anwar's treatment
and defended his action saying his former deputy was too immoral
for public office.
	   On Saturday, Mahathir said during a visit to Tokyo that Anwar
was being treated well in jail and even had a mattress to sleep on.
	   Anwar, 51, has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up
to eliminate the political challenge he had posed to Mahathir.
	   Protests in defiance of police threats of arrest and violence
have become a regular feature since Anwar's firing. Protests were
rare in Malaysia where even established political parties never
dared hold a gathering without the permission of the police.
	   Late Friday night, police arrested three people for
demonstrating at a rally in the southern port town of Malacca
organized by an opposition coalition that has campaigned for the
release of Anwar, the national news agency Bernama said.
	   Meanwhile, a government minister blamed the foreign media
coverage of opposition street rallies in Malaysia for scaring away
tourists.
	   The hotel occupancy rate had dwindled to 54 percent from 67
percent in the same period last year, Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Friday.
	   ``CNN has been successful in portraying the so-called havoc in
Malaysia in a manner that will keep away tourists from coming
here,'' he told reporters.
	   The minister also criticized the CNBC news network for what he
called distorted news coverage. CNBC has denied previous
accusations of biased coverage by Malaysian officials.

Ministers tussle with question of saving Air Afrique
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMBA DADSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ West African government ministers on
Saturday rejected calls to liquidate the debt-ridden passenger
liner Air Afrique, but sidestepped questions about how it would be
saved.
	   Speaking to journalists, Ivory Coast's Transportation Minister
Adama Coulibaly said a committee of experts had determined that the
airline, which is saddled with a dlrs 300 million debt, remains a
viable company.
	   Coulibaly was heading a committee of ministers from the
company's 11 major shareholding countries that were meeting other
partners in Ivory Coast's commercial capital to discuss ways of
saving the multi-national airline from collapse.
	   A law firm hired by Air Afrique had found several unnamed
investors _ including some in France _ willing to help defray the
debt, Coulibaly said.
	   ``The question of liquidation is completely out of the
question,'' he said.
	   At least 60 percent of the debt stemmed from the 1994
devaluation of the regional CFA franc currency used by the 11
shareholding countries, Coulibaly said.
	   In July, creditors led by France's Credit Lyonnais seized four
new Air Afrique airbuses after the company failed to pay dlrs 50
million in arrears.
	   As a result, the airline was forced to cut some of its long haul
flights to the United States and Europe.
	   Coulibaly however said that meetings with the company's
creditors in France earlier this month had proved fruitful.
	   ``We have asked them for leniency... and we have to find the
solutions together,'' he said.
	   The airline was eager to pursue a two-year-old proposal to
create a separate holding company that would buy the airline's
fleet and then lease the jets back, Coulibaly said without
providing details.
	   Although only three of its member countries have come up with
the dlrs 2 million contribution needed to create the company, the
other companies had promised to contribute by the end of June 1999,
Coulibaly said.
	   Last month, the company announced that 19 percent of its shares
would be sold to private citizens and companies in the shareholding
countries.
	   Air Afrique began 36 years ago and is now jointly owned by Ivory
Coast, Senegal, Mauritania, Chad, Niger, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso,
Congo, Mali and the Central African Republic.

Ozaki stays on top in rain-delayed Nikkei Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KASUMIGAURA, Japan (AP) _ Overnight leader Masashi ``Jumbo''
Ozaki held on to a one-stroke lead Saturday when play was halted
due to darkness in the 110 million yen (dlrs 928,000) Nikkei Cup
Torakichi Nakamura Memorial.
	   Ozaki, seeking his third title of the season and 109th overall,
finished only 16 holes of the rain-delayed third round, remaining
at 9-under total with four birdies and as many bogeys over the
par-72 Fuji Country Dejima Club.
	   Play was called with Ozaki and five others having yet to hole
out. The rainy weather had delayed the start of the round for two
and a half hours.
	   Yasuharu Imano, who started five strokes off the pace, was
nipping at Ozaki's heels with an eight-under total after 17 holes.
	   Toshimitsu Izawa, winner of the Tokai Classic last week, was at
7-under after finishing 16 holes.
	   Izawa, Ozaki's playing partner in the third round, stands one
shot ahead of clubhouse leader Brian Watts of the United States.
	   Watts fired a 69 for a 6-under 210 total, one stroke ahead of
Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng and Mitsutaka Kusakabe, who shot 68s each
for a 211 total.
	   The remainder of the third round will be played before the start
of the final round Sunday morning.

Moi to host regional summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The presidents of Uganda, Tanzania and
Kenya are to hold a one-day summit in the Kenyan capital to discuss
East African cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
	   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi will host the meeting at State
House Sunday with Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Uganda's Yoweri
Museveni, a spokesman said.
	   No details were available on what the leaders would discuss, but
it appeared likely the two-month conflict in neighboring Congo
would be on the agenda.
	   Congolese rebels this week scored what appeared to be a major
victory in their effort to topple President Laurent Kabila when
they captured the eastern town of Kindu and its strategic air base.
	   Kabila's forces had been using the base to attack rebel
strongholds in the east.
	   Several countries have been drawn into the rebellion since it
broke out Aug. 2. Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have all
acknowledged sending troops to support Kabila; rebels say Sudan has
also sent troops.
	   Although they do not openly acknowledge support for the rebels,
Uganda and Rwanda are providing military and logistical support in
what they call defense of legitimate security interests.
	   Both complain that rebels from their country have been able to
operate freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border attacks
aimed at destabilizing the two countries.
	   Museveni has denied his troops are participating in the
Congolese war, and says they are only inside Congo along the
Ugandan border to fight the Ugandan Allied Democratic Rebels based
there.
	   Mkapa of Tanzania and Zambian President Frederich Chiluba were
appointed last month by the South African Development Community to
meet with all parties to the Congo conflict in an effort to broker
peace in Congo, the third largest nation in sub-Saharan Africa.

Russian parliament speaker praises Kosovo accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament
said Saturday his country's rigorous mediation efforts have helped
avert NATO airstrikes on the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   ``It was Russia's powerful activity that produced serious
influence on NATO countries,'' Yegor Stroyev said in St.
Petersburg, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   NATO on Friday gave Yugoslavia more time to fulfill a peace
pledge and avoid airstrikes on separatist Kosovo. On Saturday, a
Yugoslav official said President Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw
his Serb-led forces in time to meet the new deadline.
	   Russia staunchly opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia,
with which it shares common Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian
religion. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it might help Serbia
with weapons if NATO strikes.
	   Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev predicted Friday that
the peace deal would hold thanks to Moscow's mediation, and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov praised Moscow's role in settling the
conflict.
	   A few dozen peace activists rallied outside the lower house of
Russia's parliament Friday to protest the potential airstrikes.
	   NATO's top political officer, Klaus Klaiber, said Russia would
not be consulted if the alliance decides to attack, the Interfax
news agency reported from NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

Road workers discover prehistoric cave in southern France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two road workers building a highway in southern
France have stumbled across a prehistoric cave, which specialists
are calling an ``exceptional discovery.''
	   The workers were clearing the way for the construction of the
new A75 highway to connect the cities of Millau and Beziers in the
Languedoc region when they discovered the cave Friday, police said.
	   Local authorities quickly dispatched a team of specialists to
the so-called ``Cirque de Moureze'' area about 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of the city of Montpellier.
	   Four human skeletons, three adults and a child, were preserved
in the cave, as well as cooking pots, which could date from the
Neolithic era, 8,000 to 3,500 B.C.
	   According to Laurent Boismenu, of the Medical-Legal Institute in
Montpellier, the cave could be from the Cro-Magnon period.
	   France's most famous Cro-Magnon cave is Lascaux in the Dordogne
region, where magnificent paintings of animals have been preserved.

President, premier urge their party to keep high moral standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's president and premier urged
their ruling party Saturday to stick to high moral standards in
order to boost voters' support before local elections in October.
	   Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, head of the Union of Democratic
Forces, said his party must win the local ballot in order to
accomplish democratic and market reforms and pave the way for
winning general elections in 2001.
	   ``The key word in our government should be `morals','' President
Petar Stoyanov told a party meeting. ``We must decisively reject
abuse of party posts and office.''
	   A critical tone prevailed in Kostov's speech as well, despite
the party's success in overcoming an economic collapse caused by
the previous Socialist government, regaining the trust of foreign
lenders and improving ties with the West.
	   He accused some party officials of a ``nonchalant and reckless
attitude toward corruption,'' of self-complacency and arrogance, of
cronyism and ignoring voters' woes, of being awkward in coping with
journalists and intolerant to media critics.
	   ``The UDF shall struggle against political patronage,'' Kostov
said. ``We shall not reproduce the (image of) former communist
rulers.''
	   The opposition has repeatedly alleged that a shakeup in
Bulgaria's notoriously inefficient and corrupt public
administration was just aimed at installing Kostov loyalists.
	   ``We must ask ourselves what our government looks like to a very
critical outside observer,'' Kostov said. ``Haughtiness and
arrogance are not European prescriptions for politics.''
	   The party rode a wave of public discontent with Socialists,
former communists, to win 1997 elections. Kostov said the party
should now expand and strengthen its base by trying to permanently
win moderate voters.

U.S. widens terrorism charges against suspect in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have widened charges
against an alleged top aide of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin
Laden awaiting extradition in Germany, officials said Saturday.
	   Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his
arrest near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a
U.S. warrant. He was charged with murder conspiracy and use of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. prosecutors recently filed additional charges of conspiracy
to transport explosives and attack military installations, Bavarian
justice ministry spokesman Gerhard Zierl said Saturday.
	   He declined comment on a report in Der Spiegel newsmagazine that
the evidence so far was not very strong.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British police said Saturday they have arrested
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of
murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
	   The 82-year-old former dictator, in London for back surgery, was
arrested Friday night after British authorities received a Spanish
extradition warrant, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said, speaking
anonymously.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens
in Chile, the spokeswoman said.
	   She refused to confirm where Pinochet is being held. No hearing
date has been set.
	   Earlier, an influential lawmaker from the governing Labor Party
said Pinochet needed to be brought to justice.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two people were missing after a deadly typhoon hit
Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu Saturday, drenching the
area with heavy rains and interrupting travel in much of the
country. Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74 people in the
Philippines and 18 in Taiwan, made landfall near the city of
Makurazaki in Kagoshima Prefecture, 985 kilometers (616 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, at around 4:30 p.m. (0730 GMT), Japan's
Meteorological Agency said. The typhoon was moving northeast at a
speed of 35 kilometers per hour. Zeb was expected to cross western
Japan and enter the Sea of Japan early Sunday, before heading
toward northern Japan, the agency said. Two men, aged 19 and 22,
were missing and believed drowned off on the southern island of
Okinawa after they went to the beach to watch roaring waves brought
on by the typhoon, an Okinawa police spokesman said. (PACIFIC
TYPHOON)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of jailed dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim joined several thousand protesters who crammed
the sidewalks of downtown Kuala Lumpur streets Saturday to demand
the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Riot police
deployed to prevent the show of support for Anwar did not
immediately try to disperse the demonstrators who mingled with
shoppers crowding malls ahead of a Hindu festival. As Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, drove to the packed street, hundreds of people
rushed to her shouting ``Reforms! Reforms!'' and ``Mahathir
Resign.'' Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the former
deputy was subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts. He faces trial beginning Nov. 2.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia more time to fulfill a peace pledge and avoid
airstrikes, a Yugoslav official said Saturday that President
Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw forces in time to meet the new
deadline. A convoy of tanks and trucks appeared to be leaving
Kosovo Friday night and the expected arrival Saturday of a
15-member advance team to prepare for the mission of 2,000 unarmed
observers signified more Yugoslav compliance with Western demands
to end the conflict. NATO on Friday decided to extend the deadline
to reduce Yugoslav forces in Kosovo by 10 days, until Oct. 27.
About 400 NATO warplanes will be kept ready for possible airstrikes
if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Halfway through the latest round of
Mideast peace talks, President Bill Clinton is again joining
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to try to mediate differences over
countering terrorism. In the balance is a long-sought accord that
would give the Palestinians control over more land in the West
Bank. Clinton planned to meet Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with hopes
an agreement can be reached by Sunday. According to diplomatic
sources, the Palestinians have accepted neither an Israeli demand
that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel for trial nor an
American compromise that they be tried by Palestinian courts. And
while the Palestinians were willing to take steps to enhance
security in the Arab city of Ramallah, there was ``absolutely no
real movement on anything'' else Friday, said one of the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Consumer prices have soared 45 percent since
Russia devalued the ruble and put off its foreign debts two months
ago, according to Central Bank and government statistics, a news
report said Saturday. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said
in an interview with the daily Kommersant that he was not to blame
for the economic meltdown and predicted things would only get
worse. Prices jumped immediately after the crisis hit and imports _
which Russia had come to rely upon for half its consumer goods _
plunged. Basic foods have remained available and the government
insists it doesn't expect shortages, though the smallest grain
harvest in decades has aggravated concerns about feeding the
world's largest country. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

Afghan opposition claims to have taken key city from Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance
claimed Saturday to have captured the capital of northern Takhar
province from the Taliban religious militia and said heavy fighting
raged in two nearby districts.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the opposition claims
that it had seized Taloqan, some 260 kilometers (160 miles) north
of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   If true, the capture of Taloqan will be the first major victory
for the opposition in more than a year.
	   The Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, control almost 90 percent of
the country including Kabul. They follow a strict version of Islam
that bars women from work and education, bans arts and music and
forces men to wear beards.
	   The opposition forces represent religious and ethnic minorities
and consist mainly of the fighters of Ahmed Shah Massood's
Jamiat-e-Islami, defense minister in the ousted government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   ``Our fighters have finally captured Taloqan, the capital of
Takhar province,'' a spokesman of the opposition on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said around 500 Taliban fighters had been taken prisoners and
more than 100 vehicles captured. There was no immediate report of
casualties.
	   Opposition fighters were locked in fierce battles with the
Taliban in two other districts, including Dasht-i-Archi of Takhar
province, he said.
	   The Taliban provided no immediate comment.
	   Taloqan is located near Afghanistan's northern border with the
Central Asian state of Tajikistan.
	   Earlier Saturday one rocket landed in the combined military and
civilian airport in the Afghan capital but there was neither damage
nor injuries as a result, said Taliban troops there.
	   The rocket was fired from the direction of Massood's troops,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) away.

Government to trace blood recipients for Hepatitis C virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong will trace patients who received
blood transfusions seven years ago from donors who later tested
positive for Hepatitis C virus, health authorities said Saturday.
	   A statement from the Hospital Authority said the former blood
recipients will be provided with an opportunity to undergo a free
test for the virus.
	   It said a screening test for the Hepatitis C virus, which often
causes chronic infection of the liver, was first introduced in Hong
Kong on July 1, 1991.
	   The statement said 547 people donated blood before July 1991 who
were later tested positive for the virus, but that the risk of
contracting the disease from such blood transfusions is low.
	   Dr. Ko Wing-man, deputy director of the Hospital Authority, said
Hong Kong is one of the first places in Asia to conduct the tracing
exercise, which is line with guidelines issued by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Members of an advance team for a
planned 2,000-strong international verification force arrived in
Belgrade on Saturday, a day before heading to Kosovo to help set up
the mission.
	   The 13 delegation members were to be joined later this weekend
by several others also involved in logistics for the monitoring
mission _ being overseen by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   John Sandrock, a member of the group that flew in from Vienna
where OSCE is headquartered, said they will remain in Yugoslavia
until at least Wednesday, checking out sites where monitors will be
based and arranging other details.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   ``We will report to the OSCE Permanent Council on what we
observe, on what we see and what we feel we require to build this
mission to full strength.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five people were killed when a

also destroyed three homes, police said.
	   The fire started at about 2:30 p.m. (0730 GMT) in a small
neigborhood on the northern outskirts of Bangkok. The cause of the
fire was not immediately known, but it was reportedly fueled by the
fireworks and spread rapidly.
	   Five people were also seriously injured and one was still
missing after jumping into a canal, said a police officer who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Authorities searched the area for nearly
four hours without finding the missing person.
	   All five of the dead were women.

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges

	   LONDON (AP) _ British police said Saturday they have arrested
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of
murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
	   Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was arrested Friday night
after British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens
in Chile, the spokeswoman said. Hundreds of Spaniards disappeared
in Chile during that period.
	   The spokeswoman refused to confirm where Pinochet is being held.
No hearing date has been set.
	   Chilean Ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, told Radio
Cooperative of Santiago Saturday that the former dictator ``is
being held until he testifies'' before an unspecified court.
	   He said he will seek the release of Pinochet _ ``what we must do
is make it clear that Mr. Pinochet is a senator, who travels with a
diplomatic passport,'' Artaza said. But he said the Chilean
government ''has nothing to do with the judicial aspect'' of the
case.
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, underwent surgery for a
herniated disc a week ago, was reported to have left London Bridge
Hospital on Wednesday.
	   The same day, Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates
handling probes into human rights violations in Chile and
Argentina, filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question
Pinochet a day earlier.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia 10 more days to fulfill a peace pledge and avoid
airstrikes, a Yugoslav official said Saturday that President
Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw forces in time to meet the new
deadline.
	   On a day when NATO planned to begin spy flights over Kosovo to
check on the status of Milosevic's promises, there were continuing
signs Yugoslavia was gradually complying with demands to end the
turmoil.
	   A huge Yugoslav army convoy appeared to leave Kosovo, and an
advance team of Western specialists arrived in Yugoslavia to
prepare for the mission of 2,000 monitors in the Serbian province,
as allowed by Belgrade in an agreement signed Friday.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio Saturday.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend a four-day grace period that
would have expired Saturday morning, giving Milosevic until Oct. 27
to fully comply. About 400 NATO warplanes are being kept ready for
possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises.
	   At least 144 army tanks, artillery trucks and other vehicles
were seen driving in the direction of the provincial border with
Serbia Friday night.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb forces and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement called for Belgrade's forces in Kosovo to be
reduced to levels they were at before the crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels began Feb. 28.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes, and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not yet enough to head off the possibility of
airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   NATO U-2 surveillance planes were to begin flying over Kosovo on
Saturday under an agreement signed with Yugoslavia, a U.S. official
said in Washington on condition of anonymity. There was no
immediate confirmation the flights had begun.
	   An advance team for the OSCE, Europe's main problem-solving
alliance, arrived in Belgrade to begin planning for the arrival of
the 2,000 monitors. The 13 staffers were to be joined by about
seven others by the time they arrive in Pristina on Sunday.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' said delegation
member John Sandrock.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in Vienna that the group
hopes to have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo
within two weeks.

Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw forces in time to meet the new
deadline.
	   On a day when NATO planned to begin spy flights over Kosovo to
check on the status of Milosevic's promises, there were continuing
signs Yugoslavia was gradually complying with demands to end the
turmoil.
	   A Yugoslav army convoy appeared to leave Kosovo, and a 20-member
advance team was headed to the Serbian province to prepare for the
mission of 2,000 international monitors, as allowed by Belgrade in
an agreement signed Friday.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corporation radio Saturday.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend a four-day grace period that
would have expired Saturday morning, giving Milosevic until Oct. 27
to comply fully. About 400 NATO warplanes are being kept ready for
possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces, who consider Kosovo their
historic heartland, and ethnic Albanians seeking to secede from
Serbia. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been displaced from their homes there.
	   At least 144 army tanks, artillery trucks and other vehicles
were seen driving in the direction of the provincial border with
Serbia Friday night. Serbia is the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb forces and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement called for Belgrade's forces in Kosovo to be

	   The advance team from the OSCE, Europe's main problem-solving
alliance, headed from Austria to Yugoslavia on Saturday to begin
planning for the arrival of the 2,000 monitors, spokeswoman Melissa
Fleming said in Vienna. They were expected to drive from Belgrade
to Pristina later Saturday or Sunday.
	   The government signed a deal Friday with the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to let the OSCE
``verifiers'' monitor Milosevic's pledge to withdraw his troops and
allow the return of refugees.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. Several thousand
ethnic Albanians are still living outdoors in about five locations
in Kosovo.
	   In the town of Pagarusa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, the United Nations delivered 160 tons of
flour, oil and other food to refugees in the area.
	   Sven L. Pedersen, with the World Food Program, said Serb police
were more cooperative in recent days.
	   ``There are less delays at checkpoints,'' he said. ``Before,
police used to check us going in and out to see what we're
carrying.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where Serbs comprise only
about 10 percent of the population, remain skeptical of Milosevic's
compliance. They also are reluctant to accept anything short of
independence for the province, while international officials urge a
lesser form of self-rule.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian specialists started disinfecting the first
component of the international space station on Saturday, a power
and propulsion module scheduled for launch next month, a news
report said.
	   The 20-ton Zarya module, built by Russia's Khrunichev company
under contract with the U.S.-based Boeing, must be sterilized
before it goes up Nov. 20. The disinfection is expected to last
until Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Khrunichev
specialists as saying.
	   NASA will follow in December with the launch of the second part,
an American-built passageway. The third part _ Russia's still
unfinished service module _ is to be launched from Kazakstan in
April 1999.
	   The station's first crew cannot go up until after that, more
than a year later than originally planned. The 16 countries
involved in the station have had to delay construction for two
years in a row because of Russia's inability to pay its share.

Taylor gives up record putting Pakistan in to bat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with play at stumps &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) - Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmed hit
strokeful centuries as Pakistan replied to Australia's first
innings total of 599 for four declared on the third day of the
second cricket Test Saturday.
	   The double-century second wicket partnership between Anwar (126)
and Ahmed (125 not out) took the home team to 329 for two when
stumps were drawn for the day.
	   They need another 71 runs to avoid follow-on with eight wickets
in hand.
	   Ahmad got his ninth Test century and fourth against Australia
when he cut leg-spinner Stuart MacGill to point boundary for his
16th four of the innings.
	   Taylor took the second new ball late in the day, but Ahmad twice
lifted paceman Glenn McGrath to the mid-wicket boundary. He has so
far hit 20 fours in his 242 ball innings in 329 minutes.
	   Just like Pakistan bowlers, Australians too found little
assistance from a a flat Arbab Niaz Stadium wicket with Pakistan
scoring at a healthy pace in the first two sessions.
	   They made 123 runs during the pre-lunch period and added another
114 in the mid-session without further damage. Pakistan went for
tea at 237 for one.
	   Both batsmen were especially harsh on leg-spinner Stuart
MacGill, who conceded 89 runs off his 20 overs without any success.
	   Anwar struck his second successive century of the series in a
grand style, hitting Mark Waugh's gentle off-spin over mid-wicket
for a big six.
	   The left-handed opener, who made 145 in Pakistan's first Test
loss by an innings and 99 runs, hit 16 fours, with five coming
through the slips cordon early in the innings.
	   Off-spinner Collin Miller broke the stand when Anwar tried and
edged to wicketkeeper Ian Healy's gloves. Anwar's 126 contained 18
boundaries and three sixes, while he faced 226 balls during his 289
minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Earlier, Mark Taylor put national interest ahead of a personal
landmark when he declared Australian first innings at the overnight
score of 599 for four and remained undefeated on 334.
	   ``For me victory in the series is more important on the
sub-continent,'' said Taylor, who left 41 short of West Indian
Brian Lara's world record. Lara made 375 against England in 1994.
	   ``Lara's world record of 375 is not important for me. It's nice
to be bracketed with Sir Don Bradman,'' Taylor said, after equaling
Bradman's one of the two triple centuries mark.
	   Australia's former Test captain and a record holder for most
Test runs, Allan Border said: ``It was a very bold decision. But
still whenever Bradman's name will be mentioned, Mark's (Taylor)
innings will also be discussed.''
	   ``Taylor is such a type of player for whom the team's victory is
above all and that he showed it today,'' Border said.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket slammed into an eastern
neighborhood of Kabul on Saturday, killing three people and
wounding four others. Two children were missing and neighbors
feared they were buried beneath the rubble.
	   No one took immediate responsibility for the attack, but
witnesses in the area said the rocket came from where opposition
troops, led by former military Ahmed Shah Massood, were positioned
north of the capital.
	   Residents of the area dug through the rubble with their hands,
searching for survivors, witnesses said.
	   Earlier in the day another rocket landed in the compound of the
combined military and civilian airport, but there were no injuries
or damage.
	   The attack came as Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance claimed
to have captured the capital of northern Takhar province from the
Taliban religious militia and said heavy fighting raged in two
nearby districts.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the opposition claims
that it had seized Taloqan, some 260 kilometers (160 miles) north
of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   If true, the capture of Taloqan will be the first major victory
for the opposition in more than a year.
	   The Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, control almost 90 percent of
the country including Kabul. They follow a strict version of Islam
that bars women from work and education, bans arts and music and
forces men to wear beards.
	   The opposition forces represent religious and ethnic minorities
and consist mainly of the fighters of Ahmed Shah Massood's
Jamiat-e-Islami, defense minister in the ousted government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   ``Our fighters have finally captured Taloqan, the capital of
Takhar province,'' a spokesman of the opposition on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said around 500 Taliban fighters had been taken prisoners and
more than 100 vehicles captured. There was no immediate report of
casualties.
	   Opposition fighters were locked in fierce battles with the
Taliban in two other districts, including Dasht-i-Archi of Takhar
province, he said.
	   The Taliban provided no immediate comment.
	   Taloqan is located near Afghanistan's northern border with the
Central Asian state of Tajikistan.

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES reference to hundreds of Spaniards in grafs 3 and 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British police said Saturday they have arrested
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of
murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
	   Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was arrested Friday night
after British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered a number of
Spanish citizens in Chile, the spokeswoman said.
	   The spokeswoman refused to confirm where Pinochet is being held.
No hearing date has been set.
	   Chilean Ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, told Radio
Cooperative of Santiago Saturday that the former dictator ``is
being held until he testifies'' before an unspecified court.
	   He said he will seek the release of Pinochet _ ``what we must do
is make it clear that Mr. Pinochet is a senator, who travels with a
diplomatic passport,'' Artaza said. But he said the Chilean
government ``has nothing to do with the judicial aspect'' of the
case.
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, underwent surgery for a
herniated disc a week ago, was reported to have left London Bridge
Hospital on Wednesday.
	   The same day, Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates
handling probes into human rights violations in Chile and
Argentina, filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question
Pinochet a day earlier.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of Spanish citizens in Argentina
during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

Relatives of Chechnya kidnapping victims join forces, vow revenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Relatives of 79 people kidnapped in
breakaway Chechnya converged on the Chechen interior minister
Saturday and offered to help officials find and free the hostages.
	   The group said it had asked Chechen Interior Minister Aslambek
Artaymet to grant them legal status so they can hunt for their
captured relatives. It was unclear whether he would do so.
	   The family members threatened to declare ``bloody revenge'' and
take up arms against the kidnappers if they don't release the
hostages.
	   Among the captives are three Britons and a New Zealander seized
earlier this month. None of their relatives attended Saturday's
meeting in the Chechen capital Grozny.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have been common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   So far this year, 176 people have been kidnapped in the North
Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of foreigners, and 90
of them released, officials have said.
	   Meanwhile, a group of ethnic Chechens living in the neighboring
republic of Dagestan called on all Chechens to unite in support of
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who faces mounting opposition at
home, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Chechens are estimated to live in other
regions of Russia, and at least 100,000 live outside the former
Soviet Union.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia 10 more days to fulfill a peace pledge and avoid
airstrikes, a Yugoslav official said Saturday that President
Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw forces in time to meet the new
deadline.
	   On a day when NATO planned to begin spy flights over Kosovo to
check on the status of Milosevic's promises, there were continuing
signs Yugoslavia was gradually complying with demands to end the
turmoil.
	   A Yugoslav army convoy appeared to leave Kosovo, and a 20-member
advance team was headed to the Serbian province to prepare for the
mission of 2,000 international monitors, as allowed by Belgrade in
an agreement signed Friday.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corporation radio Saturday.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend a four-day grace period that
would have expired Saturday morning, giving Milosevic until Oct. 27
to comply fully. About 400 NATO warplanes are being kept ready for
possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces, who consider Kosovo their
historic heartland, and ethnic Albanians seeking to secede from
Serbia. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been displaced from their homes there.
	   At least 144 army tanks, artillery trucks and other vehicles
were seen driving in the direction of the provincial border with
Serbia Friday night. Serbia is the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb forces and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement called for Belgrade's forces in Kosovo to be
reduced to levels they were at before the crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels began Feb. 28.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not yet enough to head off the possibility of
airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   NATO U-2 surveillance planes were to begin flying over Kosovo on
Saturday under an agreement signed with Yugoslavia, a U.S. official
said in Washington on condition of anonymity. There was no
immediate confirmation that flights had begun.
	   An advance team for the OSCE, Europe's main problem-solving
alliance, arrived in Belgrade to begin planning for the arrival of
the 2,000 monitors. The 13 staffers were to be joined by about
seven others by the time they arrive in Pristina on Sunday.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' said delegation
member John Sandrock.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in Vienna that the group
hopes to have a large number of monitors in place in Kosovo within
two weeks.

Two Hungarian drivers burn to death in Czech crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two Hungarian drivers burned to
death Saturday after their trucks collided on the country's main
motorway connecting Prague with the city of Brno.
	   The trucks, transporting sunflower seeds, crashed into each
other in the early morning and immediately caught fire, the CTK
news agency reported. Traffic had to be diverted, as the trucks
completely blocked the crucial thoroughfare.
	   Serious accidents are frequent on the D1 motorway.

Japan's foreign minister talks with Russia on World War II treaty

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura focused
Saturday on a World War II peace treaty with Russia, a document the
two countries never signed because of a territorial dispute.
	   Komura met in Moscow with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and later Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril
Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast. President Boris Yeltsin has promised a
treaty will be signed by 2000.
	   At the start of his meeting with Komura, Primakov said Russia
``will stand firm by the positions laid out by Yeltsin and
ex-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Diplomatic efforts in preparation for Komura's visit ``will
allow us to come closer to a peace treaty,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov said he was grateful to Japan for its support of
Russia's economic reforms, and accepted an invitation to visit
Japan.
	   Komura's talks with Ivanov also touched on Kosovo, Afghanistan
and the Korean peninsula, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The two also agreed on a date for a summit between Yeltsin and
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, to be held Nov. 10-13. It
will be the first visit by a Japanese premier to the Russian
capital in 25 years, Interfax said.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in relations.
	   Moscow insists a decision on the Kurils must not threaten its
national interests. Japan has been cautious about investment and
economic cooperation with Russia _ key areas that Komura's talks
Saturday were expected to address _ because of lack of movement in
the dispute.
	   Still, in an interview published Friday, Komura said
Russian-Japanese relations have warmed because of summits between
Yeltsin and Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura arrived in Russia on Friday night, and leaves Saturday.
He was also scheduled to meet Saturday with First Deputy Premier
Yuri Maslyukov, in charge of economic ties with Japan, and Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a likely candidate in Russia's next
presidential elections.
	   Komura's spokesman, Masaki Okada, said Saturday he was surprised
that Russia's parliament had voted Thursday to reinstate a holiday
marking the defeat of Japan in World War II, Interfax said. The
holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse. The
measure requires Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   Also Saturday, Japan delivered more than dlrs 500,000 in medical
aid to Russia's Sakhalin island, and said it would supply small
generators, flashlights and candles for a town on one of the Kuril
Islands without electricity because of fires, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The government has named a commission to
investigate the circumstances of an airplane crash last month that
killed five people including a senior military officer, a
government statement said Saturday.
	   Since the Kenyan-registered twin-engine Islander crashed Sept.
25 in the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, just across the
border in Congo, there have been conflicting reports on its
destination, the number of passengers and how many died.
	   The statement said the wreckage of the aircraft was located in a
spot 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level.
	   Five people were killed, and five others were injured, the
statement said. Among those who died was Col. Jet Mwebaze, a senior
army officer and brother of acting military Chief of Staff James
Kazini.
	   Originally, army officials had said the plane was headed for the
western Uganda town of Kasese. But a later statement acknowledged
that the plane was going to Bunia in northeastern Congo.
	   Initial reports that all 10 on board had survived were
superceded by an acknowledgement that five, including the pilot,
had died.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper reported last week
that the passengers on board were on a gold-buying mission to Bunia
and were carrying dlrs 1.2 million in cash.
	   No trace of the money was found at the crash site, the newspaper
cited a security source as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the family of pilot Enos Luwuzu, who was buried a
week ago, has claimed two bullets entered his body at the base of
the neck and exited through his mouth.
	   Luwuzu's brother, Kampala attorney Enoth Mugabi, was quoted in
New Vision as saying he suspected there may have been a scuffle
before the plane crashed, and his brother was shot in the back of
the neck.
	   The newspaper said unconfirmed reports suggested the pilot had
protested flying the plane to Bunia instead of Kasese, but that the
others on board had insisted.
	   There have also been reports that survivors, who spent nearly a
week wandering in the densely forested mountains before being
rescued, said Mwebaze had been injured by the crash but had
survived. He was dead when rescue workers reached him.
	   The New Vision said some reports indicated the scuffle that
began on the plane continued after the crash and that is why
survivors dispersed in different directions.
	   Official statements insisted that a German named Andrew Gore
died and another was among the survivors. But the German Embassy in
Kampala dismissed the allegations.

High-level Turkish team in Baghdad to boost bilateral trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A top Turkish official met with Iraq's oil
minister Saturday at the start of a series of talks aimed at
boosting bilateral trade despite tensions over Kurdish rebels and
the sharing of river waters.
	   Mehmet Batalli, a state minister with special responsibility for
Iraqi affairs, met with Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid,
the official Iraqi News Agency said. It gave no details.
	   ``Turkey will take all the measures and facilities needed to
develop bilateral ties,'' INA quoted Batalli as saying.
	   ``The visit reflects a desire by Turkey to boost volume of
economic and commercial exchanges to highest levels possible,''
said Batalli, the state minister for atomic energy and state
statistics.
	   His visit follows Iraq's recent warning that Turkey will lose
business deals under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal if it
carries out military threats against Syria. Turkey accuses Syria of
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies it.
	   Turkey has sold Iraq goods worth dlrs 230 million since the oil
program began in December 1996.
	   The issue of Kurdish rebels also has chilled Turkey's relations
with Iraq: Turkish troops frequently cross over into northern Iraq
in pursuit of the rebels who use the area as a base to attack
targets in southern Turkey.
	   Iraq also criticizes Turkey for hosting U.S. and British
warplanes that enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to guard it
from attacks by the Iraqi army.
	   Besides, the two countries also disagree on sharing the waters
of Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
	   Reflecting the sour relations, state-run newspapers ignored
Batalli's arrival Friday and Iraqi authorities did not invite
Western news organizations to cover the visit.
	   Turkey apparently hopes that Batalli's presence in Baghdad could
help smoothen relations.
	   He is accompanied by a large trade delegation, including
officials from the state pipeline company, Botas, state refinery
TUPRAS and state oil exploration company TPAO.
	   Batalli is scheduled to meet with Iraqi ministers of trade,
transportation, communication and health during the visit, which
INA said will last several days.
	   Turkey says it has lost billions of dollars as a result of the
trade sanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq for invading
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The state-run weekly, al-Maw'id, said the two sides will discuss
opening of a new border post to accommodate an increase in
bilateral trade.

Three Ukrainian workers suspected of illegal weapons production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police detained three aviation plant
workers on suspicion of illegally producing and selling firearms
and other weapons, officials said Saturday.
	   The three allegedly made shotguns, silencers, knives and
ammunition while working at the Kharkiv Aviation Plant.
	   A search of their houses yielded a ``whole arsenal'' of such
weapons, an official with the regional prosecutor's office in the
northeastern industrial city, Andriy Lomakyn, told the Interfax
news agency.
	   Lomakyn gave no further details, but noted that investigators
hoped to uncover other members of the alleged gang to which the
three belonged, as well as their clients.

Indian film star granted bail in poaching case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A popular film star who was arrested
last week for on suspicion of hunting rare antelopes in a wildlife
reserve in western India was released on bail Saturday, domestic
news agencies reported.
	   Salman Khan was ordered to pay a bail bond of rupees 100,000
(dlrs 2,500), surrender his passport and not leave the country
without permission from authorities, the Press Trust of India
reported.
	   Khan will be tried for poaching and for using guns in a wildlife
sanctuary, offenses that carry a maximum sentence of seven years.
	   Khan, along with another actor and three actresses, is accused
of killing eight antelopes in two separate safaris _ between Sept.
26-28 and on Oct. 10. The court found that Khan had pulled the
trigger on both occasions.
	   More than 100 people gave evidence against the film stars,
officials said.
	   The hunt apparently took place during a break in shooting a film
in the desert city of Jodhpur.

Davenport books place in final with win over Spirlea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with later semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No.1 Lindsay Davenport left
herself just one final hurdle to overcome in the defense of her
title, after brushing aside Romania's Irina Spirlea in the
semifinals of the dlrs 1 million European Championships on
Saturday.
	   Winner of five titles this season including the U.S. Open,
Davenport's journey to the final was quick and untroubled, cruising
through to the final without dropping a set.
	   Hardly raising a sweat, the 22-year-old American quickly
disposed of Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 in 58 minutes, to extend her winning
streak to 16 consecutive victories in Switzerland.
	   ``I played one of my best matches of the week,'' said Davenport,
who on Monday took over as the world's No.1, bringing to an end
Martina Hingis's 80 week stay atop the rankings. ``It's been very
exciting to be No.1 and it has really pushed me to play well and
defend my title.''
	   Relatively unchallenged, Davenport began her onslaught early,
breaking Spirlea's second serve to go 3-1, then again at 5-2 to win
the first set.
	   In the second, Sprilea managed to break the American's opening
serve to go 1-0, but a dominant Davenport quickly recuperated her
serve, breaking back to even the games.
	   The American then broke a second time for a 3-1 lead, which
Spirlea was unable to make up.
	   Davenport will either play compatriot Venus Williams,
seeded-second, in an all-American, power-hitting final, or
fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of France, the losing finalist last
year.
	   Regardless of Sunday's outcome, Davenport will hang on to her
No.1 ranking next week, with Hingis out due to a strained ankle
this week and unable to collect points.
	   Davenport holds a 396 point lead over Hingis, and plans to play
in Moscow, Philadelphia and New York in order to collect enough
points to remain the world's top player at the end of the season.
	   ``At first I was just happy to become world No.1 for the first
time of my career and that was enough,'' said Davenport, who lost
in the final of Filderstadt last week to France's Sandrine Testud.
``But now my goal is to finish the year as one.
	   ``And I think that is definitely attainable. It certainly would
be amazing.''

Russia disinfects first piece of international space station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 3rd graf that third module to go up next July,

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian specialists started disinfecting the first
component of the international space station on Saturday, a power
and propulsion module scheduled for launch next month, a news
report said.
	   The 20-ton Zarya module, built by Russia's Khrunichev company
under contract with the U.S.-based Boeing, must be sterilized
before it goes up Nov. 20. The disinfection is expected to last
until Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Khrunichev
specialists as saying.
	   NASA will follow in December with the launch of the second part,
an American-built passageway. The third part _ Russia's still
unfinished service module _ is to be launched from Kazakstan in
July 1999.
	   The station's first crew cannot go up until after that, more
than a year later than originally planned. The 16 countries
involved in the station have had to delay construction for two
years in a row because of Russia's inability to pay its share.

Official: Ukraine not to raise gas transport tariffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has no plans to raise its tariffs
for the transport of Russian natural gas but will seek a lower
price for the fuel, a government official said Saturday.
	   Ukraine would be ``working with Moscow in order to lower gas
prices,'' First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko said.
	   Under the 1998 gas deal, Ukraine lowered its price for
transporting 1,000 cubic meters (35,000 cubic feet) of Russian gas
from dlrs 1.75 to dlrs 1.09 per 100 kilometers (60 miles).
	   Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom, in turn, set the price
for its gas reaching Ukraine's borders at dlrs 50 per 1,000 cubic
meters, thus allowing Ukraine to lower gas prices for the
population, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   It said Russia transported 108 billion cubic meters (3.78
trillion cubic feet) of gas through Ukraine in 1997, and the figure
was expected to reach 110-114 billion cubic meters (3.85-4 billion
cubic feet) in 1998.
	   Holubchenko said Ukraine has agreed with Russia to buy 4 billion
cubic meters (140 billion cubic feet) of gas to provide for
industrial needs over the last quarter of the year, but still has
not decided ``whether to take it or not.''
	   First, it is necessary to conclude agreements with Ukrainian
consumers who would actually pay for the gas, Holubchenko said,
according to Interfax.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, and it
imports about 70 percent of its supply from Russia.
	   The cash-strapped government reportedly is interested in paying
for some of the gas in commodities, including grain, which might
also cover some of its mounting gas debt to Russia _ a source of
tension between the two countries.
	   Holubchenko said recently that Ukraine's gas debt to Moscow now
stands at dlrs 740 million, down from dlrs 1.2 billion at the
beginning of 1998.
	   On Saturday, Holubchenko also dismissed reports that Ukraine's
50 million population might face gas shortages this winter, saying
Cabinet would issue an order forbidding suppliers to cut gas to
distributors catering to public needs.

Ex-Communist starts talks on forming Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Communists saying they can support
D'Alema, who indicates his talks going well; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who now leads
Italy's largest leftist party, said Saturday his first talks with
potential allies indicated he might succeed in forming a new
government.
	   Italy's political situation these days is so volatile that
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Friday stopped short of formally
asking D'Alema to try to form of government. Instead, the head of
state said he was giving D'Alema the ``pre-task'' of testing the
waters to see if there was enough consensus to actually try to put
together a coalition.
	   D'Alema consulted on Saturday with leaders of parties which
could join forces in a new center-left coalition, including his own
Democratic Left party, a group of breakway Communists and a third
potential ally, a movement of ex-Christian Democrats led by former
President Francesco Cossiga.
	   D'Alema's party was the major partner in Romano Prodi's 2 1-2
year-old coalition which collapsed Oct. 9 after losing a confidence
vote in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   Prodi, now serving as caretaker premier, failed to forge a
consensus on a fresh start for his center-left coalition.
	   D'Alema, who was scheduled to report back to Scalfaro on Monday
evening, indicated his first round of talks were positive.
	   ``I see that there are the conditions to go ahead'' with talks,
D'Alema said, while calling the situation ``complex'' because the
parties ``have had difference experiences and will keep different
visions on the evolution of the Italian political and democratic
system.''
	   But, D'Alema, a pragmatist who, earlier this decade, helped
transform the West's largest Communist party into the current, more
moderate Democratic Left, said despite the differences, there was
space to work on achieving ``a sufficiently solid political and
policy base.''
	   Said Armando Cossutta, who leads a breakaway faction of
Communists: ``We have expressed to our comrade Massimo D'Alema our
willingness and our commitment toward ... the success of his
government.''
	   Cossutta broke away from the No. 1 Communist leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, whose refused to back Prodi in the confidence vote
because he wanted more funds for job creation.
	   Cossiga's supporters originally were loyal to opposition leader
Silvio Berlusconi, media mogul and ex-premier, but Cossiga has
indicated he might throw support to a center-left government.
	   Berlusconi has been calling for early elections, but that
prospect is considered unlikely. Elections are not held during the
last six months of the head of state's term, and that period for
Scalfaro begins in January.

Davenport books place in final with win over Spirlea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with later semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport left herself just
one final hurdle to overcome in the defense of her title, after
brushing aside Romania's Irina Spirlea in the semifinals of the
dlrs 1 million European Championships on Saturday.
	   Winner of five titles this season including the U.S. Open,
Davenport's journey to the final was quick and untroubled, cruising
through to the final without dropping a set.
	   Hardly raising a sweat, the 22-year-old American quickly
disposed of Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 in 58 minutes, to extend her winning
streak to 16 consecutive victories in Switzerland.
	   ``I played one of my best matches of the week,'' said Davenport,
who on Monday took over as the world's No.1, bringing to an end
Martina Hingis' 80-week stay atop the rankings. ``It's been very
exciting to be No.1 and it has really pushed me to play well and
defend my title.''
	   Relatively unchallenged, Davenport began her onslaught early,
breaking Spirlea's second serve to go 3-1, then again at 5-2 to win
the first set.
	   In the second, Sprilea managed to break the American's opening
serve to go 1-0, but a dominant Davenport quickly recuperated her
serve, breaking back to even the games.
	   The American then broke a second time for a 3-1 lead, which
Spirlea was unable to make up.
	   Davenport will either play compatriot Venus Williams, seeded No.
2, in an all-American, power-hitting final, or fourth-seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France, the losing finalist last year.
	   Regardless of Sunday's outcome, Davenport will hang on to her
No.1 ranking next week, with Hingis out because of a strained ankle
this week.
	   Davenport holds a 396 point lead over Hingis, and plans to play
in Moscow, Philadelphia and New York in order to collect enough
points to remain the world's top player at the end of the season.
	   ``At first I was just happy to become world No.1 for the first
time of my career and that was enough,'' said Davenport, who lost
in the final of Filderstadt last week to France's Sandrine Testud.
``But now my goal is to finish the year as one.
	   ``And I think that is definitely attainable. It certainly would
be amazing.''

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction, fresh details; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British police said Saturday they have arrested
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of
murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
	   Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was held Friday night after
British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens
in Chile, the spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
	   The spokeswoman refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but
Pinochet's press secretary in Santiago said he being held in the
London clinic where he underwent surgery for a herniated disc on
Oct. 9. No hearing date has been set.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, attending the Ibero
American summit in Porto, Portugal, said his government ``respects
the decisions taken by courts.''
	   But Chilean Ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, said he will
seek the release of Pinochet _ ``what we must do is make it clear
that Mr. Pinochet is a senator, who travels with a diplomatic
passport,'' Artaza said. The government has previously said that
Chile does not recognize the authority of foreign courts over
situations which occurred in Chile.
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, was reported to have left
London Bridge Hospital on Wednesday. But his press secretary
Fernando Martinez said he was at the clinic Friday night when
police came for him.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday. Another judge, Manuel
Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question Pinochet a day
earlier.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns
	   The judges' petitions are based on the European Convention on
Terrorism which requires signatories to cooperate with each others'
judicial processes in cases of terrorism, according to Juan Garces,
a lawyer involved in the Spanish investigation into human rights
violations in Chile.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Three additional suspects in a
sexual assault on a trio of Swiss women have been identified but
not yet found, police said Saturday.
	   Two women were raped when they were kidnapped Wednesday on their
way out of an animal reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A third
woman escaped being raped by saying she was ill.
	   Police arrested two suspects on Friday. Police spokesman Capt.
Charl Scheepers said Saturday that the police have since identified
three additional suspects.
	   The three women _ two age 31, the other 37 _ arrived in South
Africa earlier this week for a holiday and to visit friends in
KwaZulu-Natal.
	   The attack would cause irreparable damage to South Africa's
budding tourism industry, said Peter Mokaba, Deputy Minister of
Tourism.
	   ``The people that will be most affected economically from the
(attack) will be those living in the area, who sell arts and crafts
and fruit along the roadside,'' said Sakkie Hattingh, executive
director of KwaZulu-Natal's tourism promoters, Timeless Afrika.

Hundreds of Palestinians rally for prisoner releases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 400 Palestinians, some waving
large pictures of jailed family members, rallied Saturday for the
release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   A small group of demonstrators broke away and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, and the troops responded with a few rounds of tear gas
and rubber bullets. However, no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police dispersed the protesters.
	   It was the second day of unrest in or near Ramallah. On Friday,
Jewish settlers had blocked the West Bank's main north-south
highway outside the town, complaining two of their security
officers were detained and roughed up by Palestinian police.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held Thursday, but denied any ill treatment.
	   The prisoner-release rally coincided with a U.S. peace summit at
the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, at which Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank and Palestinian
security measures.
	   One issue on the table is the release of 3,000 Palestinians held
by Israel for security offenses. The Palestinian official who has
been trying to negotiate prisoner releases accompanied Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to the U.S. talks.
	   In other developments Saturday:
	   _Palestinians living near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, near
the northern West Bank city of Nablus, said about five settlers
rampaged through their olive groves, beating villagers. One
Palestinian was hit in the head with a farm tool and was taken to
the hospital for stitches, then released.
	   Itzhar settlers have a long history of clashes with Palestinians
living in surrounding villages. Three months ago, a pair of
settlers were shot dead in an ambush as they patrolled the
settlement's perimeter.
	   _About 250 demonstrators marched in Gaza City to demand the
release of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails. They
presented a letter at the United Nations office asking the U.N.
secretary-general to look into the question of detainees.

Presidential meeting to cap Taiwan negotiator's visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs of Koo comment
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Ahead of talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Taiwan's top negotiator expressed optimism Saturday that
trust can be built up between the two rival governments.
	   Koo Chen-fu's meeting Sunday with Jiang was to cap a visit that
has helped thaw contacts after a three-year hiatus and secured
agreement to explore resumed negotiations.
	   Speaking at a reception Saturday evening, Koo said that through
his visit, China and Taiwan ``can promote and build important
foundations of mutual trust that the two sides were lacking.''
	   Taiwan and China have a rivalry that dates back five decades to
the Chinese civil war, and as recently as 1996 China was seeking to
intimidate the island by testing missiles off its waters.
	   The atmosphere at Sunday's meeting in the luxurious confines of
Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house should be brightened by the
agreement Koo secured earlier this week for China and Taiwan to
work toward resuming formal negotiations.
	   Beijing suspended those talks in 1995, in anger over a trip by
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to the United States. China viewed
the visit as an affront to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan
and as a sign that Lee was leading the island toward independence.
Beijing responded by test-firing missiles and holding war games
near Taiwan, and by suspending negotiations.
	   As China's top leader, Jiang oversaw that crisis, which pushed
the two sides closer to war than they had been in decades. By
agreeing to meet Koo during this visit, Jiang appeared to be
signaling a desire for some degree of rapprochement.
	   Jiang is under pressure from the powerful Chinese military and
communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to reunification with
the Chinese mainland. The island has been separated politically
from the mainland since Taiwan's Nationalist government fled there
after losing the Chinese civil war to China's Communists in 1949.
	   Koo went sightseeing Saturday, visiting a memorial to Chinese
nationalist Sun Yat-sen, the prestigious Beijing University, and
the Forbidden City, the former residence of China's emperors.
	   On Sunday, before his sit-down with Jiang, Koo was also due to
meet Vice Premier Qian Qichen, a former foreign minister.
	   In a sign of the lingering distrust between Taiwan and China,
Taiwan's vice foreign minister, David Lee, claimed Saturday that
Qian had recently ordered Chinese diplomats to step up efforts to
isolate Taiwan diplomatically.
	   Lee quoted Qian as having called for a ``face-to-face struggle''
with Taiwan to lure away its dwindling number of diplomatic
partners. Just 27 countries now recognize Taiwan, with most having
switched recognition to Beijing.
	   Lee called on China to clarify Qian's remarks. ``We hope the
mainland authorities will respond to our goodwill and sincerity
with the same goodwill and sincerity,'' he said at a news
conference.

Maradona says private drug testing would keep him clean on field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Diego Maradona used to undergo private drug
tests ahead of soccer matches to be sure he would not turn in
positive results if tested by the Italian League, the former Napoli
star said in an interview published Saturday.
	   Maradona was banned in 1991 for 15 months after testing positive
for cocaine while playing for Napoli. But the Italian news agency
ANSA reported Friday that the backup urine sample that led to the
suspension was conducted on a faulty machine.
	   The report, based on sources at the scandal-ridden Acqua Acetosa
drug-testing laboratory in Rome, alleged that the apparatus
erroneously indicated there were traces of cocaine in a clean urine
control sample run through in a check in 1991.
	   Maradona's lawyers have said they may pursue legal action.
	   In the interview with Naples newspaper Il Mattino, the player
said ``I have never denied'' using cocaine, ``but when I went on
the field I was clean.''
	   ``I knew for certain that I could not be discovered positive,
because before every game I would take private tests,'' the
newspaper quoted him as saying. ``If these allowed me to play
without any worry, without compromising my career or harming the
club, then I would go on the field. If the opposite were true, then
I stayed at home.''
	   He said that is why ``I have always had suspicions about the
testing done in Rome.''

	   PARIS (AP) - Valentino's clothes swished around with new sparkle
and sporty verve in his Saturday show of spring ready-to-wear.
	   Versatility and ease from beach-to-evening are the bywords of
this big fashion week, and Valentino catches the spirit.
	   He likes the casual look of cardigan-sweater jackets, caftan
blouses - almost always decorated, of course. These link up with
cropped pants and lovely flat sandals.
	   There were no more uptight beaded, embroidered suits. Instead,
the lines were almost folkloric, not quite ethnic. And of course
they were up-to-date for your rich Barbados traveler or California
coast dweller.
	   In mostly blacks, whites, sandy shades with big dollops of
coral, the clothes would be good standby resort wear, skirts on the
long mid-calf side.
	   Try a lacy full gypsy blouse - a big item here, with its
low-slung seashell belt over fluid silk crepe pants.
	   Pretty lace ponchos came out over white or coral linen trousers,
full skirts in conical or round shapes would be great at any
barbecue or elegant soiree.
	   And the master of luxury could not resist orange pleated tulle
flounces on a skirt with its neat little sleeveless white top.
	   But with the many organza blouses, the breezy tiered skirts, the
collection did have a terrific contemporary offhand look that's
welcome today.
	   Right up to date, too, and with a much younger light touch, the
Herve Leger collection hit some fine high notes. The silhouettes
were fairly narrow, but easy, and the rainbow-painted skirts or
bustier tops were great fun for color.
	   Changing from his bandage-like wrapped earlier styles, Leger
went into bright printed wrap skirts or pinstriped versions that
look anything from stodgy. The young bustier dresses, pretty colors
in ikat weaves and and details give this collection a good deal of
youthful clout.
	   Great cut-out looks with flesh or flesh colored linen underneath
are super for dresses, and sexy bathing suits as well - a big line
here in cut out lycras.
	   Ribbon embroidery, twisted-rope fabrics and hand-painted silks
make for evening dresses with a touch of haute couture, while white
linen trouser suits are a fine sporty option in a collection full
of young ideas.
	   Meanwhile, Jean-Paul Gaultier took a long, cool look at Japan
and did clothes from the geisha's tea ceremony, Japanese prints or
the Ginza - his own way. Fortunately, he left out the Sumo
wrestlers in this picturesque costume show.
	   Lots of drawstring blousons thrown casually around shoulders
topped lean skirts or pants, the inevitable platform shoes some
with white socks like Japanese schoolgirls wear.
	   Tank tops or ``Marcel'' t-shirts layered over with fishnet were
another look borrowed from Japanese fishermen. Kimono sleeves all
over the place, draped shoulders and even a corselet effect, more
Gaultier than Japanese style, paraded out in a show that sometimes
looked like a parody on 19th century prints by Hokusai.
	   Trompe l'oeil dresses printed to look like statues draped front
and back were another clever Gaultier trick.
	   Light voile coverups, a couple of obi sashes made into a
swimsuit, geisha-style girls in their printed robes added to the
many Japanese-inspired ideas for couture, probably destined for
copying - since Gaultier is always a design leader.
	   The finale was a flourish on her violin by famous Japanese
violinist Vanessa Mae, very pretty in her silk dress and big obi
bow.

Rebels kill three in ambush on relief convoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Attackers believed to be Ugandan rebels
killed three relief workers and injured two others when they
ambushed a convoy in northeastern Uganda, Norwegian People's Aid
said in a statement Saturday.
	   The agency said the two vehicles _ a truck and a Toyota Land
Cruiser _ were returning from delivering relief supplies to the
southern Sudanese town of Bamuruye when they came under heavy fire.
	   The agency did not say when the attack occurred 2 kilometers (.6
miles) west of the town of Yumbe on the Ugandan side of the border.
	   The truck driver, his assistant and the convoy leader were
killed while two others were injured, the statement said. It did
not give their names or nationalities.
	   Norwegian People's Aid said the attackers were believed to be
members of the West Nile Bank Front, a rebel group that has
recently resumed operating in the area which borders both southern
Sudan and northeastern Congo.
	   The group, which NPA said is backed by the Sudanese government,
had been operating in south Sudan until Sudanese rebels captured
their bases in March 1997, forcing them to move into northeastern
Congo.
	   The relief agency, which supports the Sudan People's Liberation
Army rebels fighting for control of southern Sudan, said the route
was crucial for supplies heading to the southern Sudanese counties
of Kajo, Keji and Yei.
	   NPA said the Ugandan border town of Koboko, 20 kilometers (12
miles) west of the ambush site, is a major logistical center for
relief operations assisting 100,000 displaced Sudanese across the
border.
	   The statement said the attackers burned the two NPA vehicles and
made off with their cargo.

McEnroe vs. Leconte in seniors final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ John McEnroe can't play as well as he
used to, but his ability to offend with foul language remains as
unbeatable as ever.
	   McEnroe turned the hit and giggle Champions seniors tennis
tournament, for superannuated and mostly good-humored players still
scratching for a paycheck, into yet another distasteful outing
Saturday.
	   McEnroe littered his straight sets semi-final win over Sweden's
Mikael Pernfors with swear words aimed at his bemused opponent,
spectators and umpire Wayne McKewen. The rants were also picked up
by television microphones near the court.
	   ``By nature fun and competition don't go hand in hand,'' said
McEnroe, who won 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.
	   Frenchman Henri Leconte prevented a final match-up between
McEnroe and his former great rival Bjorn Borg by beating the Swede
6-4, 6-4 in their semi-final.
	   Leconte broke the 42-year-old Borg's opening service game and
took control with a 4-1 early lead.
	   Although Borg got a break back he was unable to force his way
back into the set, or the match.
	   ``I'm better now than when I was playing on the ATP tour,''
Leconte joked. ``The way I played today _ I haven't played like
that in a long time.''
	   Borg said, ``The Frenchman is hot. When he plays this way he is
very difficult to beat.''

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Looking to solidify his No. 1 world
ranking, Pete Sampras downed fellow American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6
(7-4) Saturday to advance to the final of the dlrs 800,000 CA
Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   On Sunday, he'll play the winner of the other semifinal match
between Karol Kucera of Slovakia and Britain's Greg Rusedski.
	   Sampras needed an hour, 21 minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked
Martin.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game, when he hit
a crosscourt backhand return past the onrushing Martin for a break
that put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tie-break en
route to the victory.
	   Sampras, involved in a close race with Patrick Rafter and
Marcelo Rios for the top ranking as the season enters its final
weeks, entered the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the
last moment as a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals
by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runnerup to Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Kucera, ranked seventh in the world, was trying to remain on
track Saturday to nail down a spot in the eight-man Hanover finale.

Israeli Arab pledge support for any Arafat-Netanyahu accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab legislators in Israel's Parliament will
support any agreement that emerges from ongoing talks between
Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu, a leading Israeli Arab
politician said Saturday.
	   But Abdel-Wahab Daraoushe of the Arab Democratic Party indicated
that the support may not amount to much, saying it is doubtful
Prime Minister Netanyahu will implement a future agreement.
	   ``We have faith in the Palestinian Authority and will support
their decisions'' in Israel's Parliament, Knesset, Daraoushe said.
	   ``But I do not have faith in Netanyahu and (Foreign Minister
Ariel) Sharon's readiness to implement any agreement signed with
the Arabs,'' he added.
	   Daraoushe was speaking to reporters after he and other Arab
lawmakers from Israel met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
discuss the role of Israeli Arabs in expediting the peace process.
	   Arafat and Netanyahu are holding intense discussions in a
secluded retreat in Maryland in the hopes of reaching a West Bank
accord that will include a crucial anti-terrorist agreement.
	   Daraoushe criticized the expected agreement, saying it ``is less
than what the Palestinians ask for.''
	   ``But given the current situation ... there are no options
before Arafat but to sign this agreement,'' Daraoushe said.
	   Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa have also expressed
concern that Arafat has been pressured into making too many
concessions in the U.S.-brokered negotiations.
	   Daraoushe said his talks with Mubarak and Moussa focused on
bolstering the Israeli-Arab role in the Knesset and ``influencing
the Israeli government to implement the agreements'' with the
Palestinians.
	   There are about 1 million Arabs in Israel, making up about 18
percent of the country's population. The 120-member Knesset has 11
Arabs _ eight Muslims, two Christians and one Druse _ representing
Arab and other opposition parties.

Ukrainian tax authorities warn company linked to corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An energy company linked to a massive
corruption probe should be forced to choose between using the money
it's stashed abroad to pay tax debts or be bankrupted, a top tax
official said, according to a news report Saturday.
	   The Unified Energy System company does not have enough money in
its accounts in Ukraine to pay the debts after losing a court case
to tax authorities, the Interfax news agency quoted Vadym Kopylov,
the deputy chief of the State Tax Service, as saying.
	   Tax officials recently fined the private gas and energy trader
1.4 billion hryvna (currently dlrs 409 million) for evading tax
payments and illegally transferring abroad dlrs 690 million
received from gas sales.
	   UES lost an appeal Thursday in the Supreme Arbitration Court.
	   Tax officials have told Ukrainian media that in 1997, UES paid a
meager 11.1 million hryvna (dlrs 5.5 million at the time) in taxes,
while its net profits amounted to 148 million hryvna (dlrs 74
million) and total turnover stood at 4.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 2
billion).
	   The company is linked to a corruption investigation against
former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, who now leads the centrist
opposition Hromada movement in parliament.
	   Lazarenko's critics accuse him of abusing his authority for
personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97, in particular of
reaping huge profits from gas imports to Ukraine by giving UES
preferential status in the national gas market during his term in
office.
	   Last month, authorities charged a prominent Hromada activist and
a former senior government official, Mykola Syvulskiy, with abusing
his position and embezzlement connected with gas imports. These
charges carry a prison term of up to five years.
	   Syvulskiy is suspected of transferring more than dlrs 5 million
from the accounts of state gas company Ukrgazprom to UES.
	   Hromada leaders have protested against the investigation, saying
the case was politically motivated and organized by President
Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters.
	   But Ukraine's prosecutor general Mykhailo Potebenko has
dismissed any suggestions of politics in the case and vowed to
complete his investigation.
	   Last week, he said investigators may complete the probe against
Lazarenko within three months and ask parliament to revoke his
immunity from prosecution if some necessary information arrives
from abroad.

Police detain hundreds of pro-Kurdish party members in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Saturday detained hundreds of
members of a pro-Kurdish party who were urging the government to
join a Kurdish rebel cease-fire, a party official said.
	   The government rejected the truce declared by the Kurdish rebels
on Sept. 1 and called on the guerrillas to surrender. The
insurgents have been fighting for autonomy in the southeast since
1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   ``The first step toward an end in this war is to silence the
guns,'' Hamit Geylani, general-secretary of the pro-Kurdish
People's Democracy Party, HADEP, told The Associated Press. ``Our
members were to call on the government to take a positive step.''
	   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said the riot police
stopped 10 passenger buses carrying HADEP members to downtown
Taksim square and detained them before they could stage a rally.
	   Geylani said some 1,000 party members were detained by the
police and that some 20 of them were injured by wielding police
truncheons. Private NTV television put the number of detentions at
500 people.
	   The Anatolia news agency confirmed that a fist-fight broke out
between the police officers and the protesters but did not give any
injury figure.
	   Also on Saturday, police detained 39 people protesting the
disappearance of loved ones believed to be in police custody in
Istanbul and in Aegean port city of Izmir.
	   Turkey's independent Human Rights Association claims more than
800 people have disappeared, most after detention by security
forces.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Oil Minister Sheik Saud al-Sabah has aborted a
plan to privatize Kuwait's state-owned gasoline stations, an
economic report said Saturday.
	   Sheik Saud believes the plan, which was devised before he took
office in March, was based on ``profiteering,'' Al-Shall Economic
Consultants quoted the minister as saying. The report is prepared
by Jassem al-Saadoun, one of Kuwait's most respected economists.
	   The scheme involved the setting up of a 16 million dinar (dlrs
52.28 million) company that would own and run 30 of the country's
80 gasoline stations.
	   Some 75 percent of the firm's shares were to be offered to the
public, while the government's Kuwait National Petroleum Co. would
have held the rest. The company would have consequently been
allowed to take control of the rest of the stations.
	   The report quoted Sheik Saud as saying in a seminar that the
company was being given a constant margin of profit for every
portion of the gasoline sold, a clause that he said ran contrary to
privatization ethics.
	   Al-Shall did not say if Sheik Saud had any alternative plans.
	   The government, whose revenues have been hit hard by falling oil
prices, has launched a privatization drive aimed at revitalizing
the economy.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese companies will take part in the
Baghdad International Trade Fair next week with more than dlrs
three million worth of goods, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Daily Star said more than 120 businessmen from 63 industrial
and agricultural companies were expected to participate in the
six-day fair starting Oct. 25.
	   Among the goods to be exhibited are canned food, fruit,
vegetables, furniture, sanitary equipment, ceramics, house
appliances and beverages.
	   It is the first time that Lebanon will take part in the Baghdad
fair since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the English-language daily
said.
	   Lebanon broke off diplomatic ties with Iraq in 1994 over the
murder of an Iraqi dissident in Beirut but relations have warmed in
recent months with officials and trade delegations exchanging
visits.
	   Under an agreement signed earlier this year, Iraq will import
goods worth dlrs 50 million from Lebanon under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program that allows Baghdad to sell limited quantities
of oil to buy food and medicine for its people.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Iraq have agreed to upgrade
economic relations and trade ties, an official said Saturday.
	   A five-member top level Iraqi business delegation, which arrived
here Friday, conducted talks with Jordanian businessmen to
coordinate trade and industrial cooperation, Ali Dajani of the
Jordan Chamber of Industry told The Associated Press.
	   He said the Iraqi delegation is headed by Hatem Abdul Rashid,
chairman of the Iraqi Industries' Union.
	   Dajani said the Iraqi delegation told the Jordanians about the
new Iraqi promotion investment law, which allows all Arab
businessmen to invest in industrial and economic projects in Iraq.
	   Jordan's trade with Iraq this year amounted to dlrs 250 million
under the U.N.'s oil for food program.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No.1 Lindsay Davenport and
Venus Williams each won their semifinals Saturday, setting up an
all-American, power-hitting final at the dlrs 1 million European
Championships.
	   Davenport left herself just one final hurdle to overcome in the
defense of her title, after brushing aside Romania's Irina Spirlea
6-2, 6-3 in her semifinal.

Swazi protestors say vote extension invites violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Pro-democracy protestors on Saturday
charged that police beat five youths during elections in one of the
world's last absolute monarchies and accused the government of
inviting violence by manipulating the vote.
	   After heavy rains kept many voters from the polls on Friday,
election officials added another day for voting _ Oct. 24 _ because
of the flooding.
	   ``The longer this takes the more anger grows,'' said Mario
Masuku, president of the People's United Democratic Movement
(PUDEMO).
	   The youths believed to have been beaten for their protests on
election day were receiving medical treatment, according to a
spokesman for the Human Rights Association of Swaziland, a
non-governmental organization in Mbabane. PUDEMO said it reported
the beating to Amnesty International in London.
	   Police in Swaziland, a country of 1 million people sandwiched
between South Africa and Mozambique, also used tear gas to break up
a demonstration by about 100 protesters calling for greater
democracy. No arrests were reported.
	   Candidates were nominated individually because parties have been
banned by royal decree since 1973. Swaziland's legislature serves
little purpose other than as a rubber stamp for the Cabinet,
appointed by King Mswati III, who was out of the country on a visit
to Asia to seek foreign investment.
	   Since 1990, police have systematically suppressed PUDEMO.
	   The election is being watched closely in a part of Africa where
democracy received a major boost with South Africa's first free
elections in 1994.
	   Masuku said PUDEMO would continue to boycott and protest against
the second voting day.
	   He said the extension would give the government more time to
intimidate voters into going to the polls and increased the chances
of election fraud.
	   Turnout was low on Friday, due as much to heavy rain and
flooding as to calls for a boycott by pro-democracy groups.
	   Masuku claimed the turnout was only 13 percent.
	   Election officials declined to give figures. Turnout in the
country's first vote, in 1993, was 17 percent.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa's other monarchy, Lesotho, months of
opposition unrest over May elections led South Africa, which
surrounds the tiny state, to send in troops to restore order.

No autobahn speed limit, incoming German government says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agreement on no autobahn speed limit, other
environmental questions. trims &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's newly elected Social Democrats
and Greens shelved plans for speed limits on the autobahn while
continuing to haggle over energy taxes in coalition talks Saturday.
	   Greens had been seeking a 100 kph (60 mph) speed limit on
Germany's famously unrestricted superhighways, but the coalition
deal says only that municipalities will be granted more leeway to
reduce speeds on city streets.
	   Both sides, however, said the issue of autobahn speed limits was
not dead. ``I'm optimistic that we're going to have a European
solution,'' Greens leader Gunda Roestel said, referring to
proposals for eventual common traffic rules throughout the European
Union.
	   In a partial win for the ecology-minded Greens, the partners
also cast serious doubt on whether a proposed magnetic-levitation
train line between Hamburg and Berlin will ever be built.
	   While agreeing to honor contracts already signed, they said the
federal government would not pay for any cost overruns.
	   The train's backers admitted Thursday that the stretch would
probably cost up to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more than
the 6.1 billion marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned.
	   The Greens oppose the Transrapid project as wasteful and
potentially dangerous to the environment and animal life.
	   ``Transrapid is not over,'' said Franz Muentefering, a Social
Democrat proposed as the next transportation minister. ``But
financing for Hamburg-Berlin looks difficult.''
	   If the private partners don't cover the extra costs, then the
government will look for another, cheaper site to build the
high-tech train, he said.
	   Party leaders then went back into closed talks over energy taxes
_ the area that seems to be the most difficult for the likely
partners to reach agreement on.
	   Both parties in the center-left grouping want to use the
proceeds from higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels to
finance cuts in other levies aimed at bringing down non-wage labor
costs. That, they hope, will spur job creation _ top of their wish
list.
	   The Greens wanted a big jump in gas prices to discourage Germans
drivers from taking their cars out and polluting the air.
	   But Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, wary of hurting the auto
industry, has said he would not accept more than a 6 pfennig (4
cent) a liter increase, far less than the Greens were seeking.
	   Since that wouldn't raise nearly enough to make a significant
dent in the other taxes they want to cut, Greens leader Kerstin
Mueller said Friday it was up to the Social Democrats ``to come and
make new proposals.''
	   Higher taxes on heating oil, electricity and other energy
sources were still being considered.
	   Also on the table for Saturday were social welfare policies and
how to pay for them.
	   Schroeder promised before winning the Sept. 27 election, that he
would rescind planned cuts in social security that were passed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens also want to boost aid for the
elderly and long-time unemployed. But financing on that must also
be hammered out.

Hundreds of Palestinians rally for prisoner releases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 400 Palestinians, some waving
large pictures of jailed family members, rallied Saturday for the
release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   A small group of demonstrators broke away and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, and the troops responded with a few rounds of tear gas
and rubber bullets. However, no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police dispersed the protesters.
	   It was the second day of unrest in or near Ramallah. On Friday,
Jewish settlers had blocked the West Bank's main north-south
highway outside the town, complaining that two of their security
officers were detained and roughed up by Palestinian police.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held Thursday but denied any ill treatment.
	   The prisoner-release rally coincided with a U.S. peace summit at
the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, at which Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank and Palestinian
security measures. Israel annexed the West Bank after seizing it
from Jordan in 1967.
	   One issue on the table at Wye is the release of 3,000
Palestinians held by Israel for security offenses. The Palestinian
official who has been trying to negotiate prisoner releases
accompanied Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the U.S. talks.
	   In other developments Saturday:
	   _Palestinians living near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, near
the northern West Bank city of Nablus, said about five settlers
rampaged through their olive groves, beating villagers. One
Palestinian was hit in the head with a farm tool and was taken to
the hospital for stitches, then released.
	   Itzhar settlers have a long history of clashes with Palestinians
living in surrounding villages. Three months ago, a pair of
settlers were shot dead in an ambush as they patrolled the
settlement's perimeter.
	   _About 250 demonstrators marched in Gaza City to demand the
release of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails. They
presented a letter at the United Nations office asking the U.N.
secretary-general to look into the question of detainees.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defying a police order, the wife
of dismissed Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Saturday joined
thousands of protesters supporting the jailed dissident and
demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The appearance at the demonstration by Azizah Ismail and Anwar's
eldest daughter, Nurul Izzah, marks a new combativeness by the
family of the anti-government leader.
	   It was the first protest in which Azizah has participated and
follows a trip abroad this week by the 18-year-old Nurul to drum up
support for Anwar, who was arrested last month after leading
rallies against Mahathir's rule.
	   As Azizah drove to the crowded street, hundreds of people rushed
to her shouting ``Reforms! Reforms!'' and ``Mahathir Resign.'' She
shook hands with some from inside her car.
	   Later, police beat protesters with rattan canes to get them off
the streets and witnesses said dozens of demonstrators were
arrested.
	   Police fired a water cannon to disperse the crowd of nearly
10,000 protesters who had marched to the palace of Malaysia's
constitutional monarch, demanding that Anwar be reinstated as the
nation's deputy prime minister.
	   Officers also used batons to push away demonstrators who blocked
an 8-lane highway near the palace for nearly 30 minutes. No
injuries were reported, but witnesses saw police dragging several
people away for detention.
	   Earlier this week, Nurul quietly slipped out of Malaysia to meet
with Presidents B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Joseph Estrada of the
Philippines. Both expressed support for the 51-year-old dissident.
	   Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and the former deputy was
subsequently charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. The trial begins Nov. 2.
	   The prime minister has dismissed international concern over
Anwar's treatment and defended his sacking saying his former deputy
was too immoral for public office.
	   Anwar, 51, has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up
to eliminate the political challenge he had posed to Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   During Saturday's protest, demonstrators mingled with shoppers
crowding malls ahead of a Hindu festival.
	   Cars honked incessantly in solidarity as protesters held up
signs and shouted slogans against the government, in the latest of
the street demonstrations that have erupted regularly since Anwar's
arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Witnesses said they saw police making several arrests from among
the protesters who had been warned repeatedly in recent weeks that
such gatherings were illegal.
	   Many of the shoppers were out buying new clothes and gifts for
Monday's Deepavali festival during which Hindus light lamps in
their homes and distribute sweets. About 10 percent of Malaysia's
22 million people are Hindus of Indian ethnicity. The majority are
Malay Muslims.
	   On Saturday, Mahathir said during a visit to Tokyo that Anwar
was being treated well in jail and even had a mattress to sleep on.
	   Defiance of police threats of arrest and violence have become
common since Anwar's firing. Protests were rare in Malaysia where
even established political parties dared not hold a gathering
without police permission.
	   Late Friday night, police arrested three people for
demonstrating at a rally in the southern port town of Malacca
organized by an opposition coalition that has campaigned for the
release of Anwar, the national news agency Bernama said.
	   Meanwhile, a government minister blamed the foreign media
coverage of opposition street rallies in Malaysia for scaring away
tourists.
	   The hotel occupancy rate had dwindled to 54 percent from 67
percent in the same period last year, Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Friday.
	   ``CNN has been successful in portraying the so-called havoc in
Malaysia in a manner that will keep away tourists from coming
here,'' he told reporters.
	   The minister also criticized the CNBC news network for what he
called distorted news coverage. CNBC has denied previous
accusations of biased coverage by Malaysian officials.

Hoddle, England captain deny argument story
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle Saturday condemned as
``a vicious lie'' a newspaper report that team captain Alan Shearer
led a players mutiny against him after Wednesday's European
Championship game against Luxembourg.
	   According to the Sun tabloid, Shearer questioned Hoddle's own
performance as coach after the players had been asked why they had
played with so little passion in the 3-0 victory in Luxembourg.
	   ``Have you thought it could be you?'' Shearer is reported to
have told Hoddle.
	   Both Hoddle and Shearer reacted Saturday by saying there was no
such confrontation between the two although it was admitted there
was a heated debate among the players about the disappointing
performance.
	   ``The story is nonsense,'' Shearer said. ``There was a
discussion in the dressing room after the game but I'm not prepared
to say what was said.
	   ``I believe that dressing room conversations are and should
remain private. But I never used the words that appeared on the
front page of the newspaper today.''
	   Hoddle condemned the Sun story.
	   ``Today's story about what happened in the England dressing room
in Luxembourg is a vicious lie. I can only guess at why anybody
should write it,'' the England coach said.
	   ``We weren't particularly happy with our second-half performance
and the discussions you have, they go on time and time again.
	   ``In every dressing room this afternoon at quarter to five
there'll be heated moments, there'll be some good discussions,
there'll be some feedback from players, and that's exactly what it
was.''
	   ``There is no truth in the story whatsoever,'' Hoddle said.
	   ``If their aim is to undermine me, it has had the opposite
effect. What they clearly aren't trying to do is to help England
qualify for Euro 2000.
	   ``That's what I want. So does Alan Shearer. So do millions of
people around the country.''

Woods, O'Meara lead after first 18 holes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first 18 of 36 with full day of play doubtful
because of start delayed by rain &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Florida neighbors Mark O'Meara
and Tiger Woods were headed to the finals of the World Match Play
Championship when they each led after the first 18 of 36 holes in
Saturday's semifinals.
	   O'Meara was crushing defending champion Vijay Singh, leading by
a massive 10 holes, but Woods was only one hole ahead of England's
Westwood.
	   The start of play Saturday was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain with
organizers doubtful both matches would be completed if they went
the full 36 holes.
	   O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine
birdies in his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6
meters), 12 (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters).
	   Woods had to struggle. He was down by three holes after the
first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting and his poor putting
and iron play.
	   But he rallied to win the 10th with a par, the 13th with a
birdie (12 footer/4 meters) and squared with another birdie on the
16th with a short putt.
	   He took the lead on the 502-yard 18th when he got on in two and
down in two. Westwood hit a bunker on his drive, another bunker at
the edge of the green on his second and needed three to get down
from there.
	   ``Vijay is a good friend of mine, and he may make some birdies
this afternoon (in the second 18),'' O'Meara said. ``I didn't make
any mistakes. I just have to keep it going.''
	   In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated Patrik Sjoland 7 and
6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, Westwood beat
three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated Ian
Woosnam 1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death
playoff.
	   Woods said after Friday's tight win _ and anticipating a tough
match with Westwood _ he wasn't banking on a final against O'Meara.
	   ``I have my work cut out... and Mark has his work cut out for
him,'' said the flu-ridden Woods, who has been fighting the bug
since he arrived in Britain last week for the Dunhill Cup.

Kashima moves ahead in Japan League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kashima Antlers, last season's first-stage winner,
edged Yokohama Marinos 2-1 Saturday and moved to the top of the
second-stage table of the 18-team professional soccer league of
Japan.
	   Kashima now has 26 points after 11th of the 17-leg second stage.
	   First-stage winner Jubilo Iwata and Urawa Reds both slipped to
away defeats to place second and third each with 24 points.
	   The 1995 champion Marinos went ahead in the 69th minute, through
Fumitake Miura, but Brazilian Bismarck equalized in the 84th.
Brazilian midfielder Jorginho scored the winner for Kashima in the
13th minute of extra time.
	   Marinos stayed fourth with 23 points.
	   Goals from Australian Aurelio Vidmar and Tatsuhiko Kubo gave
Sanfrecce Hiroshima a 2-1 victory over Iwata.
	   First-stage runner-up Shimizu S-Pulse remained in sixth with a
1-0 victory in extra time over Urawa.

Former Nazi doctor denies taking part in Auschwitz atrocities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - A former Nazi doctor who admits
working in a medical laboratory at the former Auschwitz
concentration camp denied in an interview broadcast Saturday that
he took part in Holocaust atrocities.
	   Hans Muench, 87, appeared confused at times in the interview
with Associated Press Television News at his home in Bavaria.
	   Bavarian prosecutors began investigating Muench this month after
a magazine quoted him as saying that he wasn't bothered by working
at Auschwitz, and that gassing Jews spared them from having to
suffer longer from deadly diseases that were rampant in the camp.
	   Muench's daughter, Ruli, 58, at her father's side, called the
report in Der Spiegel weekly ``absolutely false.'' But Muench said
he had not interpreted it as having any ``big mistakes.''
	   At times, though, Muench appeared to mix his personal
experiences with things he first heard of or read about in later
years.
	   He insisted that he had only worked in a lab diagnosing
``prepared samples'' of Auschwitz prisoners for possible disease.
	   Muench said the hygiene institute also employed Jewish inmates
but was separated from the Auschwitz camp. ``We knew only the
prisoner's number,'' he said.
	   He said that while he could surmise that inmates that were the
victims of ``questionable,'' experiments at Auschwitz had been
gassed, but that he was ``not competent,'' to know that himself at
the time.
	   Muench was acquitted of war crimes at Auschwitz by a court in
Krakow, Poland in December 1947, after former inmates he worked
with testified he had in fact helped them.
	   His daughter gave APTN a letter dated Oct. 1 from Eva Mozes-Kor,
of Terre Haute, Indiana, who said she accompanied Muench to
Auschwitz for the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the camp in
1995.
	   In the letter, Mozes-Kor says a doctor who had worked with
Muench told her Muench had saved his life as well as the lives of
other inmates.
	   Mozes-Kor, a survivor of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele's experiments
on twins at Auschwitz, confirmed in a telephone interview she had
written the letter and knew Muench. ``He was a decent man even if
he was in the SS,'' she said.
	   Bavarian prosecutors said this week they had forwarded their
files on Muench to Frankfurt prosecutors, who have dealt with most
cases on Auschwitz in the past.

High-level Turkish team in Baghdad to boost bilateral trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A senior Turkish official met with Iraq's
oil minister Saturday at the start of talks aimed at boosting trade
despite tensions over Kurdish rebels and the sharing of river
waters.
	   Mehmet Batalli, a state minister with special responsibility for
Iraqi affairs, met with Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid,
the official Iraqi News Agency said. It gave no details.
	   ``The visit reflects a desire by Turkey to boost volume of
economic and commercial exchanges to highest levels possible,'' INA
quoted Batalli as saying.
	   Batalli, the state minister for atomic energy and state
statistics, is heading a large trade delegation.
	   His visit follows Iraq's recent warning that neighboring Turkey
will lose business deals under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal
if it carries out military threats against Syria. Turkey accuses
Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies it.
	   Turkey has sold Iraq goods worth dlrs 230 million since the oil
program began in December 1996. However, Turkey says it has lost
billions of dollars as a result of the trade sanctions the United
Nations imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
	   The issue of Kurdish rebels also has chilled Turkey's relations
with Iraq. Turkish troops frequently enter northern Iraq to pursue
rebels who use the area as a base for attacking targets in southern
Turkey.
	   Iraq also criticizes Turkey for hosting U.S. and British
warplanes that enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to help
keep the Iraqi army at bay.
	   In addition, the two countries disagree on sharing waters of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
	   In a sign of the sour relations, state-run Iraqi newspapers
ignored Batalli's arrival Friday, and Iraqi authorities did not
invite Western news organizations to cover the visit.

Ibero-American presidents express fears of world recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Ibero-American presidents worked on a
summit declaration Saturday warning of world recession unless the
Group of Seven industrialized nations take urgent measures to
stabilize the international financial system.
	   ``Recent financial market turmoil has made clear the necessity
of adjusting the international financial system to keep the
difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all,'' a
draft declaration said.
	   It urged the G-7, which comprises the United States, Japan,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada, to act quickly to ward
off further financial turmoil.
	   Heads of state and government from 19 Latin American countries
and Spain and Portugal will issue their statement at the close of
Sunday's summit in this northern Portuguese port city.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, talking to
reporters during a side trip Saturday to Guimaraes, the cradle of
the Portuguese nation, said Brazil and China, two of the world's
largest economies, had become the ``dikes of resistance'' to global
recession.
	   He said protecting their economies from the spreading economic
turmoil, affecting more countries than at any time since the early
1980s, was key to world economic stability.
	   Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth largest
in the world, and its collapse could be expected to take the rest
of the continent along with it.
	   Although the presidents came here to debate globalization and
regional integration, much of their attention was diverted to the
economic crisis.
	   A copy of the draft declaration obtained by The Associated Press
said the G-7 must strengthen the ability of international
institutions to diagnose, prevent and react to financial market
turmoil.
	   It said more efficient methods of maintaining the stability of
financial and capital markets are ``indispensable ... for the
economic growth of our countries.''
	   Latin American leaders will carry out structural reforms to keep
their economies healthy, according to the draft.
	   Mexico and Brazil already are pursuing fiscal austerity
policies, like cutting state spending.

Typhoon Zeb hits southern Japan as the Philippines, Taiwan recover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number missing to 4, injured to 14, storm's location.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A deadly typhoon hit southwestern Japan Saturday,
drenching the area with heavy rains, interrupting travel, and
forcing more than 1,000 people to flee their homes. Four people
were missing.
	   Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines
and 18 in Taiwan, made landfall near the city of Makurazaki in
Kagoshima Prefecture, 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, at around 4:30 p.m. (0730 GMT), Japan's Meteorological
Agency said.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per
hour, the typhoon was moving across western Japan at a speed of 45
kilometers (30 miles) per hour near the city of Miyazaki, 893
kilometers (558 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Typhoon Zeb was expected to enter the Sea of Japan early Sunday,
before hitting northern Japan, the agency said. The storm was
expected to dump as much as 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain on
parts of central Japan overnight, the meteorological agency said.
	   The typhoon left two men, aged 19 and 22, missing on the
southern island of Okinawa after they went to the beach to watch
the roaring waves brought on by the storm, said an Okinawa
prefecture (state) police spokesman. The men were believed drowned
after being swept off to sea, said the spokesman who declined to be
named.
	   Two others were missing in a mudslide in Ehime prefecture on the
southwestern island of Shikoku, national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   A total of 14 people from four southern prefectures were injured
in the storm including a man who lost control of his motorbike in
heavy winds in Okinawa and a woman who suffered a head injury when
she was blown over while carrying shutters to put on her windows,
NHK said.
	   Some 271 domestic flights to and from southern Japan were
canceled and inter-island ferry service was suspended. Train
service on the southernmost main island of Kyushu was interrupted
and some local lines stopped operating in parts of western Japan,
the broadcaster said.
	   A total of 600 houses in three prefectures suffered blackouts,
and 1,200 people were forced to flee their homes due to the threat
of flooding.
	   In the Philippines and Taiwan, disaster officials were searching
for those still missing and cleaning up from the damage wrought by
Zeb on Thursday and Friday.
	   Most of the 74 people dead in the Philippines drowned or were
buried in landslides. Ten people were still missing and the
casualty figure was expected to rise as reports come in from
isolated villages.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   In Taiwan, 18 people were dead and up to 19 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Torrential rains prompted mudslides that covered two houses in
the Taipei suburb of Neihu. The bodies of two elderly men were
recovered from the debris Saturday, and rescuers were still
searching for three others believed trapped.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295 kph)
184 mph.

Japan's foreign minister talks with Russia on World War II treaty

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian and Japanese foreign ministers on
Saturday resumed negotiations over a decades-old territorial
dispute that has prevented them from concluding a World War II
peace treaty.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has pledged that a treaty will be signed
by 2000, but first Russia and Japan must come to an accord over the
Kuril Islands, which the Soviet Union seized from Japan at the end
of the war.
	   The dispute over the islands off Russia's Pacific coast ``should
be settled without damaging Russia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters
after meeting with his Japanese counterpart Masahiko Komura, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ivanov said that many points in the peace treaty had already
been agreed on or were ``in an advanced stage,'' Interfax reported.
He was quoted as saying that ``the territorial question was
obviously discussed as an integral part of a peace treaty,'' and
denied that there had been any talk of Russia's ``trading''
territory in return for Japanese economic aid.
	   The two foreign ministers agreed on a date for a summit between
Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, to be held Nov.
10-13. It will be the first visit by a Japanese premier to the
Russian capital in 25 years, Interfax said.
	   Russia's chief of staff is due to visit Japan next month, and
Russian and Japanese police officials will meet in Moscow in
December, Ivanov said. He said that Russia supported a Japanese
initiative to hold a six-nation conference on a settlement on
Korea, which would include representatives from both North and
South Korea.
	   Komura also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who expressed gratitude to Japan for its support of Russia's
economic reforms, and accepted an invitation to visit Japan. The
two also discussed the long-delayed peace treaty.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in Russo-Japanese
relations.
	   Moscow insists a decision on the Kurils must not threaten its
national interests. Japan has been cautious about investment and
economic cooperation with Russia because of lack of movement in the
dispute.
	   Komura's spokesman, Masaki Okada, said Saturday he was surprised
that Russia's parliament had voted Thursday to reinstate a holiday
marking the defeat of Japan in World War II, Interfax said. The
holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse. The
measure requires Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   Also Saturday, Japan delivered more than dlrs 500,000 in medical
aid to Russia's Sakhalin island, and said it would supply small
generators, flashlights and candles for a town on one of the Kuril
Islands without electricity because of fires, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.

Nobel Peace Prize should spur IRA disarmament, Trimble says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Trimble returning to Northern Ireland,
Ahern praise for both winners in Dublin
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Seizing upon his Nobel Peace
Prize as fresh ammunition for his arguments, Protestant leader
David Trimble called on the IRA to start disarming as he returned
to Northern Ireland Saturday.
	   Trimble's wife Daphne and youngest daughter Sarah, 6, braved a
media throng at Belfast International Airport to greet Trimble, who
on Friday shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume,
leader of the north's major Roman Catholic party.
	   Trimble, 54, was sleeping in his Denver hotel room at 5 a.m.
Friday _ nearing the end of his weeklong tour to drum up North
American investment in Northern Ireland _ when the Norwegian Nobel
Committee made its announcement. He flew overnight from Chicago,
arriving more jet-lagged than jubilant.
	   ``It is an honor, an honor which I am deeply conscious of for
myself,'' said Trimble, who emphasized that credit should be spread
widely among negotiators of his Ulster Unionist Party and Hume's
Social Democratic and Labor Party, whom he said provided ``the
center of gravity'' in the 22-month-long talks that achieved
historic accord in April.
	   It committed the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party and representatives
of the north's two major pro-British paramilitary groups _ all of
which back the accord _ to disarm by mid-2000.
	   Trimble cited Nobel recognition for Northern Ireland as an added
incentive for the IRA to start disarming now, something the
outlawed group refuses to do. Trimble said Protestant lawmakers
won't work with Sinn Fein in a new cross-community government until
the IRA does so.
	   Referring both to Sinn Fein and the IRA, Trimble said: ``I hope
this award will encourage the republican movement to take the steps
that are necessary to give public confidence and assurance that we
are going to see the end of the troubles of the last three
decades.''
	   Hume has consistently criticized Trimble for making IRA
disarmament a condition to Sinn Fein's full inclusion in the new
political structures.
	   When asked Friday in New York whether the Nobel committee's
decision would influence the IRA, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said: ``I don't think the IRA got a prize, did they?''
	   While Hume had been considered Northern Ireland's most likely
Nobel winner, Trimble was considered a dark-horse candidate because
of his success in committing the north's main British Protestant
party to April's accord _ and as crucially, delivering a bare
majority of Protestant public support in the May referendum.
	   The Nobel prize, Trimble said, ``shows that the international
community recognizes that Northern Ireland is coming out of the
turmoil that we have had over the last three decades ... that we
are in the process of bringing into existence a new Northern
Ireland.''
	   Meanwhile in Dublin, Hume spent a quiet day with his wife rather
than attend ceremonies marking the official opening of the
University of Notre Dame's extension campus in the Irish capital.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who received an honorary
doctorate from Notre Dame, told 200 invited dignitaries and
students that Hume had ``given 30 years of his life to try and find
an accommodation between the two main traditions of the historical
divide.''
	   ``Many times he failed, but it never stopped him. Each time he
sought new ideas for new initiatives, and to seek to convince
others to pursue them,'' Ahern said.
	   Ahern, a potential Nobel candidate for his own high-profile role
in the final days of negotiations, also credited Trimble for
overcoming ``horrendous opposition'' within his party.
	   ``David Trimble today is not welcomed in parts of his
constituency, he's been in considerable danger in some parts of his
constituency, and that's not nice for any politician ... but he has
faced that down,'' Ahern said.
	   When asked about the prize money of 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 963,000) they will share after December's award ceremony in
Stockholm, both Trimble and Hume have said they had no idea what
they would do with it.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Australian Mark Woodforde will have his work
cut out for him at the Singapore Open indoor tennis tournament on
Sunday, after advancing to both the singles and doubles finals.
	   A determined Woodforde fought back from one set down in his
semifinal match on Saturday to advance to his first singles final
in four years, then joined compatriot Todd Woodbridge to scrape
through their doubles semifinal in similar style.
	   Better known for his doubles play on the world's second-ranked
team, Woodforde defeated Dutchman Sjeng Schalken 0-6, 6-4, 6-2 in
his singles match. He will meet top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile in
the final of the dlrs 700,000 ATP tour event.
	   Directly after he plays Rios, Woodforde will team up with
Woodbridge to face the Indian duo of Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander
Paes in the doubles.
	   Woodforde overcame a drubbing in the first set of his singles
semifinal, succumbing to what he described as ``impatient'' play,
as Schalken broke his serve three times to take six games
consecutively.
	   But he regained his confidence in the next two sets, using an
inspired variety of slices, drop-shots and lobs to dictate the pace
of play.
	   Woodforde broke his Dutch opponent in the tenth and final game
of the second set to pull even. Moving smoothly around the court,
he put together an impressive array of passing and drop shots in
the deciding set.
	   Schalken misjudged a lunging lob from the Australian in the
critical fourth game of the final set that broke the Dutchman's
serve, and Woodforde quickly finished his opponent off with another
break to take the set and match.
	   World number three Marcelo Rios manhandled American Jim Courier
in the other semifinal. The top seed took a mere 55 minutes of
nearly flawless play to win 6-2, 6-1.
	   The two former world number one players entered the tournament
in very different standings, with Courier a wild card and Rios the
clear favorite.
	   ``I felt really good, and I didn't give him any chance,'' said a
matter-of-fact Rios, who predicts victory on Sunday.
	   The Chilean saved all five break points Courier was able to
manage against his serve, and converted five of his eight break
points against the hapless American.
	   In Saturday's doubles action, the perennially successful
Woodforde and Woodbridge survived a scare from American team Justin
Gimelstob and Jonathan Stark, pulling back from the brink of defeat
in the second set. The Australians scraped by with a 2-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 victory.
	   The Indian pair of Bhupathi and Paes were more convincing,
beating Romania's Andrei Pavel and Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 7-6
(8-6), 6-4.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Attackers believed to be Ugandan rebels
killed three relief workers and injured two others when they
ambushed a convoy in northeastern Uganda, Norwegian People's Aid
said in a statement Saturday.
	   The agency said the two vehicles _ a truck and a Toyota Land
Cruiser _ were returning from delivering relief supplies to the
southern Sudanese town of Bamuruye when they came under heavy fire.
	   The agency did not say when the attack occurred 2 kilometers
(1.2 miles) west of the town of Yumbe on the Ugandan side of the
border.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia 10 more days to fulfill a peace pledge, the alliance
sent surveillance planes over Kosovo on Saturday to check on the
status of promised Yugoslav withdrawals.
	   Yugoslavia consented to the flights this week as part of the
package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the war-torn
Serbian province.
	   ``U-2s are indeed flying,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``They're definitely up in the air, and

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chile said Saturday it will protest to British
authorities after police arrested former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet on allegations of murdering Spanish citizens
during his years in power.
	   Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was held Friday night after
British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens
in Chile, the spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
	   The spokeswoman refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but
Pinochet's press secretary in Santiago said he being held in the
London clinic where he underwent surgery for a herniated disc on
Oct. 9. No hearing date has been set.
	   In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ''filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.
	   The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez, demanded ''that steps be taken to allow an early end of
of this situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not
recognize the authority of foreign courts over situations which
occurred in Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, was reported to have left
London Bridge Hospital on Wednesday. But his press secretary
Fernando Martinez said he was at the clinic Friday night when
police came for him.

Report: 30 Muslim militants killed by government forces in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian government security forces
killed 30 Muslim militants during a week-long offensive in the
brush east of the capital, Algerian newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The area where the operation took place was under the command of
Hassan Hattab, a leader of Armed Islamic Group, who was among those
killed, the La Nouvelle Republique newspaper said. Hattab's death
has been reported at least twice before.
	   Security forces repeatedly shelled and bombed the area allegedly
used by the GIA group between Bourmedes and Tizi-Ouzou east of
Algiers, the capital.
	   At least 30 militants of the Armed Islamic Group were killed in
the operation, La Nouvelle Republique reported.
	   The Quotidien d'Oran newspaper said a dozen helicopters had
bombed the area with ``great intensity.''
	   Both the military and Muslim militants have stepped up their
attacks in recent weeks in this petroleum-rich North African nation
as Algeria prepares for early presidential elections in February.
	   An insurgency that erupted after the military-backed government
canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was set
to win has left more than 75,000 people dead.
	   Meanwhile, three fisherman and four adolescents were killed by
armed groups, Algeria media reported Saturday.
	   A group of men armed with pistols and axes killed three surf
fisherman and wounded a fourth who managed to escape and sounded
the alarm Wednesday, the Quotidien d'Oran newspaper said. The
killings took place on an isolated beach near Ain Touchent, about
440 kilometers (271 miles) west of Algiers.
	   Algerian public radio reported that four adolescents were killed
Friday near Hammam Righda, a thermal spa about 120 kilometers (75
miles) southwest of Algiers. No further details were available.

	   Kosovo appeared to be calm Saturday, and there were continuing
signs Yugoslavia was gradually complying with demands to end the
crackdown and bring stability to the province.
	   A Yugoslav army convoy appeared to leave Kosovo, and an advance
team of Western specialists arrived in Yugoslavia to prepare for
the mission of 2,000 monitors in the Serbian province, as allowed
by Belgrade in an agreement signed Friday.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio Saturday.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend a four-day grace period that
would have expired Saturday morning, giving Milosevic until Oct. 27
to fully comply. About 400 NATO warplanes are being kept ready for
possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces, who consider Kosovo their
historic heartland, and ethnic Albanians seeking to secede from
Serbia. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been displaced from their homes there.
	   At least 144 army tanks, trucks and other vehicles were seen
driving in the direction of the provincial border with Serbia
Friday night.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb forces and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement called for Belgrade's forces in Kosovo to be
reduced to levels they were at before the crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels began Feb. 28.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not yet enough to head off the possibility of
airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Closing in on his first title since
Wimbledon, top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow American Todd
Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the final of the dlrs
800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   On Sunday, he'll seek his fourth title of the year against the
winner of the other semifinal match between Karol Kucera of
Slovakia and Britain's Greg Rusedski.
	   Sampras needed an hour, 21 minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked
Martin.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game, when he hit
a crosscourt backhand return past the onrushing Martin for a break
that put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tiebreak en
route to the victory.
	   ``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,''
said Sampras, who described his play Saturday as not spectacular
but ``solid.'' ``It all came down to the tiebreak.''
	   Sampras, involved in a close race with Patrick Rafter and
Marcelo Rios for the top ranking as the season enters its final
weeks, entered the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the
last moment as a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   ``This week certainly helps'' in that effort, said Sampras after
beating Martin. ``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a
reference to his early exit from the Swiss tournament.
	   The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals
by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runnerup to Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Kucera, ranked seventh in the world, was trying to remain on
track Saturday to nail down a spot in the eight-man Hanover finale.

Road workers discover prehistoric cave in southern France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two road workers building a highway in southern
France have stumbled across a prehistoric cave, which specialists
are calling an ``exceptional discovery.''
	   The workers were clearing the way for the construction of the
new A75 highway to connect the cities of Millau and Beziers in the
Languedoc region when they spotted the cave Friday, police said.
	   Local authorities quickly dispatched a team of specialists to
the so-called ``Cirque de Moureze'' area about 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of the city of Montpellier.
	   Four human skeletons, three adults and a child, were preserved
in the cave, as well as cooking pots, an axe and a vase, which
could date from the Neolithic era, 8,000 to 3,500 B.C _ although
scientists already are differing on the date.
	   According to Laurent Boismenu, of the Medical-Legal Institute in
Montpellier, the cave could be from the Cro-Magnon period.
	   Christian Olive, an archeologist, said he believed it was a
burial site that could date back to 2,000 B.C.
	   ``It's a little bit like we had a photo of prehistory, which is
exceptional,'' said Olive.
	   The area has been sealed off and work stopped on that part of
the new highway.
	   France's most famous Cro-Magnon cave is Lascaux in the Dordogne
region, where magnificent paintings of animals have been preserved.

Davenport and Williams advance to all-American final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, background, detail &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No.1 Lindsay Davenport and
Venus Williams each won their semifinal Saturday, setting up an
all-American, power-hitting final at the dlrs 1 million European
Championships.
	   Davenport left herself just one final hurdle to overcome in the
defense of her title, after brushing aside Romania's Irina Spirlea
6-2, 6-3 in her semifinal.
	   Some 24 hours after closing out Mary Pierce's campaign with the
fastest serve in the history of women's tennis, Williams cast a
shadow over fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat's 31st birthday
celebrations, defeating the French player 6-3, 6-4.
	   Winner of five titles this season including the U.S. Open,
Davenport's journey to the final was untroubled, the American
reaching the final without dropping a set.
	   Hardly raising a sweat, the 22-year-old disposed of the Romanian
in just 58 minutes to extend her winning streak to 16 consecutive
victories in Switzerland.
	   ``I played one of my best matches of the week,'' said Davenport,
who on Monday took over as the world's No.1, bringing to an end
Martina Hingis's 80 week stay atop the rankings. ``It's been very
exciting to be No.1 and it's really pushed me to play well and
defend my title.''
	   Relatively unchallenged, Davenport began her onslaught early,
breaking Spirlea's second serve to go 3-1, then again at 5-2 to win
the first set.
	   In the second, Sprilea managed to break the American's opening
serve to go 1-0, but a dominant Davenport quickly recuperated her
serve, breaking back to even the games.
	   The American then broke a second time for a 3-1 lead, which
Spirlea was unable to make up.
	   Williams was just as clinical in her elimination of Tauziat.
	   The 18-year-old American took a commanding 4-1 lead to open the
match, then held her serve to take the set.
	   Tauziat tripped up Williams at the start of the next set,
breaking the American's second serve then holding to take a
dangerous 4-1 advantage.
	   But the American teenager's powerful strokes proved to be too
much for the French player, the determined Williams winning the
next five consecutive games to lock up her berth in the final.
	   ``Nathalie played well, attacking, trying to take every point
away,'' said Williams, who has three career titles. ``In the first
set I played very solid but in the second my first serve was
letting me down, leaving me vulnerable. So I had to improve.''
	   When the two Americans met last year in Zurich, Davenport
soundly beat her younger compatriot 6-0, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
Since then two have met four times with Davenport holding a 3-1
lead.
	   Williams last defeated Davenport in the semifinals in Oklahoma
City earlier this year. Davenport's most recent win over Williams
was in the semifinals of the U.S. Open which she went on to win.
	   Both acknowledge the showdown will likely be tight.
	   ``If I didn't feel I could win, I should default right now,''
said Williams, who served a record-breaking 205 km/hour (127.4
miles/hour) ace on Friday. ``But I'm a smarter player now, my serve
is more consistent and I'm older, more experienced.
	   ``Last year I didn't play as many tournaments, didn't know
exactly what to do at any point in time,'' recalled Williams. ``As
I look back I wonder exactly how I won the matches I did.''
	   While Davenport's new status has boosted her confidence, she is
aware of the threat her younger compatriot poses.
	   ``I'm going to try and overpower her if I can,'' said Davenport.
``It'll be important to serve well and not let her get a chance to
attack my second serve.
	   ``I'll also have to return well as she's obviously serving very
hard right now.''
	   Regardless of Sunday's outcome, Davenport will hang on to her
No.1 ranking next week, with Hingis out due to a strained ankle
this week.
	   Davenport holds a 396 point lead over Hingis, and plans to play
in Moscow, Philadelphia and New York in order to collect enough
points to remain the world's top player at the end of the season.
	   ``At first I was just happy to become world No.1 for the first
time of my career,'' said Davenport. ``But now my goal is to finish
the year as one.
	   ``And I think that is definitely attainable.''

Journalists of Indonesia, France, Algeria honored for war coverage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYEUX, France (AP) _ Associated Press Photographer Achmad
Ibrahim, 23, won the Bayeux Prize for War Correspondents on
Saturday for his photographs of the crisis in Indonesia.
	   Ibrahim had barely begun working for The AP when he was thrust
into the front line of rioting in May of this year that led to the
resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   In the television category, Morad Ait-Habbouche of France 3 won
first prize for his reporting on the war in Congo.
	   The first prize for news was won by Jean-Paul Marie of the
French leftist weekly Le Nouvel Observateur for his coverage of
people who were mutilated in the war in Angola.
	   The winners all received 50,000 francs (dlrs 9,090) plus a
trophy for their reporting, which had to be completed between June
1, 1997, and May 31, 1998.
	   This was the fifth edition of the annual prize, an ``homage to
freedom and democracy,'' to reward journalists for their coverage
of a conflict or its consequences for civilians.
	   The winners are chosen by an international jury.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just hours after NATO gave
Yugoslavia 10 more days to fulfill a peace pledge, the alliance
sent surveillance planes over Kosovo on Saturday to check on the
status of promised Yugoslav withdrawals.
	   Yugoslavia consented to the flights this week as part of the
package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the war-torn
Serbian province.
	   ``U-2s are indeed flying,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``They're definitely up in the air and
we're looking at the ground'' as part of the air surveillance
accord signed with Yugoslavia on Thursday.
	   NATO and U.S. officials have declined to say where the flights
originate from.
	   Kosovo appeared to be calm Saturday, and there were continuing
signs the Yugoslav government was gradually complying with demands
to end the crackdown and bring stability to the province.
	   A huge Yugoslav army convoy appeared to leave Kosovo overnight,
and an advance team of Western specialists arrived in Yugoslavia to
prepare for the mission of 2,000 monitors who will roam the Serbian
province under a second surveillance pact signed with Belgrade on
Friday.
	   NATO on Friday decided to extend a four-day grace period that
would have expired Saturday morning, giving Milosevic until Oct. 27
to fully comply. About 400 NATO warplanes are being kept ready for
possible airstrikes if Yugoslavia fails to meet its promises.
	   A Yugoslav official said Saturday the deadline would be met.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   At least 144 army tanks, artillery trucks and other vehicles
were seen driving in the direction of the provincial border with
Serbia Friday night.
	   Scaling back Yugoslav and Serb forces and equipment in Kosovo is
an important demand of the agreement reached Monday by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement called for Belgrade's forces in Kosovo to be
reduced to levels they were at before the crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels began Feb. 28.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes, and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not yet enough to head off the possibility of
airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   An advance team for the OSCE, Europe's main problem-solving
alliance, arrived in Belgrade to begin planning for the arrival of
the 2,000 monitors. The 13 staffers were to be joined by about
seven others by the time they arrive in Pristina on Sunday.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' said delegation
member John Sandrock.
	   Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in Vienna that the group
hopes to have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo
within two weeks.
	   The government signed a deal Friday with the OSCE to let its
``verifiers'' monitor Milosevic's pledge to withdraw his troops and
allow the return of refugees.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. Several thousand
ethnic Albanians are still living outdoors in about five locations
in Kosovo.
	   But prospects of Serb pullouts apparently have encouraged them.
According to the CIA in Washington, as of Friday about 35,000
refugees had come down from the mountains in the previous 36 hours.
	   In the town of Pagarusa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, the United Nations delivered 160 tons of
flour, oil and other food to refugees from the area Saturday.
	   Sven L. Pedersen, with the World Food Program, said Serb police
were more cooperative in recent days.
	   ``There are less delays at checkpoints,'' he said. ``Before,
police used to check us going in and out to see what we're
carrying.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where Serbs comprise only
about 10 percent of the population, remain skeptical of Milosevic's
compliance. They also are reluctant to accept anything short of
independence for the province, while international officials urge a
lesser form of self-rule.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders were expected to meet Saturday in
Istanbul, Turkey, to smooth differences between different factions
and unite in their political demands. The exiled premier of the
Albanians' self-styled Kosovo republic, Bujar Bukoshi, was to talk
with the leaders of several parties.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Police cordoned off a large part of
the federal capital after protesters set cars on fire and forced
shops to close to protest the shooting death earlier Saturday of a
militant Sunni Muslim leader.
	   Hundreds of mourners beat their chests and vowed revenge for the
killing of Maulana Mohammed Abdullah.
	   Gunmen in a car shot him as he stepped from the mosque in Apara
district of Islamabad after saying his prayers.
	   No one has taken responsibility. Abdullah was a member of the
militant Sipah-e-Sahaba, or the Guardians of the friends of the
Prophet organization. Police believe the killing was committed by
rival Shiite Muslims, who regularly clash with the group.
	   A police official said hundreds of rioters burned two government
vehicles and an oil tanker after the shooting. Witnesses said all
shops in the Apara neighborhood were shuttered and that the entire
area was in darkness.
	   Last month, four leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba were shot and killed
in another hit-and-run attack in Islamabad. Hundreds of people have
been killed in recent years in conflict between Sunni and Shiite
groups.

 &UR; Brazilian President says Brazil, China vital for world economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUIMARAES, Portugal (AP) _ Brazil and China are the last line of
defense against a looming global economic recession, Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday.
	   Cardoso said that in the wake of recent financial turmoil, ``at
this point, the dikes of resistance for the stability of the world
are China and Brazil.''
	   Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy, and eighth-largest in
world. If it goes under, its neighbors likely will be dragged down
in the backwash and the ripples would be felt around the globe,
perhaps ushering in a world recession.
	   The financial turmoil already has devastated the Asian and
Russian economies. China, another huge emerging market, has so far
survived the pressure.
	   Cardoso called on major economies to steer the world away from
recession by cutting interest rates.
	   Cardoso visited this northern Portuguese city ahead of Sunday's
summit meeting of Latin American, Spanish and Portuguese leaders in
nearby Oporto which is expected to center on economic issues.
	   To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso is preparing
austerity measures that could be a bitter blend of state spending
cuts and tax hikes.
	   The aim is to institute structural changes, like slashing the
state budget deficit, to shore up Brazil's economy and ward off
attacks by short-term speculators.
	   The reforms also would help Brazil qualify for an International
Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion.
	   Cardoso indicated he has not yet received the full fiscal reform
proposal his staff is drawing up, but he said it would pursue
currency stability and lower interest rates.
	   He insisted he is not planning an increase in direct taxes, but
gave warning that Brazil needs ``very strong financial austerity''
to keep its economy afloat.
	   The reform plan will require approval from Congress and the
cooperation of state governors.
	   Cardoso also has to persuade the people of the plan's benefits.
	   Many Brazilians resent the IMF, believing that it humiliated
them when it imposed strict financial reforms on the country during
the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.

Rain dampens Britain's answer to Million Man March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rain on Saturday dampened what black activists had
hoped would be Britain's answer the Million Man March in Washington
DC.
	   About 2,000 people marched to London's Trafalgar Square on the
third anniversary of the Washington gathering that focused on the
role black men could play in helping their communities. Organizers
had hoped for 10,000 people.
	   The event, dubbed March 10,000, was organized by the Black
United Front, an umbrella group representing organizations like the
Society of Black Lawyers, Operation Black Vote and black Christian
organizations _ as well as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, which
ran the Washington march.
	   Standing under a banner describing the march as a ''Holy Day of
Atonement,'' Leo Muhammed of The Nation of Islam's West London
chapter urged marchers to ''try to keep dry.''
	   ``Today ... is going to be a peaceful one where black people can
come together,'' he said. Speeches focused on problems in the black
community including poverty, poor education and drug abuse.
	   Retired welder Wilfred Gier, who traveled from Birmingham in
central England for the event, said black Britons do not ''have a
history of big black marches like the civil rights movement in the
United States but the point is we have to start somewhere and
perhaps sometimes in the future this will become a bigger event.''
	   Birmingham photographer Desmond Ebenoes said he came ``to see if
I could bring something positive back to my community.''
	   ``This is being organized by black people who like themselves,
which is a very powerful thing,'' he said.
	   London organizer Simon de Banya said for a non-musical event,
``this amount of black people is not a bad achievement, especially
since the Nation of Islam ... receive a bad press generally and
black people are often suspicious of them.
	   ``It is a very positive thing to see so many people congregating
to hear about serious issues,'' he said.
	   At the original Million Man March on Oct. 16, 1995, two million
African-American men descended on the U.S. capital to dedicate
themselves to solving problems in their communities.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Concerned about the impact of crime
on tourism, the South African government sent a message of regret
and sympathy on Saturday to a trio of Swiss women who were sexually
assaulted.
	   The women came to South Africa for a holiday but instead
``became victims of this barbaric crime,'' the Ministry for Safety
and Security in Pretoria said in a statement.
	   The assault occurred Wednesday when five armed men shot at a car
carrying the women as they were leaving a wild animal reserve in
northern KwaZulu-Natal.
	   The women were abducted, and two were repeatedly raped. A third
woman avoided being raped by saying she was ill.
	   Police arrested two suspects on Friday. Police spokesman Capt.
Charl Scheepers said Saturday that the police have since identified
three additional suspects.
	   A deputy minister of tourism on Friday said the attack would
cause irreparable damage to South Africa's budding tourism
industry.
	   ``The people that will be most affected economically from the
(attack) will be those living in the area, who sell arts and crafts
and fruit along the roadside,'' said Sakkie Hattingh, executive
director of KwaZulu-Natal's tourism promoters, Timeless Afrika.
	   Since December, two foreign tourists were murdered _ a German
man in Durban and an American in Cape Town.

World champion Camenzind wins Italian race

<TEXT>
	   BERGAMO, Italy (AP) _ Capping a sensational week, world road
champion Oscar Camenzind on Saturday captured the Tour of Lombardy
in the closing event of the international cycling season.
	   The Swiss cyclist of the Mapei commercial team beat Dutch
champion Michael Boogerd by six seconds at the finish line in this
northern town.
	   The triumphant day for the Swiss colors was completed by third
place of Nicola Puttini and fifth place of Pascal Richard.
	   World Cup champion Michele Bartoli of Italy finished between the
two Swiss, in fourth place.
	   Camenzind, who clinched the world title in Valkenburg last
Sunday for his first season victory, scored a solo triumph in the
92th edition of the Italian classic launching a decisive attack on
Boogerd 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) from the finish.
	   The Dutch champion, who had helped Camenzind to flee from the
pack and carry out a successful 70-kilometer (43.4-mile) escape,
could not keep the pace of the world champion in the final uphill
stretch and finished runner-up.
	   Camenzind overcame the pain of a bruised leg, suffered in a
spill in the initial part of the race, as he pedalled to his second
major career triumph in seven days.
	   ``I pushed hard, I knew I was in good form, that I could win
today,'' Camenzind said.
	   Bartoli, who had clinched the World Cup title in advance of
Saturday's last race of the 10-round competition, tried to catch up
the leading duo in the last kilometers but failed to reduce a gap
of about one minute.
	   ``Camenzind deserved victory. He proved the strongest cyclist in
the last month of activity,'' Bartoli said.
	   Saturday's race was the last one for Italian veteran Gianni
Bugno, who announced his retirement from professional cycling.
	   Bugno, 34, won two world titles and a Tour of Italy during his
13-year career.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The government has named a commission to
investigate the circumstances of an airplane crash last month that
killed five people including a senior military officer, a
government statement said Saturday.
	   Since the Kenyan-registered twin-engine Islander crashed Sept.
25 in the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, just across the
border in Congo, there have been conflicting reports on its
destination, the number of passengers and how many died.
	   The statement said the wreckage of the aircraft was located in a
spot 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level.
	   Five people were killed, and five others were injured, the
statement said. Among those who died was Col. Jet Mwebaze, a senior
army officer and brother of acting military Chief of Staff James
Kazini.
	   Originally, army officials had said the plane was headed for the
western Uganda town of Kasese. But a later statement acknowledged
that the plane was going to Bunia in northeastern Congo.
	   Initial reports that all 10 on board had survived were
superceded by an acknowledgement that five, including the pilot,
had died.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper reported last week
that the passengers on board were on a gold-buying mission to Bunia
and were carrying dlrs 1.2 million in cash.
	   No trace of the money was found at the crash site, the newspaper
cited a security source as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the family of pilot Enos Luwuzu, who was buried a
week ago, has claimed two bullets entered his body at the base of
the neck and exited through his mouth.
	   Luwuzu's brother, Kampala attorney Enoth Mugabi, was quoted in
New Vision as saying he suspected there may have been a scuffle
before the plane crashed, and his brother was shot in the back of
the neck.
	   The newspaper said unconfirmed reports suggested the pilot had
protested flying the plane to Bunia instead of Kasese, but that the
others on board had insisted.
	   There have also been reports that survivors, who spent nearly a
week wandering in the densely forested mountains before being
rescued, said Mwebaze had been injured by the crash but had
survived. He was dead when rescue workers reached him.
	   The New Vision said some reports indicated the scuffle that
began on the plane continued after the crash and that is why
survivors dispersed in different directions.
	   Official statements had previously insisted that a German named
Andrew Gore died. But on Saturday, the New Vision identified Gore
as a Sudanese.
	   The report identified another of those killed as Saidi Rashid, a
Congolese gold dealer.

Egyptian women's prison discovers inmate is a man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A female warder found nothing against the
rules when she strip-searched an inmate at a women's prison here.
	   But the inmate was in contravention. He was a man, a police
official said Saturday.
	   Ismail Mohammed Abdullah, 17, gave his name as Rascha, a woman's
name, when he was arrested with two friends on a charge of theft.
	   Police were taken in by his elaborate disguise and so were
fellow inmates after Abdullah was transferred to a women's prison.
	   It was only when the warder searched Abdullah on Friday that she
found his breasts to be fake, the police official said.
	   His fellow cell mates said Abdullah's mannerisms and actions
were not those of a man, the official reported, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Abdullah told police he ``hates men'' and that he wants to have
a sex change operation.
	   The official said Abdullah is now in a police station, awaiting
transfer to a men's prison.

Leftist guerrillas blow up police station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Leftist guerrillas blew up a police
station in southern India Saturday, killing two policemen and
injuring one, police said.
	   One visitor was also killed in the explosion in Yadgiri Gutta
village in Andhra Pradesh state. The area is 70 kilometers (40
miles) northeast of Hyderabad, the state capital.
	   Police identified the killers as members of the People's War
Group, a Maoist organization that often attacks rich land owners,
police and administrators. It accuses them of colluding with land
owners to deny farm workers their rights.

Strike disrupts train traffic in central France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike by train conductors disrupted rail traffic
Saturday in central France around the Loire Valley city of Tours.
	   Hardest hit were regional trains, where service was badly
interrupted. One out of three long-distance trains were operating,
while high-speed TGV service was running on schedule.
	   Rail strikes are frequent in France, with workers often
demanding more pay, better working conditions or protesting against
the growing number of attacks on public transport personnel.

Astronomer says state budget ignores science
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A promonent Czech scientist called
on his fellow scholars Saturday to protest against the proposed
1999 state budget, claiming it ignores investments into science.
	   Astronomer Jiri Grygar said in an open letter sent to the CTK
news agency that the proposed budget would make scientific research
virtually impossible.
	   ``If the legislators receive a large number of letters, they may
change their mind,'' Grygar said in his letter.
	   The draft budget, featuring a dlrs 1 billion deficit with
planned revenues of about dlrs 21 billion, provides only dlrs 290
million for scientific research _ 85 percent of this year's
allotment.
	   That amount would be 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product,
considerably short of the 0.7 percent required if the Czech
Republic is to join the European Union.
	   The budget draft was rejected in Parliament last week and the
government is supposed to submit another draft within a month. But
Premier Milos Zeman has already warned the new draft may feature an
even bigger deficit.

Jospin warns against violence as students plan new protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR104 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As French high school students on Saturday planned
new protests, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said his government
would take strong measures against violence against rioters.
	   Reinforcing tough talk by Education Minister Claude Allegre on
Friday, Jospin told a meeting of Socialist leaders the government
would be ``extremely firm'' with regard to future protests.
	   An estimated 500,000 high school students protested Thursday
across the country to demand more teachers, better equipment and
buildings and a lighter course load.
	   About 150 students were arrested nationwide. In Paris, five
people were injured, some 50 shops looted and 100 cars damaged as
hooligans bent on violence joined the demonstrations.
	   ``The rioters must be apprehended and punished,'' Jospin said.
	   A former Education Minister himself, Jospin also called on
current minister Claude Allegre to pursue reforms aimed at
increasing the number of teachers and reforming the education
system.
	   With new nationwide demonstrations planned for Tuesday, student
leaders were meeting in Paris on Saturday to plan their strategy.

Crimean government's debts exceed peninsula's annual budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The debts of the government of Ukraine's
Crimean Peninsula exceed the autonomous republic's annual budget,
Crimea's prime minister said Saturday.
	   While the Crimean budget stands at 450 million hryvna (dlrs
131.5 million at the current exchange rate), the government's debts
total 500 million hryvna (dlrs 146 million), said the premier,
Serhiy Kunitsyn.
	   ``The government cannot resolve all the peninsula's problems,''
Kunitsyn told a meeting of his Popular-Democratic Party, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Kunitsyn said the government owes 200 million hryvna (dlrs 58.5
million) for electric energy supplies, 120 million hryvna (dlrs 35
million) for natural gas, and 180 million hryvna (dlrs 52.6
million) in back pensions and debts to various government
organizations and companies.
	   Crimea, a once-rich resort area populated mostly by ethnic
Russians, long has been the focus of tensions between Ukraine and
Russia, but these have calmed down lately despite the presence of a
vocal pro-Moscow minority.
	   ``Although the social-economic situation remains complex, the
republic maintains a relative political stability,'' Kunitsyn said.

Filly Alborada wins Champion Stakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWMARKET, England (AP) _ Alborada, ridden by veteran George
Duffield, held off challenges from Insatiable and favored Daylami
in the dash to the line to win the 400,000 pounds (dlrs 668,000)
Dubai Championship Stakes at Newmarket Saturday.
	   The 3-year-old filly, trained by Mark Prescott, took over from
Daylami's pacemaker, Happy Valentine, 400 yards from home in the 1
1/4 mile race and Frankie Dettori made his move on 6-5 shot
Daylami.
	   But Dettori couldn't get the favorite to match the filly's
finishing burst and and it was French jockey Olivier Peslier on 8-1
shot Insatiable who took up the challenge on the rail.
	   The Frenchman appeared to be finishing faster but had too much
to make up and Alborada held on by half a length to collect the
first prize of 228,000 pounds (dlrs 381,000) at odds of 6-1.
	   Daylami placed third of the 10 runners ahead of Richard Hills on
Mutamam.

Swedes lead in Perrier Pairs golf

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _The weather shifted and the leader-board
changed at the Medoc golf club here Saturday.
	   Playing through a brief downpour and gusty winds, Sweden's Jarmo
Sandelin and Olle Karlsson snatched the lead after the third round
in the dlrs 595,000 Perrier Pairs tournament.
	   The Swedish duo will carry a four-shot cushion into the final
round after posting an eight-under-par 63 _ the round of the day _
in Saturday's greensomes.
	   ``I putted fantastic the first two days but Jarmo sure came
through today,'' Karlsson said.
	   Sandelin sank a 50-foot (15 meter) eagle putt at the 10th and
birdie putts of 40 feet (12 meter) et the 12th and 34 feet (10
meter) at the 15th to complete a six-birdie round which left the
Swedes 20 under par overall at 193.
	   Sunday's final round will be played with both individual scores
counting for a 36-hole aggregate score on the day.
	   ``Anything can happen with two rounds still to count but at
least we know we can sink putts from anywhere, '' Karlsson said.
	   Overnight leaders Jose Rivero and Santiago Luna from Spain shot
71 over the rain-softened, 6,316-meter (6,909-yard) Medoc course
and tied second place at 197.
	   They were joined by French pair Jeff Remesy and Raphael
Jacquelin who fired 68.
	   Spain's Severiano Ballesteros and Angel Miguel Jimenez shot 67
to share seventh at 200 with amateur prodigies Sergio Garcia
(Spain) and South Africa's Trevor Immelman who had a 66 Saturday.

Fire knocks out Galaxy in shootout, awaits D.C., Columbus in final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Zach Thornton and the Chicago Fire made it clear
that this is no ordinary expansion team.
	   The Fire advanced to the American Major League Soccer
championship game Friday night, beating the Los Angeles Galaxy in a
shootout after a 1-1 draw to sweep the best-of-3 Western Conference
final.
	   Chicago won the shootout 2-1, with Thornton making three
consecutive saves after Welton's goal in the second round.
	   ``It has been a long journey,'' Thornton said. ``We're very
happy to be in the final. There's a lot of pressure in the
shootout. As a goalkeeper, I have to make sure I cover my area and
shut them down.''
	   American Jesse Marsch and Polish forward Jerzy Podbrozny scored
in the fourth and fifth rounds of the shootout, with Podbrozny's
clinching goal setting off a celebration among the 32,744 fans at
Soldier Field.
	   ``It's a flip of the coin,'' said Galaxy defender Greg Vanney,
who failed on his fifth-round attempt. ``You might as well flip a
coin.''
	   The Fire will face the Eastern Conference winner Oct. 25 at the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Two-time MLS champion D.C. United
holds a 1-0 lead over Columbus in the Eastern final with Game 2
Sunday in Columbus.
	   ``We're very, very proud to reach the final,'' Chicago coach Bob
Bradley said. ``I don't like shootouts, but a night like tonight is
something positive the league can point to. Shootouts are a tough
way to go.''
	   Polish midfielder Peter Nowak gave Chicago a 1-0 lead with a
goal off a rebound in the 31st minute, and Danny Pena tied it six
minutes later off assists by Cobi Jones and Paul Caligiuri.
	   Nowak's goal was only Chicago's fourth in its last five games.
	   The Galaxy scored an MLS-high 85 goals during the regular season
and added nine more in a first-round sweep of Dallas.
	   ``This spoils it,'' Jones said. ``It doesn't matter how great a
season you have, if you don't make it to the final and win it, it
takes it away.''
	   Chicago won the opener 1-0 at the Rose Bowl on Oct. 10, with
Marsch scoring with four minutes remaining.

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna against Kucera
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kucera victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Closing in on his first title since
Wimbledon, top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow American Todd
Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the final of the dlrs
800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   On Sunday, he'll seek his fourth title of the year against
seventh-ranked Karol Kucera of Slovakia, who defeated Britain's
Greg Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Sampras needed an hour, 21 minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked
Martin.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game, when he hit
a crosscourt backhand return past the onrushing Martin for a break
that put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tiebreak en
route to the victory.
	   ``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,''
said Sampras, who described his play Saturday as not spectacular
but ``solid.'' ``It all came down to the tiebreak.''
	   Sampras, involved in a close race with Patrick Rafter and
Marcelo Rios for the top ranking as the season enters its final
weeks, entered the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the
last moment as a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   ``This week certainly helps'' in that effort, said Sampras after
beating Martin. ``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a
reference to his early exit from the Swiss tournament.
	   The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals
by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runnerup to Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Kucera remained on track to nail down a spot in the eight-man
Hanover finale. In the first set, he trailed 4-1 and was facing set
point at 5-6 before coming back.
	   Rusedski double-faulted eight times.

Three fishermen dead, 100 missing at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ At least 100 fishermen were feared missing
at sea off India's western coast Saturday after they failed to
return despite warnings that a storm was brewing in the area,
officials said.
	   As many as 280 fishermen in 28 boats set out fishing two days
ago, said a spokesman for the Fishermen's Welfare Association.
Nearly all but 100 returned after the storm warnings were made by
the weather department.
	   Three fishermen, who were among a group of ten trying to reach
the shore drowned when their boat capsized in the rough sea. But
seven others were rescued by a passing boat, officials said
Saturday.

Prime Minister assures people there is enough food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday
assured the Bangladeshi people of food security despite shortages
created by the worst flooding the country has seen this century.
	   In a national television and radio address, the prime minister
said the government had arranged to import one million tons of
foodgrain and another 1.5 million tons had been imported by private
traders. She said 1.5 million more was expected as annual food aid
by friendly donors.
	   ``The people will not suffer from food scarcity,'' Hasina said.
	   Already, the government has a stock of 625,000 tons of foodgrain
and will use the armed forces to stock, transport distribute the
foodgrain, she said.
	   Bangladesh has received dlrs 213 million for food and
rehabilitation in international aid. The floods claimed more than
1,500 lives and affected 35 million people in the three fourth of
the country.

O'Meara ousts Singh to reach World Match Play final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more O'Meara quotes; updates Woods-Westwood score
with Woods 4 up after 28 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara thrashed defending
champion Vijay Singh 11 and 10 Saturday to reach the final of the
World Match Play Championship and set a new record for the most
lopsided win in the 34-year-old tournament.
	   In the other semifinal, O'Meara's Florida neighbor and friend
Tiger Woods held a four-hole lead on Lee Westwood after 28 holes
with a final looming between the two Americans.
	   The start of play Saturday was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain with
organizers doubtful the Woods-Westwood match would be completed
before darkness if it went the full 36 holes.
	   In that case, the match would be completed early Sunday before
the start of the final, which is worth 170,000 pounds (dlrs
289,000) to the winner.
	   The previous record was set in 1978 when Tom Watson defeated
Dale Hayes 11 and 9. On Friday, Singh was 11 up after 21 holes
against Patrik Sjoland but went on to advance 7 and 6.
	   O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine
birdies in his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6
meters), 12 (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters).
	   He was 11 up after getting a par on the 20th and went to 12 up
with another par on 21. Singh _ this year's U.S. PGA champion _
recovered to only 11 down with a birdie on the 22nd, but O'Meara
closed out the match when they halved the 26th with pars.
	   For 26 holes, O'Meara had nine birdies, all in the first 18.
Singh had trouble with his usually good iron game, and his short
game and putting wasn't much better.
	   ``It was just one of those days when everything went right for
Mark O'Meara. To beat Vijay Singh, who is a world-class player, 11
and 10. It was definitely my day.''
	   ``It was one of those rounds where I was in the zone,'' O'Meara
added. ``Sixty-three with a double-bogey is more than I could ask
for.''
	   O'Meara said he'd prefer to play Woods in the final, which would
be just another of their friendly matches _ this time, for more
money.
	   ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara said. ``He (Woods) has been
playing pretty well at home. I think he took 30 bucks off me the
last time we played.''
	   ``I'm pretty smart,'' he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the
putting green afterwards and try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I
can usually win my money back on the putting green.''
	   Woods had to struggle. He was down by three holes after the
first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting and his poor putting
and iron play.
	   But he rallied to win the 10th with a par, the 13th with a
birdie (12 footer/4 meters) and squared with another birdie on the
16th with a short putt.
	   He took the lead on the 502-yard 18th when he got on in two and
down in two. Westwood hit a bunker on his drive, another bunker at
the edge of the green on his second and needed three to get down
from there.
	   He went four up through 28 with birdies on four holes, getting
two of them with 8-foot (2.5 meters) putts and one on the 28th with
a 25-footer (8 meters).
	   In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated Patrik Sjoland 7 and
6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, Westwood beat
three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated Ian
Woosnam 1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death
playoff.
	   Woods said after Friday's tight win _ and anticipating a tough
match with Westwood _ he wasn't banking on a final against O'Meara.
	   ``I have my work cut out... and Mark has his work cut out for
him,'' said the flu-ridden Woods, who has been fighting the bug
since he arrived in Britain last week for the Dunhill Cup.

Alenichev, Totti rally Roma past unbeaten Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on Roma-Fiorentina, expulsion at Empoli. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dmitri Alenichev and Francesco Totti scored
short-range goals in the final five minutes Saturday as nine-man AS
Roma rallied to shock previously undefeated Italian League leader
Fiorentina 2-1.
	   Fiorentina led 1-0 from the 31st minute on Argentine star
Gabriel Batistuta's league-high sixth goal of the season, and
looked set to pocket another win after Roma had midfielder Luigi Di
Biagio and French defender Vincent Candela sent off in separate
incidents in the second half.
	   But Alenichev, a Russian midfielder, tapped in the equalizer in
the 89th minute off Argentine striker Gustavo Bartelt's assist. And
Totti, fresh off his national team debut last weekend, capped the
comeback by driving home a rebound after a Bartelt shot in the
fourth minute of injury time before 70,000 at Olympic Stadium.
	   The result ended Fiorentina's four-game winning streak, which
put it alone atop the standings for the first time since 1982, and
reversed Roma's recent woes against top teams. The capital's club
had seven losses and one draw last season against the four other
Serie A title contenders.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, AC Parma tripled its season scoring output
by beating winless Salernitana 2-0 on goals nine minutes apart by
Italian internationals Enrico Chiesa and Diego Fuser, and Empoli
drew with Bologna 0-0.
	   Parma is the only club that has shut out every opponent so far,
but had managed to score just one goal before Saturday.
	   At Rome, Bartelt _ who lost his starting spot to Marco
Delvecchio after a series of mediocre outings _ came off the bench
in the 78th minute and turned things around for the hosts (3-1-1).
His precise cross from the end-line found Alenichev open just steps
away from the net and the Russian turned the ball home for his
first goal of the league season.
	   Bartelt then helped create the opening for Totti to win the
entertaining match, firing a deflected shot that allowed the
22-year-old Italian to send the ball into the net.
	   While Roma started well, failing to convert its superior play
into scoring chances, Batistuta came through for Fiorentina
(4-0-1), breaking past Cameroon defender Pierre Wome _ starting for
suspended captain Aldair _ and lobbing the ball past helpless Roma
'keeper Antonio Chimenti.
	   Di Biagio was sent off in the 57th after a foul away from the
ball on Brazilian forward Edmundo. Six minutes later, Candela and
Fiorentina defender Giulio Falcone clattered into each other on the
sideline and were both expelled.
	   Edmundo, whose relationship with Fiorentina has always been
stormy, yelled animatedly at coach Giovanni Trapattoni after being
substituted in the 73rd.
 &UR; Parma 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Chiesa sent a diagonal shot home from 8 meters (yards)
out in the 72nd minute and Fuser sealed victory for the hosts
(2-3-0) in the 81st with a low blast. Salernitana, which is in the
first division for the first time in 50 years, dropped to 0-1-4.
 &UR; Empoli 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Bologna (0-3-2) twice sent shots off the woodwork.
Swedish striker Kennet Andersson's header in the 41st minute struck
the underside of the crossbar, while veteran midfielder
Massimiliano Cappioli hit the post with about 10 minutes left.
Empoli, which had captain Daniele Baldini sent off in the dying
seconds, is 0-3-2.
	   The three games were pushed up ahead of the rest of the fifth
round because of clubs' UEFA Cup outings Tuesday. Sunday's schedule
is Bari vs. Udinese, Cagliari vs. AC Milan, Perugia vs. Venezia,
Piacenza vs. Sampdoria, Vicenza vs. Juventus, and Inter Milan vs.
Lazio of Rome at night.

Hundreds of Palestinians rally for prisoner releases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS demonstration of Ultra-orthodox

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 400 Palestinians, some waving
large pictures of jailed family members, rallied Saturday for the
release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   A small group of demonstrators broke away and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, and the troops responded with a few rounds of tear gas
and rubber bullets. However, no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police dispersed the protesters.
	   It was the second day of unrest in or near Ramallah. On Friday,
Jewish settlers had blocked the West Bank's main north-south
highway outside the town, complaining two of their security
officers were detained and roughed up by Palestinian police.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held Thursday, but denied any ill treatment.
	   The prisoner-release rally coincided with a U.S. peace summit at
the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, at which Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank and Palestinian
security measures.
	   One issue on the table is the release of 3,000 Palestinians held
by Israel for security offenses. The Palestinian official who has
been trying to negotiate prisoner releases accompanied Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to the U.S. talks.
	   In other developments Saturday:
	   _Palestinians living near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, near
the northern West Bank city of Nablus, said about five settlers
rampaged through their olive groves, beating villagers. One
Palestinian was hit in the head with a farm tool and was taken to
the hospital for stitches, then released.
	   Itzhar settlers have a long history of clashes with Palestinians
living in surrounding villages. Three months ago, a pair of
settlers were shot dead in an ambush as they patrolled the
settlement's perimeter.
	   _About 250 demonstrators marched in Gaza City to demand the
release of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails. They
presented a letter at the United Nations office asking the U.N.
secretary-general to look into the question of detainees.
	   _In other developments Saturday, police broke up a demonstration
of several dozen ultra-Orthodox Jews as they attempted to block off
a downtown Jerusalem street. The demonstrators, who threw glass
bottles and stones towards the policemen, were protesting the
presence of a restaurant on the street which remains open on the
Jewish sabbath, Israel Radio reported. There were no injuries.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eight years after his turbulent regime ended,
former Chilean strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet is being called to
account by Spanish authorities for the deaths, detention and
torture of political opponents.
	   Responding to a Spanish extradition warrant, British police
announced Saturday they have arrested Pinochet on allegations that
he murdered an unidentified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''
	   The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez, demanded ``that steps be taken to allow an early end of
this situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not recognize
the authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,
applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastly
dictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is one
of the great murderers of this century.''
	   Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,
which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British
government was ``under obligation to take legal action'' against
him.
	   It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,
who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he
reportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker and
hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another
judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns
	   Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected
President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, when he was
sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in a
constitution drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 political
opponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted
for after being detained by his security agents.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ An American has been
charged with killing a German couple and paying three Dominicans to
bury their bodies in front of their home in this Caribbean country,
police said Saturday.
	   Peter and Barbara Herman were reported missing a month ago when
they did not make a planned trip to Germany, said police spokesman
Col. Simon Diaz. Their bodies were found buried in the sand in
front of their home in Juan Dolio, a tourism-based town about 30
miles (50 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo.
	   Police have arrested a U.S. citizen, Dennis Manley, 46, and
charged him with murdering the two Germans. Investigators were led
to Manley after they questioned Martin de la Rosa Laureano, a
Dominican who worked for the victims, said Diaz.
	   De la Rosa told police he witnessed the killing and Manley paid
him and two other men, brothers Socimo and Ramon Castro, 20,000
Dominican pesos (dlrs 1,300 U.S.) each to bury the bodies.
	   ``Dennis Manley has not confessed to the crime, but according to
the statements by Martin de la Rosa Laureano, the American killed
the couple with a shot to the head and they were buried in the sand
in front of the house where the Germans lived,'' said Diaz.
	   Police are still unsure of the motive for the crime or exactly
when it occurred. Information on the hometowns of the Germans and
the American was not available from police.

	   PARIS (AP) - Valentino's clothes swished around with new sparkle
and sporty verve in his Saturday show of spring ready-to-wear.
	   Versatility and ease from beach-to-evening are the bywords of
this big fashion week, and Valentino catches the spirit.
	   He likes the casual look of cardigan-sweater jackets, caftan
blouses - almost always decorated, of course. These link up with
cropped pants and lovely flat sandals.
	   There were no more uptight beaded, embroidered suits. Instead,
the lines were almost folkloric, not quite ethnic. And of course
they were up-to-date for your rich Barbados traveler or California
coast dweller.
	   In mostly blacks, whites, sandy shades with big dollops of
coral, the clothes would be good standby resort wear, skirts on the
long mid-calf side.
	   Try a lacy full gypsy blouse - a big item here, with its
low-slung seashell belt over fluid silk crepe pants.
	   Pretty lace ponchos came out over white or coral linen trousers,
full skirts in conical or round shapes would be great at any
barbecue or elegant soiree.
	   And the master of luxury could not resist orange pleated tulle
flounces on a skirt with its neat little sleeveless white top.
	   But with the many organza blouses, the breezy tiered skirts, the
collection did have a terrific contemporary offhand look that's
welcome today.
	   Right up to date, too, and with a much younger light touch, the
Herve Leger collection hit some fine high notes. The silhouettes
were fairly narrow, but easy, and the rainbow-painted skirts or
bustier tops were great fun for color.
	   Changing from his bandage-like wrapped earlier styles, Leger
went into bright printed wrap skirts or pinstriped versions that
look anything from stodgy. The young bustier dresses, pretty colors
in ikat weaves and and details give this collection a good deal of
youthful clout.
	   Great cut-out looks with flesh or flesh colored linen underneath
are super for dresses, and sexy bathing suits as well - a big line
here in cut out lycras.
	   Ribbon embroidery, twisted-rope fabrics and hand-painted silks
make for evening dresses with a touch of haute couture, while white
linen trouser suits are a fine sporty option in a collection full
of young ideas.
	   Meanwhile, Jean-Paul Gaultier took a long, cool look at Japan
and did clothes from the geisha's tea ceremony, Japanese prints or
the Ginza - his own way. Fortunately, he left out the Sumo
wrestlers in this picturesque costume show.
	   Lots of drawstring blousons thrown casually around shoulders
topped lean skirts or pants, the inevitable platform shoes some
with white socks like Japanese schoolgirls wear.
	   Tank tops or ``Marcel'' t-shirts layered over with fishnet were
another look borrowed from Japanese fishermen. Kimono sleeves all
over the place, draped shoulders and even a corselet effect, more
Gaultier than Japanese style, paraded out in a show that sometimes
looked like a parody on 19th century prints by Hokusai.
	   Trompe l'oeil dresses printed to look like statues draped front
and back were another clever Gaultier trick.
	   Light voile coverups, a couple of obi sashes made into a
swimsuit, geisha-style girls in their printed robes added to the
many Japanese-inspired ideas for couture, probably destined for
copying - since Gaultier is always a design leader.
	   The finale was a flourish on her violin by famous Japanese
violinist Vanessa Mae, very pretty in her silk dress and big obi
bow.
	   At Celine the look was poetic seaside gear, in contrasting
fabrics, soft beach-washed colors. This second collection for the
upmarket house by American Michael Kors was a big success for its
rustic chic - not old, bourgeois Celine, but new and interesting.
	   When you've got a huge-weave cashmere sweater with turtleneck,
scarf wrap or hood over a dainty silk short skirt, embroidered in
ribbon curlicues in shades of seashell gray or blue, the look is
sensuous and appealing.
	   In watery hues of blue, green, silvery shell shades, the short
or long taffeta shifts with crystal-pearl decor scattered about
looked quite elegantly appealing.
	   In fact, this gear would look quite fabulous in Nantucket, fall
or spring. ``We had a gray, long fall,'' said Kors after the show,
``let's have a luminous spring.''

Taylor gives up record putting Pakistan in to bat

	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia declared before Mark Taylor
had a chance to resume world record chase, and Saeed Anwar and Ijaz
Ahmed responded with centuries to take Pakistan to 329 for two on
the third day of their second test.
	   The double-century second-wicket partnership between Anwar (126)
and Ahmed (125 not out) left Pakistan 270 runs short of Australia's
first innings of 599 for four.
	   Pakistan needed another 71 runs to avoid follow-on with eight
wickets in hand.
	   Earlier, Taylor decided the team's victory was more important
than personal glory and declared Australia's first innings before
it could resume at the crease, leaving him undefeated on 334.
	   It was only the 15th triple century in test cricket and matched
the best innings by an Australian set by Don Bradman in 1930.
	   ``For me victory in the series is more important on the
sub-continent,'' said Taylor, who remained 41 short of West Indian
Brian Lara's world record. Lara made 375 against England in 1994.
	   ``Lara's world record of 375 is not important for me. It's nice
to be bracketed with Sir Don Bradman.''
	   When Pakistan got its chance, it quickly tried to take
advantage.
	   Ahmad got his ninth test century and fourth against Australia
when he cut leg-spinner Stuart MacGill to point boundary for his
16th four of the innings.
	   Taylor took the second new ball late in the day, but Ahmad twice
lifted paceman Glenn McGrath to the mid-wicket boundary. He has so
far hit 20 fours in his 242 ball innings in 329 minutes.
	   Just like Pakistan bowlers, Australians found little assistance
from a a flat Arbab Niaz Stadium wicket with Pakistan scoring at a
healthy pace in the first two sessions.
	   Pakistan made 123 runs during the pre-lunch period and added
another 114 in the mid-session without further damage. Pakistan
went for tea at 237 for one.
	   Both batsmen were especially harsh on leg-spinner Stuart
MacGill, who conceded 89 runs off his 20 overs without any wickets.
	   Anwar struck his second successive century of the series in a
grand style, hitting Mark Waugh's gentle off-spin over mid-wicket
for a six.
	   The left-handed opener, who made 145 in Pakistan's loss by an
innings and 99 runs in the first test, hit 16 fours, with five
coming through the slips cordon early in the innings.
	   Off-spinner Collin Miller broke the stand when Anwar tried and
edged to wicketkeeper Ian Healy's gloves. Anwar's 126 contained 18
boundaries and three sixes, while he faced 226 balls during his 289
minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Taylor's decision at the beginning of the day earned praise from
former Australia test captain Allan Border.
	   ``It was a very bold decision,'' Border said. ``But still
whenever Bradman's name will be mentioned, Mark's (Taylor) innings
will also be discussed.''
	   ``Taylor is such a type of player for whom the team's victory is
above all and that he showed it today.''

World champion Camenzind wins Italian race to close season

 &UR; Eds: STANDS as 2nd Ld-Writethru to European points to UPDATE with
Camenzind's time, race distance, Edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERGAMO, Italy (AP) _ Capping a sensational week, world road
champion Oscar Camenzind overcame an early fall and Michael
Boogerd's challenge Saturday to capture the Tour of Lombardy, the
closing event of the international cycling season.
	   Camenzind, a Swiss cyclist with the Mapei commercial team,
covered the 253 kilometers (157 miles) into this northern town in 5
hours, 59 minutes, 1 second to beat Dutch champion Boogerd by six
seconds.
	   The triumphant day for the Swiss colors was completed by Nicola
Puttini's third-place finish and Pascal Richard's fifth place.
World Cup champion Michele Bartoli of Italy finished between the
two Swiss, in fourth. All were credited with the same time, 1:21
behind the winner.
	   Camenzind, who clinched the world title in Valkenburg,
Netherlands, last Sunday for his first season victory, scored his
solo triumph in the 92nd edition of the Italian classic by
launching a decisive attack on Boogerd 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles)
from the finish.
	   Boogerd had helped Camenzind flee from the pack and carry out a
successful 70-kilometer (45-mile) escape, but could not stay with
the world champion's pace in the final uphill stretch.
	   ``I pushed hard, I knew I was in good form, that I could win
today,'' said Camenzind, who had to overcome pain from a bruised
leg suffered in a spill in the initial part of the race.
	   Bartoli, who had already clinched the overall World Cup title
before Saturday's last race of the 10-round competition, tried to
catch up the leading duo in the closing kilometers (miles) but
failed to cut his gap under one minute.
	   ``Camenzind deserved victory. He proved the strongest cyclist in
the last month of activity,'' Bartoli said.
	   Saturday's race was the last one for Italian veteran Gianni
Bugno, who announced his retirement from professional cycling.
	   Bugno, 34, won two world titles and a Tour of Italy during his
13-year career.

U.S. diplomat named to head OSCE verification mission in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ American diplomat William Graham Walker
was named Saturday to head the newly created Kosovo verification
mission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
said.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
made the appointment the day after signing an agreement in Belgrade
that allows the planned 2,000-strong international monitoring force
to operate in Kosovo.
	   During 37 years in the U.S. Foreign Service, Walker served as
ambassador to El Salvador from 1985-88 and also held diplomatic
assignments in Bolivia, Honduras, Brazil, Japan and Peru.
	   Most recently, he served as special representative of the U.N.
secretary-general as head of the United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, in Croatia.
	   He holds the U.S. diplomatic rank of ambassador.
	   In his letter from Warsaw, Geremek wrote that the appointment
would offer Walker a ``unique opportunity to contribute to peace
and political stability in the Balkans.''
	   An advance team for the verification mission arrived in Belgrade
on Saturday and was due to head to Kosovo on Sunday to begin
arranging logistical details for the monitors.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said it's hoped that a
substantial number of the verifiers will be on the job in Kosovo by
the end of October.

Man U crushes Wimbledon 5-1; Arsenal held by last place
</HEADLINE>
Southampton &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United crushed Wimbledon 5-1 Saturday
to cut unbeaten Aston Villa's Premier League lead to four points
with a game in hand.
	   While Villa was held 0-0 at West Ham, Andy Cole scored twice at
Old Trafford and there were further strikes from Ryan Giggs, David
Beckham and Dwight Yorke as United made it 17 points from eight
games compared with Villa's 21 from nine.
	   The stunning result of the day was last place Southampton's 1-1
tie at defending titlist Arsenal.
	   French striker Nicolas Anelka fired the Gunners ahead at
Highbury but David Howells leveled for the Saints on an assist by
substitute Matt Le Tissier. It was only Southampton's second point
of the season and the winless toen points behind Villa and three behind United.
	   Liverpool remained well off the pace after a 0-0 tie with
Merseyside neighbor Everton at Goodison Park. The seventh place
team has now taken only three points from the last five games.
	   Even with Paul Gascoigne out of action while he undergoes
treatment for alcohol problems, Middlesbrough bounced back from a
goal down to beat struggling Blackburn 2-1 and move up to third
while Chelsea downed Charlton 2-1 to go fourth.
	   A penalty by Colombian striker Hamilton Ricard canceled out
Blackburn's strike by Tim Sherwood and Curtis Fleming added Boro's
winner in the final minute.
	   Uruguayan midfielder Gustavo Poyet netted Chelsea's winner at
Stamford Bridge after Eddie Youds' leveller for Charlton had
threatened an upset. Frank Leboeuf's penalty had given Chelsea the
lead.
	   Sixth place Newcastle held on for a 2-1 win over Derby with
early goals from Greek forward Nikolaos Dabizas and Scottish
international Stephen Glass. Jamaican World Cup player Deon Burton
replied for County.
	   Down to 10-men after defender Danny Granville had been sent off
in the 31st minute for second yellow card, Leeds went ahead through
Norwegian international Gunnar Halle at Nottingham Forest. But
Steve Stone netted a leveller for the home team five minutes from
the end in a 1-1 tie.
	   Coventry hosts Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday and Leicester
welcomes Tottenham on Monday.
	   Huddersfield strengthened its position on top of division one
after a 2-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers, which slipped to last
place in its first game under returning manager Gerry Francis.
	   Birmingham moved into second place by beating Port Vale but
Sunderland can regain that spot by winning at West Bromwich Albion
on Sunday.
	   Scottish Premier League leader Rangers scored a 3-0 victory over
Hearts with two strikes by Rod Wallace and one by Finnish forward
Jonatan Johansson.
	   Rangers remains two points clear of Kilmarnock, which won 2-0 at
Dundee United and St. Johnstone, a 5-0 winner over Motherwell,
jumped into third place ahead of defending champion which was held
2-2 by Dunfermline and now is seven points behind Rangers.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of rioters shut down a
large area of the nation's capital, setting cars on fire and
forcing shops to close to protest the shooting earlier Saturday of
a militant Sunni Muslim leader.
	   Gunmen in a car shot Maulana Mohammed Abdullah as he stepped
from the mosque in Apara district of Islamabad after saying his
afternoon prayers.
	   His death sparked demonstrations and cries for revenge by his
followers.
	   Police surrounded the area as mourners brought Abdullah's body
to the street where thousands of people said funeral prayers. Men
and boys clung to the sides and roofs of buses to follow his body
as supporters took it to a graveyard.
	   Abdullah belonged to the militant Sipah-e-Sahaba or Guardians of
the Friends of the Prophet, an extremist group that reviles Shiite
Muslims as non-Muslims.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the killing but police fear
it may have been rival Shiite Muslims. Abdullah's group,
Sipah-e-Sahaba often clashes with militant Shiite groups.
	   ``His death is a tremendous loss. . . he was shot in the back,''
said Tahiri Hussain Ali Tohidi, a cleric who helped to lead the
funeral prayers.
	   A police official said hundreds of rioters burned two government
vehicles and an oil tanker after the shooting. Witnesses said all
shops in the Apara neighborhood were shuttered and that the entire
area was in darkness.
	   Last month, four leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba were shot and killed
in another hit-and-run attack in Islamabad. Hundreds of people have
been killed in recent years in conflict between Sunni and Shiite
groups.
	   Sunni groups accuse neighboring Iran of helping the Shiite
extremists, while Shiite groups say Saudi Arabia is funding the
Sunni militant organizations. Both countries deny the charges.
	   Shiite Muslims comprise 15 percent of Sunni-dominated Pakistan.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.

Egyptian women's prison discovers inmate is a man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A female warder found nothing against the
rules when she strip-searched an inmate at a women's prison here.
	   But the inmate was in contravention. He was a man, a police
official said Saturday.
	   Ismail Mohammed Abdullah, 17, gave his name as Rascha, a woman's
name, when he was arrested with two friends on a charge of theft.
	   Police were fooled by his elaborate disguise, and so were fellow
inmates after Abdullah was transferred to a women's prison.
	   It was only when the warder searched Abdullah on Friday that she
found his breasts to be fake, the police official said.
	   His fellow cell mates said Abdullah's mannerisms and actions
were not those of a man, the official reported, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Abdullah told police he ``hates men'' and that he wants to have
a sex change operation.
	   The official said Abdullah is now in a police station, awaiting
transfer to a men's prison.

Russian parliament speaker praises Kosovo accord

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister said Saturday that other
countries were increasingly coming around to support Russia's
insistence on a negotiated settlement to the crisis in Kosovo, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was quoted as saying that ``the
more acute the situation in the Balkans, the more numerous our
partners who realize the need for our participation in the
settlement process in this region.''
	   ``Only a naive person can hope that a combat operation can solve
a problem that has not been solved for centuries,'' he said.
	   Russia staunchly opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia,
with which it shares common Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian
religion. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it might help Serbia
with weapons if NATO strikes.
	   NATO on Friday gave Yugoslavia more time to fulfill a peace
pledge and avoid airstrikes on separatist Kosovo. On Saturday, a
Yugoslav official said President Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw
his Serb-led forces in time to meet the new deadline.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of the lower house of parliament on
Saturday rejected a suggestion by ultranationalist leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky that Serbia, the leading republic in Yugoslavia, join
in an alliance with Russia and Belarus. Zhirinovsky made the
proposal on Wednesday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``It is outrageous to interfere in Yugoslavia's affairs and try
to pull out one of its republics,'' ITAR-Tass quoted parliamentary
speaker Gennady Seleznyov as saying. ``It is hard for a
sober-minded person to grasp this idea.''

O'Meara, Woods to meet in World Match Play final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Woods beating Westwood 5 and 4 for all U.S.
final &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Florida neighbors and friends
Mark O'Meara and Tiger Wood _ frequent practice partners _ will
play for real in Sunday's finals of the World Match Play
Championship.
	   O'Meara thrashed defending champion Vijay Singh 11 and 10 in the
semifinals Saturday and set a new record for the most lopsided win
in the 34-year-old tournament.
	   Woods rallied from being three holes down after seven to defeat
Lee Westwood 5 and 4 with Woods making a birdie on the 32nd hole
close out the 25-year-old Englishman.
	   The previous record for the biggest win was set in 1978 when Tom
Watson defeated Dale Hayes 11 and 9. On Friday, Singh was 11 up
after 21 holes against Patrik Sjoland but went on to advance 7 and
6.
	   It's the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat Al
Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year history
with the winner this time getting 170,000 pounds (dlrs 289,000).
	   ``I made some putts on the second 18 and that made the
difference,'' Woods said. ``I'm looking forward to playing Mark. It
will be fun and the crowds won't be as partisan, pro-British, as
they have been.''
	   O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine
birdies in his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6
meters), 12 (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters).
	   He was 11 up after getting a par on the 20th and went to 12 up
with another par on 21. Singh _ this year's U.S. PGA champion _
recovered to only 11 down with a birdie on the 22nd, but O'Meara
closed out the match when they halved the 26th with pars.
	   For 26 holes, O'Meara had nine birdies, all in the first 18.
Singh had trouble with his usually good iron game, and his short
game and putting wasn't much better.
	   ``It was just one of those days when everything went right for
Mark O'Meara. To beat Vijay Singh, who is a world-class player, 11
and 10. It was definitely my day.''
	   ``It was one of those rounds where I was in the zone,'' O'Meara
added. ``Sixty-three with a double-bogey is more than I could ask
for.''
	   O'Meara suggested the final would be another friendly match _
this time for more money.
	   ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara said. ``He (Woods) has been
playing pretty well at home. I think he took 30 bucks off me the
last time we played.''
	   ``I'm pretty smart,'' he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the
putting green afterwards and try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I
can usually win my money back on the putting green.''
	   Woods had to struggle. He was down by three holes after the
first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting. But he rallied as his
putting got better _ and Westwood's worsened was one ahead after
the first 18.
	   He went four up through 28 holes with a string of birdies,
getting two of them with 8-foot (2.5 meters) putts and one on the
28th with a 25-footer (8 meters).
	   He pushed the lead to five after 30 but two-putted from six feet
(2 meters) at the 31st for bogey before ending the match on the
32nd.
	   In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated Patrik Sjoland 7 and
6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, Westwood beat
three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated Ian
Woosnam 1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death
playoff.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ An American has been
charged with killing a German couple and paying three Dominicans to
bury their bodies in front of their home in this Caribbean country,
police said Saturday.
	   Peter and Barbara Herman were reported missing a month ago when
they did not make a planned trip to Germany, said police spokesman
Col. Simon Diaz. Their bodies were found buried in the sand in Juan
Dolio, a tourism-based town about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of
Santo Domingo.
	   Police have arrested an American, Dennis Manley, 46, and charged
him with murdering the two Germans. Investigators were led to
Manley after they questioned Martin de la Rosa Laureano, a
Dominican who worked for the victims, said Diaz.
	   De la Rosa told police he witnessed the killing and that Manley
paid him and two other men, brothers Socimo and Ramon Castro,
20,000 Dominican pesos (dlrs 1,300) each to bury the bodies.
	   ``Dennis Manley has not confessed to the crime, but according to
the statements by Martin de la Rosa Laureano, the American killed
the couple with a shot to the head,'' Diaz said.
	   Police are still unsure of a motive or date for the killings.
The hometowns of Manley and the Germans were not available from
police.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A mob of 2,000 villagers beat to death
four bandits who attacked their village Saturday, police said. Four
other bandits were seriously wounded.
	   Police said the robbers, led by a retired army major, attacked
Bankhali village and fired wildly into the air to frighten the
villagers into submission.
	   But the villagers waited until the attackers were out of
ammunition and then descended on them and punched and kicked them.
Four bandits, among them the former major, died on the spot, and
four others were seriously wounded, police said.
	   The village is 215 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of the
Bangladeshi capital Dhaka.

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna against Kucera
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kucera victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow
American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the
final of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP.
	   On Sunday, he'll seek his fourth title of the year and first
since Wimbledon against seventh-ranked Karol Kucera of Slovakia,
who defeated Britain's Greg Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Sampras needed an hour, 21 minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked
Martin.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game, when he hit
a crosscourt backhand past the onrushing Martin for a break that
put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tiebreak en
route to the victory.
	   ``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,''
said Sampras, who described his play Saturday as not spectacular
but ``solid.'' ``It all came down to the tiebreak.''
	   Sampras, involved in a close race with Patrick Rafter and
Marcelo Rios for the top ranking as the season enters its final
weeks, entered the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the
last moment as a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hannover, Germany.
	   ``This week certainly helps'' in that effort, said Sampras after
beating Martin. ``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a
reference to his early exit from the Swiss tournament.
	   The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals
by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runner-up to Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Kucera remained on track to nail down a spot in the eight-man
Hannover finale. In the first set, he trailed 4-1 and was facing
set point at 5-6 before coming back.
	   Rusedski double-faulted eight times.

Maradona says private drug testing would keep him clean on field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawyer's comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Diego Maradona used to undergo private drug
tests ahead of soccer matches to be sure he would not turn in
positive results if tested by the Italian League, the former Napoli
star said in an interview published Saturday.
	   Maradona was banned in 1991 for 15 months after testing positive
for cocaine while playing for Napoli. But the Italian news agency
ANSA reported Friday that the backup urine sample that led to the
suspension was conducted on a faulty machine.
	   The report, based on sources at the scandal-ridden Acqua Acetosa
drug-testing laboratory in Rome, alleged that the apparatus
erroneously indicated there were traces of cocaine in a clean urine
control sample run through in a check in 1991.
	   Maradona's lawyers have said they may pursue legal action.
	   ``If it is proven that there was an irregularity in the
anti-doping test that led to Maradona's suspension, we will ask for
a review of the judgement and we will pursue symbolic compensation
for damages,'' Maradona attorney Vincenzo Siniscalchi said. ``That
suspension was an injustice.''
	   In the interview with Naples newspaper Il Mattino, the player
said ``I have never denied'' using cocaine, ``but when I went on
the field I was clean.''
	   ``I knew for certain that I could not be discovered positive,
because before every game I would take private tests,'' the
newspaper quoted him as saying. ``If these allowed me to play
without any worry, without compromising my career or harming the
club, then I would go on the field. If the opposite were true, then
I stayed at home.''
	   He said that is why ``I have always had suspicions about the
testing done in Rome.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
the advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived in the
country Saturday, as efforts to ensure Yugoslavia pulls its forces
back advanced in the air and on the ground.
	   A day after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days
to fulfill a peace pledge, the Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels
accused each other of new shooting attacks. But there were signs
the government was gradually complying with international demands
aimed at ending the turmoil.
	   A Yugoslav official assured that security forces in the
secessionist province will withdraw in time to avoid threatened
airstrikes.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Empowered to verify such claims, NATO began an aerial
surveillance mission by sending U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a
clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights on Thursday as part
of the package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the
secessionist province of Serbia.
	   ``U-2s are indeed flying,'' a U.S. official told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity. ``They're definitely up in the air
and we're looking at the ground'' as part of the air surveillance
accord.
	   NATO and U.S. officials have declined to say where the flights
originate.
	   Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic to fully
comply was to expire Saturday morning, NATO extended it until Oct.
27. One reason was that the status of troop withdrawals and refugee
returns in Kosovo can't be fully attested to until the mostly
European force of 2,000 observers is in place.
	   An advance team of specialists for that mission arrived in
Belgrade on Saturday to begin planning for the monitors' arrival.
The 13 staffers were to be joined by about seven others by the time
they arrive in Pristina on Sunday.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' said delegation
member John Sandrock.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the 54-nation OSCE, said in
Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to have a sizable number of
monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days, but say the number remaining
exceeds the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina claimed that KLA
``extremists'' had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces
since late Friday, ranging from the southwest to the northeast of
the province. Machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades allegedly were
used to target Serb police, and at least two Serbs were reported
wounded.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in Vranjevac had opened fire, hitting
several Albanian houses and a car.
	   Reporters were unable to verify the conflicting claims.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   Humanitarian organizations have stepped up efforts to get aid to
the refugees before winter sets in.
	   In the town of Pagarusa, southwest of Pristina, the United
Nations delivered 160 tons of flour, oil and other food to refugees
from the area Saturday.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where Serbs comprise only
about 10 percent of the population, remain skeptical of Milosevic's
compliance. They also are reluctant to accept anything short of
independence for the province, while international officials urge a
lesser form of self-rule.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders reportedly were meeting Saturday in
Istanbul, Turkey, to smooth differences between different factions
and unite in their political demands.

Hundreds of Palestinians rally for prisoner releases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 400 Palestinians, some waving
large pictures of jailed family members, rallied Saturday for the
release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   A small group of demonstrators broke away and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, and the troops responded with a few rounds of tear gas
and rubber bullets. However, no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police dispersed the protesters.
	   It was the second day of unrest in or near Ramallah. On Friday,
Jewish settlers had blocked the West Bank's main north-south
highway outside the town, complaining that two of their security
officers were detained and roughed up by Palestinian police.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held Thursday but denied any ill treatment.
	   The prisoner-release rally coincided with a U.S. peace summit at
the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, at which Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank and Palestinian
security measures. Israel annexed the West Bank after seizing it
from Jordan in 1967.
	   One issue on the table at Wye is the release of 3,000
Palestinians held by Israel for security offenses. The Palestinian
official who has been trying to negotiate prisoner releases
accompanied Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the U.S. talks.
	   In other developments Saturday:
	   _Palestinians living near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, near
the northern West Bank city of Nablus, said about five settlers
rampaged through their olive groves, beating villagers. One
Palestinian was hit in the head with a farm tool and was taken to
the hospital for stitches, then released.
	   Itzhar settlers have a long history of clashes with Palestinians
living in surrounding villages. Three months ago, a pair of
settlers were shot dead in an ambush as they patrolled the
settlement's perimeter.
	   _About 250 demonstrators marched in Gaza City to demand the
release of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails. They
presented a letter at the United Nations office asking the U.N.
secretary-general to look into the question of detainees.
	   _ Police broke up a demonstration of several dozen
ultra-Orthodox Jews as they attempted to block off a downtown
Jerusalem street. The demonstrators, who threw glass bottles and
stones towards the policemen, were protesting the presence of a
restaurant on the street that remains open on the Jewish sabbath,
Israel Radio reported. There were no injuries.

U.S. diplomat named to head OSCE verification mission in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ American diplomat William Graham Walker
was named Saturday to head the newly created Kosovo verification
mission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
said.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
made the appointment the day after signing an agreement in Belgrade
that allows the planned 2,000-strong international monitoring force
to operate in Kosovo.
	   During 37 years in the U.S. Foreign Service, Walker served as
ambassador to El Salvador from 1985-88 and also held diplomatic
assignments in Bolivia, Honduras, Brazil, Japan and Peru.
	   Most recently, he served as special representative of the U.N.
secretary-general as head of the United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, in Croatia.
	   He holds the U.S. diplomatic rank of ambassador.
	   In his letter from Warsaw, Geremek wrote that the appointment
would offer Walker a ``unique opportunity to contribute to peace
and political stability in the Balkans.''
	   An advance team for the verification mission arrived in Belgrade
on Saturday and was due to head to Kosovo on Sunday to begin
arranging logistical details for the monitors.
	   OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said it's hoped that a
substantial number of the verifiers will be on the job in Kosovo by
the end of October.

Ex-Communist starts talks on forming Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Vatican newspaper critical of D'Alema, Communist march;
EDITS to trim &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who now leads
Italy's largest leftist party, said Saturday first talks with
potential coalition partners, including hard-line Communists,
indicated he might succeed in forming a new government.
	   Italy's political situation these days is so volatile that
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Friday stopped short of formally
asking D'Alema to try to form of government. Instead, the head of
state said he was giving D'Alema the ``pre-task'' of testing the
waters to see if there was enough consensus to actually try to put
together a coalition.
	   D'Alema consulted on Saturday with leaders of parties which
could join forces in a new center-left coalition, including his own
Democratic Left party, a group of breakway Communists and a third
potential ally, a movement of ex-Christian Democrats led by former
President Francesco Cossiga.
	   D'Alema's party was the major partner in Romano Prodi's 2 1-2
year-old coalition which collapsed Oct. 9 after losing a confidence
vote in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   ``I see that there are the conditions to go ahead'' with talks,
D'Alema said.
	   Said Armando Cossutta, who leads a breakaway faction of
Communists: ``We have expressed to our comrade Massimo D'Alema our
willingness and our commitment toward ... the success of his
government.''
	   Cossutta broke away from the No. 1 Communist leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, whose refused to back Prodi in the confidence vote
because he wanted more funds for job creation. Bertinotti's
followers marched through Rome Saturday to demand more jobs.
	   D'Alema called the situation ``complex'' because his potential
coalition partners ``have had difference experiences and will keep
different visions on the evolution of the Italian political and
democratic system.''
	   D'Alema, a pragmatist who, earlier this decade, helped transform
the West's largest Communist party into the current, more moderate
Democratic Left, invited all three main forces to sit down together
to work out ``a sufficiently solid political and policy base.''
	   Scalfaro turned to D'Alema after Prodi, now serving as caretaker
premier, failed to forge a consensus on a fresh start for his
center-left coalition.
	   D'Alema was scheduled to report back to Scalfaro on Monday
evening.
	   Cossiga's supporters originally were loyal to opposition leader
Silvio Berlusconi, media mogul and ex-premier, but Cossiga has
indicated he might throw support to a center-left government.
	   Early elections, demanded by Berluscoi, are considered unlikely.
Elections are not held during the last six months of the head of
state's term, and that period for Scalfaro begins in January.
	   The Vatican appeared unhappy over Scalfaro's turning to D'Alema.
	   Referring to the now defunct Soviet-Western blocs, Vatican
newspaper L'Osservatore Romano cited that ``hard-fought victory of
liberty and democracy over communism'' and noted that Scalfaro
chose a man ``from the apparatus of the former Italian Communist
Party'' who used to edit the party's daily.

Fifteen laborers feared buried in landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ At least 15 laborers were feared buried
alive in a landslide triggered by heavy rains in northern India,
domestic news agencies reported Saturday.
	   The laborers worked under contract for the government's Border
Roads Organization and were building roads in the Himalayan
mountains, the Press Trust of India said.
	   Rescuers still had not recovered the bodies from beneath the mud
and stones. Snowfall in the area hampered workers from clearing the
landslides, PTI said.
	   Several thousand pilgrims were also stranded in the mountains
because of landslides in the area.

No autobahn speed limit, incoming German government says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agreement on energy taxes, edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The newly elected Social Democrats and
Greens shelved plans for speed limits on the autobahn and agreed on
higher energy taxes Saturday, settling two of the most contentious
issues as they wrapped up a deal for a new center-left government.
	   ``We're done,'' said Social Democratic party chairman Oskar
Lafontaine. The coalition partners plan a final round of talks on
Monday to settle Cabinet posts before signing the coalition
agreement on Tuesday.
	   The pact still must be approved by both parties at upcoming
conventions before Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is sworn in
Oct. 27.
	   The final deal hews closer to the platform of the dominant
Social Democrats than the sometimes far-out demands of the small,
ecology-minded Greens. But the Greens weren't complaining.
	   ``A party platform and coalition negotiations are two different
things,'' said Greens negotiator Baerbel Hoehn. ``The decisive
thing was to get something going.''
	   The Greens had been seeking a 100 kph (60 mph) speed limit on
Germany's famously unrestricted superhighways, but the coalition
deal says only that municipalities will be granted more leeway to
reduce speeds on city streets.
	   Both sides, however, said the issue of autobahn speed limits was
not dead. ``I'm optimistic that we're going to have a European
solution,'' Greens leader Gunda Roestel said, referring to
proposals for eventual common traffic rules throughout the European
Union.
	   After days of haggling over a so-called ``ecological tax
reform,'' they also agreed to raise taxes on gas, heating oil and
electricity in three phases.
	   The first hike, to take effect Jan. 1, includes 6 pfennigs (4
cents) a liter more on gasoline _ far less than the Greens wanted.
	   Party leaders said the next two phases had yet to be determined.
	   Social Democratic chairman Oskar Lafontaine, the designated
finance minister, said the first stage would raise 12 billion marks
(dlrs 7.5 billion), money that will be used to lower payments
employers and employees make for social security benefits _ and
hopefully spur job creation.
	   The new government has set fighting unemployment, currently
stuck above 10 percent, as its No. 1 priority.
	   Lafontaine insisted the plan was not a tax increase, but a
restructuring that would add 300 marks (dlrs 190) a year to the
average wage-earner's paycheck.
	   ``This means that every citizen can then decide to pocket the
money by saving energy or to spend it by consuming as before,'' he
said.
	   Energy-intensive industries, such as steel mills and carmakers,
would be exempted from the first tax hike while Germany seeks to
even out energy costs throughout the European Union, he said.
	   In a partial win for the Greens, the partners also cast serious
doubt on whether a proposed magnetic-levitation train line between
Hamburg and Berlin will ever be built.
	   While agreeing to honor contracts already signed, they said the
federal government would not pay for any cost overruns.
	   The train's backers admitted Thursday that the stretch would
probably cost up to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more than
the 6.1 billion marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned.
	   The Greens oppose the Transrapid project as wasteful and
potentially dangerous to the environment and animal life.
	   ``Transrapid is not over,'' said Franz Muentefering, a Social
Democrat proposed as the next transportation minister. ``But
financing for Hamburg-Berlin looks difficult.''
	   Party leaders were to detail the planned social welfare policies
_ and how to pay for them _ on Sunday.
	   Schroeder promised before winning the Sept. 27 election that he
would rescind planned cuts in social security that were passed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens also want to boost aid for the
elderly and long-time unemployed.

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that Pinochet at London Clinic, adds
quotation from warrant &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
is rumored to be. Official at the clinic refused to comment.
	   In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''
	   The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez, demanded ``that steps be taken to allow an early end of
this situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not recognize
the authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,
applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastly
dictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is one
of the great murderers of this century.''
	   Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,
which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British
government was ``under obligation to take legal action'' against
him.
	   It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,
who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he
reportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker and
hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another
judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   The extradition warrant alleges that ``between the 11th
September 1973 and 31st December 1983 within the jurisdiction of
the 5th Central Magistrates Court of the National Court of Madrid
he did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of
the government of Spain.''
	   Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected
President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March when he was
sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in a
constitution drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 political
opponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted
for after being detained by his security agents.

Basler, Jancker heros as Bayern Munich wins again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German internationals Mario Basler and Carsten
Jancker scored Saturday as Bayern Munich extended its unbeaten run
in the Bundesliga to 17 matches with a 3-1 victory against Schalke.
	   Basler curled a free kick over the wall of defenders in the 14th
minute, while Jancker added the third goal on a counter in the 64th
against an injury-weakened Schalke side missing six starters.
	   Defender Yves Eigenrauch stunned his teammates and the crowd of
62,000 at Parkstadium with an own goal just 180 seconds into the
match as Schalke's struggles continued this season.
	   Schalke, a big name in the UEFA Cup in recent years, slid into
13th place as a result of its woeful offense, which has coughed up
just six goals in eight matches.
	   When the tall Dutch striker Rene Eijkelkamp scored in the 20th
minute, it snapped a 458 minute scoreless drought for the side.
	   ``It's extremely disappointing. We took a step forward today,
but again didn't pick up a point,'' said Schalke coach Huub
Stevens.
	   Although Munich has blazed to seven wins and a draw to open the
season, the 13-time Bundesliga champions were outplayed by Schalke
during long stretches of the contest.
	   But the veteran Munich players were ice cold in converting their
scoring chances, while Schalke's problems with finding the net cost
them the match.
	   The victory moved Bayern three points clear again of crosstown
rival 1860 Munich in the table.
	   Bayer Leverkusen roared back from two goals down against
Eintracht Frankfurt to pull out a 3-2 win on reserve Thomas
Reichenberger's shot with five minutes to play.
	   The win kept Leverkusen in third place along with Hamburger SV,
which blasted MSV Duisburg 4-1. Two other UEFA Cup aspirants,
Berlin and Stuttgart, played to a 0-0 draw.
	   SC Freiburg also beat Bremen 3-2 and FC Nuremberg shut out
Moenchengladbach 2-0. On Friday, 1860 beat Bochum 2-1 and
Kaiserslautern's winless streak reached seven matches in a 1-1 draw
against Wolfsburg.
	   Frankfurt stunned Leverkusen with an elegant first half
performance, making the visitors appear clumsy, and seized a 2-0
lead on Chinese striker Chen Yang's goal in the 23rd minute and
Alexander Schur five minutes later.
	   ``We played soccer of the finest art in the first half and did
everything we set out to do. It's hard to understand the outcome,''
said Frankfurt coach Horst Ehrmantraut.
	   But Frankfurt ran out of steam in the second half against one of
the Bundesliga title favorites. Ulf Kirsten scored in the 53rd and
Nico Kovac in the 75th, setting the stage for Reichenberger's
gamewinner.
	   Brazil's Ailton, the most expensive player in the club's
history, scored in his debut for struggling Bremen but the last
place team again failed to claim a second season victory.
	   Freiburg defenders Stefan Mueller and Torben Hoffman scored on
headers against while Marco Weisshaupt built the lead to 3-0
shortly before the half.
	   Ailton struck from short distance just before the break and
Yugoslavian teammate Rade Bogdanovic added his second goal in the
69th minute.
	   The two new players left Bremen hopeful its offensive problems
may be solved, but the team's defense has also yielded nine goals
at home this season.
	   Russian striker Sergei Kiryakov, set up by Anthony Yeboah,
scored a hat trick as Hamburg blasted Duisburg.
	   Macedonia's Sasa Ciric scored both goals as Nuremberg beat
Moenchengladbach, dropping the one-time Bundesliga powerhouse into
17th place.
	   Moenchengladbach coach Friedel Rausch has threatened to clean
house and unload numerous players.
	   ``We've got players that have no character. Some of these guys
have survived five or six coaches, but they're not going to survive
me,'' Rausch said.

Alenichev, Totti rally Roma past unbeaten Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Roma coach quote. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dmitri Alenichev and Francesco Totti scored
short-range goals in the final five minutes Saturday as nine-man AS
Roma rallied to shock previously undefeated Italian League leader
Fiorentina 2-1.
	   Fiorentina led 1-0 from the 31st minute on Argentine star
Gabriel Batistuta's league-high sixth goal of the season, and
looked set to pocket another win after Roma had midfielder Luigi Di
Biagio and French defender Vincent Candela sent off in separate
incidents in the second half.
	   But Alenichev, a Russian midfielder, tapped in the equalizer in
the 89th off Argentine striker Gustavo Bartelt's assist. And Totti,
fresh off his national team debut last weekend, capped the comeback
by driving home a rebound after a Bartelt shot in the fourth minute
of injury time before 70,000 at Olympic Stadium.
	   ``What character. My players believed they could win right down
to the end,'' said Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who put both Alenichev
and Bartelt on the field in the second half. ``This is not a game I
won with the right substiutions. It was the players that grabbed
this victory. ... Our roster is full and talented.''

Davenport, Williams advance to all-American final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Williams victory. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams
each cast aside their semifinal opponents in straight sets
Saturday, setting up an all-American championship match for the
dlrs 1 million European Championships.
	   Defending champion Davenport routed Romania's Irina Spirlea 6-2,
6-3 while Williams dampened the 31st birthday of fourth-seeded
Frenchwoman Nathalie Tauziat 6-3, 6-4.
	   Winner of five titles this season including the U.S. Open,
Davenport's journey to the final was untroubled having reached the
final without dropping a set.
	   The 22-year-old American disposed of the Romanian in just 58
minutes to extend her winning streak to 16 consecutive victories in
Switzerland.
	   ``I played one of my best matches of the week,'' said Davenport,
who ascended to the top of the WTA Tour rankings on Monday. ``It's
been very exciting to be No. 1 and it's really pushed me to play
well and defend my title.''
	   Relatively unchallenged, Davenport began bu breaking Spirlea to
lead 3-1, then again at 5-2 to win the first set.
	   In the second, Sprilea managed to break the American's serve to
lead 1-0, but a dominant Davenport responded with a break to even
the set.
	   The American then broke again for a 3-1 lead, which Spirlea was
unable to make up.
	   Williams was just as clinical in her elimination of Tauziat.
	   The 18-year-old American led jumped ahead 4-1 and held her serve
to take the set.
	   Tauziat tripped up Williams at the start of the next set,
breaking the American's second serve then holding to take a 4-1
advantage.
	   But the American teen's powerful strokes overwhelmed Tauziat and
Williams won the next five games to lock up her berth in the final.
	   ``Nathalie played well, attacking, trying to take every point
away,'' said Williams, who has three career titles. ``In the first
set I played very solid but in the second my first serve was
letting me down, leaving me vulnerable. So I had to improve.''
	   When the two Americans met last year in Zurich, Davenport
soundly beat her younger compatriot 6-0, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
Since then two have met four times with Davenport winning three.
	   Williams defeated Davenport in the semifinals in Oklahoma City
earlier this year. Davenport's most recent win over Williams was in
the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
	   Both acknowledge the showdown will likely be tight.
	   ``If I didn't feel I could win, I should default right now,''
said Williams, who served a record-breaking 205 kph (127 mph) ace
on Friday. ``But I'm a smarter player now. My serve is more
consistent and I'm older, more experienced.
	   ``Last year I didn't play as many tournaments, didn't know
exactly what to do at any point in time,'' Williams said. ``As I
look back I wonder exactly how I won the matches I did.''
	   While Davenport's new status has boosted her confidence, she is
aware of the threat her younger compatriot poses.
	   ``I'm going to try and overpower her if I can,'' Davenport said.
``It'll be important to serve well and not let her get a chance to
attack my second serve.
	   ``I'll also have to return well as she's obviously serving very
hard right now.''
	   Regardless of Sunday's outcome, Davenport will hang on to her
No. 1 ranking with Hingis out due to a strained ankle this week.
	   Davenport holds a 396-point lead over Hingis, and plans to play
in Moscow, Philadelphia and New York in order to collect enough
points to remain the world's top player at the end of the season.
	   ``At first I was just happy to become world No.1 for the first
time of my career,'' said Davenport. ``But now my goal is to finish
the year as one.
	   ``And I think that is definitely attainable.''

Caribbean Community Bureau to discuss regional issues Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Topics will range from the devastation
of Hurricane Georges to the attempted split of St. Kitts and Nevis
to the millennium computer bug when the Caribbean Community Bureau
meets Wednesday.
	   The bureau, which handles the affairs of the Caribbean Community
regional organization, will meet Wednesday in Grenada, the Caricom
Secretariat said Saturday.
	   The recovery from Hurricane Georges remains the top priority for
several member states, including Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti and St.
Kitts and Nevis.
	   ``Relief efforts are underway and the bureau is expected to
receive a status report on both the damage inflicted and the
further needs of the affected states,'' said spokesman Leonard
Robinson.
	   The bureau will also receive a report from former Barbados
attorney general Maurice King, who was appointed to help mediate
political tensions in Guyana, where occasionally violent
demonstrations have erupted several times since elections late last
year.
	   Another long-standing issue of concern is the effort by tiny
Nevis to secede from its federation with St. Kitts. The Nevis
government failed to win public support for the secession in an
August 10 referendum.
	   Potential problems from the year 2000 computer bug and the
integration of Haiti as a full member in the organization of mostly
English-speaking nations will also be on the agenda, said Robinson.

	   Details of English Premier League games:
 &UR; Arsenal 1, Southampton 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Arsenal went ahead in the 34th minute with Nicolas Anelka's low
shot from a Dennis Bergkamp pass. But Saints gained a point through
David Howells from a pass by substitute Matt Le Tissier in the 67th
minute.
 &UR; Chelsea 2, Charlton 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Frank Leboeuf fired Chelsea ahead with an 18th minute penalty
after a foul on Pierluigi Casiraghi by Charlton goalkeeper Sasa
Ilic. Australian-born Ilic, who is bidding to get on Yugoslavia's
national team, was carried off with a head injury just before half
time after a collision with Casiraghi. The visitor leveled in the
58th minute with a left-foot shot from defender Eddie Youds. But
Gustavo Poyet headed home a corner by Dennis Wise for Chelsea's
winner three minutes from the end.
 &UR; Everton 0, Liverpool 0 &QC; 
	   The 159th meeting of these Merseyside neighbors ended in
stalemate despite lots of commitment which led to seven yellow
cards. Liverpool's Robbie Fowler missed a string of chances and
co-striker Michael Owen was furious that his team-mate didn't
deliver a pass when he was in a better scoring position.
 &UR; Manchester United 5, Wimbledon 1 (2-1) &QC; 
	   Some 55,000 fans saw Andy Cole fire home David Beckham's pass
for the first in the 19th minute but Jason Euell leveled six
minutes before halftime with a close range toe-poke. Seconds before
the interval, Ryan Giggs headed in a cross by Jesper Blomqvist and
Beckham made it 3-1 with a 25-meter shot three minutes after the
break. Dwight Yorke scored his sixth goal in nine games after
beating two Wimbledon defenders in the 52nd minute and Cole added
the fifth two minutes from the end.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 2, Blackburn 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Tim Sherwood headed home Damien Duff's corner to give Rovers the
lead in the 56th minute. Boro leveled eight minutes from the end
with a Hamilton Ricard penalty after the Colombian had been pulled
down by Darren Peacock. Curtis Fleming, out of action since August
with a groin injury, fired home the winner in the final minute
after Gianluca Festa's shot had been deflected into his path.
 &UR; Newcastle 2, Derby 1 (2-0) &QC; 
	   Peruvian midfielder Nolberto Solano set up both Newcastle goals.
His 13th minute cross was headed home by Nikolaos Dabizas and, four
minutes later, his provided a crossfield pass for Stephen Glass to
score the second. Solona squandered three good chances to score
himself while Derby gave Newcastle a late scare when Jamaican World
Cup player Deon Burton scrambled the ball home in the 73rd minute
after Costa Rican forward Paolo Wanchope had headed on Lee
Carsley's free kick.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 1, Leeds 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Leeds defender Danny Granville was sent off after only 31
minutes for a second yellow card but 10-man Leeds went ahead 20
minutes later through Gunnar Halle's header from a cross by
Austrian international Martin Hiden. Forest grabbed a point when
Steve Stone headed in a cross by French midfielder Thierry Bonalair
five minutes from the end.
 &UR; West Ham 0, Aston Villa 0
	   Welsh international striker John Hartson and Israeli forward
Eyal Berkovic were back on the Hammers team for the first time
since their violent training ground clash. But it was Villa who had
the better chances with Paul Merson, six meters from an open goal,
hesitating and giving Hammers goalkeeper Shaka Hislop time to
recover from an earlier save and tip the ball round the post.

Former Olympic chief Pescante meets with prosecutors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Maradona-Drugs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors questioned former Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) president Mario Pescante for two hours Saturday in
connection with an ongoing probe into irregularities at the
country's drug-testing laboratory.
	   Five former employees of the Acqua Acetosa lab, which was shut
earlier this month at the International Olympic Committee's behest,
are being investigated for abuse of office and concealment of
evidence.
	   Drug tests of soccer players were not carried out fully,
documentation was not kept and some positive tests were reportedly
covered up.
	   The scandal led to Pescante's resignation, and he spoke to Rome
prosecutors as ``a person informed about the facts.''
	   Also Saturday, Ugo Longo, who quit as CONI's chief anti-doping
investigator last week, handed prosecutors evidence he gathered
during his own inquiry over the summer.

Feminist Austrian author awarded Germany's highest literary prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) _ The controversial Austrian author and
playwright Elfriede Jelinek, whose writings focus on sexuality,
violence and power plays between the sexes, was awarded Germany's
highest literary honor Saturday.
	   The 51-year-old feminist writer was presented with the
60,000-mark (dlrs 37,500) Georg Buechner Prize at a ceremony in
Darmstadt.
	   She had a bestseller in 1989 with ``Lust,'' which she has
described as portraying ``the violence by the man against the
woman'' in a conventional marriage.

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna against Kucera
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of Kucera match, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Closing in on his first title since
Wimbledon, top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow American Todd
Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the final of the dlrs
800,000 CA Trophy tennis tournament.
	   On Sunday, he seeks his fourth title of the year against
seventh-ranked Karol Kucera of Slovakia, who defeated Britain's
Greg Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Sampras described his play against the 29th-ranked Martin as
unspectacular but solid.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game when he hit a
crosscourt backhand return past the onrushing Martin for a break
that put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tiebreak en
route to the victory.
	   ``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,''
said Sampras. ``It all came down to the tiebreak.''
	   Sampras, in a close race with Patrick Rafter and Marcelo Rios
for the top ranking as the season enters its final weeks, entered
the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the last moment as
a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   ``This week certainly helps'' in that quest, said Sampras after
beating Martin. ``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a
reference to his early exit from a Swiss tournament.
	   His biggest challenger for the top ranking, No. 2 Rafter, was
eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals by Rusedski.
	   Kucera called his victory ``a pretty big step'' toward nailing
down a spot in the eight-man Hanover finale.
	   ``This has been the greatest year for me,'' said the 24-year-old
Slovak, who began the year ranked 24th in the world. ``It was more
than I expected.''
	   On Saturday, he rallied in the first set after being down 1-4
and facing a set point at 5-6 before coming back to take the set.
Then at match point on Rusedski's serve, he hit a backhand return
winner.
	   ``The key today was that I won a lot of points from the baseline
and returned well,'' he said.
	   He said that in order to beat Sampras, ``I have to be better
than him from the baseline, and try to hold my serve.''
	   Rusedski, last year's runnerup in Vienna to Goran Ivanisevic,
double-faulted eight times Saturday.

Seleznyov: Lower house may consider impeachment motion in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament may vote next month
on a motion to impeach President Boris Yeltsin, the chamber's
speaker said Saturday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, said that the
motion would be based on three allegations: that Yeltsin was
responsible for the unsuccessful, 1994-96 war in Chechnya, that he
instigated the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and that he
illegally ordered troops and tanks to attack hard-liners holed up
in the former parliament in October 1993.
	   The impeachment campaign by the Communist-led opposition began
long before the current economic crisis in Russia. It appears
likely to fail, as have several previous efforts, in part because
the constitution gives Yeltsin the upper hand in dealing with
parliament.
	   Seleznyov said he would push for speedy adoption of a law giving
former presidents legal immunity and a seat in the upper house of
parliament, the Federation Council, for 10 years. He also said he
would favor Yeltsin's voluntary resignation ``in connection with
his health problems,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Seleznyov confirmed Saturday that he intends to run for
president in the next elections, which are scheduled for 2000.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
is rumored to be. Official at the clinic refused to comment.
	   In a statement issued in Oporto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero-American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''

O'Meara and Woods to meet in World Match Play final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS Woods quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara will
play a little friendly round of golf Sunday _ as they often do. But
this time there'll be more than a few dollars at stake.
	   The two Florida neighbors reached the finals of the
170,000-pound (dlrs 290,000) World Match Play Championship as Woods
won his Saturday semifinal 5 and 4 over Lee Westwood and O'Meara
crushed defending champion _ and U.S. PGA champion Vijay Singh _ by
a record 11 and 10.
	   It's the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat Al
Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year history.
	   ``This is definitely a great final,'' Woods said. ``No doubt
about it. It will be fun playing against one of my best friends,
someone I consider like an older brother, I'll be happy if he wins
and he'll be happy if I win.''
	   Woods said they've never played together in the final of a
match-play event or as the last twosome on the final day of a
stroke-play tournament.
	   ``Playing head-to-head, we don't get that chance very often
where we're in the same tournament and just happen to play well at
the same time.''
	   O'Meara, who broke the old tournament record set in 1978 when
Tom Watson beat Dale Hayes 11 and 9, suggested it'll just be
another round of golf with Tiger _ but for more cash.
	   ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara said. ``He (Woods) has been
playing pretty well at home. I think he took 30 bucks off me the
last time we played.''
	   ``I'm pretty smart,'' he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the
putting green afterwards and try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I
can usually win my money back on the putting green.''
	   Unlike O'Meara, Woods struggled early with the windy, wet West
course (7,006 yards) at Wentworth _ and the nagging flu bug and a
partisan 12,000 crowd cheering on the 25-year-old Englishman.
	   He was down by three holes after the first seven as Westwood
putted well. But he rallied as his putting got better and
Westwood's turned sour to lead by one after 18. And he never looked
back.
	   Woods went four up through 28 holes with a string of birdies,
getting two with 8-foot (2.5 meters) putts and one on the 28th with
a 25-footer (8 meters).
	   He pushed the lead to five after 30, two-putted from six feet (2
meters) at the 31st for bogey before ending the match on the 32nd
with a birdie _ his seventh one-putt green in the last eight holes.
	   ``I just had one of those days when the putter felt like a fish
in my hands,'' said Westwood, who has a chance this season to
dethrone Colin Montgomerie as Europe's leading money winner.
	   ``The final should be interesting,'' Westwood added. ``I know
they're friendly, but they'll probably have the daggers out for
each other tomorrow (Sunday).''
	   O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine
birdies in his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6
meters), 12 (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters).
	   He was 11 up after a par on the 20th and went to 12 with another
par on 21. Singh recovered to only 11 down with a birdie on the
22nd, but O'Meara closed out the match when they halved the 26th
with pars.
	   On Friday, Singh was 11 up after 21 holes against Patrik Sjoland
but went on to advance 7 and 6.
	   ``It was just one of those days when everything went right for
Mark O'Meara. To beat Vijay Singh, who is a world-class player, 11
and 10. It was definitely my day.''
	   ``It was one of those rounds where I was in the zone,'' O'Meara
added. ``Sixty-three with a double-bogey is more than I could ask
for.''

Japan's foreign minister talks with Russia on World War II treaty

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian and Japanese foreign ministers on
Saturday resumed negotiations over a decades-old territorial
dispute that has prevented them from concluding a World War II
peace treaty, and the Japanese minister promised to continue
disbursing an existing loan to Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has pledged that a treaty will be signed
by 2000, but first Russia and Japan must come to an accord over the
Kuril Islands, which the Soviet Union seized from Japan at the end
of the war.
	   The dispute over the islands off Russia's Pacific coast ``should
be settled without damaging Russia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters
after meeting with his Japanese counterpart Masahiko Komura.
	   Ivanov said that many points in the peace treaty had already
been agreed on or were ``in an advanced stage,'' the Interfax news
agency reported. He was quoted as saying that ``the territorial
question was obviously discussed as an integral part of a peace
treaty,'' and denied that there had been any talk of Russia's
``trading'' territory in return for Japanese economic aid.
	   The two foreign ministers agreed on a date for a summit between
Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, to be held Nov.
10-13. It will be the first visit by a Japanese premier to the
Russian capital in 25 years, Interfax said.
	   Russia's chief of staff is due to visit Japan next month, and
Russian and Japanese police officials will meet in Moscow in
December, Ivanov said. He said that Russia supported a Japanese
initiative to hold a six-nation conference on a settlement on
Korea, which would include representatives from both North and
South Korea.
	   Komura also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who expressed gratitude to Japan for its support of Russia's
economic reforms, and accepted an invitation to visit Japan. The
two also discussed the long-delayed peace treaty.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in Russo-Japanese
relations.
	   Moscow insists a decision on the Kurils must not threaten its
national interests. Japan has been cautious about investment and
economic cooperation with Russia because of lack of movement in the
dispute.
	   However, Komura did discuss joint automobile assembly and power
engineering projects with First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov on Saturday, Interfax said. He also said that Japan would
``regularly carry out payments'' of the dlrs 1.5 billion loan
granted to Russia by the Japanese Export-Import Bank, Komura's
press spokesman Masaki Okada said, according to Interfax. The bank
is ready to disburse dlrs 600 million this year, he said.
	   ``This was a very good meeting devoted to bilateral economic
cooperation. It was a meeting where we understood each other,''
Komura was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Okada said Saturday he was surprised that Russia's parliament
had voted Thursday to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of
Japan in World War II, Interfax said. The holiday had been dropped
after the 1991 Soviet collapse. The measure requires Yeltsin's
signature to become law.
	   Also Saturday, Japan delivered more than dlrs 500,000 in medical
aid to Russia's Sakhalin island, and said it would supply small
generators, flashlights and candles for a town on one of the Kuril
Islands without electricity because of fires, ITAR-Tass reported.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
the advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived in the
country Saturday, intensifying efforts to ensure that Yugoslavia
removes its forces from the secessionist Serbian province.
	   A day after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days
to fulfill a peace pledge, Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels accused
each other of new shooting attacks. But there were signs the
government was gradually complying with international demands aimed
at ending the turmoil.
	   A Yugoslav official gave assurances that security forces in
Kosovo will withdraw in time to avoid threatened airstrikes.
	   ``I am convinced that our leader has been pulling his troops out
of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London,
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Empowered to verify such claims, NATO began an aerial
surveillance mission by sending U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a
clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights on Thursday as part
of the package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in
Kosovo in southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   ``U-2s are indeed flying,'' a U.S. official told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity. ``They're definitely up in the air
and we're looking at the ground'' as part of the air surveillance
accord.
	   NATO and U.S. officials have declined to say where the flights
originate.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces, who consider Kosovo their
historic heartland, and ethnic Albanians seeking to secede from
Serbia. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
been displaced from their homes there.
	   Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic's full
compliance was to expire Saturday morning, NATO extended it until
Oct. 27. One reason was that the status of troop withdrawals and
refugee returns in Kosovo can't be fully determined until the
mostly European force of 2,000 observers is in place.
	   An advance team of specialists for that mission arrived in
Belgrade on Saturday to begin planning for the monitors' arrival.
The 13 staffers were to be joined by about seven others by the time
they arrive in Pristina on Sunday.
	   ``We are here to do some of the preparatory work that will
hopefully facilitate the activation of the verification mission,
which we hope to have here as soon as possible,'' said delegation
member John Sandrock.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the 54-nation OSCE, said in
Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to have a large number of
monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported large pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number still remaining
in Kosovo exceeds the level required by the agreement reached by
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina, the provincial capital,
claimed that KLA ``extremists'' had staged more than a dozen
attacks on Serb forces since late Friday. Machine-gun fire, mortars
and grenades allegedly were used to target Serb police, and at
least two Serbs were reported wounded.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in Vranjevac, a suburb of Pristina, had
opened fire and hit several Albanian houses and a car.
	   Reporters were unable to verify the conflicting claims.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   Humanitarian organizations have stepped up efforts to get aid to
the refugees before winter sets in. In the town of Pagarusa,
southwest of Pristina, the United Nations delivered 160 tons of
flour, oil and other food to refugees from the area Saturday.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where Serbs comprise only
about 10 percent of the population, remain skeptical of Milosevic's
compliance. They also are reluctant to accept anything short of
independence for the province, while international officials urge a
lesser form of self-rule.

	   SPEYER, Germany (AP) _ Germany's army bid farewell to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Saturday night with a torchlit military ceremony
honoring the man who peacefully reunited the nation.
	   Kohl, voted out of office last month, was the first chancellor
to be invited for a Grand Taps ceremony, the army's highest
ceremonial honor.
	   In a speech before an estimated 17,000 spectators, the outgoing
leader looked back sentimentally on the end of the Cold War and his
greatest success _ German unification in 1990 _ but also expressed
horror at continuing war in the Balkans.
	   ``This is a moving moment for me,'' Kohl said. Standing after
the speech in a heavy rain without an umbrella, he seemed to
struggle for composure as he watched the hour-long pageantry of
marching and music that dates back to the 17th century.
	   Audience members were moved as well. ``I feel rather
melancholy,'' said Herbert Schmitt while his wife, Monika, cried at
his side. ``This is the end of an era.''
	   During his 16 years in power, Kohl helped build up the army's
image and eased decades of self-restraint rooted in its Nazi past.
	   On a parade ground in the cathedral's shadow, the chancellor
some Germans fondly nickname ``The Old Elephant'' praised the army
for making an ``an incalculable contribution to Germany's global
reputation'' after World War II.
	   He recalled another achievement: sending German soldiers abroad
on their first missions abroad since the war as peacekeepers,
including service in Bosnia.
	   And he noted the ``historically unique'' fusion of former
communist East Germany's armed forces with the west's after
unification.
	   Kohl, a historian by training, had asked for the ceremony to be
held in this ancient town on the banks of the Rhine River, near his
home town of Ludwigshafen.
	   He was fond of taking heads of state and other dignitaries to
Speyer's nearly 1,000-year-old cathedral, including Pope John Paul
II. The town's proximity to France also fit with Kohl's continuous
striving for closer ties with Germany's neighbor and main European
ally.
	   Kohl's conservative coalition was defeated in elections by the
center-left Social Democrats. Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is
forming a coalition with the environmentalist Greens party. He is
due to take office Oct. 27.
	   Speyer residents had mixed feelings about the ceremony.
	   ``The town is split on it, really,'' said museum attendant
Manuel Siching, 20. ``I think it's a good thing, but we have to
remember Germany's past, too, and maintain a critical attitude to
ceremonies like this.''
	   Speyer native Claus Neubauer thought the ceremony was proper.
	   ``It was time for a change of power, but it's also right that he
is honored as a person for all his achievements,'' he said.

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
is rumored to be. Officials at the clinic refused to comment.
	   In a statement issued in Oporto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero-American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''
	   The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez, demanded ``that steps be taken to allow an early end of
this situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not recognize
the authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,
applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastly
dictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is one
of the great murderers of this century.''
	   Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,
which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British
government was ``under obligation to take legal action'' against
him.
	   It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,
who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he
reportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker and
hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another
judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   The extradition warrant alleges that ``between the 11th
September 1973 and 31st December 1983 within the jurisdiction of
the 5th Central Magistrates Court of the National Court of Madrid
he did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of
the government of Spain.''
	   Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected
President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March when he was
sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in a
constitution drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 political
opponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted
for after being detained by his security agents.
	   Britain's Home Office said Saturday that the Spanish government
had 40 days from the time of Friday's arrest to submit a formal
extradition request. Under a 1989 law the final decision on whether
to extradite Pinochet will rest with Home Secretary Jack Straw.

Turin 2006 plans for transport, lodging need work, IOC says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Plans for transportation and lodging, two
issues that dogged Rome's failed bid to host the 2004 Olympics,
must be improved if this northern city is going to land the 2006
Winter Games, an IOC inspection team said Saturday.
	   The timing of the panel's three-day visit could hardly have been
worse for Italy.
	   The country is in the throes of a political crisis after Premier
Romano Prodi resigned last week, while a soccer doping scandal has
shut down an IOC-accredited drug-testing laboratory and led
national Olympic committee president Mario Pescante to quit.
	   Japan's Chiharu Igaya, the head of the IOC delegation in Turin,
said the city's 2006 bid ``needs further work with regard to the
lodging of athletes and journalists, transportation, and the event
sites, which are rather dispersed.''
	   Igaya did praise local officials for their attention to the
environment and for rehabilitation of old industrial areas.
	   The other cities bidding for the 2006 Winter Games are Sion,
Switzerland; Zakopane, Poland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Klagenfurt,
Austria, and Helsinki, Finland.
	   A winner will be selected in June in Seoul, South Korea.

Peace, war, Serb or Albanian: Once again, Kosovo's at a crossroad

<TEXT>
	   PREKAZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Death's silence. A Serb's taunt and an
Albanian woman's sob. Kosovo suspended between war and peace is a
place where past horrors mingle with fears for the future.
	   As government troops end their assault and refugees try to
survive another day, a new peace mission is taking shape in
capitals far away. NATO warplanes are poised, observer missions are
in the making and negotiators cajole or issue warnings _ whatever
it takes to end Kosovo's bloodshed and banish the threat of mass
deaths of refugees this winter.
	   History is being made _ and repeated. Again the province, fought
over for centuries by Serbs, Turks, Albanians and others, is at a
turning point. But will it turn to bloodletting or peacemaking?
	   Western hopes are that the threat of NATO strikes will make
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic adhere to promised troop
withdrawals and other measures to end a decade of repression of the
province.
	   But there is no NATO threat to keep armed ethnic Albanians from
resuming their struggle to take Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic, if Milosevic keeps his word and ends the
government offensive against them. To many, Milosevic's agreement
to renew Kosovo's autonomous status means the ethnic Albanians have
won, and the next step is the independence favored by most
Albanians.
	   ___
	   Death still holds the village of Prekaz, eight months after the
battle that started it all. Flies buzz over a dog's carcass and a
door creaks in the wind, fitting sounds to the tableau of
destruction _ the rubble of former homes, and the neglected
makeshift graveyard sheltering the remains of the Jashari family.
	   The Jashari men had been a thorn in the Serbs' side for a
decade, ever since one of them killed a policeman over an argument
of now forgotten origins _ and then dared the Serbs to come and get
him.
	   The Jasharis were rich, well-armed and ensconced in an anti-Serb
area, so the Serb police stayed away until they were handed the
excuse they needed for revenge.
	   Adem Jashari began appearing, armed, uniformed and bragging
about heading the newly emerged Kosovo Liberation Army, responsible
for a growing rash of police killings as part of a ``battle of
independence.''
	   The fight for Prekaz in March was fierce, but like subsequent
battles, one-sided. The Serbs had cannons, mortars and heavy
machine guns, the Jasharis submachine guns. Except for one person
in Germany, the entire clan was wiped out and their coffins _ 30 of
them _ bulldozed into a field.
	   No one lives now in Prekaz, about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
northeast of Pristina, the provincial capital, and no one is
welcome. A tank hides in a thicket, and a grim Yugoslav soldier,
gun pointed at chest level, emerges from the bush, telling a
visitor to leave and not come back.
	   But the Jasharis live on in the popular imagination, feeding the
constant need for heroes on both sides of the struggle.
	   ``I never knew them, but for me they are like members of my own
family,'' says Shkurta Bajrami, a sallow-faced mother of 10 who
found refuge in nearby Srbica but whose husband and sons are with
the guerrillas. ``They are a symbol for us.''
	   ___
	   Refugees cluster near Kisna Reka, a destroyed village 15 miles
(25 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. A gully teems with hundreds
of them, and there are thousands more in nearby ravines.
	   Tens of thousands of the more than 275,000 Albanian villagers
driven from their homes camp out under plastic sheeting. Each day
they weigh the dangers of staying put as the weather grows colder
or going back to villages where Serb police still lurk.
	   ``They shot again all night,'' sobs Bahtije Hykaj, holding a
cigarette to the lips of her 75-year old husband, immobilized by a
stroke. ``If we go back, then ...'' _ a finger slicing across her
throat says it all.
	   Adding to the misery of refugee life is the air of permanency
about the camp. Some residents have been there five months, and
fear dictates an indefinite stay.
	   An array of faucets attached to a pipe pokes out of the ground,
bringing spring water from the hills. Proud residents say it's a
huge improvement over the filthy creek water they had before, their
smiles reflecting the Kosovo Albanian ability to accept and adapt.
	   Up a snaking gully path stands a large hothouse-like
construction of plastic sheeting attached to wooden ribbing. A sign
welcomes visitors to the ``School of Hard Knocks.''
	   Inside, students ages 11 to 15 sit on wooden planks, some with a
notebook, others with a pencil, many with nothing at all. Their
teacher, Shahit Bujuri, passes around a book for practicing reading
skills.

Chileans on Pinochet arrest: some happy, others angry, all baffled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ In moods ranging from fury to relief,
Chileans reacted Saturday to the arrest in London of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former dictator whose ruthless regime was widely
criticized for its human rights record. The government issued a
formal protest.
	   One response on the streets of the country's capital appeared
unanimous: astonishment that the man who ruled Chile for almost 17
years was now in such a difficult position.
	   British police arrested Pinochet on a Spanish extradition
warrant in the murder of Spaniards during his years in power.
	   ``It is very good news for us,'' said Viviana Diaz, a member of
an organization of Chileans who disappeared after being arrested by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``We had asked the British government to allow Pinochet to be
questioned because that's probably our only chance to get him to
answer about the fate of our loved ones.''
	   According to the civilian government that succeeded the general
in 1990, 1,102 dissidents remain unaccounted for after Pinochet's
security forces detained them.
	   Jaime Munoz, who sells building materials, was delighted at the
former general's detention.
	   ``That's great news. Finally someone, like (British Prime
Minister) Tony Blair, has taken the bull by the horns.''
	   Concepcion Lopez, a widow in Santiago's middle class La Florida
neighborhood, reacted more calmly.
	   ``After all those years doing evil, I hope he at least gets a
big scare,'' she said.
	   Isabel Allende, a daughter of Salvador Allende _ the Marxist
president Pinochet ousted in his bloody 1973 coup _ called his
arrest an opportunity to make him account for the human rights
violations under his regime.
	   Others people were angry. Pinochet's son, also called Augusto,
vowed to hire ``the best team of lawyers existing in London.''
	   Word of the arrest quickly dominated radio broadcasts in the
normally quiet Saturday morning, and the initial mood was one of
disbelief.
	   At a downtown newsstand, a man looked at the front page of the
only paper that carried the news. ``Is it true?'' he asked.
	   In the corridors of power, Julio Lagos, a right-wing senator and
staunch Pinochet supporter, called the arrest ``an open violation
of the diplomatic immunity granted to him by the Chilean State.''
	   Pedro Daza, a retired career diplomat who served as envoy to the
United Nations under Pinochet, said the retired general has
immunity because he travels with a diplomatic passport.
	   The government agreed, calling the arrest a violation of
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity, and it filed a formal protest with
the British government.
	   While he wasn't on diplomatic business, Pinochet received a
diplomatic passport from the government in his capacity as a
senator-for-life. He remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
	   The army remained silent, as it has in all situations involving
Pinochet since Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, a non-political, professional
soldier, replaced the former dictator as head of the armed forces.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, underwent surgery Oct. 9
for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder which has given him pain
and hampered his walking in recent months.

<TEXT>
	   The students laugh and get rowdy, like those anywhere with a
school visitor. But they erupt in loud boos when asked if they
believe Milosevic means it this time when he talks about peace.
	   ``He's lying,'' proclaims Manushaqe Bujuri, 14. ``Look around
you. He's responsible for all of this!''
	   ___
	   The guerrillas should be happy for the respite in fighting,
after being on the losing side for much of the seven-month
government crackdown. Even the Serbs claim few recent attacks by
them beyond occasional sniping.
	   But the militants would have preferred NATO strikes instead of
only threats, and now seem to be weighing whether to fight on. If
they do, the West will be hard pressed to prevent police from
responding in self defense and resuming the bloodshed.
	   Fadil, an unsmiling young fighter who refuses to give his last
name, looks up from cleaning his assault rifle and scowls when
asked if he's happy about the NATO threat and the end to the
government offensive.
	   ``That was a NATO decision and has nothing to do with us,'' he
says sullenly. ``We obey only our command and will do whatever we
are told to.''
	   ___
	   The Serbs are clearly no happier with an agreement to stop a
fight they had already all but won.
	   More than ever, Western reporters are considered accessories to
an anti-Serb conspiracy that led to the NATO threat. Soldiers
sitting in the backs of Yugoslav army trucks give journalists grim
stares. Some raise three fingers in the Serb supremacy salute.
Others gesture with one finger.
	   Miljko, the mustachioed police commander in Gornje Nerodimlje,
is more friendly, offering to take visitors to the front line of
the village 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina.
	   There, Serb men in their 70s are dug in on a wooded hillside.
Clutching submachine guns, they keep watch during the day. The
younger men pull 12-hour night shifts against an enemy they say is
only hundreds of yards (meters) away.
	   ``The other war was a real war,'' muses Novica Dobic, 71,
comparing his World War II fight against the Germans to the present
struggle. ``Now, we are facing cowards.''
	   He and the other retirees-turned warriors loudly proclaim that
they will die before leaving, no matter what Milosevic agreed to.
``Kosovo is and always will remain Serb,'' whoops a grizzled
veteran.
	   Miljko _ he won't give his full name _ also says he will die
before he'll cut and run.
	   ``The Turks were beating us for 500 years and we managed to
survive,'' he says, alluding to Ottoman rule of Kosovo and the rest
of Serbia that ended only in the last century.
	   He and two colleagues turn their attention to breakfast of
sausage and potent home-brew, but talk of crops and village affairs
can't be sustained. The issue of Kosovo's future keeps getting in
the way, until one of the younger officers just can't keep up the
pretense.
	   ``We Serbs are done for,'' he mutters.

IMF team postpones visit, bailout package likely to be delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund team
postponed a visit to cash-strapped Pakistan, meaning a badly needed
loan package will likely be delayed, a senior government official
said Saturday.
	   ``The visit of the IMF team has been postponed, and the new date
will be announced later,'' Hafeez Pasha, Finance Adviser to the
prime minister told The Associated Press.
	   The IMF team was due to arrive in Islamabad on Oct. 21 on a
follow-up trip to refine a bailout package for the country's ailing
economy after talks in Washington earlier this month.
	   ``A lot of progress has been made in our talks in Washington,''
Pasha said.
	   But he gave no reasons as to why the IMF team's visit was
postponed.
	   Economists fear the delay may have been the result of an ongoing
feud between the government and privately run power companies. In
recent weeks the government has stepped up its accusations against
private power companies, accusing them of charging inflated power
rates to state-run utilities.
	   Power contracts have been canceled and the courts have ordered
rates slashed.
	   Pakistan also is scrambling to avoid a default on its foreign
debt because its fragile economy has been further shaken by
sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests in May.
	   India faces similar sanctions, but it is less dependent on
foreign loans and aid than Islamabad.
	   The IMF held up a dlrs 1.56 billion loan to Pakistan after the
nuclear tests.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan has less than dlrs 600 million in foreign
exchange reserves _ barely enough to pay for a month of imports.

Woods says he's getting better and better _ and better
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Is Tiger Woods a better player
than he was a year ago?
	   ``No doubt about it,'' the world's top-ranked player said
Saturday, listing better control, a wider variety of shots, fewer
three putts and a better mental game as his major improvements.
	   Woods, in the finals of Sunday's World Match Play Championship
against his American pal Mark O'Meara, offered a smile as wide as
his shoulders as he went on about polishing his game.
	   ``I can't even describe to you how much better of a player I am
physically and mentally,'' he said. ``The shots I can hit now,
there's no way I could have played last year.''
	   ``Last year there's no way I could have hit the shots I did last
week at St. Andrews (in the Dunhill Cup). My swing plane wasn't
able to hit the ball with that trajectory and that spin.
	   ``Today (Saturday) I hit some very low shots, I can hold it
either way.''
	   Woods, winner four times last year on the U.S. PGA Tour _ but
only once in '98 _ said his new putting philosophy might take
another year or two to produce results.
	   ``Last year I was a very consistent putter,'' he said, which was
a key _ and surprising part _ as he won the Masters. ``This year I
have been very streaky. I'm not making as many putts, but I'm not
three-putting as much.
	   ``I'm dying more putts at the hole. I'm not running them by like
I used to. Consequently, I think my lines are just a little off
because I'm not used to that. All my life I've been very
aggressive.''
	   ``I just decided over the long haul it will be much better for
me if I start dying some putts and not leaving myself with four- or
five-footers at every hole,'' he added.
	   ``There have been a few tournaments where I have gone three
weeks without three-putting. I could never have done that last
year.''
	   The 22-year-old American also said his mental game had improved
since turning professional two years ago, and invoked the words of
one of the game's greats.
	   ``Like Ben Hogan said, you never really do master the mental
part of the game. I think that's so true.''
	   ``But I know I have so much I can improve on.''
	   A scary thought.

Chileans on Pinochet arrest: some happy, others angry, all baffled

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ In moods ranging from fury to relief,
Chileans reacted Saturday to the arrest in London of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former dictator whose ruthless regime was widely
criticized for its human rights record. The government issued a
formal protest.
	   One response on the streets of the country's capital appeared
unanimous: astonishment that the man who ruled Chile for almost 17
years was now in such a difficult position.
	   British police arrested Pinochet on a Spanish extradition
warrant in the murder of Spaniards during his years in power.
	   ``It is very good news for us,'' said Viviana Diaz, a member of
an organization of Chileans who disappeared after being arrested by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``We had asked the British government to allow Pinochet to be
questioned because that's probably our only chance to get him to
answer about the fate of our loved ones.''
	   According to the civilian government that succeeded the general
in 1990, 1,102 dissidents remain unaccounted for after Pinochet's
security forces detained them.
	   Jaime Munoz, who sells building materials, was delighted at the
former general's detention.
	   ``That's great news. Finally someone, like (British Prime
Minister) Tony Blair, has taken the bull by the horns.''
	   Concepcion Lopez, a widow in Santiago's middle class La Florida
neighborhood, reacted more calmly.
	   ``After all those years doing evil, I hope he at least gets a
big scare,'' she said.
	   Isabel Allende, a daughter of Salvador Allende _ the Marxist
president Pinochet ousted in his bloody 1973 coup _ called his
arrest an opportunity to make him account for the human rights
violations under his regime.
	   Others people were angry. Pinochet's son, also called Augusto,
vowed to hire ``the best team of lawyers existing in London.''
	   Word of the arrest quickly dominated radio broadcasts in the
normally quiet Saturday morning, and the initial mood was one of
disbelief.
	   At a downtown newsstand, a man looked at the front page of the
only paper that carried the news. ``Is it true?'' he asked.
	   In the corridors of power, Julio Lagos, a right-wing senator and
staunch Pinochet supporter, called the arrest ``an open violation
of the diplomatic immunity granted to him by the Chilean State.''
	   Pedro Daza, a retired career diplomat who served as envoy to the
United Nations under Pinochet, said the retired general has
immunity because he travels with a diplomatic passport.
	   The government agreed, calling the arrest a violation of
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity, and it filed a formal protest with
the British government.
	   While he wasn't on diplomatic business, Pinochet received a
diplomatic passport from the government in his capacity as a
senator-for-life. He remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
	   The army remained silent, as it has in all situations involving
Pinochet since Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, a non-political, professional
soldier, replaced the former dictator as head of the armed forces.
	   But recently retired Gen. Luis Cortes called the arrest ``an act
of cowardice, entering the room of a man who is ill, in bed, to
tell him he is under arrest.''
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, underwent surgery Oct. 9
for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder which has given him pain
and hampered his walking in recent months.

Rightist militias execute 11 peasants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rightist paramilitary gunmen executed at
least 11 peasants this week after tying the victims up and accusing
them of belonging to leftist guerrilla groups, Colombia's Defense
Minister has confirmed.
	   A force of about 200 heavily armed men reportedly carried out
the massacre Wednesday in San Pedro, a small town in the Sierra
Nevada mountains about 320 miles (510 kilometers) north of Bogota.
	   The killings took place after militias members sealed off roads
leading in and out of town, the army reported.
	   Human rights monitors charge the government has done little to
reign in the paramilitary groups, who have committed massacres and
who are supported by members of the Colombian army.
	   Confirming the massacre on Friday, Defense Minister Rodrigo
Lloreda vowed to pursue the killers with ``all the force of the
state.''

Sampras beats Martin, moves into final in Vienna against Kucera
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of Kucera match, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow
American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the
final of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP.
	   On Sunday, he'll seek his fourth title of the year and first
since Wimbledon against seventh-ranked Karol Kucera of Slovakia,
who defeated Britain's Greg Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Sampras described his play against the 29th-ranked Martin as
unspectacular but solid.
	   He took control of the first set in the sixth game when he hit a
crosscourt backhand return past the onrushing Martin for a break
that put him up 4-2.
	   After falling behind a break in the second set, he pulled even
at 6-all and then won the first three points of the tiebreak en
route to the victory.
	   ``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,''
said Sampras. ``It all came down to the tiebreak.''
	   Sampras, in a close race with Patrick Rafter and Marcelo Rios
for the top ranking as the season enters its final weeks, entered
the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the last moment as
a wild card.
	   In a bid to become the first player to finish the year as No. 1
for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   ``This week certainly helps'' in that quest, said Sampras after
beating Martin. ``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a
reference to his early exit from a Swiss tournament.
	   His biggest challenger for the top ranking, No. 2 Rafter, was
eliminated in Friday's quarterfinals by Rusedski.
	   Kucera called his victory ``a pretty big step'' toward nailing
down a spot in the eight-man Hanover finale.
	   ``This has been the greatest year for me,'' said the 24-year-old
Slovak, who began the year ranked 24th in the world. ``It was more
than I expected.''
	   On Saturday, he rallied in the first set after being down 1-4
and facing a set point at 5-6 before coming back to take the set.
Then at match point on Rusedski's serve, he hit a backhand return
winner.
	   ``The key today was that I won a lot of points from the baseline
and returned well,'' he said.
	   He said that in order to beat Sampras, ``I have to be better
than him from the baseline, and try to hold my serve.''
	   Rusedski, last year's runnerup in Vienna to Goran Ivanisevic,
double-faulted eight times Saturday.

Real Madrid reclaims first place in Spanish league
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: to be updated with late games

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid ousted Zaragoza to retake first
place in the Spanish Premier Division Saturday in a 4-3 slugfest.
	   Springing back from two straight losses in European and league
play against Spartak of Moscow and Betis, Real Madrid came out
fighting in the sixth week of play after spending a week in second
place.
	   It scored in the 11th minute on a penalty kick by Fernando
Hierro after Zaragoza striker Marcos Vales fouled Real's Croatian
star Robert Jarni.
	   Playing in Zaragoza, Real struck again six minutes later on a
nice header by Brazil's Roberto Carlos on a pass from Jarni.
	   Zaragoza kept up pressure on goalkeeper Bodo Illgner of Germany
and in the 23rd minute made it 1-2 on a goal by Yugoslav midfielder
Sabo Milosevic.
	   As the first half drew to a close Zaragoza blew several other
chances to score, including a shot by Roberto Miguel Acuna, which
Illgner stopped with his fists.
	   The holders of the European Champions League title wasted little
time in making it 1-3 as striker Raul Gonzalez scored on a pass
from Pedrag Mijatovic in the 40th minute.
	   Early in the second half Real Madrid seemed overconfident and
saw Zaragoza score on a free kick by Argentine Gustavo Lopez in the
60th minute to make it 2-3.
	   Real Madrid answered in the 71st minute as Mijatovic surprised
goalkeeper Juan Miguel Garcia with an arcing shot after a pass from
Jarni.
	   Fighting in vain to hold on to first place, the season's upstart
Zaragoza made it 3-4 with a goal from Argentine midfielder Kily
Gonzalez.
	   In other games played Saturday, in Seville, Celta won 3-0
against Betis which has won just one game this year -- in week five
against Real Madrid.
	   And Atletico de Madrid, playing at home, beat Tenerife 2-0.
Osvaldo Giroldo 'Junhino' scored in the 71st minute on a penalty
kick, only to be expelled from the game shortly thereafter for a
tackle against Yugoslav midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic.
	   The Canary Islands team played the last 15 minutes with nine
men. Brazilian Emerson Moises Costa was booted for drawing two
yellow cards and countryman Andre Luiz Moreira drew a red. Atletico
seized on the opportunity and scored in the final minute with a
goal from Roberto Fresnedoso.

Ibero-American presidents express fears of world recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS lead, EXPANDS on Brazilian crisis
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Facing the threat of their countries
being engulfed by a widening global recession, Latin American
leaders attending a summit meeting here Sunday urged the Group of
Seven industrialized countries to come to their rescue.
	   Heads of state and government from 19 Latin American countries,
Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an
Ibero-American summit declaration warning of world recession unless
urgent action is taken by the G-7 to stabilize the international
financial system.
	   The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil made
it clear that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the
difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.''
	   The G-7 includes the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Canada.
	   The final declaration will be delivered at the end of Sunday's
summit in this port city in northern Portugal.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, talking to
reporters during a side trip Saturday to Guimaraes, the cradle of
the Portuguese nation, said Brazil and China, two of the world's
largest economies, had become the ``dikes of resistance'' to global
recession.
	   He said protecting their economies from the spreading economic
turmoil, affecting more countries than at any time since the early
1980s, was key to world economic stability.
	   Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth largest
in the world, and its collapse could be expected to take the rest
of the continent along with it.
	   To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso is preparing
austerity measures like spending cuts, tax hikes and lower interest
rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for an International
Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion.
	   The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137
billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago
and then spread from Asia to Russia.
	   The Clinton administration, aware that a Latin American
recession would severely affect the United States, has actively
pushed the IMF and the World Bank to support Brazil after it was
hit by investor flight.
	   Although the presidents came here to debate globalization and
regional integration, much of their attention was diverted to the
economic crisis.
	   A copy of the draft declaration obtained by The Associated Press
said the G-7 must strengthen the ability of international
institutions to diagnose, prevent and react to financial market
turmoil.
	   It said more efficient methods of maintaining the stability of
financial and capital markets are ``indispensable ... for the
economic growth of our countries.''
	   Latin American leaders will carry out structural reforms to keep
their economies healthy, according to the draft.
	   Mexico, Colombia and Brazil already are pursuing fiscal
austerity policies, like cutting state spending.

British police arrest Pinochet on murder charges

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
is rumored to be. Officials at the clinic refused to comment.
	   In a statement issued in Oporto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero-American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the arrest
created ''a delicate domestic and international situation for the
Chilean government.'' Insuzla said that he and Robin Cook,
Britain's Foreign Secretary, had disagreed Saturday in a telephone
discussion about the interpretation of diplomatic immunity. Insulza
told a news conferene that Santiago Benadava, a well known Chilean
international law expert, is flying to London.
	   Chile has previously said it does not recognize the authority of
foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,
applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastly
dictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is one
of the great murderers of this century.''
	   Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,
which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British
government was ``under obligation to take legal action'' against
him.
	   It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,
who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he
reportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker and
hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another
judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Garcia's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in Chile
during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   The extradition warrant alleges that ``between the 11th
September 1973 and 31st December 1983 within the jurisdiction of
the 5th Central Magistrates Court of the National Court of Madrid
he did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of
the government of Spain.''
	   Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected
President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March when he was
sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in a
constitution drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 political
opponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted
for after being detained by his security agents.
	   Britain's Home Office said Saturday that the Spanish government
had 40 days from the time of Friday's arrest to submit a formal
extradition request. Under a 1989 law the final decision on whether
to extradite Pinochet will rest with Home Secretary Jack Straw.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   During the late morning, the mostly cloudy skies across the east
half of Puerto Rico through the U.S. Virgin Islands moved westward.
By 1 p.m., these conditions shifted to the west half of Puerto
Rico. Soon after, and under moderate southeast winds, locally heavy
showers and isolated thunderstorms developed and intensified across
the northwest slopes. Some of the heavier rain drifted northwest to
the vicinity of Aguadilla. The heaviest rain, estimated at up to 5
inches was indicated across inland sections of Moca, San Sebastian
and Anasco where stream, street and road flooding was occurring.
Mid afternoon coastal temperatures ranged from the low 80s across
northwest Puerto Rico to around 90 degrees across south central
sections.
	   The precipitation was associated with daytime heating, mountain
influences and the sea breeze. These factors combined with the
passage of a weak low-level trough that moved west of the islands
leaving southeast winds in its wake. These winds focused the heavy
rain across the northwest quarter of Puerto Rico. Moderate rain
will linger across this area into the evening hours. A weak
tropical wave will approach the region on Sunday increasing clouds

Report: Nobel-winner ponders Nigerian political separation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and other
leading Nigerian democracy campaigners plan to form an opposition
national congress to decide whether the ethnically-divided West
African country should remain a single state, a newspaper said
Saturday.
	   Soyinka, who returned home on Wednesday from four years in
exile, said a number of prominent leaders were organizing a
``Congress of Nationalities in Nigeria'' to debate, among other
options, sovereign statehood for individual regions, the respected
Lagos Guardian reported.
	   The congress may meet in November, although no firm dates had
been set, Soyinka said.
	   Nigeria's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has promised
presidential elections in February and a transition to civilian
rule by the end of May.
	   However Abubakar has rebuffed calls by opposition leaders to
form a national political congress to reconsider the country's
constitution prior to the elections.
	   ``There is nothing that stops the transition to civilian rule
... from going on side by side with the sovereign national
conference,'' Soyinka told the newspaper.
	   Nigeria, where the mainly Christian southern provinces are rich
in oil and gas, has long been dominated by military leaders from
the predominantly-Muslim north. Ethnic divisions have divided the
country since colonial times and frequently explode into violent
confrontations. The two-year separatist Biafra War in the country's
southeast from 1967-70 resulted in between 500,000 and two million
deaths.
	   Soyinka, who hails from the south where most people remain
desperately poor despite the oil wealth, urged Nigerians in a
public speech on Friday to demand that individual regions begin
collecting _ and spending _ government revenue.
	   Soyinka, who became the first African to win the Nobel prize for
literature in 1986, is the author of more than 20 works of fiction,
poetry and drama.
	   The 64-year-old writer, who has been one of Nigeria's strongest
junta critics at home and abroad, fled his homeland in 1994 during
the rule of late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, who silenced critics
with jailings, torture and executions.
	   Soyinka, who has no clear personal political ambitions or party
affiliations, visited the southwestern city of Ibadan on Saturday.
He is leaving Nigeria next week and has not said when he plans to
return. He is currently a professor at Emory University in Atlanta.

Taliban free 25 Iranian prisoners in 'good will' gesture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with 26 truck drivers arriving in Iran; NEW
to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
freed 25 Iranian captives on Saturday ``as a gesture of good
will,'' Radio Shariat reported.
	   The Taliban's radio broadcast, monitored in neighboring
Pakistan, said the International Red Cross sent an aircraft to the
Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar, picked up the freed
Iranians and returned them to Iran.
	   Twenty-six truck drivers arrived at an airport outside Tehran
later Saturday on two planes of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, according to Iran's official news agency. The
discrepancy in numbers could not be immediately be explained.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said that with the release of
the 26, the Taliban had freed a total of 51 Iranians. The first
batch of five truck drivers were released days after the Taliban
admitted the diplomats' killing in early September.
	   The Taliban seized the truck drivers while they were carrying
``humanitarian goods'' to northern Afghanistan, the agency said. It
gave no details about the men's health.
	   The Iranians were captured in August during the Taliban's bloody
takeover of the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Renegade
soldiers killed eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist
during the fighting.
	   The killings caused a chill in relations with neighboring Iran,
which massed more than 200,000 soldiers on its eastern border with
Afghanistan and sent hundreds of tanks and scores of fighter jets
there.
	   The United Nations sent a special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to the
region on an emergency peace mission. He spent five days in Iran
and traveled Wednesday to the Taliban headquarters in southern
Kandahar.
	   It was there that Brahimi secured a promise from the Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that all the Iranian captives would be
released. The Taliban said they were holding 25 Iranians, whom they
called military personnel. Iran said they were truck drivers and
private business people.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of send arms and money to its
enemies _ a northern-based alliance that has been trying to stop
the Taliban's total takeover of Afghanistan. The Taliban rule 90
percent of the country and they have imposed a harsh form of
Islamic law and justice.
	   The remaining territory is ruled by the opposition, whose
members are mostly from the country's minority ethnic groups.
	   Brahimi's shuttle diplomacy also secured a promise from Omar to
cooperate with a joint United Nations and Organization of Islamic
Conference commission to investigate reports of massive human
rights abuse by both sides in the conflict.
	   The opposition says the Taliban massacred hundreds of ethnic
Hazaras who belong to Afghanistan's minority Shiites.
	   The Taliban say 2,000 of their men were slaughtered by ethnic
Uzbeks in May 1997 after an alliance soured.

Israeli Arab says Netanyahu will not honor any accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Israeli Arab legislator,
CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States will press Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sign an agreement with the
Palestinians, but he will not honor it, said an Arab member of
Israel's parliament Saturday.
	   ``There will be some pressure on Netanyahu to reach an
agreement,'' said Tawfiq Khatib of the current summit among
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. leaders outside Washington.
	   But ``Netanyahu has got used to breaching his promises and not
honoring previous agreements,'' said Khatib, who represents the
Arab Muslim Movement in Israel's Knesset.
	   Khatib spoke as one of the 12 Arab Knesset members making a
three-day visit to Egypt.
	   Earlier Saturday, the leader of the delegation, Abdel-Wahab
Daraoushe, said he and his Arab colleagues in the Knesset would
support any agreement forged at the summit, but also cast doubt on
Netanyahu's ability to honor an accord.
	   ``We have faith in the Palestinian Authority and will support
their decisions,'' said Daraoushe.
	   ``But I do not have faith in Netanyahu and (Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel) Sharon's readiness to implement any agreement
signed with the Arabs,'' he added.
	   Daraoushe, who belongs to the Arab Democratic Party, spoke to
reporters after he and fellow delegates met Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak for talks on the role of Israeli Arabs in the peace
process.
	   Khatib also saw Sharon, who is known for hard-line views, as an
obstacle to the peace process, but the legislator said that in the
short term Sharon ``might play a positive role by helping Netanyahu
to pass an agreement with the (Israeli) government.''
	   Members of Netanyahu's coalition Cabinet are believed to have
threatened to resign if the prime minister accepts the U.S. plan
for an Israeli military withdrawal from a further 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   Daraoushe criticized the plan, saying it offers ``less than what
the Palestinians ask for.''
	   ``But given the current situation ... there are no options
before Arafat but to sign this agreement,'' Daraoushe said.
	   Mubarak and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa have expressed
the opinion that Arafat has been pressured into conceding too much
during the U.S.-brokered negotiations.
	   There are about 1 million Arabs in Israel, accounting for about
18 percent of the population. The 120-member Knesset has 12 Arabs _
nine Muslims, two Christians and one Druse _ representing Arab and
other opposition parties.

An unlikely situation for Pinochet: arrested in a foreign land

 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Under arrest in a foreign land, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet found himself in an unlikely position for a man
who held total power in Chile for 17 years and retains considerable
clout even now.
	   Highly respected by his former soldiers, revered by his
followers, feared or hated by his foes, the 82-year-old Pinochet
was under arrest Saturday at a London clinic.
	   British police arrested the former dictator at the request of
Spanish judges, who want to question him about Spanish citizens
killed during his years in power. It was a severe blow for a man
who grew accustomed to giving orders and being obeyed during his
1973-90 dictatorship.
	   ``Not a leaf moves in this country if I am not the one who is
moving it,'' he once said.
	   Pinochet was born Nov. 25, 1916, one of three children of a
customs official who urged him to study medicine. Instead, he
entered the military academy after twice being rejected as too
physically weak.
	   He seized power in a bloody coup on Sept. 11, 1973, overthrowing
Marxist President Salvador Allende _ the man who had made him
commander-in-chief of the army 19 days earlier.
	   The takeover initially enjoyed substantial public support
because of social and economic chaos under Allende. But few
expected Pinochet to remain ruler for more than a few years.
	   Pinochet even pledged to remain in power ``only as long as
circumstances demand it.''
	   Soon, however, he said he led ``by goals, not deadlines,'' and
disbanded congress, banned political activity and began a harsh
campaign against leftists. At least 3,197 people were killed, more
than 1,000 disappeared and thousands were arrested, tortured or
forced into exile.
	   Pinochet defended his authoritarian rule as a bulwark against
communism _ and later he claimed part of the credit for the
collapse of communism. The repression later decreased, although
Pinochet did not hesitate to respond if challenged.
	   In the early 1980s, amid a deep economic crisis, the first open
street demonstrations against his regime broke out. He sent
thousands of soldiers into the streets and hundreds of people were
killed.
	   Pinochet kept his hold on power by combining harsh repression
with policy changes. Under free-market policies, Chile began to
post economic results that drew widespread praise at home and
abroad.
	   He survived an assassination attempt in 1986, when attackers
shot at his armored car.
	   A confident Pinochet called a referendum on extending his rule,
expecting a ``yes'' answer to keep him in power until the turn of
the century. It was crucial mistake, as an overwhelming ``no''
forced him to call open elections that opposition leader Patricio
Aylwin won.
	   Pinochet stepped down Mar. 11, 1990, but ensured that he
retained considerable clout. The constitution drafted by his regime
allowed him to remain commander of the army until last March, then
move swiftly to congress as senator for life, a position he now
has.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the
slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
is rumored to be. Officials at the clinic refused to comment.
	   In Oporto, Portugal, where he is participating in the
Ibero-American summit, Chilean President Eduardo Frei insisted that
Pinochet has diplomatic immunity that should be recognized by
Britain.
	   ``This situation of diplomatic immunity protects all members of
Parliament in Chile. That is a very old tradition,'' he said. ``But
what seems more crucial to us is that we think that people in Chile
must be tried by Chilean courts.''
	   ``We do not accept extra-territoriality of courts,'' Frei said.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the arrest
created ``a delicate domestic and international situation for the
Chilean government.'' Insulza said that he and Robin Cook, British
Foreign Secretary, had disagreed Saturday in a telephone discussion
about the interpretation of diplomatic immunity.

Clinton tries to mediate differences over security measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout. Press briefing expected about

 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton took turns
Saturday meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as the West
Bank summit reached the halfway point with disagreement and
discord.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   According to diplomatic sources, key security issues remained
unsettled, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat exchanged allegations underscoring
mistrust between the two leaders.
	   At a face-to-face meeting Friday, the sources told The
Associated Press, Netanyahu raised an old complaint about thousands
of cars being stolen from Israelis. The sources, insisting on
anonymity, said Arafat responded that Jewish settlers were the
thieves.
	   On another touchy point, the sources said Arafat told Netanyahu
that Jewish extremists were collaborating with Arab extremists.
	   On a bright, sunny day, Clinton arrived on Maryland's rural
Eastern Shore by helicopter from Washington and met first, over
lunch, for 45 minutes with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and other senior aides.
	   The president then walked to Houghton House, an elegant retreat
that once was the residence of a rich American family. Arafat was
waiting at the door. Together, they want to the library and talked
for 90 minutes.
	   Arafat walked Clinton back to his quarters, and the president
telephoned a report to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
	   A meeting with Netanyahu at River House, a luxurious estate
overlooking the Wye River, was next on Clinton's schedule. Four
aides on both sides were invited to participate.
	   Clinton was trying to clear the way for an agreement by Sunday,
the end of four days of talks, but signs of discord were evident.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart gave reporters a terse
account that made no reference to the disputed topics.
	   ``We think the environment out here has provided the ability for
informal discussions and has provided an atmosphere that is
constructive,'' Lockhart said.
	   He said Clinton enjoyed a ``strong reservoir of trust'' with the
two leaders, and if he can play ``a constructive role,'' the
president will return Sunday.
	   The talks are being held under a virtual news blackout imposed
by the administration on the theory that secrecy is conducive to
compromise.
	   Saturday's talks were billed by the administration in advance as
``informal,'' possibly because Netanyahu was meeting with Clinton
on the Jewish Sabbath, when work is proscribed.
	   According to diplomatic sources, the Palestinians have accepted
neither an Israeli demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to
Israel for trial nor an American compromise that they be tried by
Palestinian courts.
	   And while the Palestinians were willing to take steps to enhance
security in Ramallah, a major Arab city on the outskirts of
Jerusalem, there was ``absolutely no real movement on anything''
else Friday.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement unless Arafat takes concrete
steps to curb terrorism.
	   Albright is backing Israel in its call for improved security and
the uprooting of terrorist cells on territory already under the
control of Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   In an Associated Press interview Thursday, she described the
agreement she is trying to nail down as an exchange of land for
security.
	   Arafat's position is that peace itself will bring better
security and that he is already making a 100 percent effort to
combat violence against Israelis.
	   A key Israeli demand is that 36 suspects be extradited for
trial. Israel claims that 30 are implicated in the deaths of
Israeli civilians and 10 are serving in the Palestinian police
force.

Iraq's Tariq Aziz accuses U.N. monitors in Iraq of spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has
accused the remaining U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq of spying and
urged the U.N. secretary general to stop their ``dangerous
practices,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
	   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Aziz demanded an
investigation into the practices of about 40 U.N. arms monitors who
are still working in Iraq, the agency reported.
	   The agency did not say when the letter was sent and officials in
Aziz's office could not be reached on the weekend.
	   Iraq has frozen spot inspections by U.N. arms monitors since
Aug. 5, effectively paralyzing the search for its illegal
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The remaining 40 inspectors and their support staff of about 60
are allowed to visit only those weapons sites where the United
Nations already has surveillance equipment installed.
	   Aziz wrote that even activities by these monitors border on
espionage, the agency reported.
	   U.N. arms officials in Baghdad were not available for comment.
	   Aziz accused the monitors of trying to photograph troop
movements, of asking for the names of Iraqis who hold high degrees,
and of demanding an inventory of Iraq's water resources.
	   ``Demanding special and new information about personnel, vital
activities or strategic establishments closely linked to the
security of the Iraqi people and its future (is an example) of
these dangerous practices,'' Aziz wrote.
	   ``There is no justification for getting information on all the
water resources ... Our conviction is that insistence on demanding
such information is nothing but an act of espionage.''
	   Iraq has long called for a halt to the U.N. inspections, saying
it no longer possesses banned weaponry. But the inspectors' reports
have accused the Baghdad government of withholding significant
information.
	   The trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will not be lifted until Baghdad shows it has eliminated its
illegal arms.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A final settlement to a border dispute
that has plagued Peru and Ecuador for half a century could be
announced next week, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said Saturday.
	   Peru and Ecuador have agreed in advance to accept any settlement
proposed by the four guarantor nations of a 1942 treaty that ended
the War of the Pacific between the two countries.
	   A dispute over a small section of their Amazon jungle border has
erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 1995. Tensions
flared again in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of
entering its territory.
	   Cardoso said the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile, Argentina
and the United States _ were putting the finishing touches on their
proposed settlement while attending an Ibero-American summit in
this northern Portuguese port.
	   Presidents from the three Latin American countries met here
Saturday with Presidents Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, who reconfirmed their legislatures had approved
accepting an imposed solution.
	   ``We have ordered the negotiators to work quickly, and I
estimate a proposal ought to be placed on the table by next week,''
Cardoso told reporters.
	   He said the proposal would respect the national sovereignty of
each nation and will provide ``what we all desire, which is
peace.''
	   A quick solution was anticipated when the Peru and Ecuador
legislatures approved proposals Friday from their respective
presidents to accept any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
disputed area.
	   Fujimori and Mahaud met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help find a
solution to the dispute. They told him they had made substantial
progress toward completing a peace agreement, but remained at odds
over delineating the actual border area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Machlas hattrick fires Vitesse into second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A first-half hattrick by Greek
striker Nikos Machlas gave Vitesse Arnhem a 3-2 win Saturday over
Willem II Tilburg, pulling Vitesse level on points with Dutch honor
division leader Feyenoord, which drew 0-0 with mid-table Roda JC
Kerkrade.
	   Machlas was last season's top scorer in the Dutch league and is
already on course to retain his title this term with nine goals in
as many games. He struck in the 14th, 19th and 39th minutes for the
home club.
	   Defender Mark Schenning pulled a goal back for Willem II in the
28th minute and Arno Arts converted a 44th minute penalty to make
it 3-2 before half time before a goalless second half allowed
Vitesse to take all three points.
	   Feyenoord stayed top of the league because of its superior goal
difference, but the goalless draw capped a miserable two days for
the club, which Friday confirmed it was being investigated by
fiscal authorities for suspected tax evasion.
	   Feyenoord survived nearly three quarters of the match with only
10 men after defender Kees van Wonderen was sent off for a
professional foul in the 25th minute.
	   SC Heerenveen continued its strong start to the season with a
3-1 win Friday at AZ Alkmaar. Heerenveen is third, one point behind
Feyenoord and Vitesse.
	   Defending champion Ajax Amsterdam, languishing in sixth place,
has a tricky tie Sunday against fourth-placed FC Twente while last
season's runner-up, PSV Eindhoven, in 10th place with just 10
points from seven matches, travels to Nijmegen to take on
fifth-placed NEC.

Clinton presses Japan, calls IMF money U.S. 'insurance policy'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANDRA SOBIERAJ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton heralded the United
States' newly approved dlrs 17.9 billion contribution to the
International Monetary Fund as ``an insurance policy for our own
economy'' and pressed Japan once more to shore up its banks.
	   America's prosperity is inextricably tied to markets overseas,
and ``we stand ready to help countries that develop policies to
keep their economy strong,'' Clinton said in Saturday' weekly radio
address. And while a Japanese Parliament vote to pump billions of
dollars into that country's troubled banks was welcome news, he
said, it's not enough.
	   ``Now it's critical to avoid further delay by moving quickly and
using that money most effectively. ... Now the health of Asia's
economy _ and indeed the world _ depends upon Japan,'' Clinton
said.
	   After intense negotiations over an omnibus budget bill yielded a
victory for Clinton on IMF funds late last week, the president used
his radio broadcast from the Oval Office to take another dig at
congressional Republicans for holding them up during a global
crisis.
	   The money will leverage dlrs 90 billion in new aid to teetering
foreign economies, Clinton said. ``Although I'm pleased we've
accomplished this, eight days of progress cannot entirely make up
for eight months of partisanship,'' he said.
	   In exchange for agreeing to the full dlrs 17.9 billion, the
Republican majority insisted that the U.S. contribution come with
strings attached: shorter loans at higher interest rates and more
public deliberations by the board of directors of the 182-nation
lending institution.
	   The spending legislation is expected to pass Congress this week.
Looking ahead to signing that massive budget package, Clinton said
Saturday:
	   ``Now the IMF is stronger and ready to act. We must make certain
that when it acts, it acts to promote global growth and to limit
the reach of financial crisis. In turn, this will foster a stronger
economy here at home and help our own workers, farmers and
ranchers.
	   ``It is an insurance policy for our own economy.''
	   Meanwhile, Clinton signed defense authorization and spending
bills Saturday for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. He voiced
reservations, however, over a provision in the dlrs 270.5 billion
spending bill, which requires him to report to Congress before any
military involvement in Albania, Macedonia or the Serbian province
Kosovo.
	   Clinton, threatening NATO airstrikes unless Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic halts violence in Kosovo, said in a statement:
``I shall interpret (the provision) to apply only to the deployment
of additional ground forces.''
	   He added that he would implement the measure consistent with his
authority as commander in chief ``and not in a manner that would
encumber my constitutional authority.''
	   The legislation that Clinton signed also raises military pay by
3.6 percent, supports Clinton's decision to keep U.S. troops in
Bosnia and imposes new curbs on satellite exports.

Final settlement nears on Peru-Ecuador border dispute

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A final settlement to a border dispute
that has plagued Peru and Ecuador for half a century could be
announced next week, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said Saturday.
	   Peru and Ecuador have agreed in advance to accept any settlement
proposed by the four guarantor nations of a 1942 treaty that ended
the War of the Pacific between the two countries.
	   A dispute over a small section of their Amazon jungle border has
erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 1995. Tensions
flared again in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of
entering its territory.
	   Cardoso said the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile, Argentina
and the United States _ were putting the finishing touches on their
proposed settlement while attending an Ibero-American summit in
this northern Portuguese port.
	   Presidents from the three Latin American countries met here
Saturday with Presidents Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, who reconfirmed their legislatures had approved
accepting an imposed solution.
	   ``We have ordered the negotiators to work quickly, and I
estimate a proposal ought to be placed on the table by next week,''
Cardoso told reporters.
	   He said the proposal would respect the national sovereignty of
each nation and will provide ``what we all desire, which is
peace.''
	   A quick solution was anticipated when the Peru and Ecuador
legislatures approved proposals Friday from their respective
presidents to accept any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
disputed area.
	   Fujimori and Mahaud met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help find a
solution to the dispute. They told him they had made substantial
progress toward completing a peace agreement, but remained at odds
over delineating the actual border area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Taliban free 25 Iranian prisoners in 'good will' gesture

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
freed 25 Iranian captives on Saturday ``as a gesture of good
will,'' Radio Shariat reported.
	   The Taliban's radio broadcast, monitored in neighboring
Pakistan, said the International Red Cross sent an aircraft to the
Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar, picked up the freed
Iranians and returned them to Iran.
	   Twenty-six truck drivers arrived at an airport outside Tehran
later Saturday on two planes of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, according to Iran's official news agency. The
discrepancy in numbers could not be immediately be explained.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said that with the release of
the 26, the Taliban had freed a total of 51 Iranians.
	   The Iranians were captured in August during the Taliban's bloody
takeover of the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Renegade
soldiers killed eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist
during the fighting.
	   The killings caused a chill in relations with neighboring Iran,
which massed more than 200,000 soldiers on its eastern border with
Afghanistan and sent hundreds of tanks and scores of fighter jets
there.
	   The first batch of five truck drivers were released days after
the Taliban admitted the diplomats' killing in early September. The
Taliban seized the truck drivers while they were carrying
``humanitarian goods'' to northern Afghanistan, the Iranian news
agency said. It gave no details about the men's health.

Leeward Islands' poor batting opens door for Trinidad

 &UR; Eds: Will UPDATE with final results &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Trinidad leg spinners Dinanath
Ramnarine and Kenneth Hazel triggered a Leeward Islands
middle-order collapse Saturday that saw six wickets fall for 26
runs, limiting the islanders to 171 for nine in their Red Stripe
Bowl semifinal.
	   After the Leeward Islands was coasting a 100 for one, Hazel
started the slide by capturing two for 25 and Ramnarine, who will
tour with the West Indies in South Africa next month, claimed three
wickets for 17 runs.
	   The winner will meet Guyana in the final on Monday.
	   All the scores came in 41 overs, the revised total after early
morning rain caused a 90-minute delay to the start.
	   Captain Stuart Williams and Keith Arthurton paced Leewards early
surge, reaching the century mark in only 20 overs. But the side
collapsed after it lost Williams, caught and bolwed by pacer Ian
Bishop, for a top score of 54.
	   Williams had nine boundaries in his innings off 85 deliveries.
	   Arthurton went shortly thereafter for 21. It took a late-order
flurry from wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs, who made 29, and
all-rounder Anthony Lake, who made 17, to push the champions to a
respectable score.

Burg: Ten European countries not planning on sharing Nazi gold with
</HEADLINE>
Jews &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The head of an organization that has battled
for the return of Holocaust survivors' assets said Saturday that
ten European nations have decided to distribute about six tons of
looted Nazi gold among themselves without conferring with Jewish
organizations.
	   Avraham Burg, co-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, said in a statement released to the press, that the
countries decided not to include Jewish organizations in dispersing
the gold which has been stored in the vaults of the Federal Reserve
Bank in New York and the Bank of England in London.
	   According to an aide to Burg, it was decided at the 41-nation
conference that tried to trace the trail of looted Nazi gold in
London last December, that the U.S.-British-French Tripartite Gold
Commission panel would examine if any of part of the six tons of
gold rightfully belonged to the Jewish people before any dispersal
was decided on.
	   ``We will find the way to prevent this theft, to trace the
amount which belongs to the Jews and to return it its owners,''
Burg said in the statement.
	   Burg was traveling and could not be reached for additional
comment.
	   Some Jewish groups insist that the leftover gold form the core
of a fund to compensate Holocaust victims.
	   For 50 years, the Tripartite Gold Commission returned hundreds
of tons of stolen gold to countries plundered by Nazi Germany.
	   The Tripartite Commission is funded from the 5.5 tons of gold
that remains. This was to have been distributed among 10 countries
that have received Tripartite gold: Belgium, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, Greece, Austria, Albania,
Yugoslavia and Italy.
	   These are the countries Burg claimed have signed an agreement to
disperse the remaining gold among themselves.
	   At December's conference in London, participants agreed to seek
financial restitution for victims of Nazi persecution. The United
States set an end-of-the-century deadline for distributing cash to
Holocaust survivors, many nearing the end of their lives.

Eighty students poisoned by contaminated biscuits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eighty students were admitted to hospital
Saturday after eating contaminated biscuits in the second such case
in a week, Egypt's official news agency reported.
	   Some of the students were in a critical condition, the Middle
East News Agency said.
	   The students ate the biscuits in several schools in al-Saf, a
town in Giza province near Cairo, the agency said. It did not give
the age of the pupils.
	   The provincial governor has banned the biscuits.
	   On Oct. 11, about 1,400 children were admitted to hospital after
eating contaminated biscuits in primary, middle and secondary
schools in Darin, a village in the Nile delta province of Mansoura.
	   The authorities are investigating the source of the
contamination.

Real Madrid reclaims first place in Spanish league

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with four late games

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Predag Mijatovic scored one and set up
another Saturday, leading Real Madrid past Real Zaragoza 4-3 and
into the Spanish Primera Division lead.
	   Madrid jumped out to a 3-1 lead by the 40th minute and then had
to hang on at Zaragoza to end a two-game losing streak that dropped
it behind Zaragoza in the league standings.
	   In other games Saturday, Atletico de Madrid beat Tenerife 2-0,
Celta defeated Betis 3-0 to take third place and Villareal tied
Real Sociedad 1-1.
	   Spain's other football titan, FC Barcelona, tied Salamanca 1-1
at home to drop from third to fifth place in the standings.
	   The Catalans jumped ahead in the 58th minute on a goal from
Dutch striker Philip Cocu. Two minutes later Luis Enrique Martinez
missed a penalty shot granted after Sergio Corino fouled Vitor
Borba Ferreira, 'Rivaldo'.
	   Salamanca tied the game on a shot by midfielder Eduardo Alonso.
	   In Bilbao, Athletic Bilbao beat Valencia 2-0. Striker Ismael
Urzais scored on a header in the 26th minute and Julen Guerrero
scored in the 50th on a powerful blast from near midfield.
	   In the key matchup of the day in Zaragoza, Madrid took a 2-0
lead by the 17th minute, getting a penalty from Fernando Hierro in
the 11th minute after Zaragoza striker Marcos Vales fouled Real's
Croatian star Robert Jarni and a header by Roberto Carlos off a
cross from Jarni.
	   Yugoslav midfielder pulled Zaragoza within one in the 23rd but
Madrid keeper Bodo Illgner turned away several others, including
punching a way one chance by Roberto Miguil Acuna.
	   Mijatovic sent Raul Gonzalez through to give Madrid a 3-1 lead
five minutes before halftime, but Argentine Gustavo Lopez cut
Real's lead to one again in the 60th minute on a free kick.
	   Mijatovic appeared to put the game way in the 71st with an
arcing shot over goalkeeper Juan Miguel Garcia, but four minutes
later Argentine midfielder Kily Gonzalez pulled Zaragoza within one
again.
	   At Seville, French midfielder Claude Makelele, Portugese forward
Jorge Cadete and Juan Sanchez all scored second-half goals to give
Celta the victory and hand Betis its third loss this season.
	   At Madrid, Atletico jumped ahead on Juninho's 71st-minute
penalty and had a two-man advantage until Juninho was red carded.
	   Tenerife's Emerson was sent off for his second yellow in the
76th minute for drawing two yellow cards and teammate and
countryman Andre Luiz drew a red shortly thereafter.
	   But Juninho quickly joined them for a tackle against Yugoslav
midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic, leaving Atletico with a man advantage
for the final quarter hour.
	   It took until the second minute of injury time before it
capitalized, getting a final goal from Roberto Fresnedoso that put
Atletico in fourth place.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A final settlement to a border dispute
that has plagued Peru and Ecuador for half a century could be
announced next week, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said Saturday.
	   Peru and Ecuador have agreed in advance to accept any settlement
proposed by the four guarantor nations of a 1942 treaty that ended
the War of the Pacific between the two countries.
	   A dispute over a small section of their Amazon jungle border has
erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 1995. Tensions
flared again in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of
entering its territory.
	   Cardoso said the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile, Argentina
and the United States _ were putting the finishing touches on their
proposed settlement while attending an Ibero-American summit in
this northern Portuguese port.
	   Presidents from the three Latin American countries met here
Saturday with Presidents Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, who reconfirmed their legislatures had approved
accepting an imposed solution.
	   ``We have ordered the negotiators to work quickly, and I
estimate a proposal ought to be placed on the table by next week,''
Cardoso told reporters.
	   He said the proposal would respect the national sovereignty of
each nation and will provide ``what we all desire, which is
peace.''
	   A quick solution was anticipated when the Peru and Ecuador
legislatures approved proposals Friday from their respective
presidents to accept any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
disputed area.
	   Fujimori and Mahaud met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help find a
solution to the dispute. They told him they had made substantial
progress toward completing a peace agreement, but remained at odds
over delineating the actual border area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Leaders from 19 Latin American nations,
Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an
Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession
unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial
system.
	   The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil shows
that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the difficulties
affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.''
	   The declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations. The
Group of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
	   The final declaration will be approved at Sunday's summit in
this port city in northern Portugal.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that
Brazil and China, two of the world's largest economies, had become
the ``dikes of resistance'' to global recession.
	   Protecting their economies from the spreading economic turmoil,
which is affecting more countries than at any time since the early
1980s, is key to world economic stability, he said.
	   Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest
in the world, and its economic collapse could take the rest of the
continent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso
is preparing austerity measures including spending cuts, tax hikes
and lower interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for
an International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30
billion.
	   The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137
billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago
and then spread from Asia to Russia.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware of the
impact that a Latin American recession would have on the United
States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank to support
Brazil after it was hit by investor flight.

Congolese president Kabila makes quick visit to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The president of the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Laurent Kabila, flew to Khartoum on Saturday for talks with
Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, Sudan's national radio reported.
	   El-Bashir ``reiterated Sudan's condemnation of the combined
Ugandan-Rwandan invasion of the Congo and said that Sudan would
support the Congo in international forums and defend its
sovereignty,'' Radio Omdurman said.
	   Kabila's government has accused Uganda and Rwanda of sending
troops to eastern Congo to support insurgents.
	   Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo but says they
are defending its border from rebels. Rwanda says it reserves the
right to intervene against attacks from Rwandan Hutu rebels.
	   In turn, Congolese rebel commanders have accused Sudan of
sending forces to support the Kabila government. Sudan denies
involvement in Congo.
	   Before flying home late Saturday, Kabila visited the el-Shifa
pharmaceutical factory in north Khartoum which the United States
destroyed in a missile attack on Aug. 20. Washington said the plant
produced the ingredients of chemical weapons _ a charge denied by
Sudan and the factory's owners.

Final settlement nears on Peru-Ecuador border dispute

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A final settlement to a border dispute
that has plagued Peru and Ecuador for half a century could be
announced next week, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said Saturday.
	   Peru and Ecuador have agreed in advance to accept any settlement
proposed by the four guarantor nations of a 1942 treaty that ended
the War of the Pacific between the two countries.
	   A dispute over a small section of their Amazon jungle border has
erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 1995. Tensions
flared again in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of
entering its territory.
	   Cardoso said the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile, Argentina
and the United States _ were putting the finishing touches on their
proposed settlement while preparing for an Ibero-American summit
Sunday in this northern Portuguese port.
	   Presidents from the three Latin American countries met here
Saturday with Presidents Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, who confirmed that their legislatures had
approved accepting an imposed solution.
	   ``We have ordered the negotiators to work quickly, and I
estimate a proposal ought to be placed on the table by next week,''
Cardoso said.
	   He said the proposal would respect the national sovereignty of
each nation and will provide ``what we all desire, which is
peace.''
	   A quick solution was anticipated when the Peru and Ecuador
legislatures approved proposals Friday from their respective
presidents to accept any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
disputed area.
	   Fujimori and Mahaud met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help solve the
dispute. They told him they had made substantial progress toward
completing a peace agreement but remained at odds over delineating
the actual border area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Status of Milosevic's promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Status of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's Oct. 27 deadline
or face renewed threat of airstrikes:
	   _Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   No major fighting has been reported this month in the southern
Serbian province, but both sides reported shooting incidents
Saturday. Serb police claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists''
attacked them more than a dozen times across Kosovo. Ethnic
Albanians blamed Serbs for at least two incidents, saying police in
the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac opened fire.
	   _Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before crackdown
began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes began flying over Kosovo on Saturday to check
status of pullouts. On Friday, despite withdrawals, NATO said more
Serb troops and police remain in the province than are permitted.
	   _Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for start of talks has been announced. Both sides have
held separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Ethnic
Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in Turkey to
discuss taking a united stand on independence or autonomy.
	   _Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   U.N. refugee agency and others resumed aid convoys in past
several days, and some workers say Serb police were less
obstructive.
	   _Cooperating with International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators received Yugoslav visas and plan
to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   An advance team for monitors, to be overseen by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived Saturday in
Belgrade, and another small group arrived in Kosovo from Bosnia.
OSCE said it hoped a sizable number of monitors would be in Kosovo
in two weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived
Saturday, as efforts to ensure Yugoslavia pulls its forces back
advanced in the air and on the ground.
	   A day after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days
to fulfill a peace pledge, Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels blamed
each other in new shooting attacks, including one that killed three
Serb police Saturday night.
	   But Western officials said there were signs the government was
gradually complying with international demands aimed at ending the
turmoil.
	   While its warplanes stand by in case Milosevic breaks his word,
NATO began an aerial surveillance mission by sending U-2 planes
high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights on Thursday as part
of the package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the
secessionist province of Serbia.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic is pulling back at least
two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander Wesley
Clarke on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic to fully
comply in order to avoid airstrikes was to expire Saturday morning,
NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clarke returns to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to Yugoslav
officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,'' said the
White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   An advance team of specialists for the mission of 2,000 ground
monitors arrived in Yugoslavia on Saturday to do setup work.
Thirteen staffers flew into Belgrade and another small group
arrived in Kosovo from Bosnia later.
	   ``We're going to look for the mother of all buildings,'' said
Peter Erben, the head of the Bosnia team, alluding to one of the
main likely problems of the mission _ finding enough living and
working space.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the 54-nation OSCE, said in
Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to have a sizable number of
monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   In one of the worst incidents this month, three Serb policemen
were found killed late Saturday after what their colleagues said
was a KLA grenade attack on the house they occupied along a main
Kosovo road in Orlate, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Two other police were seriously wounded, they said.
	   Reporters who drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied bodies
on the second floor of the house.
	   The Serb Media Center claimed earlier that KLA ``extremists''
had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces across Kosovo
since late Friday, using machine guns, mortars and grenades and
wounding at least two Serbs.
	   ``That's what they are trying to do _ use the agreement to open
fire on us,'' said
	   A Serb police commander at the police checkpoint at Dragobilje
said the rebels are trying to ``use the agreement to open fire on
us.''
	   ``They want to provoke us into a response, and get NATO to
attack,'' said the commander, who goes by the nom de guerre Baja.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
ncidents, saying police in Vranjevac had opened fire, hitting
several Albanian houses and a car.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   Humanitarian organizations have stepped up efforts to get aid to
the refugees before winter sets in.

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A surge in the
mosquito population has closed one school and prompted the
government to warn of a possible outbreak of dengue fever, though
no cases have been reported yet.
	   ``Residents should take the necessary preventative measures to
protect themselves and their families,'' said Dr. Noel Carr,
director of the government-run health clinic in Frederiksted.
	   An outbreak of dengue fever, which is caused by a virus carried
by mosquitoes, often follows a surge in the population of the
insects. The mosquito population has increased since Hurricane
Georges passed over the islands on Sept. 21. Rainfall that leaves
puddles provides a breeding place for mosquitoes.
	   The government has begun spraying pesticides on St. Thomas and
St. John but will spray on St. Croix only when requested by
residents, said the territory's environmental health director,
Laura Hassell.
	   ``Certain people complained that the chemical was killing their
dogs, was killing their fish, is giving them rashes,'' Hassell
said.
	   She discounted those claims and said the pesticide used, Ultra
Low Dose DP-100, is safe. But because of the complaints, St. Croix
residents must sign a waiver before pesticides are sprayed near
their homes.
	   Officials were forced to close one school in St. Thomas when
teachers walked off the job, saying the mosquitoes made the
building unbearable.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd and last grafs to UPDATE with three Serb police
killed, some advance team members in Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Saturday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's
deadline _ pushed back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   Both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday, and Serb police
claimed ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked them more than a dozen
times across Kosovo in an effort to provoke them and draw NATO
airstrikes. Reporters saw the bodies of three police killed in what
the Serbs said was a KLA grenade attack southwest of Pristina.
	   _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes began flying over Kosovo on Saturday to check on
the status of pullouts. On Friday, despite withdrawals, NATO said
more Serb troops and police remain in the province than are
permitted.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. The two sides
have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill. Ethnic Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in
Turkey to discuss taking a united stand on independence or
autonomy.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys for
the past several days, and some workers say Serb police have been
less obstructive.
	   _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   First members of an advance team for the monitors, to be
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, arrived in Kosovo. OSCE said it hoped a sizable number of
monitors would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived
Saturday, as efforts to ensure Yugoslavia pulls its forces back
advanced in the air and on the ground.
	   A day after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days
to fulfill a peace pledge, Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels blamed
each other in new shooting attacks, including one that killed three
Serb police Saturday night.
	   But Western officials said there were signs the government was
gradually complying with international demands aimed at ending the
turmoil.
	   While its warplanes stand by in case Milosevic breaks his word,
NATO began an aerial surveillance mission by sending U-2 planes
high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights on Thursday as part
of the package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the
secessionist province of Serbia.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic is pulling back at least
two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander Wesley
Clarke on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic to fully
comply in order to avoid airstrikes was to expire Saturday morning,
NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clarke returns to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to Yugoslav
officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,'' said the
White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   An advance team of specialists for the mission of 2,000 ground
monitors arrived in Yugoslavia on Saturday to do setup work.
Thirteen staffers flew into Belgrade and another small group
arrived in Kosovo from Bosnia later.
	   ``We're going to look for the mother of all buildings,'' said
Peter Erben, the head of the Bosnia team, alluding to one of the
main likely problems of the mission _ finding enough living and
working space.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the 54-nation OSCE, said in
Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to have a sizable number of
monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   In one of the worst incidents this month, three Serb policemen
were found killed late Saturday after what their colleagues said
was a KLA grenade attack on the house they occupied along a main
Kosovo road in Orlate, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Two other police were seriously wounded, they said.
	   Reporters who drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied bodies
on the second floor of the house.
	   The Serb Media Center claimed earlier that KLA ``extremists''
had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces across Kosovo
since late Friday, using machine guns, mortars and grenades and
wounding at least two Serbs.
	   A Serb police commander at the police checkpoint at Dragobilje
said the rebels are trying to ``use the agreement to open fire on
us.''
	   ``They want to provoke us into a response, and get NATO to
attack,'' said the commander, who goes by the nom de guerre Baja.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
ncidents, saying police in Vranjevac had opened fire, hitting
several Albanian houses and a car.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   Humanitarian organizations have stepped up efforts to get aid to
the refugees before winter sets in.

Iraq's Tariq Aziz accuses U.N. monitors in Iraq of spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has
accused the remaining U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq of spying and
urged the U.N. secretary general to stop their ``dangerous
practices,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
	   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Aziz demanded an
investigation into the practices of about 40 U.N. arms monitors who
are still working in Iraq, according to the agency.
	   The agency did not say when the letter was sent and officials in
Aziz's office could not be reached on the weekend.
	   Iraq has frozen spot inspections by U.N. arms monitors since
Aug. 5, effectively paralyzing the search for its illegal
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The remaining 40 inspectors and their support staff of about 60
are allowed to visit only those weapons sites where the United
Nations already has surveillance equipment installed.
	   Aziz wrote that even activities by these monitors border on
espionage, the agency reported.
	   U.N. arms officials in Baghdad were not available for comment.
	   Aziz accused the monitors of trying to photograph troop
movements, of asking for the names of Iraqis who hold high degrees,
and of demanding an inventory of Iraq's water resources.
	   ``Demanding special and new information about personnel, vital
activities or strategic establishments closely linked to the
security of the Iraqi people and its future (is an example) of
these dangerous practices,'' Aziz wrote.
	   ``There is no justification for getting information on all the
water resources ... Our conviction is that insistence on demanding
such information is nothing but an act of espionage.''
	   Iraq has long called for a halt to the U.N. inspections, saying
it no longer possesses banned weaponry. But the inspectors' reports
have accused the Baghdad government of withholding significant
information.
	   The trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will not be lifted until Baghdad shows it has eliminated its
illegal arms.

Real Madrid reclaims first place

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games; Stands as 2nd Ld-Writethru to
European lines to RESTORE first Zaragoza goal scorer. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Predag Mijatovic scored one and set up
another Saturday, leading Real Madrid past Real Zaragoza 4-3 and
into the Spanish Primera Division lead.
	   Madrid jumped out to a 3-1 lead by the 40th minute and then had
to hang on at Zaragoza to end a two-game losing streak that dropped
it behind Zaragoza in the league standings.
	   In other games Saturday, Atletico Madrid beat Tenerife 2-0,
Celta defeated Betis 3-0 to take third place, Villareal tied Real
Sociedad 1-1, FC Barcelona was held to a 1-1 draw by Salamanca at
home, Athletic Bilbao beat Valencia 2-0, and Celta rolled over
Betis 3-0.
	   At Zaragoza, Madrid took a 2-0 lead by the 17th minute, getting
a penalty from Fernando Hierro in the 11th minute after Zaragoza
striker Marcos Vales fouled Real's Croatian star Robert Jarni, and
a header by Roberto Carlos off a cross from Jarni.
	   Yugoslav midfielder Savo Milosevic pulled Zaragoza within one in
the 23rd but Madrid keeper Bodo Illgner turned away several others,
including punching away one chance by Roberto Miguil Acuna.
	   Mijatovic sent Raul Gonzalez through to give Madrid a 3-1 lead
five minutes before halftime, but Argentine Gustavo Lopez cut
Real's lead to one again in the 60th minute on a free kick.
	   Mijatovic appeared to put the game way in the 71st with an
arcing shot over goalkeeper Juan Miguel Garcia, but four minutes
later Argentine midfielder Kily Gonzalez pulled Zaragoza within one
again.
 &UR; Celta 3, Betis 0 &QC; 
	   At Seville, French midfielder Claude Makelele, Portugese forward
Jorge Cadete and Juan Sanchez all scored second-half goals to give
Celta the victory and hand Betis its third loss this season.
 &UR; Atletico 2, Tenerife 0 &QC; 
	   At Madrid, Atletico jumped ahead on Juninho's 71st-minute
penalty and had a two-man advantage until Juninho was red carded.
	   Tenerife's Emerson was sent off for his second yellow in the
76th minute for drawing two yellow cards and teammate and
countryman Andre Luiz drew a red shortly thereafter.
	   But Juninho quickly joined them for a tackle against Yugoslav
midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic, leaving Atletico with a man advantage
for the final quarter hour.
	   It took until the second minute of injury time before it
capitalized, getting a final goal from Roberto Fresnedoso that put
Atletico in fourth place.
 &UR; Barcelona 1, Salamanca 1 &QC; 
	   In Barcelona, a missed penalty by Luis Enrique cost Barcelona
dearly when Eduardo Alonso scored in the 62nd minute and gave
Salamanca a 1-1 draw.
	   The Catalans jumped ahead in the 58th minute on a goal from
Dutch striker Philip Cocu. But two minutes later Enrique missed his
penalty attempt after Sergio Corino fouled Rivaldo.
	   Although the draw kept Barcelona as one of only two unbeatens in
the Spanish first division, it was its fourth tie (2-4-0-) and
dropped it from third to fifth. Mallorca is the only other unbeaten
team.
 &UR; Athletic Bilbao 2, Valencia 0 &QC; 
	   In Bilbao, Striker Ismael Urzais scored on a header in the 26th
minute and Julen Guerrero scored in the 50th on a powerful blast
from near midfield.
 &UR; Villareal 1, Real Sociedad 1 &QC; 
	   At Villareal, Antonio Diaz scored in the 61st minute to keep it
just ahead ov Sociedad on goal differential. Francisco Jose de
Pedro gave Sociedad the lead in the 32nd.

	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Swirling floodwaters threatened to
submerge nearly 100 villages in a southern Indian state on
Saturday, officials said.
	   At least 80 people were feared dead, either drowned or crushed
under collapsed houses, and more than 50,000 panicky villagers
crowded into trucks and boats in an attempt to flee the encroaching
waters.
	   In the districts of Krishna, Guntur and Nalgonda, nearly 100,000
people have already been evacuated to higher ground. Police
forcibly removed some residents who didn't want to leave their
homes.
	   Government officials in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh
state, said the floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains that
overflowed the Krishna river.
	   Two air force helicopters dropped food and waters bottles to
flood-hit villages, said B.P. Acharya, relief commissioner in the
state.
	   In the Diviseema region, the Krishna river submerged the only
road link to a cluster of 30 villages, marooning almost 20,000
people.
	   Cotton, tobacco and paddy rice crops and banana plantations have
been devastated on nearly half a million acres, Acharya said.
	   With a long coast line, the state is often hit by floods and
cyclones. In 1996, a fierce cyclone killed more than 2,000 people.

Conference looks at ways to protect Caribbean's fragile reefs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ U.S. islands in the
Caribbean are leading the way in the effort to preserve coral
reefs, but enforcement of protective laws is still lax and reefs
are easily lost.
	   Those were among the conclusions from a conference of scientists
and resource managers from eight southern U.S. states, Puerto Rico,
Jamaica and the Virgin Islands that concluded here this weekend.
	   ``The U.S. islands have taken the lead in the country on coral
reef protection,'' said Joseph A. Uravitch, chief of the Coastal
programs Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. But there is still much scientists don't understand
about reefs. They just know how easily they can be lost.
	   A little too much rain, a little too much runoff, seawater a few
degrees too warm, a few carelessly dropped boat anchors _ these are
just a few of the many influences that can upset the fragile
balance that keeps coral reefs thriving.
	   Reefs are a balanced community of plants and animals ranging
from fish to algae, said Ralf H. Boulon, an endangered species
coordinator with the U.S. Virgin Islands parks service.
	   ``All are part of the chain, part of the balance,'' said Boulon.
``We don't know the role that each organism plays in a reef.
Normally you only find out when one of these animals disappears.''
	   Humans cause many of the threats. Removal of mangroves
eliminates natural filtering and lets sediment into the sea.
Pollution and runoff kill reefs. Damage from boats and even
tourists breaking off pieces of coral for souvenirs have taken a
toll.
	   ``Coral reefs around the world are all in trouble, they are all
declining,'' said Michael Crosby of NOAA. ``There's a lot of stress
from changes in the ecosystem.''
	   The Virgin Islands is among the areas trying to preserve its
reefs, and is having at least some success, said Virdin Brown,
assistant commissioner for the territory's parks and natural
resources division.
	   ``We have a better management of coastal pollution than many
jurisdictions across the United States because of recent
legislation and increasing controls over wastewater runoff,'' said
Brown.
	   While the laws are on the books, enforcement needs improvement,
however, said Boulon.
	   ``I would say we're somewhere in the middle in terms of reef
protection efforts,'' he said.

Report: Turkey and Syria to begin security talks Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey and Syria will hold direct talks on
Turkish Kurd insurgents, beginning Monday, Egypt's official news
agency said Saturday.
	   The talks will start either in the Turkish capital, Ankara, or
in the Syrian one, Damascus, the Middle East News Agency said. The
delegations would be headed by high-ranking security officials.
	   The agency did not give a source for its report and officials
could be reached for confirmation Saturday.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak played a leading role in
mediating the long-running dispute that flared up on Oct. 6 when
Ankara delivered what it termed a `final warning' to Damascus over
Syria's alleged support for Turkish Kurd insurgents.
	   Monday's discussions will focus on Turkey's demand that Syria
clamp down on the activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party or
PKK, the agency said.
	   Ankara accuses Damascus of allowing PKK guerrillas to cross into
southeastern Turkey from northern Syria and to train in camps in
parts of Lebanon under Syrian military control. Syria denies the
accusations and in turn accuses Turkey of taking an unfair share of
the water of the Euphrates river.
	   Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told reporters Oct. 13
that Syria appeared to have shut down Kurdish camps in eastern
Lebanon. The announcement indicated an easing of tension.

Notre Dame launches major project in capital of peaceful Irish
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The University of Notre Dame unveiled its
impressive new Dublin headquarters Saturday, far and away the most
substantial project undertaken by an American college in Ireland.
	   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern welcomed more than 100 university
officials and the 33 American students already studying in Dublin
under the auspices of the Keough-Notre Dame Study Center, opened as
part of a dlrs 13 million project principally funded by
Irish-American alumnus Donald Keough.
	   The program's classrooms and offices are on the top floor of
what was once the Catholic University of Ireland, a building of
restored Victorian splendor overlooking St. Stephen's Green.
	   ``To breathe life into this historic building is frankly
thrilling,'' said Keough, former president of Coca-Cola Corp. and
current chairman of investment bankers Allen and Co. Inc.
	   Keough noted that his ongoing funding of a Keough Institute of
Irish Studies at Notre Dame's South Bend, Indiana, campus left his
ambitions ``only half done.''
	   ``Students are already coming to Notre Dame to explore their
Irish background and history,'' he said. ``Not to allow some of
them the chance to experience modern Ireland itself would be tragic
and foolish when there's the resources to do so.''
	   University President Edward Malloy said Notre Dame began sending
business students to University College Dublin six years ago. Plans
to open a permanent Dublin mission with the university's own
lecturers accelerated after Notre Dame and Navy staged a football
game in the Irish capital in 1995.
	   ``The aim is to create a legitimate international vehicle for
Irish studies, in genuine partnership with Irish academics,'' he
said, noting that the university hopes to send about 100 students
to Ireland annually _ the only U.S. institution with such a
commitment.
	   The students themselves seem enthusiastic about living and
learning in the center of one of Europe's most sociable and rapidly
expanding cities. Most are attending University College Dublin
classes through December, others until May.
	   ``I've been amazed to see all these American companies, most of
which evidently have arrived on the scene in the recent past,''
said commerce student David Frick, a pony-tailed 20-year-old from
Elkhart, Ind. ``It's obvious why they're calling Ireland the
`Celtic Tiger.'''
	   At an afternoon ceremony on the Trinity campus, Notre Dame
Provost Nathan Hatch paid tribute to Ahern as the person who had
helped ``revive a stalled peace process'' after his June 1997
election as prime minister.
	   Referring to the April accord reached in Belfast by eight
parties and the British and Irish governments, Hatch said,
gesturing to Ahern beside him: ``The Good Friday agreement will
always stand as a monument to his outstanding contribution to Irish
life.''
	   A disappointing if understandable no-show was John Hume,
Northern Ireland's most prominent Catholic leader, who was a joint
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his central role in promoting
the Belfast negotiations.
	   Later the staff and students held a dedication Mass in the
University College Dublin church beside the new center.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived
Saturday, as efforts to ensure Yugoslavia pulls its forces back
advanced in the air and on the ground.
	   A day after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days
to fulfill a peace pledge, Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels blamed
each other in new shooting attacks, including one that killed three
Serb police Saturday night.
	   But Western officials said the government was showing signs of
gradually complying with international demands aimed at ending the
turmoil.
	   While its warplanes stand by in case Milosevic breaks his word,
NATO began an aerial surveillance mission by sending U-2 planes
high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights on Thursday as part
of the package of agreements worked out to end the turmoil in the
secessionist province of Serbia, its largest republic.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic is pulling back at least
two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander Wesley
Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic to fully
comply in order to avoid airstrikes was to expire Saturday morning,
NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark returns to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to Yugoslav
officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,'' said the
White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

	   Status of compliance by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
with conditions he must meet by NATO's Oct. 27 deadline or face
renewed threat of airstrikes:
	   _Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   Both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday, and Serb police
claimed ethnic Albanian rebels had attacked them more than a dozen
times across Kosovo in an effort to provoke them and draw NATO
airstrikes. Reporters saw the bodies of three police killed in what
the Serbs said was a KLA grenade attack southwest of Pristina.
	   _Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before crackdown
began Feb. 28:
	   NATO surveillance planes began flying over Kosovo on Saturday to
check status of pullouts. On Friday, despite withdrawals, NATO said
more Serb troops and police remain in the province than are
permitted.
	   _Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for start of talks has been announced. Both sides have
held separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Ethnic
Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in Turkey to
discuss taking a united stand on independence or autonomy.
	   _Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   U.N. refugee agency and others resumed aid convoys in past
several days, and some workers say Serb police were less
obstructive.
	   _Cooperating with International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators received Yugoslav visas and plan
to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   First members of an advance team for the monitors, to be
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, arrived in Kosovo. OSCE said it hoped a sizable number of
monitors would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.

 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago earned a place in
the final of the Red Stripe Bowl one-day cricket tournament
Saturday by beating champions the Leeward Islands on a faster
scoring rate at the Kaiser Sports Club.
	   The Trinidadians had scored 137 for five wickets in 31.3 overs
when their batsmen accepted the umpires' offer for bad light. Rain
prevented further action.
	   Because the Leewards had scored 129 for seven at a similar stage
in their innings, Trinidad and Tobago were declared winners and
will play Guyana in the final Monday.
	   For the second day in succession, the elements forced the
abandonment of a match. On Friday, Guyana defeated Barbados by
virtue of having a higher net run-rate, after rain forced an end to
play midway through the Bajan innings.
	   Chasing the Leewards score of 172 for nine, Trinidad and Tobago
received an early jolt when Andre Lawrence was dismissed by Curtly
Ambrose in the first over.
	   But positive batting from Suruj Ragoonath and Darren Ganga
carried the score to 70 before Ragoonath was stumped in the 19th
over by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs off offspinner Anthony Lake for
39.
	   Captain Brian Lara then took the attack to the Leewards bowlers,
belting his way to 41 before he was bowled by part-time bowler
Wilden Cornwall. Lara's dismissal, with the score on 135, triggered
a mini collapse with Ganga being run out for 44 and Phil Simmons
going for a duck.
	   Earlier, the Trinidadians, who won the toss, picked up six
wickets for 26 runs to restrict the Leewards to their modest total.
After a 68-run second wicket partnership between captain Stuart
Williams and Keith Arthurton had set the champions on course for a
big score, they lost wickets steadily to the spin duo of Dinanath
Ramnarine and Kenneth Hazel.
	   Ramnarine was the pick of the Trinidad attack claiming three
wickets for 17 runs. Hazel who started the slide, captured two for
25. Williams topscored with 54, which contained nine boundaries.

Trinidad was still short of the Leeward Islands' 172 for nine, but

first over.
	   But Suruj Ragoonath and Darren Ganga revived Trinidad and
carried the score to 70 before Ragoonath was stumped in the 19th
over by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs off offspinner Anthony Lake for
39.
	   Captain Brian Lara then took the attack to the Leewards bowlers,
belting his way to 41 before he was bowled by part-time bowler
Wilden Cornwall. Lara's dismissal, with the score on 135, triggered
a mini collapse with Ganga being run out for 44 and Phil Simmons
going for a duck.
	   Earlier, the Trinidadians, who won the toss, picked up six
wickets for 26 runs to restrict the Leewards to their modest total.
After a 68-run second wicket partnership between captain Stuart
Williams and Keith Arthurton had set the champions on course for a
big score, they lost wickets steadily to the spin duo of Dinanath
Ramnarine and Kenneth Hazel.
	   Ramnarine was the pick of the Trinidad attack claiming three
wickets for 17 runs. Hazel who started the slide, captured two for
25. Williams topscored with 54, which contained nine boundaries.

 &UR; VIRGIN ISLANDS: Conference looks at region's fragile reefs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ U.S. islands in the
Caribbean are leading the way in the effort to preserve coral
reefs, but enforcement of protective laws is still lax and reefs
are easily lost.
	   Those were among the conclusions from a conference of scientists
and resource managers from eight southern U.S. states, Puerto Rico,
Jamaica and the Virgin Islands that concluded here this weekend.
	   ``The U.S. islands have taken the lead in the country on coral
reef protection,'' said Joseph A. Uravitch, chief of the Coastal
programs Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. But there is still much scientists don't understand
about reefs.
 &UR; GUYANA: Caribbean Community Bureau sets agenda for Wednesday
meeting
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Topics will range from the devastation
of Hurricane Georges to the attempted split of St. Kitts and Nevis
to the millennium computer bug when the Caribbean Community Bureau
meets Wednesday.
	   The bureau, which handles the affairs of the Caribbean Community
regional organization, will meet Wednesday in Grenada, the Caricom
Secretariat said Saturday.
	   The recovery from Hurricane Georges remains the top priority for
several member states, including Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti and St.
Kitts and Nevis.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: American charged with killing two Germans
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ An American has been
charged with killing a German couple and paying three Dominicans to
bury their bodies in front of their home in this Caribbean country,
police said Saturday.
	   Peter and Barbara Herman were reported missing a month ago when
they did not make a planned trip to Germany, said police spokesman
Col. Simon Diaz. Their bodies were found buried in the sand in
front of their home in Juan Dolio, a tourism-based town about 30
miles (50 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo.
	   Police have arrested a U.S. citizen, Dennis Manley, 46, and
charged him with murdering the two Germans. Investigators were led
to Manley after they questioned Martin de la Rosa Laureano, a
Dominican who worked for the victims, said Diaz.
	   De la Rosa told police he witnessed the killing and Manley paid
him and two other men, brothers Socimo and Ramon Castro, 20,000
Dominican pesos (dlrs 1,300 U.S.) each to bury the bodies.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Sammy Sosa day in New York makes Dominicans proud
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Baseball fans focused on Yankee Stadium Saturday
night, but just hours before the World Series began New Yorkers
welcomed an out-of-town hero like one of their own.
	   Tens of thousands of fans, many of them Dominican-Americans,
roared cheers at Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa as the city
treated him to a parade through the ``Canyon of Heroes'' in lower
Manhattan.
	   Immigrants waved Dominican flags to honor one of the Caribbean
nation's favorite sons, and fans yelled ``Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!'' as
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave Sosa a key to the city.
	   Sosa's 66 home runs and his record-breaking race with St. Louis
Cardinals hitter Mark McGwire electrified this year's baseball
season.
	   ``A lot of people portray Hispanics, particularly Dominicans, as
the kid on the corner selling drugs,'' said Margie Bermudez, of
Jersey City, N.J. ``We need someone positive, and right now Sosa's
there, to show ... we have ambition, we have dreams. ... A lot of
poor kids, he gives them ambition to do more for their lives.''

Chileans on Pinochet arrest: some happy, others angry, all baffled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 19th graf with army communique. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By FEDERICO QUILODRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ In moods ranging from fury to relief,
Chileans reacted Saturday to the arrest in London of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former dictator whose ruthless regime was widely
criticized for its human rights record. The government issued a
formal protest.
	   One response on the streets of the country's capital appeared
unanimous: astonishment that the man who ruled Chile for almost 17
years was now in such a difficult position.
	   British police arrested Pinochet on a Spanish extradition
warrant in the murder of Spaniards during his years in power.
	   ``It is very good news for us,'' said Viviana Diaz, a member of
an organization of Chileans who disappeared after being arrested by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``We had asked the British government to allow Pinochet to be
questioned because that's probably our only chance to get him to
answer about the fate of our loved ones.''
	   According to the civilian government that succeeded the general
in 1990, 1,102 dissidents remain unaccounted for after Pinochet's
security forces detained them.
	   Jaime Munoz, who sells building materials, was delighted at the
former general's detention.
	   ``That's great news. Finally someone, like (British Prime
Minister) Tony Blair, has taken the bull by the horns.''
	   Concepcion Lopez, a widow in Santiago's middle class La Florida
neighborhood, reacted more calmly.
	   ``After all those years doing evil, I hope he at least gets a
big scare,'' she said.
	   Isabel Allende, a daughter of Salvador Allende _ the Marxist
president Pinochet ousted in his bloody 1973 coup _ called his
arrest an opportunity to make him account for the human rights
violations under his regime.
	   Others people were angry. Pinochet's son, also called Augusto,
vowed to hire ``the best team of lawyers existing in London.''
	   Word of the arrest quickly dominated radio broadcasts in the
normally quiet Saturday morning, and the initial mood was one of
disbelief.
	   At a downtown newsstand, a man looked at the front page of the
only paper that carried the news. ``Is it true?'' he asked.
	   In the corridors of power, Julio Lagos, a right-wing senator and
staunch Pinochet supporter, called the arrest ``an open violation
of the diplomatic immunity granted to him by the Chilean State.''
	   Pedro Daza, a retired career diplomat who served as envoy to the
United Nations under Pinochet, said the retired general has
immunity because he travels with a diplomatic passport.
	   The government agreed, calling the arrest a violation of
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity, and it filed a formal protest with
the British government.
	   While he wasn't on diplomatic business, Pinochet received a
diplomatic passport from the government in his capacity as a
senator-for-life. He remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
	   The Chilean army issued a communique calling the arrest
``unacceptable.'' It vowed to take ``all the measures aimed at
putting an end to this unjust situation, using all the judicial,
diplomatic and governmental means.''
	   The army had previously remained silent in all situations
involving Pinochet since Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, a non-political,
professional soldier, replaced the former dictator as head of the
armed forces.
	   Recently retired Gen. Luis Cortes called the arrest ``an act of
cowardice, entering the room of a man who is ill, in bed, to tell
him he is under arrest.''
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, underwent surgery Oct. 9
for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder which has given him pain
and hampered his walking in recent months.

Annual release of baby endangered turtles to make Internet debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ Web-surfers will meet
web-footed surfers when the Cayman Islands broadcasts its annual
release of baby endangered turtles for the first time ever on the
Internet.
	   About 400 green sea turtle hatchlings will be released Oct. 23
from Seven-Mile Beach on Grand Cayman under the gaze of cameras
linked to a web site, the government's Cayman Turtle Farm announced
Friday.
	   The annual release attracts hundreds of spectators to the beach,
and many are allowed to help carry the turtles to the water. Each
baby is marked with a titanium tag to help researchers track the
turtle population.
	   Adult green sea turtles can be five feet (1.5 meters) long and
weigh up to 700 pounds (315 kilograms). They prefer shallow water
and may not touch land until they mature at ages 18 to 25. The
females then return to the beach and lay eggs.
	   The turtle farm has released more than 29,000 young turtles
since 1980. Of about 45,000 eggs produced at the farm each year,
only a few hundred hatch.
	   Organizers said the broadcast will begin at 3:30 p.m. EDT (1930
GMT) on Oct. 23, with the release scheduled to begin about an hour
later.
	   The web site is http://www.turtle.ky/webcam.htm

 &UR; Eds: Items include Imran Khan and Jemima Goldsmith, Larry
Fortensky, Geri Halliwell, Kaji Sherpa, and Donald Trump. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The three-year marriage of former Pakistan cricket
captain Imran Khan and billionaire's daughter Jemima Goldsmith is
in trouble, Britain's tabloid newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Cultural difference, a large age gap and Khan's determination to
forge a political career have driven the couple apart, the Daily
Mail reported.
	   Jemima, 24, reportedly four months' pregnant with the couple's
second child, remained in London this weekend while her 45-year-old
husband flew to the United States to raise money for the cancer
hospital he founded in Lahore.
	   Neither was available for comment Saturday, although reporters
who caught up with Khan in the United States quoted him as saying
that ``as far as I am concerned we are getting on fine, thank you,
unless something has happened since I got on the flight that I do
not know of.''
	   The couple live with Khan's family in Lahore, but Jemima,
daughter of the late Anglo-French entrepreneur Jimmy Goldsmith,
regularly makes extended visits to her family in London.
	   Newspapers said Khan was upset that his wife, who has converted
to Islam, was attending too many frivolous parties in London, not
seemly behavior for a Muslim woman. She reportedly feels restricted
by the Muslim way of life and neglected as her husband becomes
increasingly involved in his Movement for Justice Party.
	   The couple, who married in Paris in May 1995, have a 2-year-old
son, Sulaiman.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   INDIO, California (AP) _ Larry Fortensky, the blue-collar
ex-husband of American actress Elizabeth Taylor, was arrested for
investigation of felony domestic violence against his girlfriend.
	   The 46-year-old Fortensky was booked Friday for allegedly
beating the woman, whose name with withheld, said Riverside County
sheriff's Detective Mark Wasserman.
	   Fortensky was jailed, with bail set at dlrs 25,000.
	   Taylor's seventh husband, he met the actress while both were
being treated for addictions the Betty Ford Center. The actress and
the construction worker married in 1991 and were divorced five
years later.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ The singer formerly known as Ginger Spice
was in East Africa this week being filmed in a British charity
program.
	   Geri Halliwell performed in a piece to be broadcast by the
charity Comic Relief.
	   ``I've enjoyed being in Uganda. It was good for me to get
away,'' Halliwell told reporters Thursday before boarding a flight
at Entebbe Airport.
	   Formerly known as Ginger Spice, Halliwell, 26, quit the group in
June.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A Sherpa guide, determined to be the
fastest climber of Mount Everest, scaled the world's highest peak
in 20 hours and 24 minutes Saturday, expedition organizers said.
	   Kaji Sherpa, 34, started his trek from the 5,300 meters (17,500
feet) base camp Friday afternoon and reached the 8,848 meters
(29,028 feet) high summit Saturday afternoon.
	   Bad weather and high winds forced Kaji to slow down for three
hours after he reached 8,700 meters (28,700 feet) in the morning.
	   Climbers usually take two to four days to make the climb from
the base camp to the summit in favorable weather conditions and
with breaks in camps in between. Kaji, who has already climbed
Everest four times, had hoped the make the climb in less than 18
hours or less.
	   Sherpas are known for their mountaineering skill. They were
mostly yak herders and traders living high in the Himalayas until
Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and
knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for
foreign climbers.
	   In October 1990, a French alpinist Marc Bertard set the speed
record by climbing Everest in 22 hours and 29 minutes.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The sky's still the limit for Donald Trump's
dreams.
	   The American magnate says his latest real estate project _ an
861-foot (262-meter) monolith _ will be the world's tallest
residential complex. The dlrs 360 million building will house
condominiums starting at dlrs 1 million. The building will have 72
floors, but the lobby's vaulted ceilings will make it the
equivalent of 90 floors.
	   Demolition began Friday on the vacant office building occupying
the site near the United Nations.
	   Trump's plans to build the world's tallest commercial building
fell apart after federal officials said it would interfere with air
traffic. He lost out on an effort to buy the defunct New York
Coliseum.
	   Trump, who also owns Trump Tower, Trump Palace, and Trump
International Hotel and Tower, plans to call the new building The
Trump World Tower.
	   ``What can I say?'' Trump said Friday. ``The name creates
value.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
whose 17-year rule was marked by widespread human rights abuses and
a climate of fear, was under arrest Saturday in the death,
detention and torture of Spanish citizens. Responding to a Spanish
extradition warrant, British police arrested Pinochet on Friday for
questioning about allegations that he murdered an unidentified
number of Spaniards in Chile from in the decade after he seized
power in 1973. Chile said it would protest to British authorities,
arguing that the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic
immunity. But Britain maintains he does not, and Prime Minister
Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the magistrates and
the police.'' (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo on
Saturday and an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force
arrived, major steps toward ensuring Yugoslavia pulls its forces
out of the secessionist province. Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels
also blamed each other in new shooting attacks Saturday, a day
after NATO gave President Slobodan Milosevic 10 more days to
fulfill a peace pledge. But Western officials said there were signs
the government was gradually complying with international demands
aimed at ending the turmoil. While its warplanes stand by in case
Milosevic breaks his word, NATO began an aerial surveillance
mission by sending U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny
day in the southern Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the
flights Thursday as part the peace agreements. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Ahead of talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Taiwan's top negotiator expressed optimism Saturday that
trust can be built between the two rival governments. Koo Chen-fu's
meeting with Jiang was to cap a visit that has helped thaw contacts
after a three-year hiatus and secured agreement to explore resumed
negotiations. Speaking at a reception Saturday, Koo said that
through his visit, China and Taiwan ``can promote and build
important foundations of mutual trust that the two sides were
lacking.'' The atmosphere at Sunday's meeting in the luxurious
confines of Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house should be
brightened by this week's agreement for China and Taiwan to work
toward resuming formal negotiations. (CHINA-TAIWAN)
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton held
extensive talks Saturday with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as
the West Bank summit reached the halfway point with disagreement
and discord. CIA director George Tenet was at Clinton's side in the
sessions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, underscoring U.S. efforts to
gather intelligence on terrorists whose attacks have damaged
Mideast peacemaking. At stake was a long-sought accord that would
give the Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to
establish a state. No claims of progress were made by the U.S.
hosts as the talks wound past nightfall, interrupted only for a
barbecue dinner for the American, Israeli and Palestinian
delegations. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian forces killed at least 30
Muslim militants during a weeklong offensive east of the capital,
Algiers. Seven other people reportedly died in separate attacks,
newspapers reported Saturday. The operation took place in an area
under the command of Hassan Hattab, a leader of Armed Islamic
Group, the most radical faction fighting in Algeria's eight-year
insurgency. La Nouvelle Republique newspaper said Hattab was killed
in the offensive, although his death has been reported at least
twice before. The security forces did not disclose losses. Both the
military and Muslim militants have stepped up their attacks in
recent weeks in this petroleum-rich North African nation while
Algeria prepares for early presidential elections in February.

Linda saved Former Beatle Paul McCartney from nervous breakdown,

newspaper reports

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney said that his
relationship with his wife Linda saved him from a nervous breakdown
after the fab four split up in 1970, The Mail on Sunday reported.
	   ''I felt completely useless when the Beatles broke up. I was
probably on the edge of a nervous breakdown,'' the newspaper quoted
McCartney as saying in a three-page interview in the newspaper,
extracts of which were also carried in The Daily Mail on Saturday.
	   ''She gave me confidence. She said, 'You're great, you're
okay,''' McCartney was quoted as saying about his American-born
wife, who died at the family's Arizona ranch in April, aged 56, of
breast cancer.
	   After the Beatles broke up, the McCartneys spent time in their
farmhouse in Scotland, where McCartney learned to unwind after the
tensions of negotiating with the other three Beatles: John Lennon,
Ringo Starr and George Harrison, the newspaper said.
	   ''We liked doing very simple and very down to earth things.
During the time we spent up there I did a lot of sheep-shearing.
It's the only time in my life I had shoulders,'' the newspaper
quoted McCartney as saying. Linda McCartney also taught Paul how to
ride horses.
	   ''That was the biggest thing. Linda taught me to horse-ride. I
really remember at that time being on a horse and thinking I've got
control of something,'' McCartney was quoted as saying in the
newspaper. ''Through the nature in Scotland, through riding and
through her support I did manage to get it back together.''
	   Sir Paul was speaking in advance of the Oct. 26 release of a
solo album recorded by Linda McCartney before her death.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Opposition activists who seized a truck
allegedly loaded with ruling-party handouts and propaganda said
police forced them at gunpoint to surrender the vehicle, local
media reported Saturday.
	   Friday's incident in the northern border state of Tamaulipas
comes in the run-up to Oct. 25 elections for state governorship and
local congress.
	   State police in the Gulf coast city of Altamira allegedly beat
and threatened members of three opposition parties who had stopped
the truck.
	   The truck belonged to a government food agency and was being
used to distribute food, hats and other gifts, some bearing the
name of a ruling-party candidate, the newspaper Reforma reported.
Mexican law forbids the use of gifts to influence voters.
	   Opposition Senator Maria del Carmen Bolado said said in a
statement that police drove the truck away after confiscating
cameras and video cameras, cellular phones and radios from
activists who were guarding it.
	   Ramirez Nava, a spokesman for the Tamaulipas state government,
said he had no information on the incident.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Family members of former president Carlos
Salinas de Gortari said he is in Cuba, where is consulting with
advisers on the money-laundering case against his brother, Raul,
local media reported Saturday.
	   Carlos Salinas left Mexico in disgrace soon after leaving office
in December 1994 but may return for the first time in more than
three years, the newspaper El Universal quoted relatives as saying.
	   Swiss prosecutors have reportedly concluded that dlrs 132
million in Swiss bank accounts held by his brother are probably the
product of drug-related bribes. Raul Salinas has denied those
accusations.
	   Mexican media had previously reported that Carlos Salinas had
left Ireland, where he has spent much of his self-imposed exile.
	   Raul Salinas, imprisoned since early 1995, is on trial in Mexico
on charges of illegally enriching himself during his brother's
administration and masterminding the 1994 murder of a political
rival.
	   Carlos Salinas has never been charged with any crime.
	    &UR; ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rightist paramilitary gunmen executed at
least 11 peasants this week after tying them up and accusing them
of membership in leftist guerrilla groups, according to Colombia's
defense minister.
	   A force of about 200 heavily armed men reportedly carried out
the massacre Wednesday in San Pedro, a small town in the Sierra
Nevada mountains about 320 miles (515 kilometers) north of Bogota.
	   The killings took place after militia members sealed off roads
leading in and out of town, the army reported.
	   Human rights monitors accuse the government of doing little to
rein in paramilitary groups that have committed massacres and are
supported by elements within the Colombian army.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda vowed Friday to pursue the
killers with ``all the force of the state.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
whose 17-year rule was marked by human rights abuses and a climate

widely criticized for its human rights record, was recovering from
surgery in a London clinic when he was detained Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   After Pinochet ousted leftist President Salvador Allende in
1973, the army and security forces cracked down viciously against
the former president's supporters. According to a report by the
Chilean government, 3,197 political opponents died during
Pinochet's term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted for after being
detained by his security agents.
	   Efforts by Pinochet's regime to stifle critics extended beyond
Chile's borders. In 1976, a former Allende minister, Orlando
Letelier, and his American aide were blown up in their car by
Chilean agents in Washington.
	   On Saturday, Scotland Yard refused to reveal Pinochet's
whereabouts, but his Santiago spokesman, Fernando Martinez, said he
was in a London clinic when police came for him. A regular visitor
to Britain, Pinochet underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc.
	   Police officers in flak jackets accompanied by a support vehicle
were stationed outside the London Clinic in central London where he
was rumored to be. Officials at the clinic refused to comment.
	   Britain said Saturday that the Spanish government had 40 days
from the time of Friday's arrest to submit a formal extradition
request.
	   In Oporto, Portugal, where he is participating in the
Ibero-American summit, Chilean President Eduardo Frei insisted
Saturday that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity that should be
recognized by Britain.
	   ``This situation of diplomatic immunity protects all members of
Parliament in Chile. That is a very old tradition,'' he said. ``But
what seems more crucial to us is that we think that people in Chile
must be tried by Chilean courts.''
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said he and Robin
Cook, British Foreign Secretary, had disagreed Saturday in a
telephone discussion about the interpretation of diplomatic
immunity.
	   Chile's army called the arrest ``unacceptable,'' issuing a
statement vowing to take all judicial, diplomatic and governmental
means necessary to end what it called ``this unjust situation.''
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the
Ibero-American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions
taken by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling
investigations into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina,
filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after
another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   Pinochet, a customs clerk's son, remained commander-in-chief of
the Chilean army until March, when he was sworn in as a
senator-for-life, a post established for him in a constitution
drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place.
	   A U.S. congressional investigation in the mid-1970s disclosed
the Nixon administration's involvement in the turmoil that
enveloped Chile in the months leading up to Pinochet's coup.
	   When CIA-backed efforts to prevent Allende's election in 1970
failed, the White House authorized a CIA campaign to destabilize
his government, according to declassified U.S. government documents
released by Congress.
	   The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment on Pinochet's
arrest.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton held
extensive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the West
Bank summit, trying to smooth discord over a long-sought accord
that would give the Palestinians control over more land on which
they hope to establish a state.
	   Clinton was trying to clear the way for an agreement by Sunday,
the end of four days of talks, but signs of discord were evident.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
reject the deal if Palestinain leader Yasser Arafat did not take
strong action to uproot terrorist cells on land he already
controls.
	   CIA director George Tenet was at Clinton's side in Saturday's
sessions with Netanyahu and Arafat, underscoring U.S. efforts to
gather intelligence on terrorists whose attacks have damaged
Mideast peacemaking.
	   No claims of progress were made by the U.S. hosts as the talks
wound past nightfall, interrupted only for a barbecue dinner for
the American, Israeli and Palestinian delegations.
	   ``A constructive, pragmatic approach continues,'' James P.
Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokemsan, said. ``Everyone's mood
remains that we are determined to keep the pace as intensive as
possible.''
	   According to diplomatic sources, key security issues remained
unsettled, and Netanyahu and Arafat exchanged allegations
underscoring mistrust between the two leaders.
	   At a face-to-face meeting Friday, the sources told The
Associated Press, Netanyahu raised an old complaint about thousands
of cars being stolen from Israelis. The sources, insisting on
anonymity, said Arafat responded that Jewish settlers were the
thieves.
	   On another touchy point, the sources said Arafat told Netanyahu
that Jewish extremists were collaborating with Arab extremists.
	   On a bright, sunny day, Clinton arrived on Maryland's rural
Eastern Shore by helicopter from Washington and met first, over
lunch, for 45 minutes with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and other senior aides.
	   The president then walked to Houghton House, where Arafat was
waiting at the door. Together, they went to the library and talked
for 90 minutes.
	   Arafat walked Clinton back to his quarters, and the president
telephoned a report to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
	   A 90-minute meeting with Netanyahu at River House, a luxurious
estate overlooking the Wye River, followed. At nightfall, Clinton
and Netanyahu went out and walked along the river.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart gave reporters a terse
account of Saturday's talks that made no reference to the disputed
topics.
	   ``We think the environment out here has provided the ability for
informal discussions and has provided an atmosphere that is
constructive,'' Lockhart said.
	   He said Clinton enjoyed a ``reservoir of trust'' with the two
leaders, and if he can play ``a constructive role,'' the president
will return Sunday.
	   The talks are being held under a virtual news blackout imposed
by the administration on the theory that secrecy is conducive to
compromise.
	   According to diplomatic sources, the Palestinians have accepted
neither an Israeli demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to
Israel for trial nor an American compromise that they be tried by
Palestinian courts.
	   And while the Palestinians were willing to take steps to enhance
security in Ramallah, a major Arab city on the outskirts of
Jerusalem, there was ``absolutely no real movement on anything''
else Friday.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement unless Arafat takes concrete
steps to curb terrorism.
	   Albright is backing Israel in its call for improved security and
the uprooting of terrorist cells on territory already under the
control of Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   In an Associated Press interview Thursday, she described the
agreement she is trying to nail down as an exchange of land for
security.
	   Arafat's position is that peace itself will bring better
security and that he is already making a 100 percent effort to
combat violence against Israelis.
	   A key Israeli demand is that 36 suspects be extradited for
trial. Israel claims that 30 are implicated in the deaths of
Israeli civilians and 10 are serving in the Palestinian police
force.

Libyan leader says he doesn't want confrontation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has said he doesn't
want confrontation with the United States and Great Britain over
the planned Lockerbie bombings trial, The Sunday Telegraph
reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Gadhafi as saying that ''We have no
interest in confrontation. Our people want peace. They want to be
friends.''
	   The newspaper said that in the interview, which will be shown on
British Broadcasting Corp. TV this week, Gadhafi renews his offer
to hand over the two men, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, suspected of blowing up the New York-bound Pan Am jumbo
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   ''We can solve this problem very easily. The families of the
victims will be satisfied. We have no interest in this tension,''
the newspaper quoted Gadhafi as saying.
	   In August, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S.-British
plan for a trial of the two suspects in the Netherlands overseen by
Scottish judges following Scottish law.
	   The two suspects were indicted in 1991 and U.N. sanctions were
imposed in 1992 to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to
hand them over. He argued that the two would not be guaranteed a
fair trial in either Britain or the United States.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sharon Stone plans to live with her new
husband in San Francisco, but that doesn't mean she will neglect
her position among Hollywood's most in-demand stars. She has
struggled too long to get there.
	   The actress marked two milestones this year: in March she turned
40; on Valentine's Day, she married Phil Bronstein, 47, executive
editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
	   About the move to the Bay Area, she says she really doesn't like
Los Angeles. ``San Francisco is a better life. People there are
interested in a much broader spectrum,'' she says.
	   Stone seemed to reflect a new maturity and a refreshing candor
as she spoke in an interview at a Westside hotel.
	   Most of today's stars tap dance around any hint of controversy.
Not Sharon Stone. She is reminiscent of Bette Davis and Joan
Crawford in her willingness to speak out. And like those two
immortals, Stone has earned her climb up the ladder.
	   Born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, she recalls wanting to be an
actress from the age of 4. Her thrill of the week was watching
classic movies on television on Saturday mornings, including the
films of Davis and Crawford.
	   ``My father was always barking at me, 'Go outside and play,' but
I wanted to stay inside and watch movies. I'm still like that. My
husband says, 'You haven't left the house in three days; you should
go outside.'''
	   After winning a hometown beauty contest, she made TV commercials
in New York, modeled in Europe and returned to the United States to
pursue acting. Woody Allen cast her in a brief but memorable scene
in ``Stardust Memories'' in 1980. Then she endured a bimbo decade
in such films as ``Police Academy 4'' and ``Action Jackson.''
	   She blames that period on poor agenting, but also her naivete.
``I was a kid from the country. I was getting jobs, I didn't know
what to do. I felt I should be grateful for the jobs I was getting,
that I could buy a home and pay my bills.
	   ``I was doing exciting things in acting class, and, eventually I
just got ashamed. I was doing all this good work in class, and I
was doing all this crap on the screen. Well, what is good about
that?''
	   She decided to stop being a good girl and to abandon ``the WASPy
manners I was brought up with.'' At 32 she realized she had to make
up for the time she had lost.
	   Matters improved when she kickboxed Arnold Schwarzenegger in
``Total Recall.'' Then came the explosive ``Basic Instinct'' with
that risque shot in police interrogation.
	   Although the film placed her in the top ranks, she remains angry
with the director, Dutchman Paul Verhoeven.
	   ``I hated him for showing the world up my skirt,'' says Miss
Stone.
	   ``I hated him for making me believe that I could go out on a
limb. I didn't have a net, he wasn't watching my back. You expect
to be able to freewheel as much as you want, because you expect the
director to protect you.
	   ``I really thought that was our agreement. As a mature artist, I
agree that shot was the best choice for the movie. I really
disagree with the way he got it. Because, it made me look
incredibly stupid when I was very, very willing to do what it took
to be that character.
	   ``It would have been better if he had brought me into the
editing room and shown me the scene and explained why he did it.
But he showed it to me in a roomful of strangers. That was him
trying to create a cruel, inappropriate power over me. That hurt me
a lot.''
	   ``That scene'' had people talking across the country and
throughout the world. Her stardom established, Miss Stone followed
with ``Sliver,'' which created no talk at all.
	   ``I never thought `Sliver' was a good picture, I never really
wanted to do it,'' she says. ``But my agent at the time was the
agent of Joe Eszterhas (who wrote the script). I didn't really
understand that game.
	   ``I trusted (the agent) more than I should have. Joe was
supposed to do a lot of rewrites that never happened. I was so new
to the game that I didn't know I could just say no.''
	   She agreed to ``Sliver'' with the proviso that her agent push
for ``Intersection'' with Richard Gere. That happened, and she
followed with an action film with Sylvester Stallone, ``The
Specialist,'' and a Western, ``The Quick and the Dead,'' produced
by her own company.
	   She was cast in ``Casino,'' opposite Robert De Niro. The Martin
Scorsese film brought her an Academy Award nomination, a Golden
Globe and a bundle of respect.
	   She followed with a bad choice: ``Diabolique,'' a poor remake of
the 1955 French classic thriller that starred Simone Signoret, who
won accolades from critics and audiences alike. Playing the same
role of the conniving mistress, Stone was trounced.
	   Always aiming for surprise, the actress has abandoned her wicked
ways to play the loving mother of a disabled boy in ``The Mighty.''
It's a secondary role to a pair of 13-year-olds (Kieran Culkin,
Elden Henson) who form an odd friendship to defy their young
tormentors.
	   ``I always try to do something that I haven't done before,'' she
says. ``I think it's appropriate to play moms and to play people
who have life experiences. I'm not an ingenue anymore. I think it's
time for me to invest some of my own life into my work.
	   ``It's interesting to play psychopaths and villains because
they're without boundaries. That's kind of sensationalistically
entertaining. But I reached a point where it's not as rewarding to
me, it's not as much fun.''
	   Her husband considers her ``Mighty'' role the closest to who she
really is, and she's inclined to agree. But there is a difference:
She is childless.
	   ``So far,'' she said. ``But I just found my dude. Give me a
minute.''
	   That's something the tabloids have declined to do. She claims
her pregnancy has been announced ``400 times.'' But not by her.
	   After claiming preposterously, ``I'm just a normal girl,'' she
elaborated: ``I have a very unnormal occupation. But I am a normal
woman. I'm not my job.
	   ``When you're a movie star, it's hard for people to understand.
No one wants to believe that you could possibly want to hang out in
your underwear and channel surf and eat Chinese food out of a box.
But if you don't, you lose your mind. If you don't, you become a
shallow thing that doesn't really exist.''

Broadway _ on and off _ braces itself for the British
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MATT WOLF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With the regularity of the seasons, the English
theater is heading to New York, where no spate of shows is complete
on Broadway or off without a heavy lineup of Britons.
	   Matthew Bourne's London-born (and mostly male) ``Swan Lake'' is
already up and dancing on Broadway, and New York is expected to
receive as many as a dozen recent English or Irish hits over the
coming months.
	   Last season's Tony Award-winning ``Art'' and ``The Beauty Queen
of Leenane'' both began in the West End, sharpening the American
appetite for shows from across the Atlantic.
	   At this point, it's hard to imagine anyone beating Judi Dench to
the Tony for best actress next June, reprising her superlative
London performance in David Hare's ``Amy's View.''
	   A leading candidate for best actor has to be New York's own
Kevin Spacey, reviving for Broadway next spring his bravura turn in
``The Iceman Cometh'' with which he dazzled London for four
sold-out months.
	   Patrick Marber's ``Closer'' and Conor McPherson's ``The Weir''
are two other London critics' picks bound for Broadway, while
Harold Pinter's ``Ashes to Ashes,'' Caryl Churchill's ``Blue
Heart'' and a stage adaptation of Tolstoy's epic ``Anna Karenina''
are just three of the many London ventures headed off-Broadway.
	   Even non-hits are making it to New York. Joe Penhall's ``Some
Voices'' and Shelagh Stephenson's ``The Memory of Water'' did well
but hardly spectacularly on the London ``fringe,'' and yet both are
on tap for major off-Broadway premieres this fall.
	   ``I don't think New York has ever been hungrier for something
really, really exciting,'' says Brian Cox, the Scottish actor who
took over last month in the Broadway cast of the West End smash
``Art.''
	   ``Embracing the Anglo-Irish theater has been, and is, part and
parcel of the Broadway tradition,'' says Cameron Mackintosh,
co-producer of the dlrs 3 million ``Swan Lake,'' now at the Neil
Simon Theater.
	   ``Certainly, the good prestigious play coming over always seems
to have found a welcome home on Broadway,'' added Mackintosh, who
has cornered his own globally successful market with ``Cats,''
``Les Miserables,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Miss
Saigon.''
	   Obviously, not every West End hit scores overseas. New York is
littered with London triumphs-turned-Broadway train wrecks _ David
Hare's ``The Secret Rapture,'' Ian McKellen in ``Wild Honey'' and,
just last April, Peter Whelan's ``The Herbal Bed.''
	   Still, said Hare, ``at least in New York audiences don't kill
shows with indifference, which we do.''
	   The 51-year-old Hare may have three plays on simultaneously in
New York next spring if ``Amy's View'' is joined by Nicole Kidman
in ``The Blue Room'' and Hare's own solo show, ``Via Dolorosa.''
	   New Yorkers are either for or against a show, says Hare, whereas
in Britain, ``partly because of the subsidized theater or perhaps
the national characteristic, shows pass by in lukewarm
indifference.''
	   ``The New York audience is very astute and discerning,'' said
Vikki Heywood, who, as Royal Court executive director, will have a
hand in presenting Dublin writer McPherson's ``The Weir'' on
Broadway, probably in February.
	   ``If you put on good work, they'll come and see it,'' she said.
``I've not found any sense of, `Oh no, not another Irish play!' The
issues `The Weir' is dealing with are universal. That's what it
should be judged on, not the fact that it's another Irish play.''
	   One could argue that New York is more open to English and Irish
work than vice versa. New York got London hit musical after another
in the 1980s, yet rare is the Broadway success that repeats itself
on the West End. ``Rent,'' which opened in May to lukewarm reviews
and middling business at London's Shaftesbury Theater, is now
finding that out.
	   On the straight play front, there's virtually a rule of thumb:
the bigger the New York success, the riskier its chances in London.
As David Hare has observed, ``It's very hard to make London focus
on American playwrights.''
	   French playwright Yasmina Reza says she has never felt like a
stranger on Broadway. Reza had never had a play produced in the
United States until ``Art'' opened on Broadway in March, its London
cachet behind it.
	   In June, it went on to beat Anglo-Irish dramatist Martin
McDonagh's ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' as well as two American
competitors, to take the Tony for best play.
	   ``I thought the play could travel because it was not typically
French,'' Reza said, ``but I was not expecting such incredible
success.''
	   In the wake of ``Art,'' interest in Reza's other plays has
leaped, with ``The Unexpected Man'' _ a work written just before
``Art'' in 1992 _ all but confirmed for a New York run in the
winter. Michael Gambon and Eileen Atkins are expected to repeat
their London performances as a celebrated writer and his greatest
fan.
	   ``We're waiting for absolutely the right theater,'' said Atkins,
whose every New York appearance _ whether off-Broadway in ``A Room
of One's Own'' or on Broadway in ``Indiscretions'' _ seems to bring
with it ever more doting reviews.
	   The actress, now 64, returns the affection.
	   ``New York is like a village if you're in a show,'' she said.
``It's lovely.''

Furyk in lead in tournament where he got his first win
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Jim Furyk, trying to break a victory drought on
the same golf course where he won his first pro tournament, shot a
9-under-par 63 to take a three-shot lead into the final round of
the Las Vegas Invitational.
	   Furyk had five straight birdies on the back nine Saturday to get
to 21 under on a day when the winds calmed and the leaders found
the TPC Summerlin course much tamer than it had been in gusty winds
a day earlier.
	   Mark Calcavecchia shot a 65 and was second at 18-under 270,
while Scott Verplank hit a ball into a desert canyon flanking the
18th hole and finished with a double bogey for a 67 that left him
another stroke back.
	   ``I control my own destiny if I can go out there and fire a good
number tomorrow,'' Furyk said. ``If not, a lot of guys can go out
there and shoot nine under and pass me by.''
	   Furyk, who set a record for money won without a victory last
year and has 10 top 10 finishes this year, has not won since the
Hawaiian Open in 1996.
	   That was the only other win besides the 1995 Las Vegas
Invitational for a player who consistently finishes in the top 10
but has been frustrated by his inability to win over the past two
seasons.
	   ``We're all out here trying to win golf tournaments,'' Furyk
said. ``But it's a humbling game. If I play 30 tournaments and win
three times it would be a great year. But there would be 27
tournaments I didn't win.''
	   Furyk was tied for the lead with Verplank and Bob Tway when he
started his birdie binge after hitting a 7-iron to 10 feet (3
meters) on the par-4 12th. By the time he tapped in a 3-footer for
birdie on the par-5 16th, he had the lead to himself.
	   Furyk finished with a 30 on the back nine on a course where he
has consistently fired low scores in his career.
	   Furyk is seventh on the money winning list this year with
earnings of dlrs 1.46 million, despite not having won in 26
tournaments.
	   Calcavecchia, who shot a 31 on the back nine to pull into
contention, said Furyk might need a round in the mid-60s Sunday if
he wants to retain his lead.
	   ``He's well within reach, believe me,'' Calcavecchia said.
	   Verplank, whose last win was in the qualifying school to get a
spot on the tour this year, was only two back before making a
double bogey on the par-4 finishing hole. It was his second double
bogey in a week that has seen him make 27 birdies.
	   ``I've just made way too many mistakes out there'' Verplank
said. ``There's not that many hard holes out there.''
	   Still, Verplank wasn't too unhappy after his 67 put him in third
place in a year that has seen him win dlrs 940,769.
	   ``This year has been my best year ever,'' he said. ``The only
thing I haven't done is win a tournament.''
	   Tway, who had a two-shot lead after three rounds of the 90-hole
tournament, was seven shots back after an even-par 72 that included
a double bogey when he hit a ball into the water on 16.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Sometimes,'' says Stephen King, ``it's
alive.''
	   Not the hungry king vampire of his early novel, ``Salem's Lot.''
Not the ancient evil of ``It'' or the more recent ``Desperation.''
Not even the decidedly displeased ghost of his latest effort, a
gothic tale called ``Bag of Bones.''
	   Sometimes, says modern fiction's most prolific horror writer, an
author's tools _ narrative skill, adeptness with dialogue, ability
to spin a tale _ don't matter, because the story gets up and starts
walking around.
	   The moral: Twenty-five years after his first novel, ``Carrie,''
the New Englander who has become the modern H.P Lovecraft still
likes to stand back and see what happens when he lets the things he
creates carry him off into the night.
	   The result often satisfies him, though not all critics, who say
he often lets himself be carried off too far.
	   ``I think of it as the takeoff point _ when the wheels leave the
ground. It comes to life,'' King, 51, says. ``You have confidence
that the story lines will come together.''
	   In ``Bag of Bones,'' they did, albeit convolutedly. King's
newest, a fat tome written in the first person, chronicles the
torturous life of author Mike Noonan, creatively crippled since the
inexplicable death of his wife, Jo. Drawn to their vacation cottage
on a ghostly Maine lake, Noonan finds solace in the company of a
young widow and her daughter _ and faces dangers both earthly and
supernatural.
	   King, a schoolteacher who grew into one of the most popular
horror novelists ever, has long been both a darling of best-seller
lists and a critical target. While readers voraciously buy up his
words, he fends off charges of everything from shallowness to
self-indulgence to just plain lack of talent.
	   ``Bag of Bones'' seems an attempt to add weight _ and thus
credibility _ to his body of work. Of late, as his pendulum swung
to more everyday horrors, King experimented with everything from a
narrowly focused psychosexual tale (``Gerald's Game'') to marital
discord and perseverance (``Dolores Claiborne''). With ``Bag of
Bones,'' he brings the worldly and the unearthly together.
	   It is also classic gothic. Eerie cottages creak and groan.
Ectoplasm oozes. Ghosts haunt. Old injustices are unearthed and
horrible compromises are made. But below it all, one very secular
terror reigns: Mike Noonan still can't write.
	   Gee, Steve. Author angst. Didn't you explore that pretty
thoroughly in ``The Shining,'' ``Misery'' and ``The Dark Half''?
Getting narcissistic?
	   ``I'll give you this much,'' King says on a recent publicity
tour. ``I don't think there's any need to write any more books
about writers. I think I've said all I need to say about that.''
	   What King does love to discuss is writing _ his, others', the
craft in general, where it's headed. He's at a loss when he goes to
author appearances and gets the weirdest questions that have little
to do with writing: Was he abused as a child? Is that why he
concocts such dark tales?
	   ``That's self-indulgent,'' he says. ``I should not have to go
out on these tours and sell Stephen King.''
	   But he does have to sell himself these days, because he has a
new boss. After departing Viking, his longtime publisher, he's now
one of Scribner's marquee names. But to hear King tell it, he'd
rather have his work do the talking.
	   Years ago, King concocted a quote that preceded one of his
novellas: ``It is the tale, not he who tells it.'' He still tries
to observe that credo, though many have said _ in both admiration
and scorn _ that his writerly mark on his work is too heavy-handed.
	   ``If it's going to be he who tells it, not the tale, tell it on
a psychiatrist's couch. Don't try to sell it for dlrs 28 at Barnes
and Noble,'' King says. ``The bottom line is, can you read it on an
airplane? Can you read it on a train? Are you going to stay up an
extra hour when you need your sleep to read a little more? If you
can say yes, it's because of the tale.''
	   Critics say he needs a more aggressive editor, that his prose is
fat; they have a point, although his indulgences are, more often
than not, redeemed by his compelling narratives and the folks who
populate them.
	   More galling for King (who harbors no illusions about the
permanence of his work) are the accusations that he cooks up the
convenience-store burritos of American literature. For King, to
whom sense of place runs a close second to character and story,
setting means evoking the modern world _ through brand names and
corporate specifics that have often brought the criticism of the
elite down upon his Yankee head.

	   This isn't necessarily a problem for a man who once called
himself a ``Big-Mac-and-fries-type writer'' _ a man who has more
than a dash of the pulpy ``Vault of Horror'' approach to
storytelling.
	   ``I was taught as a writer to be specific,'' he says. ``Critics
would go into these frenzies about how it was a knee-jerk, shallow,
pop view of the world. And I would think, 'What do these people see
when they open their medicine cabinet? Do they see Brand X?'
	   ``This wasn't my innovation, but I got the most attention out of
it. People maybe thought, 'This isn't good writing because it
doesn't tell about a good world.' But we're a McDonald's world.
Don't blame me for it. I'm a product of my culture and my time.''
	   Forget, then, the tortured author sitting in a secluded room
producing prose, though certainly that is part of the King creative
process. Think, instead, of Stephen King, scribe of the commercial
age, working out at the Y in Bangor, Maine, thinking about his new
book.
	   Think of him finishing a set of sit-ups _ or was it chin-ups? He
can't recall _ when it occurs to him to send someone to the rescue
of a young woman and a child.
	   That, coupled with his earlier idea of ``a house, an old crime
and buried bodies'' brought the story to its critical mass. That
was when it all came together and the bag of bones came to life _
the takeoff point, the moment when the wheels left the ground.
	   An odd metaphor, by the way. Because Stephen King, chronicler of
modern angst, creator of a thousand unspeakable terrors, is afraid
of flying.
	   And maybe, though he doesn't admit it, of falling flat.
	   After all, Stephen King isn't necessarily a big Stephen King fan
_ with a few exceptions.
	   ``I really like `The Dead Zone.' It has an arc,'' King says.
``And I like 'The Green Mile,''' his serialized story about death
row in the 1930s. Then he smirks.
	   ``A lot of the other ones ... all I can say is that I liked them
at the time.''

On Yankees' big day, fans give Sosa a hero's welcome

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Just hours before the World Series began at
Yankee Stadium, New Yorkers welcomed an out-of-town hero like one
of their own.
	   Tens of thousands of fans, many of them Dominican-Americans,
roared cheers at Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa Saturday night as
the city treated him to a parade through the ``Canyon of Heroes''
in lower Manhattan.
	   Dominican flags were waved to honor one of the Caribbean
nation's favorite sons, and fans yelled ``Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!''
when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave Sosa a key to the city.
	   ``It's a great thing for baseball and for the people of New
York,'' said Richard Viera, who wore a Yankees cap and an American
League champions T-shirt. ``Even though we're Yankees fans, we
still want to give our support.''
	   Sosa's 66 home runs and his record-breaking race with Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals electrified the baseball season.
Although McGwire finished with 70 home runs, fans said Sosa's good
sportsmanship, humility and devotion to his community made him a
perfect role model. Roger Maris of the Yankees had held the
previous record of 61 home runs since 1961.
	   ``A lot of people portray Hispanics, particularly Dominicans, as
the kid on the corner selling drugs,'' said Margie Bermudez, of
Jersey City, New Jersey. ``We need someone positive, and right now
Sosa's there, to show ... we have ambition, we have dreams. ... A
lot of poor kids, he gives them ambition to do more for their
lives.''
	   Sosa waved to the crowd as a float carried him up the same
stretch of lower Broadway where New Yorkers have saluted Charles
Lindbergh, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, veterans of the Gulf War, Nelson
Mandela and the 1996 World Series champion Yankees.
	   Parade-goers waved signs proclaiming their love for Sosa in
English and Spanish, and a singer on one float bellowed ``Viva
Sammy Sosa!''
	   ``It's been unbelievable, it's been a great moment,'' a
soft-spoken Sosa told hundreds of cheering, flag-waving fans who
gathered in City Hall Park to see him receive the key to the city.
``To be here in New York with all the Dominican people, that's what
I am.''
	   Sosa threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 1 Saturday
night, capping a day that saw Gov. George Pataki give him the
Jackie Robinson Empire State Freedom Medal.
	   Giuliani, a lifelong Yankees fan, presented his favorite Cub
with a New York City jacket, a copy of the city's seal and a
proclamation declaring Saturday ``Sammy Sosa Day.'' In return, Sosa
gave the city a bat that deputy mayor Rudy Washington said was the
one that hit home run 66.
	   ``Sammy Sosa's achievements go beyond the 66 home runs,''
Giuliani said. ``His achievements have more to do with what an
exceptional human being he is and what a tremendous representative
of the Dominican community.''
	   Giuliani offered to throw Sosa a parade in the Canyon of Heroes
after officials nixed Dominican community leaders' hopes of feting
him in the Washington Heights neighborhood, where many of the
city's half million Dominican immigrants live.
	   Washington Heights residents excitedly followed Sosa's
spectacular summer and were especially grateful for his efforts to
help those who were displaced when Hurricane Georges hit the
island.
	   The parade ``brings Washington Heights downtown instead of
keeping us isolated uptown,'' said Jesus Abikaram, a Dominican
immigrant who works as an insurance agent.
	   But a town that takes its baseball seriously would only go so
far to honor a Cub whose own city did not give him a parade.
Chicago may be Sammy's kind of town, but the police band that led
his parade played ``New York, New York.''

Macedonians have plenty of choices in parliamentary election

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Thirty-eight parties and alliances
competing in Sunday elections all were promising a brighter future
for a nation burdened by economic woes and ethnic tension.
	   The multitude of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
meant none stood a chance of winning a majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   The three partners of the ruling coalition _ the Social
Democratic Alliance or renamed Communists, the ethnic Albanians'
Party for Democratic Prosperity and the Socialists _ ran
separately.
	   A favorite of pro-reform voters was the recently formed
coalition of the VMRO-DPMNE party and Democratic Alternative.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation. Their
desires for self-rule have drawn comparisons to those in
neighboring Kosovo.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance headed by former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   But Macedonia was the poorest of all six republics in the former
Yugoslavia, and its economy remains feeble with about 30 percent
unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   The Yugoslav wars and resulting sanctions on its neighbor and
main trade partner, Serbia, shut down many production lines and
trade routes.
	   Economic issues dominated the parties' campaign pitches to
Macedonia's 1.5 million voters.
	   ``Obvious democratic progress has been made in Macedonia in the
last four years,'' said Kent Patton, resident program officer of
the International Republican Institute. ``The stability of this
country, as long as people work through the system, is ensured.''

Haitian voodoo taps spirit of people who won freedom

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ An empty whiskey bottle, embellished with
sequins. A pig in black papier mache. A dlrs 2 bill. Some soap. An
icon of the goddess of love.
	   They're all sacred objects in Vodou, Creole for Haitian voodoo.
This Caribbean religion once empowered slaves from Africa who were
whipped and worked to death, but finally revolted. They created
Haiti, the world's first black republic.
	   An exhibit of the religious arts that still grace the daily
lives of 7 million Haitians opened Saturday at the American Museum
of Natural History. ``Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou,'' which runs
through Jan. 3, is a tribute to the creativity that flourished even
under poverty and oppression.
	   ``Haiti has been demonized and its culture ridiculed in the
United States because it represented a slave rebellion to a
slave-owning society _ the worst fear realized,'' says exhibit
co-curator Donald Cosentino, professor of African and Caribbean
folklore at the University of California at Los Angeles, which
organized the exhibit.
	   The slave revolution started with a voodoo ceremony in 1791 and
ended 13 years later with the birth of Haiti. To this day, some
voodoo holy men carry machetes symbolizing the spiritual power that
fueled their hard-won freedom.
	   But don't look for zombies or pins stuck in dolls at this
exhibit. While such objects are part of voodoo, ``they've often
been used to mock blacks and their culture,'' says Cosentino.
	   Perhaps the most comprehensive display ever on the arts of the
Afro-Caribbean religion, the show is a fascinating fusion of the
Africanism, Christianity and Freemasonry at the heart of Haiti.
	   The slaves who arrived in the 1600s on the island of Hispaniola
_ one-third of it now occupied by Haiti _ toiled in cotton, sugar
and coffee fields. To survive, they worshipped the Roman Catholic
saints of their Spanish masters, while secretly seeing them as
representations of African deities. Thus was born voodoo, a word
derived from the Fon language of West Africa meaning ``sacred.''
	   While collecting some of the approximately 500 pieces on
display, co-curator Marilyn Houlberg of the Art Institute of
Chicago visited Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Haiti's capital,
Port-au-Prince.
	   ``There were pigs rolling around in the mud, as they should be,
and children playing. I walked across planks into this house, which
had no running water,'' remembers Houlberg. ``But inside was a
place of goodness and beauty.''
	   She came away with religious banners, a sequined goblet and
decorated bottles. In voodoo, sequined bottles and painted
calabashes, often filled with Haitian rum, serve as repositories
for spiritual forces.
	   In Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, the most
ordinary objects are used to invoke divinity. Voodoo, says
Cosentino, ``is a low-budget religion where everything is
recycled.''
	   In Port-au-Prince, the temple of voodoo priest Sauveur St. Cyr
is a room where he officiates from a dentist's chair bought at an
open market.
	   ``I felt a good spirit coming from it,'' St. Cyr, 51, said in
Creole during a visit to New York, his first trip out of Haiti. He
is a consultant for the exhibit, which also includes a replica of a
voodoo temple, paintings, photographs, videos of religious
ceremonies and dolls.
	   St. Cyr's tiny temple is filled with dolls _ ``messengers'' for
spirits that help people probe the mysteries of life, death and
sex. Some are well-worn Barbies, wearing notes as they hang upside
down by threads tied to their ankles.
	   ``I think of that little room where his business gets done as
his cosmic cockpit,'' says Houlberg.
	   ``Business'' means summoning the 11 principle voodoo divinities,
or ``Iwa,'' derived from benign West African spirits and
aggressive, fiery Central African and Creole ones.
	   Rhythms beaten on drums and beaded rattles with bells awaken
them. The deities are honored with bannerlike flags and mirrors
that bathe the museum walls with iridescent color.
	   The priest says he feels instantly whether an object or person
is imbued with the right spirit: His skin shivers. His voodoo name,
Janmensou Lakwa, refers to a god ``who drinks and never gets
drunk,'' he says with an impish smile.
	   On a cool fall morning, the priest strolls alongside Central
Park toward the museum dressed in white to evoke purity and
perfumed with a gardenia scent ``that captures the spirits.'' He
joins two priestesses and another priest, all from Manhattan, in a
candlelight dance at the exhibit's altars.
	   ``I feel New York's spirits, and they're sweet,'' St. Cyr says.

Mary Cassatt: America's Impressionist, feminist of her time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY352 &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBRA HALE SHELTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Walking past a Paris art gallery in 1874, a young
American named Mary Cassatt couldn't help but notice a bold pastel
of ballet dancers.
	   Pressing her face to the window of the shop on the Boulevard
Haussmann, she gazed at the work of French Impressionist Edgar
Degas.
	   Decades later, Cassatt _ the only American among the French
Impressionists _ wrote that the first sight of Degas' pictures
``was the turning point in my artistic life.''
	   ``I saw art as I wanted to see it,'' she said of her older
colleague's seemingly unposed snapshots of contemporary life. ``I
began to live.''
	   Ninety-one works by Cassatt _ oils, pastels, drawings and prints
_ went on display Tuesday at The Art Institute of Chicago in the
exhibition ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman.''
	   The exhibition, running through Jan. 10, is the first
retrospective in about 30 years of the 19th-century feminist's
work, according to curator Judy Barter. It next will be shown at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston Feb. 14-May 9, 1999, and at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington June 6-Sept. 6, 1999.
	   Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City will
exhibit a collection of drawings and prints by Cassatt beginning
Oct. 20 and running through Jan. 24, 1999.
	   Degas' Impressionism was the incentive the young Cassatt needed
to escape her more restrictive, academic art training.
	   The cantankerous Degas would later become the wealthy and
dignified Cassatt's lifelong friend, mentor and admirer _ hanging
one of her oils prominently in his apartment and collecting scores
of her prints and pastels.
	   ``No woman has a right to draw like that,'' was the backhanded
compliment he paid Cassatt after seeing her oil painting, ``Young
Woman Picking Fruit.''
	   Cassatt, who died at age 83 in 1926, was born in Pittsburgh and
raised in Philadelphia but spent most of her life in Europe,
settling in France in 1874. Never married, she had no children. But
she doted on her nieces and nephews, and the image of a nurturing
mother and an innocent child is reflected in much of the art for
which she is best known.
	   These maternal works show women bathing children, reading to
children, nursing, dressing, holding them. In possibly her most
famous painting, ``The Child's Bath,'' the woman's hands are big
and beautiful as they provide the child with protection and
intimacy.
	   ``For Cassatt, motherhood constituted the basis of a feminism
that extended maternal nurture and protection to the preservation
of all life,'' Barter writes in the catalog accompanying the
exhibition.
	   Cassatt supported women's suffrage and participated in a benefit
exhibition in New York City in 1914. World War I convinced her that
male-dominated governments were to blame for wars, according to
Barter.
	   Cassatt's brightly colored art became increasingly domestic
after the death of her beloved sister, Lydia, when it fell to her
to take care of her aging parents. But even when shown in domestic
scenes, Cassatt's female models are usually active, connected to
the contemporary world, whether through reading, sewing, having tea
or talking.
	   Cassatt herself was truly modern for her time. An automobile
enthusiast, she bought a Renault in 1906. She was a vegetarian for
a while. She attended seances and, while not a particularly
religious woman in the conventional sense, she was interested in
Spiritualism. The movement was a perfect fit: It preached equality
of the sexes and placed high value on children.
	   An assertive, witty woman with a penchant for high fashion and
high teas, Cassatt was single by choice. ``I think she believed
that a woman who wished to have a serious career had to be
single,'' Barter said. She wasn't pretty, with a ruddy complexion,
snub nose, brown hair and big hands. But she was a connoisseur of
fashion magazines. And at 5 feet 6 inches (1.67 meters), she
appeared statuesque, even elegant in high-collared dresses, brown
satin clothing, scarves, feathered hats and parasols.
	   She traveled extensively, braving disease, bed bugs and cold
with what a young friend called ``an electric vitality.''
	   Though she suffered severe bouts of depression, Cassatt outlived
all of her close relatives. In old age she could not paint and
suffered from diabetes, cataracts, rheumatism and neuralgia.
	   She barely escaped the Great Chicago Fire in 1871; she had
brought two of her paintings to the city, but both were destroyed
in a jewelry store where they were on display.
	   Cassatt never visited Chicago again but painted a 58-foot
(18-meter) mural, ``Modern Woman,'' for the World's Columbian
Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The mural was poorly received and
later was lost or destroyed.
	   But its installation revealed yet another of Cassatt's traits,
humility. When she learned it would be hung above the central
court, she did not object but said, ``Better painters than I am
have been put out of sight.''

A goodbye from George Martin, ``The Fifth Beatle''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY304 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's one of life's cruel ironies that a man who
helped create some of the century's most sublime sounds is losing
his ability to hear them.
	   Sir George Martin's handicap is barely noticeable. He'll lean in
a little closer to make sure he's not missing part of a
conversation, or politely ask that something be repeated.
	   Precise hearing is pretty important for a record producer,
though. His failing ears are among the reasons why Martin, who had
a hand in fashioning the Beatles' music from ``Love Me Do'' to
``The End,'' is calling it a career at age 72.
	   ``I used to be quite good,'' says the man they called ``The
Fifth Beatle.'' ``Now I think I'm not so good. ... Age is something
you can't do anything about. I'm lucky that I've been healthy. But
I'm also aware that time is very precious and I don't want to waste
time.''
	   Martin has the luxury _ and the clout _ to say goodbye on his
own terms.
	   His swan song, an all-star cover album of Beatles music called
``In My Life,'' is being released this month.
	   It's a strange brew. Celine Dion and Phil Collins deliver
poignant and pretty interpretations that are precisely what most
listeners would expect. But other selections are odd, if not
downright bizarre.
	   Goldie Hawn warbles ``A Hard Day's Night.'' Sean Connery recites
``In My Life.'' Robin Williams and Bobby McFerrin come together for
``Come Together.'' And when Jim Carrey admits, ``I defiled a
timeless piece of art,'' during his hyperactive rendition of ``I Am
the Walrus,'' he sounds puzzled rather than proud.
	   For anyone who doesn't understand, Martin explains: This is his
life, too.
	   He has worked with comedians, actors and classical musicians
throughout his career, not only the Beatles; he recorded Peter
Sellers' comic version of ``Can't Buy Me Love'' one year after the
Beatles sang it.
	   ``My life has been a mixed bag and this album is a mixed bag,''
he said during a recent visit to Manhattan. ``I think if people
understand that what we were doing was having fun, then they'll
appreciate it in a different way. We're not saying, `OK, this is
the best version you've ever heard of this particular song.' That
would be pompous. We're saying, 'Come and join us. We're having a
party.'''
	   Martin said he'd rather listen to Carrey doing ``I Am the
Walrus'' than Frank Sinatra singing ``Something.''
	   Since it was a party, Martin only invited people he thought
would get into the spirit and be fun to work with. ``I didn't
approach Barbra Streisand, for a start,'' he said. ``Is that
self-explanatory?''
	   ``In My Life'' was something of a release from the grueling job
of helping to compile the Beatles ``Anthology'' series of discs.
Martin spent months listening again to tapes of everything the
Beatles recorded.
	   He could hardly have anticipated the music would have been so
alive in people's minds more than three decades after it had been
created. It seemed an unlikely collaboration at first: the
thirtyish Londoner trained in classical music who spotted something
magical in the music of four cheeky young rockers from Liverpool.
	   Martin believed the Beatles were major talents when he first saw
them, even if their music wasn't very good at the time. ``I was
convinced that I would make some very good records with them that
would last five years at the least,'' he said.
	   Little did he know. Their subsequent musical growth ``was a
continuous surprise to me and I adored them for it,'' he said.
	   Martin was the man who signed the Beatles to a recording
contract in 1962 after listening to them audition, and he was in
the control room for the making of virtually all of their music. As
producer, he'd make many musical suggestions and try to bring the
Beatles' ideas to life.
	   It wasn't always fun, though. During the making of ``Let It
Be,'' the last Beatles album, Martin found it particularly
infuriating.
	   He was stung when John Lennon told him he wanted an album
``where we don't have your trickery.'' Lennon wanted an album
recorded live in the studio; what he got was the sound of a band
disintegrating.
	   ``I had to produce that album with chains on, all those
restrictions,'' he said. ``It was very boring.''
	   When recording was done, he felt his only option was to make the
album sound like a documentary of the Beatles at work. It sat on
the shelf and Martin thought the Beatles were through _ until Paul
McCartney approached him with the idea of making one last album
like the old days. The result was ``Abbey Road.''
	   ``It was the last time we worked together and it was a very
happy album,'' he said. ``John was as sweet as pie, even though he
didn't like the symphonic ideas I'd been pumping into Paul.''
	   Several months later, he was astonished to hear Lennon had given
the ``Let It Be'' tapes to producer Phil Spector, who was
overdubbing voices and instruments, adding orchestras and a choir.
``He was doing all the things that they said I couldn't do,''
Martin said.
	   ``To add insult to injury, they issued the record as produced by
Phil Spector, using my tapes,'' he said. ``EMI told me they didn't
want my name on the album. I said that contractually you have to
have my name on the album, because I did all the original work.''
	   The album cover ended up saying ``Reproduced for disc by Phil
Spector,'' and ``Thanks to George Martin.''
	   Although he's retiring from producing, Martin doesn't intend to
disappear. He'll participate in an occasional concert or TV show,
and he still helps run a radio station. He also wants to sail and
sculpt.
	   Martin stays in touch with the surviving Beatles, who have had
some tough times: George Harrison's throat cancer, the death of
McCartney's wife, Linda, of breast cancer.
	   ``The tragedy was that everybody thought she had licked the
disease and it turns around and bites when they didn't expect it,''
he said. ``He is still very, very shaken by it. He will recover,
but it will take time.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Oct. 18-24:
	   50 years ago: Moira Shearer and Anton Walbrook starred in ``The
Red Shoes.''
	   40 years ago: Buddy Holly recorded ``It Doesn't Matter Anymore''
at a studio in New York City. The song became a hit after Holly was
killed in a plane crash several months later.
	   25 years ago: Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford starred in
``The Way We Were.'' The film was directed by Sydney Pollack.
	   And ``Kojak,'' starring Telly Savalas, premiered on U.S.
television network CBS.
	   15 years ago: ``The Right Stuff,'' based on the Tom Wolfe best
seller about the U.S. space program, starred Sam Shepard, Scott
Glenn, Ed Harris and Dennis Quaid.
	   And the U.S. National Association of Theater Owners named Kim
Basinger ``Female Star of Tomorrow.''
	   10 years ago: Duran Duran publicized its latest album, ``Big
Thing,'' by giving a free concert for 5,000 fans in a Hollywood
parking lot. The concert was held outside the landmark Capitol
Records building.
	   ``Roseanne,'' starring Roseanne Barr as a blue collar housewife,
made its debut on the U.S. television network ABC.
	   And 10,000 Maniacs, which got its start in Jamestown, New York,
said thanks to the city. The band presented the mayor with a gold
record symbolizing 500,000 copies sold of the rock group's album,
``In My Tribe.''
	   One year ago: Just 37 days after its release, Elton John's
``Candle in the Wind 1997'' broke the record for the best-selling
single recording with 31.8 million copies shipped around the world.
The record was previously held by Bing Crosby's ``White
Christmas.''
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``I would like to have the same kind of career that John
Malkovich has, except I didn't really like that he was in 'Con
Air,' but I'm sure he does not care. He's always played really
interesting characters, and he's well-respected and interesting, as
opposed to being like every other actor.'' _ Actress Christina
Ricci, one of the stars of the film, ``The Ice Storm.''
	   ``At one point I had to change, to go from a teen-ager, but it's
just real hard, because you still want to do teen-ager things, have
fun and everything, and think about the work last. But you're not
going to stay a teen-ager all your life, and I'm not a teen-ager
anymore. So work is first and play is last.'' _ Singer Mary J.
Blige

	   In the spotlight: Dwight Yoakam, cowboy crooner
	    &UR; Image: With his tight jeans _ and low-riding cowboy hat
shadowing his eyes _ the lean Dwight Yoakam is cool and hip _ with
a country twang.
	    &UR; Personal stats: Yoakam was born on Oct. 23, 1956, in Pikeville,
Kentucky. He was raised in Columbus, Ohio, where he attended Ohio
State University. He gained fame in Los Angeles after being spurned
by record companies in Nashville, Tennessee.
	    &UR; Recording career: His 1986 debut album ``Guitars, Cadillacs,
Etc. Etc.'' sold more than a million copies. It included the hit,
``Honky Tonk Man,'' an old Johnny Horton song. ``This Time,''
released in 1993, produced four hits, including ``Ain't That Lonely
Yet.''
	   ``Under the Covers,'' released in 1997, is a collection of cover
songs, including remakes of songs by Ray Davies, Roy Orbison, Sonny
Bono, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. (``It was important to
find our own interpretation of everything we did,'' Yoakam said
when the collection was released.)
	    &UR; Plus, he acts: Yoakam won praise for his role as a short-fused
bully in the film, ``Sling Blade.'' He also starred in ``The Newton
Boys.'' His next film, ``The Minus Man,'' stars Sheryl Crow and
Janeane Garofalo.
	    &UR; Quote: ``I'll never quit playing country music, or at least

Morgan sets course record and take lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EL DORADO HILLS, California (AP) _ John Morgan had two eagles in
a course-record 9-under-par 63 Saturday and held a three-stroke
lead over four players after two rounds of the Raley's Gold Rush
Classic.
	   Morgan, a native of England and a non-winner in his second
season Senior PGA Tour, holed a 7-iron from 165 yards (150 meters)
on the par-4 5th and hit a 4-wood within 6 feet (1.8 meters) on the
par-5 14th for his eagles as he posted an 8-under 136 total at the
Serrano Country Club course.
	   Jim Colbert, the 1996 champion, shot a 67 and was at 139 along
with Dana Quigley, Gary McCord and Dale Douglass, all of whom had
68s.
	   Last week, Colbert won his first tournament since undergoing
prostate surgery in June 1997 and became the senior tour's career
earnings leader.
	   ``It's my best round in the U.S.; but I shot a 59 once in an
exhibition in England,'' said Morgan, whose wife Chris, a former
golf instructor, is his caddie. ``I think 10 under might win
tomorrow. I think there will be some rebounding by some guys.''
	   Morgan's round, which included no bogeys and required 27 putts,
eclipsed Butch Baird's course record of 64 set two years ago. J.C.
Snead also shot a 63 when the tournament was held at Rancho Murieta
in the first nine years of its 12-year tenure.
	   Nine players, including Jim Albus, one of the three first-round
leaders, were at 140.
	   Morgan began the day one stroke behind unheralded first-day
leaders John Schroeder, Kurt Cox and Albus after a 73 in winds that
gusted to more than 25 mph (40 kph). He began his second round in
much calmer conditions with birdies on Nos. 1 and 3.
	   ``If there's no wind, you can have a more measured approach,''
said Morgan, who's 51st on the senior tour money list, one position
shy of an exemption for next season. ``If you hit it properly,
there's no reason you can't hit it close. It turned out I did a
little bit better than that. Once you start making putts you think
you should make 20-footers on every hole.''
	   Morgan, whose pro career highlights include victories in
Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and numerous titles in his native country,
held the first-round lead last week at the TransAmerica. He
faltered to a 74 in the second round before finishing seventh.
	   ``Hopefully, I learned something from last week,'' said Morgan,
whose highest finishes this season are two fourth-place ties.
``I'll play the first nine holes tomorrow without looking at the
leaderboard, but I expect someone will make a charge tomorrow.''
	   Morgan finished his rookie season 45th on the money list, but
he's been disappointed this season.
	   ``Last year, every tournament was a new experience, but this
year I expected more of myself,'' said Morgan, a 30-year pro who
never played on the PGA Tour.
	   Defending champion Bob Eastwood shot a 72 and is nine strokes
behind at 145.

No autobahn speed limit, incoming German government says

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German motorists got good news and bad news
in the coalition deal worked out by the incoming center-left
government: no autobahn speed limits, but higher gasoline taxes.
	   After two weeks of talks, the newly elected Social Democrats and
Greens wrapped up their pact Saturday with agreement on
transportation policy and energy taxes _ among the most contentious
issues.
	   ``We're done,'' Social Democratic party chairman Oskar
Lafontaine said when asked what remained to be settled. Details on
social welfare reforms were to be announced Sunday.
	   The coalition partners plan a final round of talks on Monday to
settle Cabinet posts before signing the coalition agreement on
Tuesday.
	   The pact still must be approved by both parties at upcoming
conventions before Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is sworn in
Oct. 27.
	   The final deal hews closer to the platform of the dominant
Social Democrats than the sometimes far-out demands of the small,
ecology-minded Greens. But the Greens weren't complaining.
	   ``A party platform and coalition negotiations are two different
things,'' said Greens negotiator Baerbel Hoehn. ``The decisive
thing was to get something going.''
	   The Greens had been seeking a 100 kph (60 mph) speed limit on
Germany's famously unrestricted superhighways, but the coalition
deal says only that municipalities will be granted more leeway to
reduce speeds on city streets.
	   Both sides, however, said the issue of autobahn speed limits was
not dead. ``I'm optimistic that we're going to have a European
solution,'' Greens leader Gunda Roestel said, referring to
proposals for eventual common traffic rules throughout the European
Union.
	   After days of haggling over a so-called ``ecological tax
reform,'' they also agreed to raise taxes on gas, heating oil and
electricity in three phases.
	   The first hike, to take effect Jan. 1, includes 6 pfennigs (4
cents) a liter more on gasoline _ far less than the Greens wanted.
	   Party leaders said the next two phases had yet to be determined.
	   Social Democratic chairman Oskar Lafontaine, the designated
finance minister, said the first stage would raise 12 billion marks
(dlrs 7.5 billion), money that will be used to lower payments
employers and employees make for social security benefits _ and
hopefully spur job creation.
	   The new government has set fighting unemployment, currently
stuck above 10 percent, as its No. 1 priority.
	   Energy-intensive industries, such as steel mills and carmakers,
would be exempted from the first tax hike while Germany seeks to
even out energy costs throughout the European Union, Lafontaine
said.
	   In a partial win for the Greens, the partners also cast serious
doubt on whether a proposed magnetic-levitation train line between
Hamburg and Berlin will ever be built.
	   While agreeing to honor contracts already signed, they said the
federal government would not pay for any cost overruns.
	   The train's backers admitted Thursday that the stretch would
probably cost up to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more than
the 6.1 billion marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned.

Oxygen therapy is latest rage in Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY379 &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Remember those goofy tabloid headlines
exposing pop king Michael Jackson's use of a hyperbaric oxygen
chamber?
	   ``He hopes it will keep him young,'' Jackson's personal manager
Frank Dileo said at the time.
	   Now, oxygen-filled cocoons are all the rage in Hollywood.
Besides Jackson, who has a dlrs 125,000 in-home chamber, John
Travolta, Kirstie Alley and other celebrities use hyperbaric
systems in an attempt to thwart the ravages of age.
	   Miss Alley particularly likes the magic that pure oxygen works
on her complexion, said publicist Nancy Kane. ``She loves the
benefits for her skin,'' the spokeswoman said.
	   Show business types aren't the only ones.
	   Hyperbaric chambers are increasingly seen in hospital
inventories because of oxygen's capacity to aid healing. Trainers
for major sports teams also have the chambers on hand for athletes.
	   There are even a few free-standing facilities, like the Beverly
Hills Center for Hyperbaric Medicine on Beverly Boulevard.
	   ``It's in an explosive phase right now,'' said Dr. Ralph Potkin,
a pioneer in oxygen chamber therapy and operator of the center.
	   Trainers and doctors say oxygen therapy speeds up the healing
process and reduces scarring. It can cut surgical recovery time in
half, save limbs from amputation and help cancer patients with
radiation-damaged tissue.
	   Hyperbaric chambers have been commonly used to treat scuba
divers who rise too quickly to the surface and suffer the bends, as
well as burn victims and even those with flesh-eating bacteria.
	   But for those in the public eye, the chambers are seen as the
fountain of youth.
	   ``This is the new thing for celebrities. It's been such a rage,
just like getting a facial for some,'' said Potkin, chief of
pulmonary medicine and critical care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
and the University of California, Los Angeles.
	   His Beverly Hills center, complete with a back entrance to
ensure VIP privacy, is one of the nation's busiest free-standing
hyperbaric medical facilities.
	   ``Celebrities enjoy it because they are also separated from the
chaos of their everyday lives. There are no cell phones or
beepers,'' he said. ``They come in just to get energized and
relax.''
	   Celebrities also are interested in the ``longevity aspects'' of
oxygen therapy, Potkin said, but he cautions there is no scientific
proof that it has the ability to reverse or impede the aging
process.
	   The cost is about dlrs 200 an hour and up, but that's no problem
for the well-heeled.
	   ``These are people who spend dlrs 100 to dlrs 150 for a tanning
booth or a massage. This has therapeutic benefits,'' he said.
	   Potkin treats everyone from diabetics to divers, and, of course,
celebrities. Clients include very recognizable names, Potkin said,
but he won't name them.
	   ``A lot of them are cosmetic surgery patients with complications
or those who need to get back on the set sooner,'' he said. ``We
even had someone with a laser resurfacing who sent her kids off to
camp and didn't want her kids to know about it.''
	   He added, ``Frank Sinatra was supposed to have a chamber in his
home and sports teams have chambers.''
	   For up to 90 minutes, patients are placed in a clear plexiglass
housing that is filled with 100 percent oxygen. During treatment,
patients dressed in cotton smocks can watch television or videos or
listen to music, and many report it is as relaxing as any treatment
in a spa.
	   ``Oxygen under pressure affects the whole body. It stops
swelling, speeds up healing and reduces pain with no side effects.
Oxygen itself is really a medicine. From the medical side of
things, as far as wound healing and cosmetic surgery, it's the most
amazing scientific change in years,'' Potkin said.
	   ``A lot of people we see come from all over the world for
cosmetic surgery. They only want to be in town for a short time and
off the job a short time. They are willing to do whatever they can
to enhance healing. They also want privacy and we provide
confidentiality and discreetness.''
	   Rani Stoler, spokeswoman for Potkin, is an advocate.
	   ``We get so little oxygen now in the air. There's so much
pollution,'' she said. ``It regenerates cells, clears out toxins.
As you age, oxygen doesn't always get to the all the cells.''

PBS' film 'Africans in America' examines roots of slavery
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Consider these words:
	   ``When you make men slaves you deprive them of half their
virtue. ... You set them, in your own conduct, an example of fraud
and cruelty, and compel them to live with you in that state of
war.''
	   It is hard to imagine a more eloquent condemnation of a soulless
enterprise, or any better source: Olaudah Equiano, who was
kidnapped as a child in Africa, enslaved in America in the 1700s
and, finally, emerged a man who seized freedom.
	   His is one of many voices heard in ``Africans in America:
America's Journey Through Slavery,'' an incisive and stirring
four-part the PBS U.S. TV network documentary. It airs in the
United States this week.
	   Using personal stories to give life to history is a favored
technique of today's nonfiction filmmakers, and ``Africans in
America'' makes the most of it. With 18th- and 19th-century diaries
and other sources, many recently discovered, the series allows
people to illuminate _ or indict _ themselves and their time.
	   Here, for instance, is farmer George Washington, the future
president, striking a business deal: ``I will take six or more
negroes ... relying on your word that the whole are healthy, and
none of them addicted to running away. The latter I abominate.''
	   The irony of a man who would help win the American colonies'
freedom from Britain so casually enslaving others is inescapable.
But that dichotomy _ of a country symbolic of freedom yet built on
slavery _ is at the heart of ``Africans in America.''
	   The film dissects the attitudes that allowed slavery's
acceptance and how the process affected our developing national
character and society.
	   ``We tried to broaden the series and make it a much more
expansive story of the impact of Africans coming to America and
what that meant in terms of what this nation would become and what
its people would ultimately become,'' said Orlando Bagwell, the
project's executive director.
	   ``It's clear that some of these ideas that are born in this
period are ideas we still live with today, attitudes we still live
with, things we cannot change or lose that quickly,'' Bagwell said.
	   Angela Bassett, the actress, provides an effective narration.
The series also features readings by Andre Braugher, Avery Brooks
and William Hurt. A companion book to the series was co-written by
Charles Johnson, Patricia Smith and researchers at public
television station WGBH Boston. (Smith is the Boston Globe
columnist who was fired for fabricating people and quotations; PBS
has said her work on the book was thoroughly vetted.)
	   The documentary's first chapter, ``The Terrible
Transformation,'' relates the arrival of a handful of African
slaves in 1619, just 12 years after the first colonists landed at
Jamestown. It was a precursor to a lucrative human trade that
ultimately would ensnare more than 20 million black Africans. Most
perished along the horrific ``middle passage'' across the Atlantic
Ocean to the Americas, in which shiploads of chained human beings
were stacked like firewood, given little if any food or water and
virtually no fresh air.
	   By 1738, the Carolina colony's population had a black majority:
They outnumbered whites by two to one. By 1750, when Georgia
legalized slavery, every corner of British North America allowed
slave-owning.
	   There was conflict from the start, with violent slave rebellions
and violent reactions to fears of slave uprisings. And the turmoil
was not limited to the South: Thirteen slaves were burned alive at
the stake and 18 hanged in New York in 1741 after coerced witnesses
alleged an insurrection plot.
	   In ``Revolution,'' the second episode, the American colonies
fight for freedom from England as slaves challenge their bondage.
The role of blacks as soldiers on both sides of the struggle is
detailed, as is the nascent split between Northern and Southern
states over slavery.
	   ``Brotherly Love'' looks at the first four decades of the new
nation, including the growth of Philadelphia's unique free black
community, the role of black churches in demanding the end of slave
laws and the westward spread of slavery fueled by cotton farming.
	   Inventor Eli Whitney's marvel, the cotton gin, was great for the
American economy but, we learn, bad for the cause of black freedom.
	   The documentary concludes with ``Judgment Day,'' focusing on the
pre-Civil War years that included growing abolitionist activity and
the U.S. Supreme Court's Dred Scott ruling in 1857 that blacks were
not citizens, thus upholding the Fugitive Slave Law and leaving
blacks unprotected by the Constitution.
	   One wrenching segment tracks the result of the 1850 Fugitive
Slave Law, which the film says created a ``reign of terror'' as
slaveholders exercised their rights to enter Northern cities and
kidnap long-freed blacks, and many blacks who were born free and
had never been enslaved.
	   Says historian Eric Foner: ``You could think what you wanted
about slavery hundreds of miles (kilometers) away, but when an
individual comes to your community, a black individual fleeing
marshals who are trying to grab him and send him back into slavery,
it puts slavery on a human level.
	   ``It made people have to choose,'' Foner says in the film.
	   The program's producer would like to see viewers make a choice
as well: to consider how the past shaped racial perceptions in
America and continues to inform race relations.
	   To allow slavery to be implemented and supported, Americans had
to be convinced that lifelong bondage _ which included rape,
mutilation, torture and slaughter _ of a people was acceptable,
Bagwell said.
	   ``That began the slow movement toward creating ideas of racial
differences and creating ideas of moral justification. ... It set
up ideas about what makes these people enslavable and what allows
others to be free,'' he said.
	   The result was a society with a stake in casting whites as
superior and blacks as inferior, a society with ingrained
prejudices.
	   ``If you're looking at something that lasts 240 years, one
generation after another after another, you can understand how
entrenched those ideas can become. And how they become not just
beliefs but, at a certain level, what some would think of as
truths.''

	   ``The Bootleg Series Vol. 4 _ Bob Dylan Live 1966, The `Royal
Albert Hall' Concert'' (Sony Legacy)
	   Most of the attention given this long-awaited concert document
has gone, rightfully so, to the electric half performed by Bob
Dylan with the musicians who would become The Band.
	   It's a remarkable example of an artist following his muse
despite outright hostility from an alienated audience. It's almost
unimaginable today _ think of Sarah McLachlan kicking off the next
Lilith Fair with a set of her favorite heavy metal covers.
	   Dylan's performance is one huge nose thumbing in the direction
of an angry audience. Their protests only make him sing louder, as
if he can shout them down by himself. The band follows his lead,
bashing away with all their might. And it's electric in more ways
than one; their playing is not just loud, it's suffused with the
excitement of creating new paths.
	   Yet it's the acoustic half of this two-disc set that's truly
spectacular. Dylan's at the peak of his poetic powers, and he burns
through epics like ``Desolation Row'' and ``Visions of Johanna,''
the songs also new to the people watching.
	   Knowing the challenge that awaits him and his audience, Dylan
doesn't kiss off the set. ``It's All Over Now, Baby Blue'' and
``Just Like a Woman'' are fed by fresh emotion _ their wounds raw
and not covered up by 30 years of calluses that make their
performance now inevitably different. Dylan's youthful voice, too,
is a supple wonder.
	   For all the amusement the electric disc provides in retrospect _
it's just rock 'n' roll, folks, it won't kill you _ the acoustic
half is, on the whole, filled with better songs.
	   This much-bootlegged concert catches Dylan at a frantically
creative time, one soon to be lost forever when a motorcycle
accident sent him into seclusion. This set should help succeeding
generations understand what the fuss was all about.
	   _ By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Highways and Honky Tonks'' (Rounder) _ Heather Myles
	   ``Highways and Honky Tonks'' is a great album, maybe the best
country album of the year. Heather Myles has a big, strong, twangy
voice that goes as well with a steel guitar and fiddle as gin does
with tonic and a lime. This is straight-ahead, classic country, the
type that should appeal to fans of Loretta Lynn or Merle Haggard,
who joins Myles for a duet on ``No One Is Gonna Love You Better.''
	   There are several songs here, including the jangly ``You're
Gonna Love Me One Day'' and ``True Love,'' that sound like they
ought to be hits, if country radio would only play them. Of course,
this is exactly the sort of music that sends the people who program
Today's Hot New Country running for cover _ it's big and bold, a
Harley-Davidson in a Vespa world. Myles is a great country singer,
and the proof is right here in these 12 songs.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Cry Cry Cry'' (Razor and Tie) _ Cry Cry Cry, with Dar
Williams, Lucy Kaplansky and Richard Shindell
	   ``Cry Cry Cry'' is an album of covers from three of today's most
brilliant singer-songwriters, which sounds like a recipe for
trouble _ so often the whole ends up being somehow less than the
sum of its parts in these projects. Happily, Dar Williams, Lucy
Kaplansky and Richard Shindell _ collectively Cry Cry Cry _ have
made a lovely album.
	   Fans of each of these three artists will find plenty to make
them smile: Shindell takes the lead vocals on a moving, chilling
``Cold Missouri Waters,'' Kaplansky shines on ``By Way of Sorrow''
by the sorely overlooked Julie Miller; and Williams reclaims
R.E.M.'s ``Fall on Me'' for folk music. The only real problem here
is tempo: After a ripping version of Robert Earl Keen's ``Shades of
Gray'' about midway through, things get _ and stay _ a little soft.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Man of My Word'' (Rounder) _ Johnny Adams
	   The great New Orleans soul and jazz singer Johnny Adams released
one of the finest albums of his storied career before his death
Sept. 14. ``Man of My Word'' is a classic, an album that can stand
alongside the works of Otis Redding, Solomon Burke or any of the
great soul singers.
	   Just listen to Adams on the opening song, the mournful ``Even
Now,'' as he slowly builds in intensity until the end, when his
heartache seems to overwhelm him and he unleashes a pained
falsetto. It seems almost pointless to keep going after a song that
great, but those who do will find the rest of ``Man of My Word'' a
real treat.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Alabama Song'' (MCA) _ Allison Moorer
	   Allison Moorer showed her star potential on the soundtrack to
``The Horse Whisperer.'' Her softly aching ballad, ``A Soft Place
to Fall,'' made her shine even among the luminaries on that album,
and it's a highlight of her debut disc as well. Moorer has more
going for her than that one gorgeous song, although she sounds most
comfortable when she's singing in a similar vein. In that respect,
she's the other side of the coin from her sister, Shelby Lynne,
whose sonic assault is unmatched in country music. Moorer can kick
it as well, but her talent lies more in the way she uses her lacy
voice to wring heartache out of even the most mundane moments.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``A Cloud of Red Dust'' (Blue Note) _ Stefon Harris
	   Stefon Harris' debut as a leader heralds the arrival of a large
talent in jazz. Harris is the most exciting thing to happen to the
vibes in ages, playing with a warmth and melodic sense that belies
his years. Further, he leads one cooking band on ``A Cloud of Red
Dust,'' inspiring terrific work from them, especially pianist
Mulgrew Miller.

A long strange trip to Series for `El Duque'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando Hernandez was back in Cuba a year ago, a
virtual prisoner in his own country as he watched his half brother
Livan pitch the World Series opener.
	   On Sunday night, far from his homeland, ``El Duque'' will pitch
for the New York Yankees in the second game of this year's Series.
	   ``No, I didn't think I'd be here today,'' he said Saturday.
``But yes, I did think of finding a way to one day be here.''
	   Last October, Orlando was earning 206 pesos (dlrs 10) a month.
Now, after defecting on a raft with seven others on Dec. 26, he has
a dlrs 6.6 million, four-year contract and is about to appear in
baseball's most intense spotlight, facing San Diego's Andy Ashby in
Game 2.
	   ``El Duque,'' who went 12-4 with a 3.13 ERA after making his
major league debut in June, appears to be taking it calmly, as he
did in Game 4 of the AL championship series, when it seemed as if
the Yankees' season was starting to spin out of control.
	   ``He showed me a tremendous calm when at that point in time,
down 2-1, playing on the road, was something we needed,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``He allowed his ability to take over, and
I don't anticipate any change tomorrow.''
	   When Livan Hernandez pitched for the Marlins last October,
earning the Most Valuable Player award of the NL championship
series and the World Series, it wasn't easy for ``El Duque'' to
watch. With American television not available, he had to go to
CNN's studios on the communist island.
	   Not that Cubans didn't find out about Livan's exploits.
	   ``A lot of newspapers get to Cuba,'' Orlando said. ``Radio Marti
is a very popular station in Cuba and some people have
satellites.''
	   Ashby, who joined the Padres in 1993, has had a more
conventional career. A first-time All-Star, he went 17-9 with a
3.34 ERA, setting a career high with 151 strikeouts in 226 2-3
innings.
	   ``One of the main things is staying healthy,'' said Ashby,
bothered by arm problems in previous years. ``It's been a struggle
the last few years, but I think it's made me a better person.''
	   Ashby appreciates all that ``El Duque'' has gone through.
	   ``I think it shows you how much desire he has to play major
league baseball,'' Ashby said, ``and what it means to him _ and not
only him but to everyone that put this uniform on.''
	   Ashby, like most of the Padres, was in awe of Yankee Stadium.
	   ``Yankee Stadium is something special with all the history,'' he
said. ``You go back and look at the monuments, see the type of
players, you look back on the things that have happened in this
stadium, it's very special.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie''
should do a fine job of entertaining children. But grown-ups will
find their minds wandering.
	   Full of feel-good platitudes, studded with sugary songs, it's a
Mr. Rogers version of the favorite Christmas tale. As for the
dialogue, this is the kind of movie where Santa can declare he has
an idea ``so crazy it just might work.''
	   The animated feature adds some twists to the well-known tale.
Rudolph (voiced by Eric Pospisil and Kathleen Barr) gets a doe
friend named Zoey. And he leads a mission to rescue her from the
evil witch Stormella (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg), who brews up a
blizzard that threatens to cancel Santa's big flight.
	   Of course, the flight goes on, led by the glowing nasal beacon
of you-know-who. Stormella, a pale imitation of the sea witch
Ursula in ``The Little Mermaid,'' ends up casting a spell on
herself to become nice.
	   How nice. This whole movie is nice. And if that's what you're
after, it's just fine.
	   ``Rudolph'' was directed and produced by William R. Kowalchuk.
John Goodman and Debbie Reynolds supply the voices for Santa and
Mrs. Claus, and Bob Newhart, Eric Idle and Richard Simmons do the
other characters.
	   The movie will appear on video Nov. 10 after a brief theatrical
release.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It could have been so resonant, so memorable: a
Reconstruction-era tale of compromise, motherhood, racial politics
and ghosts. Sadly, though, Jonathan Demme's ``Beloved'' is a
disappointment, a hodgepodge of images and unsatisfying
storytelling.
	   Based on the Toni Morrison novel, ``Beloved'' chronicles the
life of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), a former slave living with her
daughter in a farmhouse outside Cincinnati eight years after the
Civil War.
	   Their life is simple and streaked with melancholy. Sethe's
husband never joined her after she escaped from a cruel Kentucky
plantation called ``Sweet Home.'' Her other daughter, who died as a
baby, haunts the house so virulently that Sethe's two sons leave
when they are still young boys. Still, Sethe insists the haunting
is not malevolent. ``It ain't evil,'' she says. ``Just sad.''
	   Into this sad homestead walks Paul D (Danny Glover), a friend of
Sethe's from Sweet Home who has been on the move for 16 years. He
moves in, sees the emotional and physical scars that slavery
imprinted upon Sethe, and his deep affection for her grows into
passion.
	   Sethe's living daughter, the blooming Denver (Kimberly Elise),
meanwhile, is battling with her own demons. The haunting, and her
mother's suffocating love, have kept her in the house, undermined
her education and made her a pariah. She is frustrated and sad, and
she needs a change.
	   When her baby sister's ghost falls silent, Denver is skeptical.
``I think the baby ain't gone,'' she breathes. ``I think the baby
got plans.''
	   Then, one crisp fall afternoon, Sethe, Denver and Paul D return
home to find a young, almond-eyed woman in a flowing dress (Thandie
Newton) laden with crawling lady bugs slumped against a tree trunk
in their yard. Childlike and drooling but strikingly beautiful, she
says in an unsettling baby voice that her name is Beloved.
	   ``Something strange about that girl,'' says Paul D.
	   Matters disintegrate from there. Strange things begin happening;
strange relationships develop. And, as Sethe takes to Beloved with
a blissful obsession, a dark secret that Sethe has hidden begins to
wend its way into the open, with appalling consequences that all
point directly back to her.
	   The above plot synopsis, of course, only scratches the surface.
Because the plot of ``Beloved'' is permitted to run wild over the
production, with bewildering results.
	   Relationships are often unclear; the character of Sethe's late
mother-in-law, a charismatic spiritual woman called ``Baby Suggs''
(Beah Richards, in a lovely performance), has a name that begs
confusion with Sethe's dead daughter; and there are so many story
arcs and false mini-climaxes that it's merely a relief when, after
nearly three hours, the film ends.
	   This is not to say that ``Beloved'' lacks redeeming qualities.
Its production design is wonderful. Its themes, when intelligible,
resonate. So rarely are we permitted a glimpse into the immediate
results of what slavery wrought; for that story to be told in such
a quiet, dignified manner speaks well of Demme and his players.
	   Winfrey, who co-produced and whose clout ensured the film was
made, delivers a palatable but not dazzling performance. She does
make you forget that she's Oprah, but one wonders what an actress
of enormous substance like Alfre Woodard could have done.
	   Newton (``Jefferson in Paris'') is lovely, ethereal and
expressive, but the one-note character that the script provides her
eventually grows annoying. Far more memorable are Glover and Elise
(``Set It Off''), both of whom offer muted, disciplined
performances that carry the film. Look for Jason Robards in a
cameo.
	   So is ``Beloved'' about guilt? Is it about redemption? Slavery?
Or is it just a good tale? There are too many story arcs to be
certain.
	   ``Beloved'' is a textured epic told on a small canvas. But the
colors bleed, the paint is daubed on to excess and the final image
is so blurred that it has been rendered unrecognizable. The sad
fact: Despite a worthy story, ``Beloved'' never fulfills its
intriguing potential.
	   The Touchstone Pictures release was produced by Harpo Films.

Postel, Internet pioneer, dies after heart surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TED BRIDIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jon Postel, the Internet pioneer who wielded
enormous influence managing technical details of the global
computer network, has died of complications from heart surgery in
Los Angeles, friends in Washington said Saturday. He was 55.
	   Postel, a crucial player in the future of the Internet, died
Friday night while recovering from surgery to replace a leaking
heart valve, said Vint Cerf, a senior vice president for MCI
Worldcom Inc. who worked closely with Postel.
	   The death also was announced Saturday at an Internet conference
in Barcelona, said Bill Semich, the president of .nu domain,
another Internet company.
	   Postel's death comes at a critical juncture for the Internet,
with the U.S. government in the midst of largely turning over
management of the worldwide network to a nonprofit group that
Postel helped organize.
	   Though Postel worked behind the scenes and was hardly known
outside high-tech circles, his role as director of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority allowed the Internet to match unique
numerical addresses for computers on the global network with its
millions of Web addresses, such as www.ap.org.
	   So powerful was Postel that ``The Economist'' once dubbed him
``god'' of the Internet.
	   ``Jon was a very private person and didn't seek the limelight at
all,'' said Cerf, who attended high school with Postel in
California. ``He preferred to exercise his stewardship role in a
very quiet but competent way.''
	   Earlier this year, Postel drew sharp criticism but demonstrated
his influence when he redirected half the Internet's 12
directory-information computers to his own system. He told U.S.
officials afterward he was running a test to see how smoothly such
a transition could be made.
	   Cerf said Postel underwent a heart-valve replacement in 1991,
but the replacement value started to leak about 10 days ago. He was
quickly hospitalized for surgery and was recovering when he died
suddenly.
	   ``One minute he was alert and laughing about a joke, and the
next minute he was gone,'' Cerf said. ``It was very fast.''
	   Postel, who was unmarried with no children, was intensely
private. When a recent trade publication profiled him and told him
readers were interested in his personal life, he answered: ``If we
tell them, they won't be interested anymore.''
	   Cerf said Postel is survived by a brother, Mort Postel, who
lives in Los Angeles.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton held
extensive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the West
Bank summit, trying to smooth discord over a long-sought accord
that would give the Palestinians control over more land on which
they hope to establish a state.
	   Clinton was trying to clear the way for an agreement by Sunday,
the end of four days of talks, but signs of discord were evident.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
reject the deal if Palestinain leader Yasser Arafat did not take
strong action to uproot terrorist cells on land he already
controls.
	   CIA director George Tenet was at Clinton's side in Saturday's
sessions with Netanyahu and Arafat, underscoring U.S. efforts to
gather intelligence on terrorists whose attacks have damaged
Mideast peacemaking.
	   No claims of progress were made by the U.S. hosts as the talks
wound past nightfall, interrupted only for a barbecue dinner for
the American, Israeli and Palestinian delegations.
	   ``A constructive, pragmatic approach continues,'' James P.
Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokemsan, said. ``Everyone's mood
remains that we are determined to keep the pace as intensive as
possible.''
	   According to diplomatic sources, key security issues remained
unsettled, and Netanyahu and Arafat exchanged allegations
underscoring mistrust between the two leaders.
	   At a face-to-face meeting Friday, the sources told The
Associated Press, Netanyahu raised an old complaint about thousands
of cars being stolen from Israelis. The sources, insisting on
anonymity, said Arafat responded that Jewish settlers were the
thieves.
	   On another touchy point, the sources said Arafat told Netanyahu
that Jewish extremists were collaborating with Arab extremists.
	   On a bright, sunny day, Clinton arrived on Maryland's rural
Eastern Shore by helicopter from Washington and met first, over
lunch, for 45 minutes with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and other senior aides.
	   The president then walked to Houghton House, where Arafat was
waiting at the door. Together, they went to the library and talked
for 90 minutes.
	   Arafat walked Clinton back to his quarters, and the president
telephoned a report to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
	   A 90-minute meeting with Netanyahu at River House, a luxurious
estate overlooking the Wye River, followed. At nightfall, Clinton
and Netanyahu went out and walked along the river.
	   Clinton subsequently returned to Houghton House to have dinner
with Arafat. ``The president had an extended conversation with
Prime Minister Netanyahu and wanted to get back and spend time with
Chairman Arafat before he want back to Washington,'' says White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
	   Lockhart gave reporters a terse account of Saturday's talks that
made no reference to the disputed topics.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels also blamed each other in new
shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented progress and setback
for last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve
the conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, an advance team of specialists arrived in Yugoslavia
to do set up for the monitors.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the
54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to
have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number remaining exceeds
the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But just a day after NATO gave Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill
his peace pledge, new attacks reported throughout the province put
new urgency into implementing the agreement.
	   In the worst of those, three Serb policemen were found killed
after what their colleagues said was a KLA grenade attack on the
house they occupied along a main Kosovo road in Orlate, 20 miles
(30 kilometers) southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina.
Two other police were seriously wounded, they said. AP reporters
who drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied bodies on the second
floor.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina claimed earlier that KLA
``extremists'' had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces
since late Friday. Machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades allegedly
were used to target Serb police and at least two Serbs were
reported wounded.
	   A Serb police commander at the police checkpoint at Dragobilje
said the rebels are trying to ``use the agreement to open fire on
us.''
	   ``They want to provoke us into a response, and get NATO to
attack,'' said the commander, who goes by the nom de guerre Baja.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac had
opened fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car.
	   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   But signs of progress in implementing the Kosovo peace agreement
also continued Saturday.
	   Milos Radulovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to London, told British
Broadcasting Corp. radio that security forces would be withdrawn
from Kosovo before the Oct. 27 deadline set by NATO.
	   And humanitarian organizations have stepped up efforts to get
aid to the refugees before winter.
	   In the town of Pagarusa, southwest of Pristina, the United
Nations on Saturday delivered 160 tons of flour, oil and other food
to refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where Serbs make up only
about 10 percent of the population, remain skeptical of Milosevic's
compliance. They also are reluctant to accept anything short of
independence for the province, while international officials urge a
lesser form of self-rule.

Deposed Malaysian leader says Prime Minister Mahathir fears
</HEADLINE>
people's wrath
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader
said his release him from detention under a harsh security law was
prompted by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fear of his
countrymen's wrath and pressure from the international community.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, the dismissed deputy prime minister who was
arrested under Malaysia's harsh Internal Security Act, made the
remark in a statement released from jail. He is awaiting trial to
face a number of corruption and sex charges.
	   The statement was circulated by Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail,
late Saturday night. It was the first such statement issued since
his arrest.
	   Anwar, 51, was taken into custody under the Internal Security
Act on Sept. 20 after he organized mammoth rallies against the
government. After 24 days in detention under the ISA, he was
shifted to a regular jail cell where he has been permitted access
to his lawyers and family.
	   The security, which allows for indefinite imprisonment without
trial, had restricted such access.
	   The deposed deputy premier said Prime Minister Mahathir's
government had acted to stem growing public sympathy for Anwar and
ease pressure from abroad before Malaysia hosts a summit meeting
next month of leaders from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   ``The plan was to get me out of ISA detention before APEC
begins,'' Anwar Ibrahim said in the statement.
	   Malaysia's police chief, meanwhile, said more charges could be
brought against Anwar, The Star newspaper said Sunday. Rahim Noor
was quoted as saying that a probe into the activities of the
dissident politician were ongoing.
	   Anwar's case drew international condemnation after he appeared
in court with bruises and a black eye, and alleged he was a victim
of police brutality.
	   Among those sympathetic to him were governments of several
countries scheduled to attend the APEC summit meeting in Kuala
Lumpur. The presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines have not
yet confirmed their attendance.
	   Malaysia says the economic forum should not be politicized.
	   Within Malaysia, protests have continued over Anwar's Sept. 2
dismissal and his subsequent arrest.
	   Defying a police order, Azizah Ismail joined thousands of
protesters demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   It was the first protest in which Azizah has participated since
her husband was arrested last month after leading rallies against
Mahathir's rule. Police have warned her against getting involved in
the reform campaign her husband began.
	   Hundreds of people rushed to Azizah's car shouting ``Reforms!
Reforms!'' and ``Mahathir Resign!'' She shook hands with some from
inside her car. The couple's 18-year-old daughter, Nurul Izzah,
accompanied her.
	   Later, police beat protesters with rattan canes to get them off
the streets and witnesses said dozens of demonstrators were
arrested.
	   Police fired a water cannon to disperse the crowd of nearly
10,000 protesters who had marched to the palace of Malaysia's
constitutional monarch, demanding that Anwar be reinstated as the
nation's deputy prime minister.
	   Officers also used batons to push away demonstrators who blocked
a highway near the palace for nearly 30 minutes. Witnesses saw
police dragging several people away.
	   Nurul traveled out of Malaysia recently to meet with Presidents
B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Joseph Estrada of the Philippines.
Both expressed support for her father.
	   Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar saying his former heir-apparent was
morally unfit to rule. Anwar has denied the charges, saying they
were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he had posed to
Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   His trial begins Nov. 2.

control over more land on which they hope to establish a state.
	   Clinton was trying to clear the way for an agreement by Sunday,
the end of four days of talks, but signs of discord were evident.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to reject the
deal if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat did not take strong action
to uproot terrorist cells on land he already controls.
	   No claims of progress were made by the U.S. hosts as the talks
wound past nightfall Saturday, interrupted only for a barbecue
dinner for the American and Palestinian delegations. Nor was a
three-way meeting held, which might have indicated the President
had narrowed differences between Netanyahu and Arafat sufficiently
to bring them together to try to go further.
	   ``A constructive, pragmatic approach continues,'' James P.
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said. ``Everyone's mood
remains that we are determined to keep the pace as intensive as
possible.''
	   CIA director George Tenet was at Clinton's side in the sessions
with Netanyahu and Arafat, underscoring U.S. efforts to gather
intelligence on terrorists whose attacks have damaged Mideast
peacemaking.
	   According to diplomatic sources, key security issues remained
unsettled, and Netanyahu and Arafat exchanged allegations that
suggest mistrust between the two leaders persists.
	   At a face-to-face meeting Friday, the sources told The
Associated Press, Netanyahu raised an old complaint about thousands
of cars being stolen from Israelis. The sources, insisting on
anonymity, said Arafat responded that Jewish settlers were the
thieves.
	   On another touchy point, the sources said Arafat told Netanyahu
that Jewish extremists were collaborating with Arab extremists.
	   Arafat, on the other hand, reportedly was insisting that the
Israeli pullback being negotiated be followed by another one.
	   Clinton arrived Saturday on Maryland's rural Eastern Shore by
helicopter from Washington and met first, over lunch, with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
and other senior aides.
	   The president met Arafat 90 minutes, and telephoned a report to
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He then met Netanyahu twice for a
total of three hours.
	   Clinton was returning to this pastoral resort Sunday in hopes of
closing a deal on the final day of the four-day talks, but signs of
discord were evident. Hawkish Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Yizhak Mordechai were flying in to join the
Israeli side for Sunday's talks.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart gave reporters a terse
account that made no reference to the disputed topics.
	   ``We think the environment out here has provided the ability for
informal discussions and has provided an atmosphere that is
constructive,'' Lockhart said.
	   He said Clinton had a ``reservoir of trust'' with the two
leaders, and if he can play ``a constructive role,'' the president
will return Sunday.
	   The talks are being held under a virtual news blackout imposed
by the administration on the theory that secrecy is conducive to
compromise.
	   According to diplomatic sources, the Palestinians have accepted
neither an Israeli demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to
Israel for trial nor an American compromise that they be tried by
Palestinian courts.
	   And while the Palestinians were willing to take steps to enhance
security in Ramallah, a major Arab city on the outskirts of
Jerusalem, there was ``absolutely no real movement on anything''
else Friday.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement unless Arafat takes concrete
steps to curb terrorism.
	   Albright is backing Israel in its call for improved security and
the uprooting of terrorist cells on territory already under the
control of Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   In an Associated Press interview Thursday, she described the
agreement she is trying to nail down as an exchange of land for
security.
	   Arafat's position is that peace itself will bring better
security and that he is already making a 100 percent effort to
combat violence against Israelis.
	   A key Israeli demand is that 36 suspects be extradited for
trial. Israel claims that 30 are implicated in the deaths of
Israeli civilians and 10 are serving in the Palestinian police
force.

Typhoon Zeb weakens into tropical storm, 11 reported dead in Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A typhoon which cut a destructive swath through
Asia, killing dozens and severely disrupting major transportation
routes, weakened to a tropical storm Sunday as it crossed over the
Japanese archipelago and moved into the Sea of Japan.
	   Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines
and 18 in Taiwan, was downgraded to a tropical storm by Japan's
Meteorological Agency as of 9:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) as it swirled
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) west of Aomori, a city 576
kilometers (360 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   At least 11 people in Japan were killed by landslides and
weather-related accidents and three others were reported missing,
national broadcaster NHK said. More than 1,500 people were forced
to flee their homes.
	   After coming ashore late Saturday in southern Japan, the storm
blew into the Sea of Japan and was moving toward the coast of the
country's northernmost main island of Hokkaido at a speed of 90
kilometers (56 miles) per hour.
	   Parts of Hokkaido were expected to get up to 150 millimeters (6
inches) of rain Sunday, with as much as 20 millimeters (a 3/4 inch)
of rainfall in a one hour period, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   In southwestern Japan's Okayama prefecture, a 40-year-old woman
and her two school-age sons died after a landslide destroyed their
house early Sunday, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Another landslide killed an elderly couple and their 41-year-old
son late Saturday in neighboring Hiroshima prefecture.
	   The storm caused the cancellation of domestic flights, including
some departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, and disrupted train and
ferry service all across Japan.
	   Before landing in Japan, Typhoon Zeb devastated parts of the
Philippines and Taiwan late last week.
	   Most of the 74 people killed in the Philippines drowned or were
buried in landslides. Ten people were still missing as of late
Saturday and the casualty figure was expected to rise as reports
come in from isolated villages.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   In Taiwan, 18 people were dead and up to 19 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295 kph)
184 mph.

Temple shocks Virginia Tech; Northern Illinois ends 23-game losing
</HEADLINE>
streak &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Three of college football's lowliest
teams pulled off stunning victories Saturday, while UCLA won a wild
shootout over Oregon in a matchup of unbeaten teams.
	   Previously winless Temple shocked No. 14 Virginia Tech 28-24,
Northern Illinois ended the nation's longest major-college losing
streak at 23 games with a 16-6 win over Central Michigan, and
Rutgers snapped a 13-game road losing streak by beating Pittsburgh
25-21.
	   Second-ranked UCLA beat No. 11 Oregon 41-38 in overtime on a
24-yard field goal by Chris Sailer, who had missed a 21-yarder on
the final play of regulation.
	   UCLA (5-0, 3-0 Pac-10) extended the nation's longest winning
streak to 15 games, but had some anxious moments after Oregon (5-1,
2-1) scored 24 consecutive points to pull ahead 31-24 early in the
fourth quarter.
	   Brian Clark kicked three field goals as Northern Illinois (1-5,
1-2 Mid-American) won for the first time since Sept. 21, 1996.
Students tore down the goal posts after the game, which was delayed
26 minutes in the first quarter by lightning.
	   ``Not until it was over did I feel we had won,'' coach Joe Novak
said. ``Our kids played possessed. They came through when we needed
to.''
	   Freshman Devin Scott threw for 155 yards and two touchdowns as
Temple (1-6, 1-2 Big East) beat Virginia Tech (5-1, 3-1). It was
the Owls' first road victory in the Big East after 26 losses and
their first win over a ranked team in 11 years.
	   Scott scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 1-yard sneak with 6:08
left and Temple won despite Virginia Tech driving 86 yards to the
Owls' 2 in the closing minutes. Ricky Hall dropped a pass in the
end zone with 24 seconds remaining, and Lamont Pegues was stopped
for a loss on a fourth-down sweep.
	   ``The Temple jinx that we cannot win a game, that last goal-line
play just kicked that door down,'' Owls coach Bobby Wallace said.
	   Mike McMahon threw two touchdown passes in the third quarter as
Rutgers (3-3, 1-3 Big East) rallied to beat Pitt. Rutgers, a
21-point underdog, entered the game 0-9 in Pittsburgh and 2-13
overall against the Panthers.
	   In Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 45, Minnesota 15; No. 4
Kansas State 52, Oklahoma State 20; No. 5 Florida 24, Auburn 3; No.
25 Georgia Tech 41, No. 7 Virginia 38; No. 9 Wisconsin 37, Illinois
3; No. 12 Penn State 31, Purdue 13; No. 13 Georgia 31, Vanderbilt
6; No. 16 Arizona 28, Oregon State 7; No. 17 Arkansas 41, South
Carolina 28; No. 19 Colorado 19, No. 22 Texas Tech 17; No. 20
Missouri 20, Oklahoma 6; No. 23 Syracuse 42, Boston College 25; and
No. 24 Tulane 28, Louisville 22.
	   In late games, it was Clemson at No. 6 Florida State, Kansas at
No. 8 Nebraska, No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M at Baylor, and Kentucky at No. 21
LSU.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 45, Minnesota 15 &QC; 
	   At Columbus, Ohio, Joe Germaine passed for 339 yards and two
touchdowns, and David Boston had 10 receptions for 191 yards as
Ohio State routed Minnesota.
	   Michael Wiley rushed for 119 yards and a touchdown, and Central
McClellion scored on a 55-yard interception return for the Buckeyes
(6-0, 3-0 Big Ten). Minnesota (3-3, 0-3) hasn't won at Ohio Stadium
since 1949.
 &UR; No. 2 UCLA 41, No. 11 Oregon 38, OT &QC; 
	   At Pasadena, California, UCLA tied the game on a 2-yard
touchdown run by Jermaine Lewis with 10:13 remaining and went ahead
38-31 on a 60-yard TD pass from Cade McNown to Danny Farmer with
2:36 left.
	   But the Ducks tied the game on a 2-yard pass from Akili Smith to
Damon Griffin with 22 seconds to play and Nathan Villegas'
conversion. After Oregon's overtime possession was halted by an
interception, Keith Brown's running helped UCLA move into position
for Sailer's winning field goal.
 &UR; No. 4 Kansas St. 52, Oklahoma St. 20 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop threw three TD passes and
ran for two as Kansas State broke an 88-year-old school record with
its 14th straight victory.
	   Bishop completed only 8 of 23 passes, but those completions
covered 287 yards, including a 60-yard strike to the 1 that set up
Frank Murphy's 2-yard TD run in the third.
 &UR; No. 5 Florida 24, Auburn 3 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, Doug Johnson passed for 198 yards and
two touchdowns and Travis McGriff scored twice as Florida (6-1, 4-1
SEC) extended its home winning streak to 26 games.
	   McGriff ran for a score on an end-around and caught a 15-yard TD
pass for the Gators, who scored all their points in the first half
against struggling Auburn (1-5, 1-4).
 &UR; No. 25 Georgia Tech 41, No. 7 Virginia 38 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Dez White turned a short catch into a 54-yard
touchdown with 4:40 remaining to give Georgia Tech (5-1, 4-0 ACC) a
victory over Virginia (5-1, 3-1).
	   White scored on half of his six pass receptions, which covered
243 yards to break the school record of 223 set last year by
Derrick Steagall, also against Virginia.
 &UR; No. 9 Wisconsin 37, Illinois 3 &QC; 
	   At Champaign, Illinois, Ron Dayne rushed for 190 yards and three
scores as Wisconsin (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) remained unbeaten.
	   It was Dayne's sixth straight 100-yard game this year. Illinois
(2-5, 1-3) had only two first downs in the first half.
 &UR; No. 12 Penn State 31, Purdue 13 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, freshman Eric McCoo rushed for
163 yards and one touchdown and Aaron Harris scored twice as Penn
State (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) downed Purdue (3-4, 1-2).
	   Purdue's Drew Brees was pressured all day by Penn State's
defense, but still completed 39 of 57 passes for 361 yards and one
touchdown.
 &UR; No. 13 Georgia 31, Vanderbilt 6 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, two-way starter Champ Bailey turned two
screen passes into touchdowns and set up two other scores as
Georgia (5-1, 3-1 SEC) beat winless Vanderbilt (0-6, 0-4).
	   Bailey, an All-SEC cornerback last season, made his third start
at wide receiver this season. He caught a 29-yard TD pass from
freshman Quincy Carter in the first quarter and added a 44-yard
scoring catch in the third period.
 &UR; No. 16 Arizona 28, Oregon St. 7 &QC; 
	   At Corvallis, Oregon, Kelvin Eafon scored on three short
touchdown runs and Leon Callen added 107 yards and a score as
Arizona beat fumble-plagued Oregon State.
	   Eafon gained 84 yards for the Wildcats (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10), who
outrushed the Beavers 228-21. Oregon State (4-3, 1-3) lost four
fumbles, including two in the first half that led to 14 Arizona
points.
 &UR; No. 17 Arkansas 41, South Carolina 28 &QC; 
	   At Columbia, South Carolina, Clint Stoerner perked up a sluggish
offense with three second-half TD passes as Arkansas (6-0, 3-0 SEC)
rallied to beat South Carolina (1-6, 0-5).
	   The Razorbacks, off to their best start since 1988, gained only
108 yards in the first half and trailed 21-10. But Stoerner led
four straight scoring drives in the second half, including TD
tosses of 51 yards to Michael Williams and 5 yards to Anthony
Lucas.
 &UR; No. 19 Colorado 19, No. 22 Texas Tech 17 &QC; 
	   At Boulder, Colorado, Jeremy Aldrich kicked four field goals and
Colorado used a strong defensive effort to beat Texas Tech.
	   Colorado (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) forced three turnovers and held the
Red Raiders (6-1, 3-1) in check over the final 30 minutes,
preventing Spike Dykes from tying Pete Cawthon as the winningest
coach in Texas Tech history.
 &UR; No. 20 Missouri 20, Oklahoma 6 &QC; 
	   At Columbia, Missouri, Wade Perkins returned one of his two
interceptions for a touchdown as Missouri beat Oklahoma for the
first time since 1983.
	   Devin West ran for two touchdowns for Missouri (5-1, 2-0 Big
12), which held Oklahoma (2-4, 0-3) to two first downs and 48 yards
in the first half.
 &UR; No. 23 Syracuse 42, Boston College 25 &QC; 
	   At Boston, Jeff Lowe caught the first two touchdown passes of
his career as Syracuse (4-2, 2-0 Big East) beat Boston College
(3-3, 2-2).
	   Lowe, who replaced injured Quinton Spotwood, caught TD passes of
12 and 29 yards from Donovan McNabb.
 &UR; No. 24 Tulane 28, Louisville 22 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Shaun King threw three TD passes despite playing
with a broken left wrist and Tulane withstood a late rally to
continue its best start in 24 years.
	   The Green Wave (5-0, 3-0 Conference USA) matched the 5-0 start
of the 1974 team that finished 5-6. King, who is right-handed, was
16-of-29 for 273 yards without an interception.

	   KANATA, Ontario (AP) _ Wade Redden scored once and set up two
goals to pace the Ottawa Senators to a 3-1 victory over the
expansion Nashville Predators on Saturday night.
	   The win gave Ottawa a franchise-best 3-0 start to the season.
	   Redden assisted on goals by Andreas Johansson on the power play
and Magnus Arvedson before scoring an insurance goal himself in the
third period.
	   Jeff Nelson scored for Nashville (1-2).
 &UR; Sabres 4, Canadiens 3
	   In Montreal, Vaclav Varada scored midway through the third
period as the Buffalo Sabres overcame a three-goal deficit to beat
the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Dixon Ward tied it at 2:46 of the third, beating goalie Jocelyn
Thibault on a wraparound move from behind the goal. Varada scored
his first goal of the season at 10:23 after Thibault failed to
cover up a loose puck.
	   Brian Hozlinger and Mike Peca also scored for the Sabres. Benoit
Brunet, Vladimir Malakhov and Vincent Damphousse scored for the
Canadiens.
 &UR; Flyers 1, Hurricanes 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Sami Kapanen scored his first
goal of the season and the Carolina Hurricanes spoiled the
Philadelphia Flyers' bid for a 4-0-0 start with a tie.
	   Arturs Irbe, making his second consecutive start in place of the
struggling Trevor Kidd, stopped 18 shots for Carolina, which
remained winless at 0-1-3.
	   In a game marked by plenty of close checking, both teams were
held to their lowest shot totals of the season _ 19 for each team.
 &UR; Oilers 4, Devils 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Bill Guerin had two goals and an
assist in his first game in New Jersey since being traded last
season and the Edmonton Oilers defeated the Devils.
	   Guerin, who was traded in January, two months after a
hard-fought contract negotiation with general manager Lou
Lamoriello, scored the first and last goals for the Oilers. He also
had the second assist on Andrei Kovalenko's goal midway through the
third period that gave Edmonton a 3-1 lead.
	   Ryan Smith also scored and Mikhail Shtalenkov stopped 32 shots
as the Oilers won their second straight on the road after opening
the season with two losses at home. Petr Sykora scored both goals
for the Devils, who have now lost three of four games under new
coach Robbie Ftorek.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Penguins 3
	   In Pittsburgh, Todd Harvey scored his second goal of the game
late in the third period as the New York Rangers ended their
season-opening four-game losing streak with a tie against the
Pittsburgh Penguins.
	   Harvey scored during a two-man advantage at 13:35 as the Rangers
survived allowing three straight goals after taking a 2-0 lead into
the last four minutes of the second period.
	   Wayne Gretzky's pass deflected off a Pittsburgh stick to Harvey,
who beat goaltender Peter Skudra. The assist was Gretzky's 2,800th
career point.

	   In Chicago, Ethan Moreau's goal at 5:38 of the third period
snapped a tie as Chicago battled back from a two-goal deficit to
beat Dallas.
	   The Blackhawks, who trailed 2-0 and 3-1, took charge late in the
second period with aggressive forechecking and persistent digging.
After misfiring a first attempt, Moreau managed to muscle the puck
past Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour from 20 feet for the game winner.
	   Tony Amonte, Alex Zhamnov and Chris Chelios also scored for the
Blackhawks. Darryl Sydor and Brett Hull each had a power-play goal
and two assists for Dallas, which lost for the first time this
season (2-1-1). Jere Lehtinen also scored a power-play goal for the
Stars.
 &UR; Islanders 1, Blues 0
	   In St. Louis, Tommy Salo stopped 23 shots to earn his 11th
career shutout and Bryan Berard scored the game's only goal as the
New York Islanders beat the St. Louis Blues.
	   Salo was not strongly tested by the Blues, who were shut out in
a home opener for the first time since 1973. Salo, a three-year
veteran, earned his last shutout last Oct. 14.
	   Berard scored the only goal at 16:08 of the second period during
an Islanders power play. Berard took a pass in front of the net
from Bryan Smolinski to beat goaltender Jamie McLennan for his
first goal of the season.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tino Martinez hit a grand slam and Chuck
Knoblauch hit a three-run homer in a seven-run seventh Saturday
night that rescued the New York Yankees, giving them a 9-6 victory
over the San Diego Padres in Game 1 of the World Series.
	   Knoblauch and Martinez, infamous for the blown bunt that cost
them Game 2 of the AL championship series against Cleveland, surely
redeemed themselves this time.
	   Two home runs by Greg Vaughn and a two-run shot by Tony Gwynn
sent San Diego ahead 5-2. But with the underdog Padres heading
toward a startling win and the sellout crowd of 56,712 sitting
quietly, the Yankees rallied.
	   What was supposed to be a pitching duel between aces Kevin Brown
and David Wells instead turned into a game of home-run derby. And
it was Martinez and Knoblauch, both slumping below .200 in this
postseason, who won it.
	   Game 2 will be Sunday night, with Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez
starting for the Yankees against Andy Ashby.
	   Brown took a three-run lead into the seventh and looked in
control when he retired leadoff man Scott Brosius on an easy
grounder.
	   Then the Yankees broke loose, as they did all season in setting
an AL record with 114 wins. Jorge Posada singled and rookie Ricky
Ledee, who hit a two-run double and a single in his first two
at-bats, drew a walk.
	   San Diego manager Bruce Bochy decided Brown was done. A few
batters later, the Padres were done, too.
	   Donne Wall relieved and Knoblauch lofted the third pitch high
into the left-field stands for a home run that made it 5-all. Derek
Jeter followed with a single, and it was Mark Langston's turn to
relieve.
	   But this was not the kind of outing Langston was hoping for in
his first Series appearance in a 15-year career. After getting the
second out, Langston threw a wild pitch and then intentionally
walked Bernie Williams.
	   Chili Davis also walked to load the bases, and up stepped
Martinez. An All-Star who has had a history of postseason failure,
he atoned in a big way with a grand slam into the upper deck in
right.
	   The fans who had blamed him and Knoblauch for the bone-headed
play 10 days ago rewarded Martinez with a long, loud standing
ovation that he acknowledged with a curtain call.
	   Martinez hit the 17th slam in Series history, and the first
since Lonnie Smith did it for Atlanta in 1992. It was the Yankees'
first Series slam since Joe Pepitone connected in 1964.
	   Down 9-5, the Padres tried to come back in the eighth. Gwynn led
off with his third hit of the night and, with two outs, Knoblauch
made an error on Wally Joyner's grounder to second and a run
scored.
	   Steve Finley stepped up as the potential tying run, but Mariano
Rivera got him on an easy grounder to end the inning and the
Padres' last chance.
	   Rivera finished up for a save and Wells wound up with the
victory. The ALCS MVP improved to 4-0 in this postseason and 8-1
overall, winning despite a shaky outing.
	   Wall got the loss. Brown, who had an 0.38 ERA in three
postseason starts this year, entered the game with a 12-3 career
record against the Yankees, the best mark in history vs. New York
by a pitcher with at least 10 wins.
	   The win was the 114th in Series history for the Yankees, trying
to win their record 24th championship. San Diego's only previous
Series appearance came in 1984, when it lost in five games to
Detroit.
	   Vaughn, the 50-homer man who missed most of the NL championship
series because of a strained left quadriceps, hit a two-run shot in
the third inning that tied it at 2. It stayed that way until the
Padres' three-run fifth.
	   Quilvio Veras singled with two outs and Gwynn followed with a
first-pitch line drive that banged off the facade of the upper deck
in right. The homer was a good sign for Gwynn _ the eight-time NL
batting champion had been hitting only .220 in this postseason.
	   Vaughn was next and the slugger, nearly traded to New York last
year, sent Wells' pitch high and deep to left field for a 5-2 lead.
It marked the 40th multi-homer game in Series history and the first
since Atlanta's Andruw Jones did it in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium.
	   Gwynn and Vaughn connected for the 12th set of back-to-back
homers in the Series, with Moises Alou and Charles Johnson doing it
last year for Florida.
	   Ledee, not even on the Yankees' postseason roster when the AL
playoffs began, hit a two-out, two-run double that landed on the
right-field line in the second. Earlier in the inning, Chili Davis
singled off Brown's left shin.
	   Ledee sat out the Yankees' first-round victory over Texas and
was added to the roster when Darryl Strawberry was sidelined by
colon cancer. The 24-year-old Ledee went 0-for-5 in the ALCS, but
manager Joe Torre picked him to start the opener in left field over
Tim Raines, Chad Curtis and Shane Spencer because of his
left-handed bat and defensive skills.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  The Padres and Yankees had played only once before, a
rain-shortened tie in spring training last March. ... Padres DH Jim
Leyritz, a Series hero for New York in 1996, got a nice ovation in
pregame introductions and tipped his cap. ... Sign of Big Games
Dept.: A notice posted outside the players' and preferred parking
lot next to Yankee Stadium _ ``No Stretch Limousines.'' ...
Strawberry watched the game from his home. ... The 15 runs were the
most in a Game 1 in 20 years, since the Dodgers beat the Yankees
11-5 in 1978.
